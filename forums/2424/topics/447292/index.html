              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">PAUL SCHOLES has given his first hint to Alex Ferguson that he is ready to play on for another season.</h2>
              <p>The Manchester United legend, 37, discussed his comeback performances with Ferguson at an informal meeting last week.</p>
              <p>Boss Fergie revealed statistics from recent games showed Scholes is averaging the same levels as he did 16 months ago.</p>
              <p>They included a pass completion rate of 82 per cent, while his kilometres per game ranked him alongside Ryan Giggs and Michael Carrick.</p>
              <p>Scholes is under no pressure from Ferguson or United to give an early answer but has promised a decision before the season ends.</p>
              <p>The ex-England midfielder will speak further with his family before deciding, but has indicated the stats — and how quickly he has settled back into the side — have surprised even himself.</p>
              <p>Fergie also confirmed the Old Trafford board has drafted a one-year deal and would love Scholes to play a further season.</p>
              <p>He came out of retirement last month and has already hinted he would seriously consider returning to the international stage if the Three Lions want him for the Euros.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">RYAN GIGGS admits Paul Scholes retired too early — and he is desperate not to do the same.</h2>
              <p>The midfielder, 38, penned a one-year contract extension at Manchester United last week.</p>
              <p>It will keep him at Old Trafford until at least the end of next season.</p>
              <p>Former England star Scholes retired from the game last summer, only to reverse his decision in January.</p>
              <p>And Giggs said: "When to retire is difficult. Do you quit too early or go that one too many games and let people see you on the slide?</p>
              <p>"Retirement is just a decision that I have to take my time with because I feel different after each game.</p>
              <p>"Scholesy was missing it and it's no secret that me, Gary Neville and a few other people felt that he had finshed too early but who were we to know?</p>
              <p>"We wanted him to carry on but he'd made his decision quite early and it was probably too early, which I think he accepts now.</p>
              <p>"Who knows? Maybe he'll carry on next year."</p>
              <p>Giggs has switched from the wing to a more central role in more recent seasons and he believes that will benefit him in the long-term.</p>
              <p>He added: "Moving in to central midfield has definitely helped me.</p>
              <p>"I had a taste of what it was like on the wing against Liverpool on Saturday and it's just completely different because you are up and down all the time.</p>
              <p>Giggs could be in contention for selection as one of Great Britain boss Stuart Pearce's over-age players for the London 2012 Olympics.</p>
              <p>But he would only agree to play in the tournament if the Welsh FA were happy for him to do so.</p>
              <p>He said: "I haven't thought about the Olympics too much but nearer the time, I am obviously going to have to.</p>
              <p>"First of all, I have to get picked — there are a lot of players vying for 20-odd spots.</p>
              <p>"Then there is another obstacle: will it affect Wales in the future?</p>
              <p>"If it does, then it will be an easy decision for me to make.</p>
              <p>"If it comes to the time when the likes of myself, Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey are picked, it is something we will have to speak to the FAW about."</p>
