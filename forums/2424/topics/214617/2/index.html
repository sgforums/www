            <div class='col-md body'>Rooney was simply unbelievable.. Sublime touches and brilliant passing techniques, extremely high work rate and fighting for the ball like a mad bull, superb strength and balance... This guy was brilliant! Solksjaer and Saha great balance and holding of ball but Saha should have scored after that beautiful pass by Rooney who displayed awesome technique in executing that pass with the outside of his foot.. Truly deserving match winners..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah... i think ronaldo was being kept for the FC Copenhagen match at Old Trafford this tue in the Champions League. Giggs was probably also but they needed him the add some attack down the wing last night. It also give him a good run-out in this match.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Louis Saha praised United's determination and effort after they came from behind to beat Wigan 3-1 at the JJB Stadium.<br><br>The victory kept up the Reds' unbeaten away record this term and gave them a temporary advantage over Chelsea at the top of the table.<br><br>"It was a great three points for us," Saha told MUTV after the game. "We had to win the game and keep the pressure on Chelsea.<br><br>"Wigan got off to a great start with an excellent free kick and we had to play very well in the second half to win it. Hopefully, one of the big teams like Chelsea and Arsenal will drop points here because it's a hard place to come."<br><br>Goals from Nemanja Vidic, Saha and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer earned three points for the Reds, but, according to the French striker, it was the introduction of Ryan Giggs after half-time which swung the game United's way.<br><br>"Ryan is the type of player who can scare the opposition," explained Saha. "We started to pass the ball a lot quicker after the break and that helped us to create more chances.<br><br>"Scoring goals is always my target so I was pleased to get on the score-sheet.<br><br>"Wayne [Rooney] provided a great cross for my goal," added Saha. "He also set up Ole's goal and overall played very well."</div>
