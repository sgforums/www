              <h2>VIDIC REJECTS FERGIE ROW RUMOURS</h2>

              <p> </p>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Manchester United defender Nemanja Vidic has moved quickly to quash rumours of a feud with Sir Alex Ferguson.</strong> <strong>Tension is reportedly high between the Red Devils centre-half and the manager, with rumours circulating that the Serbian is trying to secure a move to Real Madrid.</strong> </p>
              <p>However, the 28-year-old, who moved to Old Trafford for £7million from Spartak Moscow in 2006, has denied any bust-up with Ferguson. </p>
              <p>Vidic pulled out of the pre-match warm-up against Leeds on Sunday and missed out on the Red Devils' 1-0 defeat. When asked whether he knew what was wrong with the defender, Ferguson remarked: "I couldn't tell you. I couldn't tell you at all." </p>
              <p>But Vidic has played down the reported feud and says he has a "marvellous" understanding with his manager. "Everything surprised me a lot," he told <em>Sportski zurnal.</em> "Ferguson said that he didn't talk with the club doctor, but he didn't say that he doesn't believe in my injuries and that we are in a fight. </p>
              <p>"Everybody in the club knows that I have a marvellous understanding with my coach Ferguson. "Moreover, I'm not unhappy at Old Trafford. I'm just injured and that is the end of the story. </p>
              <p>"I hope that I will be able to play as soon as possible. The doctors told me that I will not be able to play for the next seven or ten days so I don't think that I will play against Birmingham City."</p>
              <p>One of Vidic's representatives, Paolo Fabbri, told <em>ESPN Soccernet</em>: "I am quite surprised by all these rumours, the situation is under control and is not unusual. </p>
              <p>"As far as I know, the player is not negotiating with any other club. "Regarding the mood of the player, I think it is standard. I have not spoken to him since the last defeat but, as far as I know, there is no problem."</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">NEMANJA VIDIC has laughed off rumours of a rift with boss Alex Ferguson.</h2>
              <p class="article">Manchester United defender Vidic has again been linked with a big-money switch to Spain in recent days, with Real Madrid said to be plotting a move.</p>
              <p class="article">The speculation increased following his bizarre withdrawal moments before Sunday's shock FA Cup loss to Leeds.</p>
              <p class="article">But it has now been established that Vidic tweaked a nerve in his leg that was causing him enough pain to make him sit out the game. He said: "Everyone in the club knows I have a marvellous understanding with Ferguson.</p>
              <p class="article">"He said he didn't talk with the club doctor but he didn't say he doesn't believe in my injuries and that we are in a fight.</p>
              <p class="article">"I am not unhappy at Old Trafford - I am just injured.</p>
              <p class="article">"I hope I will be able to play as soon as possible.</p>
              <p class="article">"The doctors said I will not be able to play for the next seven or 10 days so I don't think I will play against Birmingham on Saturday but I should be OK after that."</p>
