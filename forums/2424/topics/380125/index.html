              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson might just have stumbled on a strike-partnership for </strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span><strong>. Michael Owen and Danny Welbeck are displaying a liking for playing together in the Carling Cup.</strong></p>
              <p>Having combined to see off Wolves in the last round, the veteran and the prodigy did so once again as <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Barnsley</span></strong> manager Mark Robins was denied a victory against the manager whose job he once famously secured with a winning goal in an FA Cup tie at Nottingham Forest almost 20 years ago.</p>
              <p>Welbeck, the pick of United’s impressive youngsters at Oakwell, opened the scoring before Owen completed the victory for the cup holders with a magical second.</p>
              <p>Yet the game was marred by Gary Neville’s 64th minute dismissal for a studs-up challenge on Adam Hammill prior to an unsavoury injury-time incident when two Barnsley supporters entered the pitch and kicked the ball out of United goalkeeper Ben Foster’s hands.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson arrived in Barnsley having already experienced the ignominy of a cup upset at Oakwell. Eleven years ago, his reigning league champions were on the wrong end of a 3-2 FA Cup fifth-round replay in South Yorkshire, albeit against a Barnsley side enjoying a one-season flirtation with the top flight.</p>
              <p>By eliminating Chelsea and Liverpool from the FA Cup in 2008, Barnsley clearly find something extra against teams who would ordinarily view domestic cup encounters as an inconvenience in the grand scheme of things.</p>
              <p>Perhaps the prospect of United and Ferguson being humbled prompted Keith Hackett, the general manager of the Premier League referees, to take a seat in Oakwell’s directors’ box. Or maybe he was just checking on the fitness of referee Chris Foy.</p>
              <p>But United, despite their approach of resting senior figures in this competition, proved by lifting the Carling Cup last season that it is worthy of a place in Old Trafford’s well-stocked trophy cabinet.</p>
              <p>And with their last outing resulting in a painful defeat against Liverpool at Anfield, Barnsley’s fate was as good as sealed before Ferguson’s fringe players took to the field.</p>
              <p>The Scot had made 11 changes from the team sent out at Anfield. Eleven rested, rather than axed, but their replacements at least went into this fixture with the incentive of knowing that they had the opportunity to dislodge their rivals for the Premier League clash with Blackburn on Saturday.</p>
              <p>Defenders Jonny Evans and Wes Brown, in particular, played with an extra spring in their step. If Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic continue to perform as they did at Anfield, Evans and Brown will soon be handed tougher assignments than shackling Jon Macken and Daniel Bogdanovic.</p>
              <p>United began in determined mood. Within five minutes, Barnsley full-back Rob Kozluk had been forced to clear a Michael Owen header off the line.</p>
              <p>Seconds later, Welbeck had put United ahead with his second Carling Cup goal of the season when he headed Anderson’s corner past goalkeeper Luke Steele from six yards.</p>
              <p>Welbeck is an emerging force, but chances have been limited so far this season. His pace and burgenoning power suggest he will be a regular sooner rather than later.</p>
              <p>The same could be said for Gabriel Obertan, the £3m purchase from Bordeaux who, after knee and back injuries, was making his debut at Oakwell.</p>
              <p>Slick, with incredibly quick feet, the 20-year-old displayed more potential in 45 minutes than Nani, the infuriating Portuguese, has shown in almost three years.</p>
              <p>Despite their impressive forward play, United’s defensive frailties were not eradicated by the removal of Sunday’s back four and Bogdanovic was left unmarked to head Hammill’s corner against the crossbar on 22 minutes.</p>
              <p>Where United were toothless and predictable at Anfield, they were quick and purposeful here.</p>
              <p>The opposition was some way down the pecking order in comparison to Liverpool, but Welbeck in particular was finding the gaps that proved beyond Wayne Rooney and Dimitar Berbatov at the weekend.</p>
              <p>The 19 year-old released Owen with a defence-splitting pass on 49 minutes which appeared perfectly crafted for the forward to score without breaking stride, yet a nudge in the back from Stephen Foster proved critical and Steele was able to block Owen’s shot.</p>
              <p>For Welbeck, it was to be his final contribution of the evening, with a muscle pull curtailing his involvement on 53 minutes.</p>
              <p>Welbeck’s replacement, Zoran Tosic, is in the Nani camp in terms of having plenty to prove at Old Trafford, but a rapier-like shot over Steele’s crossbar moments after entering the fray suggested he has the ability to justify his transfer.</p>
              <p>It was an impressive effort, but Owen topped it with his goal on 61 minutes.</p>
              <p>Pity Fabio Capello was not at Oakwell to see it. Having received the ball from Fabio’s throw-in with his back to goal 10 yards from the touchline, Owen turned one defender and nutmegged another before curling a right-foot shot past Steele from 18 yards.</p>
              <p>There was even a burst of pace from the 29 year-old. Scoring against Barnsley is one thing, though. Doing it regularly in the Premier League is another.</p>
              <p>He may get the opportunity against Blackburn this weekend, but Neville will have to sit that one out having earned a suspension for his reckless challenge on Hamill. But the future is not Neville’s.</p>
              <p>That lies at the feet of Evans, Obertan, Welbeck and maybe even an old-stager called Michael Owen.</p>
