              <p><br><strong>Cristiano Ronaldo is expected to end Manchester United’s 40-year wait for a European Footballer of the Year when the winner of the Ballon d’Or. The last United player to win it was George Best, pictured with his mother, Anne, in 1968. Since then English football has had a thin time. Kevin Keegan won in 1978 and 1979, although he was then with Hamburg. Michael Owen was the last English-based player to win, in 2001</strong></p>
              <p>Ronaldo has had an amazing year, scoring 42 goals in 2007-8 as United won the Premier League and Champions League, but he will still have to beat competition from Barcelona’s Lionel Messi, Liverpool’s Fernando Torres and last year’s winner, Kaka of AC Milan</p>
              <p>United players have won the award more than any other English club. Ronaldo would be the fourth Red Devil recipient, following Denis Law (1964), Bobby Charlton (1966) and Best (1968)</p>

              someone else lift it.<br><br>Asked by <em>Sky Italia</em> about the

              <h2>ANCELOTTI: RONALDO DESERVED AWARD</h2>
              <div id="printsaveline"><img id="articleImage" src="http://images.football365.com/08/12/240/CristianoRonaldo_1567571.jpg" border="0" alt="Ronaldo - praised by Ancelotti."></div>
              <p><br></p>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>AC Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti believes Cristiano Ronaldo was the worthy winner of the Ballon d'Or. The Manchester United winger beat Barcelona's Lionel Messi and Liverpool striker Fernando Torres to claim the prestigious award. </strong></p>
              <p>Ronaldo succeeded AC Milan playmaker Kaka, who won the trophy in 2007. "Cristiano Ronaldo is one of the best and most spectacular players in the world," said Ancelotti.</p>
              <p>The fact that no Serie A player was voted in the top five, with Kaka finishing eighth and Inter Milan striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic voted ninth, did not come as a surprise to Ancelotti.</p>
              <p>"The Ballon d'Or depends on the trophies you win while the Champions League also plays an important role," he said. "Kaka has already won it while Ibrahimovic is destined to win it in the future. "But Italian football gives more importance to the collective rather than individual play. This was evident in the World Cup won by the Italian national team in 2006."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://news.bbc.co.uk/olmedia/1075000/images/_1077262_8_award300_emp.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="180"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Ronaldo became the third Portuguese player to win the award after Inter Milan veteran Luis Figo (2000) and legendary striker Eusebio (1965).</strong></p>
              <p>The 23-year-old was a runaway winner polling 77 of the 96 votes cast by journalists and Figo said his former Portugal team-mate's award was a source for national pride.</p>
              <p>"I'm very proud that Cristiano Ronaldo has won the Ballon d'Or because he's the third player in the history of Portuguese football to win this prestigious award after Eusebio and me," he told Inter Milan's official website.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/40912000/jpg/_40912712_queiroz203.jpg" border="0" alt="Carlos Queiroz (right) and a member of the Futscola team" width="203" height="152"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Portugal manager Carlos Queiroz, who was United's assistant coach last season before taking up the role with the national team, also congratulated Ronaldo on his award.</p>
              <p>"Cristiano [Ronaldo] has worked very hard to deserve it," Queiroz told the Portugal Football Federation (FPF) website. "I want to congratulate him and emphasise this distinction."</p>
              <p>The 55-year-old tactician was witness to Ronaldo's stellar season last term when he fired 42 goals to help United claim the Champions League and Premier League crowns.</p>
              <p>And after playing a key coaching role in Ronaldo's football education since his arrival at Old Trafford in 2003, Queiroz said it was an honour to see the midfielder claim the prestigious award.</p>
              <p>"As someone who was responsible for his training and preparation at Manchester United, I am really proud for his achievement, which was his dream and ambition," he said.</p>
              <p>"I hope this award symbolises a career full of success both individually and collectively. "This award is also a challenge for him to keeping working as he has been doing so far in order to remain at the top and progress even further."</p>
