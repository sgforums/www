              <p>According to the <em>News of the World</em>, that most reliable of rumour mills, Ben Foster is ready to leave Manchester United in search of first-team football.</p>
              <p>The 25-year-old has found opportunities scarce since arriving at Old
              Trafford from Stoke City in 2005, due in no small part to Dutch veteran
              Edwin van der Sar's inimitable presence between the sticks.</p>
              <p>It was thought that Foster would succeed the former Fulham and
              Juventus goalkeeper during the 2007-08 campaign, following
              his impressive stint at Watford, but a pre-season knee injury put an
              end to that notion.</p>
              <p>The once-capped England custodian now finds himself battling with
              Poland's Tomas Kuszczak for the No. 2 spot, and he is reportedly ready
              to request a winter transfer now that Van der Sar has penned a new deal.</p>
              <p>Foster will have few problems finding a new home, as Tottenham
              Hotspur, Middlesbrough and Aston Villa are all thought to be interested
              the highly rated shot-stopper who is rated at around £4 million.</p>
              <p>It remains to be seen whether Sir Alex Ferguson will sanction a move, but a loan deal at the very least looks likely.</p>

              <p>I think he is one of the best young English keepers to come out in recent times. I think Alex Ferguson has a big task on hand to keep him happy. Look at what happen to so called ENGLISH TALENTED, PROMISING keepers in recent times, Chris Kirkland, Scott Carson, they are now languising and most likely may not play for England again. I think its hugely due to the fact that they are not given a chance to play. Look at Spain, their top 2 keepers are only in their mid 20s, Iker Casillas and Pepe Reina because they are allowed to be in the first team early. Only Paul Robinson, David James, Robert Green are making it or have made it...because again they were blooded into the first team.</p>
              <p>So for the sake of optimising Ben Foster's talents, its either Alex play him instead of relying on Edwin Van Der Sar who will retire in the next one or two years or let him go to a team who is willing to take a risk and play him as the first team keeper.</p>

              <p>Foster is definitely not up to the mark yet... He is a good keeper but he is still not at the level of VDS. And as much as Fergie want to give him a chance, he has not taken it... And he seem to get injure quite easily too... Even a coming to 40 yrs old VDS don't get injure so often...  </p>
              <p>Chris Kirkland, Scott Carson, Paul Robinson, Robert Green all are good decent keepers... All were given their fair chance... Robinson is a good example when given a chance at the highest level...  see what happen?</p>
              <p>And comparing him and the rest of them to Casillas is totally unfair cos Casillas was given a chance and he proved himself consistently from the start first at Real C side then their B side and evenually to their A team. If he didn't, Real would have bought another keeper long ago... And I personally don't think Reina is in the same level as VDS or Cech or Arsenal's former German keeper too... I rate him a good keeper but not great one.</p>
