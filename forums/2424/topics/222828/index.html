            <div class='col-md body'>I dun think its professional to recall Rossi from Newcastle.  I think SAF will just do without him till his loan expire.<br><br>It'll look bad on Man U to recall him prematuredly, despite the fact that Rossi is rotting at Newcastle.  It only confirmed ppl's rumor that Man U is desperately short of strikers - a loss of face for such a big club.<br><br>I think a more practical way would be to (a) push Ronaldo / Giggs into striking position, drafting in Fletcher on the right / Richardson depending who's striker.<br>SAF has done that before w/ Giggs partnering Rooney.  And he partnered Ronaldo w/ Rooney agst Everton.<br><br>Defense wise, they are okay - its just that strikers they are abit lacking.  And yes, despite Rossi coming back in Jan, SAF shld go out to mkt and buy a striker and hopefully a midfielder as well bcos Richardson is not up to par yet.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>brown? he can play at rite back, as gary is always injured.<br><br>why not fergie play more of smith? or is it something fergie knows that we do not know, smith is not the same type of player after the long layoff?<br><br>some players not as good as before after injuries, like alan shearer after he came back from long injury, he lost a yard of pace or two. Gazza also, before he was injured, he was god damn good, but after he came back from long injury, he never play like before with the same kind of swagger and style</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i dunno, but I am abit against Brown. I still remember his boos boos a few season back that caused Man U to concede many goals.  It was so bad that at one point in time, he was the main culprit that Man U concede goals.<br><br>And unfortunately, he's one of those whose performance went downhill after a terrible injury.  Prior to his injury, he's good and SAF once praised him as one of the best CB, then he got injured and lost his place.  After his injury, he's a pale shadow liaoz.<br><br>As RB, he has no speed, O'shea also can play RB.  As CB, he is too hesitant.  Between him and Silvestre, I would prefer Silvestre - at least he still has speed.  In any case, Man U has a good RB youth player (cannot remember name).</div>

O'shea is slower than Brown, but he's very versatile. A useful utility man; use to plug the gaps; CB, LB, RB, DM, LM, CM, RM.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I doubt Martin will have any position to play, especially with Carrick and Scholes in the middle of the park.<br>We also have O'Shea, Fletcher and Richardson who can play in the centre of midfield. Giggs can switch to centre and Rooney can drop back to accomodate so i doubt Martin'll ever start.<br><br>As for Rossi, Yes, i do agree that letting him join Newcastle on loan is a bad mistake. I think he'll improve even better playing for United reserve den having to sit on the bench for Newcastle.<br><br>Cheers.<br>C.K</div>
