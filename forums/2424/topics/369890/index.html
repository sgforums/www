              ANELKA says Manchester United have shot their title hopes in the foot
              by letting go of Cristiano Ronaldo and Carlos Tevez.</h2>
              <p class="article">And the Chelsea hitman has warned Alex Ferguson's side that he and Didier Drogba are out to get them.</p>
              <p class="article">French
              star Anelka said: "I don't think United will be as strong this season
              because Ronaldo has gone and Carlos Tevez has gone. That could give us
              more chance to be stronger than them.</p>
              <p class="article">"United have lost two big players so it gives everyone else - including ourselves - a big chance to win it."</p>
              <p class="article">The
              Blues have been impressive in pre-season and Anelka reckons retaining
              their best players is a real plus for new boss Carlo Ancelotti.</p>
              <p class="article">The
              30-year-old striker added: "Maybe this season - because we have a
              strong squad and everyone is together - we have a better chance.</p>
              <p class="article">"It is going to be a tough title race. They are all very strong. Even Man City have some good players."</p>
              <p class="article">Anelka
              was the league's top scorer last season with 19 goals, despite spending
              most of his time playing on the right side of a front three.</p>
              <p class="article">But with Ancelotti planning to play with two hitmen this term, Anelka reckons anything is possible.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: "I think Drogba and I can be the best partnership in England because we are strong together as a pair.</p>
              <p class="article">"I
              always want him to score, he always wants me to score. We have a good
              understanding and we like to play together. What is possible is for us?
              To win the Premier League and if we do it will be because we will both
              get chances to score from each other.</p>
              <p class="article">"That is
              what will give us more chance of winning the title. When I signed for
              Chelsea I always thought I would play with Didier.</p>
              <p class="article">"I
              wanted to play with him and he wanted to play with me as well and,
              overall, last season I think we did well as a partnership "Now we have
              the chance to start the season together up front to score goals."</p>
              <p class="article">New
              Blues signing Yuri Zhirkov was impressive in Friday's 2-1 win over AC
              Milan in Baltimore and netted his first goal for the club.</p>
              <p class="article">Anelka said: "You can see already he is a good player. He scored his first goal in his first game. That's a good sign."</p>

              <h2 style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">PATRICE EVRA is ready to quit Manchester United this summer - with Real Madrid and Inter Milan ready to pay £18million.</h2>
              <p>The France full-back, 28, is believed to want a new challenge.</p>
              <p>Evra's close ex-United pal Cristiano Ronaldo has recommended him to Real.</p>
              <p>Since his £7m move from Monaco 4½-years ago, Evra has established himself as one of the best left-backs in the world.</p>
              <p>He has two years left on his current deal worth around £80k a week.</p>
              <p>A sale would give United a serious profit on a player whose value will plummet next summer with only a year left on his contract.</p>

              <p>As for Man City, i still not sure of their title credits as all the big signing are forwards...so basically the squad still somehow the same as last season, they cant be putting in 10 strikers all the time rite...</p>

              <p>well, i think Liverpool is the biggest threat, they have the least disruption if they keep the current team.</p>
              <p>Chelsea has a big change in their manager. Rem Scholari?</p>
              <p>Actually, I saw the interview done by Tiger Up close with Arsene, and I applaud his change in thinking in going young. Given the current market, other than RM, no other clubs can "buy" their way to success. The only flaw is that his young fledgings did not "mature" and "perform" fast enough. Note, I said "fast enough". And they did lose flamini and helb two of their "old birds". </p>
              <p>how well Mcity will perform will depends on how fast MH gel the team (Mark Hughes or Sparky).  Not entirely convinced all the buys are his ideas so it will take time to gel and contain the egos. But if he managed to herd them towards one direction, then they are a major force.</p>
              <p>MU's lost is Ronaldo, and despite law of average, MU lost quality that it has not made up in transfer market. How fast they cope is key. SAF is a wily old fox that is able to produce gems but this season is a big big test. Cause in the past, MU did buy out of trouble, but with many big sharks circling. It is harder to do that now.</p>

              <p>To be honest, I think Chelsea has 30% chance of winning the title...</p>

              <p>whoever wants to be the champs, need to be consistent, play well above all teams and finish on top by the end of the season. last season, liverpool beat chelsea and man u home and away, thats 12 points. they would be champs if they didnt have so many draws at home. too bad they are not consistent enough and you need to win against small teams as well, no good to beat the top teams and then draw or lose against the mid or smaller teams.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>every season is different. I dun think they can beat man u and chelsea home and away again this season, thats for sure. if they do, hats off to them. its going to be extremely difficult for man u to win the title again afer ronaldo left for RM, but never write off utd chances. this season, not much of players movement on the big four team. I still think city will be the same as last season, score alot, yet concede a lot at the back, no consistency away from home.</p>
