              <h1>Manchester United's new policy on age rules out signing Franck Ribéry</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong></strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united">Manchester United</a> have made a long-term decision not to sign any players aged 26 or above
              for large transfer fees because of new financial stipulations that have
              been put in place at Old Trafford to shape the club's recruitment
              policy. Dimitar Berbatov, who was 27 when he signed from Tottenham
              Hotspur last September, has been described as the "last of his kind" in
              a move that has immediate implications for their attempts to replace <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/ronaldo">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>.</p>
              <p>The restrictions automatically mean that <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/sir-alex-ferguson">Sir Alex Ferguson</a>'s admiration for <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/franck-ribery">Franck Ribéry</a> will not manifest itself in a concerted attempt to sign the France international. Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/bayernmunich">Bayern Munich</a>'s chairman, said yesterday that United, Chelsea and Barcelona had all lodged bids but the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague">Premier League</a> champions say that is not true.</p>
              <p>Instead,
              the policy from now onwards isthat the club will have a strict
              age-before-ability approach in which they will sign players in
              big-money deals only if they will retain a significant market value
              some years after signing a five- or six-year contract.</p>
              <p>Karim
              Benzema, the Lyon striker, would fit into their strategy, being 21, but
              Ribéry is considered too old even though he turned 26 only two months
              ago and is approaching what are generally considered the best years of
              a footballer's career. United's thinking is that Ribéry would cost
              close to £60m and have no significant resale value, leaving Chelsea,
              who have tabled a formal bid believed to be around £40m, hopeful of
              signing the France international, particularly as <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/realmadrid">Real Madrid</a>'s interest appears to have cooled.</p>
              <p>The
              same policy applies to David Villa, the outstanding Valencia striker
              who is on the market at the age of 27 for a fee of around £45m, as well
              as the man who scored the first goal against United in the Champions
              League final, Barcelona's 28-year-old forward Samuel Eto'o. Both are
              ruled out unless there is a rethink at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>United are
              aware that the policy may not go down well with those supporters who
              are expecting high-profile replacements to fill the void left by
              Ronaldo's impending world-record transfer to Real Madrid. However, the
              club insists it makes sound business sense not to bring in a player for
              £30m or more who cannot be sold for another high valuation some years
              after signing his contract.</p>
              <p>This explains why United did not make any effort to sign <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/kaka">Kaka</a>,
              the Brazil international and former world footballer of the year, when
              he became available for £59m from Milan, even though Ferguson has now
              admitted he knew for virtually all of last season that Ronaldo would be
              leaving this summer. Kaka was 27 in April and that does not fit into
              United's strategy of not buying expensive players whose values will
              then plummet.</p>
              <p>Berbatov was considered an exception to the rule
              when he signed for £30.75m but Ferguson is now working under the
              knowledge that his chief executive, David Gill, and the club's American
              owners, the Glazer family, expect him to pursue younger players who
              could conceivably make the club a profit.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo was 18 when he
              signed from Sporting Lisbon for £12.2m six years ago and United,
              despite being renowned for wanting to keep their better players, are
              placing a heavy emphasis on bringing in people who could feasibly make
              them money. The policy has been gradually evolving over recent years,
              with Nemanja Vidic, Patrice Evra, Michael Carrick, Anderson and Nani
              all 25 and below when they were signed.</p>
              <p>United are now targeting Antonio Valencia, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/wiganathletic">Wigan Athletic</a>'s
              23-year-old Ecuador international, to take over from Ronaldo on the
              right side of their attack but face competition for the 23-year-old
              from Madrid and an unnamed club, believed to be Bayern Munich. "It all
              rests on where the lad wants to go to: Man United, Real Madrid or the
              other European club," said Wigan's chairman, Dave Whelan. "We can't
              force him where to go. We will have a meeting with United and Real
              Madrid in the next three or four days, see what offers are on the table
              and then present them to the lad and he will decide where he wants to
              go or if he wants to go. We would never stop a player from going to a
              top club. The lad comes back from holiday this weekend and I expect it
              will be another 10 to 14 days before a deal is done.</p>
              <p>"Real Madrid
              have been in contact once a week for the last six weeks. I thought them
              agreeing a deal with Ronaldo would fulfil their requirements but it
              hasn't done, as they've been in touch again since then. There have been
              fees spoken about but have we had a bid put in black and white? No."
              Whelan added that he would not increase the asking price for Valencia
              in light of Ronaldo's £80m sale.</p>
              <p>said Wigan's chairman, Dave Whelan.</p>
              <p>Ferguson is also still hoping to persuade <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/carlos-tevez">Carlos Tevez</a> to sign a permanent deal with the club, despite the Argentinian saying
              publicly and privately that he has no plans to return to Old Trafford
              when he becomes a free agent on 30 June. Tevez, also a target for
              Manchester City, Chelsea – who do not believe they will land him – and
              Liverpool, is 25 and United's initial reluctance to pay the £25.5m fee
              wanted by the investors who own his economic rights partly derived from
              a concern about what he might be worth to them towards the end of a
              five-year contract. Gill has already publicly stated that he thinks
              Tevez's valuation is a "bit toppy."</p>

              fark the new age policy lar. policies are made by humans. shouldn't be guided by these policies invented by man.
              
              it should be decided by the manager. if the player is world class and good, sign him even if he is 27 or 28.
