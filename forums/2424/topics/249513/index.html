            <div class='col-md body'>DOHA, April 19 (Reuters) - Cristiano Ronaldo needs to stay at his peak for another two years before he can be called one of the world's greatest players, according to Pele.<br><br>The great Brazilian, who won three World Cups, said the Portugal winger, who has been in inspired form for Manchester United this season, was 'one of the good players' but it was too soon to call him one of the best in the world.<br><br>In a wide-ranging interview, Pele said: 'To mention him as one of the best players in the world is very soon... We have Kaka, who plays very well, too...<br><br>'Four or five years ago, we had Ronaldinho in good shape. We have to wait a little bit. Let's see, in one or two more years, if they keep at the same level.'<br><br>United manager Alex Ferguson recently compared Ronaldo's skills to those of Pele and Diego Maradona, whose individual talent inspired Argentina to win the World Cup in 1986.<br><br>Ferguson said Ronaldo, who last week agreed a new five-year contract with the Premier League leaders, should try to emulate the two South Americans.<br><br>Pele was speaking at the launch of Doha's Aspire Academy, a programme to give talented African students a chance to study, and train at one of the world's most advanced sports academies.<br><br>Turning to the World Cup, Pele sounded a note of caution about Brazil's bid to host the 2014 finals, now unopposed since the withdrawal of Colombia.<br><br>He cited the problems South Africa has faced since winning the right to stage the 2010 tournament.<br><br>'Africa has a little problem because everybody fights - and everybody worked hard to see the World Cup in Africa - and then it's a little complicated, the situation there,' he said.<br><br>'I hope Brazil will be prepared because today to organise a World Cup is very expensive. It's very difficult because it's 32 countries, it's not so easy.'<br><br>Asked about former England captain David Beckham's transfer from Real Madrid to LA Galaxy at the end of the season, Pele said he was not sure if it was a good move for the player but it was good for soccer in the United States.<br><br>'I don't know if it's a good choice but for America it's a fantastic promotion,' said Pele, who starred for New York Cosmos in the North American Soccer League in the 1970s.<br><br>'He could help the same as myself, (Franz) Beckenbauer, Carlos Alberto and Georgio Chinaglia - when we were all at the end of our career we promoted football in the United States.<br><br>'Then I think George Best was in LA... where Beckham is going to play... I hope he can help a lot though'.<br><br>Pele also spoke in support of Maradona, recently readmitted to hospital in Buenos Aires with alcohol-related problems.<br><br>'It's a shame because two years ago Maradona opened a programme, a talk show, and I was there to help him with the first programme,' said Pele.<br><br>'At that time, he was very well. He had recovered. Unfortunately, now he's back in hospital.<br><br>'It's difficult to say exactly what happened because before it was drugs and now the doctors say it's alcohol... but I feel very sorry for him being in hospital.'<br><br>ps, my 1st time posting dis<br>personally, Pele talks too much.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>every good youngster from Bazil will be compared to Pele, every good youngster from Agentina will be to Maradona, its just the media's way to selling for news, Ronaldo is a great player but to compare him with the likes of Pele and Maradona is simply just plain stupid, those guys played well for almost the entire of their footballing carrer whereas Ronaldo just about to complete his best season, give him another 5 years and we'll see if he really lives up to the tag. and for the TS please don't say i've talked too much like what you've said about Pele  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
