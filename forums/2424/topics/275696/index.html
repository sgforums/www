            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/42882000/jpg/_42882101_berbatov203.jpg"><br><br><strong><span class="large">United to test Spurs resolve with bid for unsettled Berba</span><br><br>Manchester United are hoping to capitalise on Dimitar Berbatov's increasing unhappiness at Tottenham by signing the striker in a Â£22million deal. United manager Sir Alex Ferguson is aware that the Bulgarian international has grown discontent among the chaos at White Hart Lane and has made a bid for the striker. </strong><br><br>Berbatov, who looks set to miss Tottenham's match at Old Trafford on Sunday due to a groin injury, has been angered by events at the club over the past few weeks and is unsure they can give him the Champions League football he craves.<br><br>The 26-year-old was furious after Spurs failed to sign Bulgarian team-mate Martin Petrov in the summer because they could not compete with Manchester City over his wages. Berbatov recommended Petrov as the left winger the club needed to be a serious threat to the top four this season, but Spurs fell short of City's offer of Â£60,000-a-week.<br><br>Tottenham have a wage structure in which the highest earners like Robbie Keane and Ledley King get paid Â£50,000 a week and they refused to break it to get Petrov from Atletico Madrid. A left winger has still not been signed and to add to Berbatov's angst, he was substituted in the club's opening Premier League game, which ended in a 1-0 defeat at newly-promoted Sunderland.<br><br>His agent, Emil Dantchev, has since had to deny that Berbatov fell out with manager Martin Jol amid reports the Dutchman went to the board demanding the striker be sold. But talks over a new, improved contract, which began near the end of last season, have stopped and only two months ago Berbatov revealed his dream of playing for Manchester United.<br><br>He said: "Of course, I like Sir Alex's team. Their style is attacking and pleasant to watch and it coincides with my own style of playing football. "Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes and Wayne Rooney are fantastic players and that fast guy Cristiano Ronaldo on the right side is a magician with the ball. He plays football from another planet. "Of course, it would be a pleasure for me to play with these guys; they simply know how to have fun on the pitch."<br><br>Ferguson is looking for a new striker after his side picked up only two points from their first three games and are without Wayne Rooney for another six weeks because of a foot injury. Berbatov scored 23 goals in his first season in English football having joined Tottenham from Bayer Leverkusen for Â£10.9m and the north London club are determined to keep their prize asset.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/08_03/JolBerbatovGETTY_468x356.jpg"><br><br><strong><span class="large">Robbo raps Spurs as United bid for Berba</span><br><br>Paul Robinson may have had other matters on hand last night after his England blunder but he still found time to launch a blistering attack on Tottenham's board of directors over the Martin Jol affair. As Spurs were fighting off renewed Manchester United interest in their star player, Bulgarian striker Dimitar Berbatov, Robinson said: "I'm very disappointed with what's been happening at the club. </strong><br><br>"To see how far MJ has taken the club and the strides he has taken, to then go behind his back to seek other options is very disappointing because the manager has got the full support of the players. "It's very difficult for him because of what he has done. We are 100 per cent behind and we all hope he stays as long as possible. It's known throughout the club how the players feel. "To question somebody's job after three games of the season is ridiculous, especially after what the man has done for the past two years.<br><br>As Robinson spoke, the Spurs board were trying to fend off United's Â£21million offer for Berbatov. All offers have been rebuffed so far and Spurs put a Â£40m price tag on the 6ft 2in forward. But Ferguson is determined to add another striker to his squad following Wayne Rooney's broken foot and specifically wants someone who can add a taller, physical presence.<br><br>Scouts from across Europe were called into United's Carrington training ground last week for a briefing and Ferguson has started with Berbatov, who was regarded as one of the Premier League's outstanding performers last season with 19 goals in all competitions. United wanted to bring Berbatov to England last year before his transfer from Bayer Leverkusen to Spurs, who had an agreement that they would have first call on the player provided they matched the Â£10.9m asking price.<br><br>Privately, Berbatov is flattered by United's interest and would like the chance to play for them and test himself further in the Champions League. However, Spurs, who rejected United's enquiries about a Â£17m deal in May, will stand firm. That leaves United considering their options, while Berbatov, who is struggling to shake off a groin injury in time to face the champions on Sunday, may now have to declare a desire to leave White Hart Lane in order to force the issue.<br><br>United have alternatives. They have been offered Newcastle's Obafemi Martins and know they could buy Nicolas Anelka from Bolton for Â£12m. However, they are in danger of being left with nobody as Anelka's representatives held talks with Portsmouth officials last night, with the Frenchman keen to sign for Harry Redknapp.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Spurs to lose Berbatov to Man United or Real<br><br>You need a good sense of rumour to enjoy all the latest paper-talk. Today's gossip also includes a Sunderland move for Kuffour and Arsenal's Eduardo being tipped to outshine Liverpool's Torres as well as news from Manchester United, Real Madrid and Manchester City </strong><br><br>The rumours regarding Spurs star Dimitar BerbatovÂ’s move to Manchester United are gathering pace, although still lacking any real proof.<br><br>Martin Jol is battling to hang onto the star striker after Sir AlexÂ’s side lodged a Â£21million bid for the Bulgaria international (Daily Mail). The report then goes on to say that all offers have been rebuffed so far and Spurs put a Â£40m price tag on the 6ft 2in forward, which in todayÂ’s market may not be high enough to scare off the opposition.<br><br>Now, I am not sure if Dimitar is unhappy at Spurs and I donÂ’t know if talk of his sale has any connection to whether Jol is nearing the sack. What I do know is that United need a striker, and therefore every paper and website is linking any forward, both living or dead, to the club and this rumour is just another example of this situation.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
