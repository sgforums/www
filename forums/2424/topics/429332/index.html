              <p>Manchester United manager <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=30"><span style="color: #225fb2;">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></a> believes <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/8853/Ryan-Giggs"><span style="color: #225fb2;">Ryan Giggs</span></a> is fit enough to play for another five years.</p>
              <p>Giggs, who made his debut for the club 20 years ago in 1991, has already signed a new contract for next season which will take him through his 38th birthday. But time shows no sign of catching up with a player who has already made a record 873 appearances, before the trip to Arsenal, for the club.</p>
              <p>Last month Burnley defender Graham Alexander joined Tony Ford as the only outfield players to pass 1000 appearances. If Giggs plays on he will join them, but Alexander and Ford played their football in the lower divisions and for Giggs to complete the feat playing all his matches in top-flight football would be an astounding achievement.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex told the <em>Sunday Mirror</em>: "He's been unbelievable, fantastic. I don't know how he does it. He's 37 years old and still looks as if he's got four or five years left in him.</p>
              <p>"Of course, when you get older it can hit you quickly. You never know. But what he's doing at the moment is quite amazing.</p>
              <p>"Ryan has never had any weight problems. He's also got great balance. You never see him get whacked because his balance is so good."</p>
              <p>Ferguson also revealed he is still hoping to persuade <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/8860/Paul-Scholes"><span style="color: #225fb2;">Paul Scholes</span></a> to play on for another season. Unlike Giggs, Scholes has so far not committed to another 12 months with United.</p>
              <p>He added: "I've had a few chats with Paul, encouraging him to stay on. We'll see."</p>

              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson admits Howard Webb is the best referee in England, but is still concerned about his side finding themselves on the wrong end of a major decision this weekend.</p>
              <p>Ferguson received a five-match ban for his attack on Martin Atkinson over his handling of the first Premier League game between United and Chelsea in March.</p>
              <p>In a game which the United boss felt triggered Chelsea's impressive recent form, Atkinson did not spot a foul by David Luiz that should have brought the Brazilian's dismissal, then awarded the Blues a debatable penalty for Chris Smalling's foul on Yury Zhirkov.</p>
              <p>It forms part of what Ferguson feels is a catalogue of key calls that have gone against his team, even though there are a number of examples of United benefiting.</p>
              <p>One such occurrence came in January, when Liverpool's Ryan Babel posted a mocked-up picture of Webb on Twitter after an FA Cup third round tie at Old Trafford when the World Cup final referee awarded United a penalty and sent off Steven Gerrard.</p>
              <p>"We are getting the best referee, there is no doubt about that," Ferguson said. "But (getting a bad decision) is definitely our big fear.</p>
              <p>"We have the players to do it all right. We just hope it's our turn for a little bit of luck."</p>
