            <div class='col-md body'>UNITED'S goalscoring department is suddenly looking a little threadbare.<br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson's Premiership champions are facing a nail-biting and expensive summer effort to install a new forward - and potential sellers are well aware of the Reds' pursuit of more goal power.<br><br>Of course, any attack that contains the world-class talents of Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo can't be too badly off.<br><br>Sir Alex was unable to land a replacement for the prolific goal-poacher Ruud van Nistelrooy last summer.<br><br>But, without the Dutchman, Rooney and Ronaldo bagged 23 goals each - both personal bests - while Louis Saha contributed 13, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer 11 and Alan Smith one.<br><br>And with the other departments weighing in, United were able to outshoot all their Premiership rivals to lift the title.<br><br>But with pre-season prepartions for the 2007-08 season around a month away there are more than a few question marks hovering over the striking ranks.<br><br>New signings Nani and Anderson are both attacking players, but the quartet of Saha, Solskjaer, Smith and Giuseppe Rossi - who spent most of last season out on loan - are causes for concern.<br><br>Saha made only two substitute appearances in United's last 18 games of the season and scored just one goal in 2007.<br><br>His battle with a hamstring injury frustrated the club's fans and manager alike and his knee injury in training towards the end of the season ruled him out of the FA Cup Final.<br><br>There is now a fear that the French striker may not even be fit in time for the start of the new term in August.<br><br>Solskjaer had another clean-out operation on his creaking knee this week after suffering discomfort in training with Norway.<br><br>The 34-year-old has vowed to return in time for the start of pre-season training, but has hinted the new campaign could be his last.<br><br>It is now plain to see that the Reds won't be able to rely on their legend as a regular 90-minute man.<br><br>United have told Smith they will not be re-negotiating his contract as had allegedly been promised.<br><br>Though the 26-year-old still has two years left on his current Old Trafford deal, it is clear the Yorkshireman could be on his way out with Spurs, Everton, Aston Villa and Middlesbrough all reportedly interested in paying for his services. The Reds could have the promising Rossi back from Parma, where he has been on loan since January.<br><br>The 20-year-old scored nine goals in 19 games in Serie A and so impressed Parma coach Claudio Ranieri that the Italian - who this week chose to move to Juventus instead of City - is keen on taking him with him to his new post at the Stadio delle Alpi.<br><br>If the Reds allowed that to happen, that would leave Rooney - backed by Ronaldo and the new signings - as the only recognised, reliable striker that Fergie can bank on for next season without some kind of issue hanging over him.<br><br>Smith's contract snub and Solskjaer's predicament will not have gone unnoticed by clubs who have them in their sights.<br><br>Ajax's Klaas Jan Huntelaar, Dimitar Berbatov of Spurs and Fernando Torres (Atletico Madrid) remain the trio most heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford.<br><br>Having secured Nani, who has passed a medical and now requires internatuional clearance, and Anderson, who is expected to secure a work permit, as well as Owen Hargreaves early, Fergie will want his squad fully assembled by the time United's pre-season matches kick off in July.<br><br>The club have so far announced eight games on their warm up calendar, beginning with three matches on their Far East tour.<br><br>They are : July 17 v Urawa Red Diamonds (A); July 20 v FC Seoul (A); July 23 v Shenzhen Xiangxue Eisiti (A); August 1 v Internazionale (H); August 3 v Doncaster (A); August 5 v Chelsea (Community Shield at Wembley); August 8 v Glentoran (Belfast); August 8 United XI v Dunfermline (Edinburgh).<br><br>Whether Fergie has a new addition by then, or he is waiting to see how his questionable quartet respond, remains to be seen.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by omgukilledkenny:</div><div class="quote_body">should we get another striker? i think we should.</div></blockquote>Yes.But not as starting 11. I felt that our current lineup can no longer fit another striker. SO its something like a supersub. Which is why i think leaves established strikers like Eto'o and Berbatov totally out of the equation.<br><br>We wont do justice to Huntelaar if we were to buy him and leave him on the sub bench. So i think Ryan Babel might be a good option. Young prospect to hone his skills at Old Trafford.. Oh well..let's hope our scouts can look at those who shone at the upcoming UEFA U-21 championships...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>They should keep Smith. He's a good player, always willing to slog his guts out to get something out of the game. If he goes away, then Utd's firingpower will be weakened especially when Saha and Solskjaer being injured every now and then. :\</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I do believe that they have a striker lined up, and they're just keeping the dealings quiet as Fergie said he'd like to do. Definitely be looking forward to a surprise deal being announced soon.<br><br>Realistically, we're looking at only 3 true front-men for next season. Smith, Rossi and Dong. Solskjaer looks a spent force and Saha is way too fragile to be anything close to be reliable.<br><br>Berba doesn't seem to be going anywhere after he signed his new contract. To bid for Eto would be to engage in a bidding with Milan who still have a certain Gilardino and possibly even Ricardo Olivero to offload. Huntelaar might just be a possibility but with Ajax also regularly challenging for domestic trophies at least, the lure isn't really there yet.<br><br>The one i'd really like to see would be Afonso Alves. To the best of my knowledge, Heerenveen are not gonna be playing in the UCL next season. Also, i'd really like to know if his contract has any buy-out clauses that will reduce the need for negotiations. He remains my personal fave as his movement is good, and he scores plenty.<br><br>Still, it's up to Fergie.</div>
