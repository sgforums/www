The Teessiders face the awesome task of preventing Manchester United from establishing a six-point lead at the summit. But 'Boro took four points off the Red Devils' last season and humiliated them in this corresponding fixture. They've also already beaten Chelsea at home.<br><br>'Boro, who held United to a goalless draw at Old Trafford in May, have sights set on their first ever back-to-back home victories over the Red Devils in the Premiership, and only their fourth maximum on home soil in this League against them. The Teessiders took a firm grip on this fixture in October last year when Gaizka Mendieta scored in the second minute and they never loosened it, winning by a remarkable 4-1 margin.<br><br>Aiyegbeni YAKUBU is Middlesbrough's top scorer with four goals.<br><br>Goalkeeper Mark SCHWARZER and Emanuel POGATETZ are the only players to have been on the field for every minute of Middlesbrough's Premiership matches this season.<br><br><strong>MANCHESTER UNITED</strong> returned to winning ways on Wednesday night (3-0, home to Everton) after sharing the spoils in last Sunday's shoot-out with fellow high-fliers Chelsea. The Londoners are inactive this weekend, which means the leaders have opportunity to launch a huge psychological blow by increasing their advantage with a fifth successive Premiership victory on the road. They are the only club still to lose a Premiership game away from home this season.<br><br>Louis SAHA is United's leading scorer with nine League and Cup goals.<br><br>Wayne ROONEY is the club's top marksman in the Premiership with seven.<br><br>ROONEY is one shy of 50 career Premiership goals.<br><br>If he lines up for the kick-off, ROONEY will be making his 100th start in a United shirt.<br><br><strong>Middlesbrough (from):</strong> Schwarzer, Jones, Turnbull, Xavier, Davies, Huth, Woodgate, Pogatetz, Taylor, Arca, Boateng, Downing, Cattermole, Morrison, Rochemback, Euell, Mendieta, Yakubu, Maccarone, Graham.<br><br><strong>Manchester United:</strong> Van der Sar, Kuszczak, Neville, Brown, Ferdinand, Vidic, O'Shea, Silvestre, Evra, Heinz, Fletcher, Ronaldo, Scholes, Carrick, Giggs, Richardson, Saha, Rooney, Smith, Solskjaer.<br><br><strong>REFEREE</strong><br>Chris Foy (St Helens, Merseyside)<br><br><strong>LAST SEASON'S CORRESPONDING GAME</strong><br>Middlesbrough 4-1 Manchester United<br><br><strong>HEAD TO HEAD TOTALS </strong><br><br>at Middlesbrough only<br>League: Middlesbro 18 wins, Man United 19, Draws 11<br>Prem: Middlesbro 2 wins, Man United 7, Draws 2<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Now MacClaren is no longer at Middlesborough, i think the percentage of United winning is higher by a notch.<br><br>Boro's performance is really like a roller-coaster ride. They can beat Chelsea 2-1 and lose to Portsmouth 4-0 the next week. It makes me wonder what the players are thinking. Winning Chelsea and on Cloud 9?<br><br>Furthermore, Southgate likes to rotate his starting line-up, especially his strikers. Malcom Christie, Yakubu Aeyegbini, Jason Euell, Massimo Maccarone.<br><br>I'm going for a 2-0 win for United.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Cheers.<br>C.K</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>RONALDO at the centre of another storm at the Riverside.<br>Boro boss Gareth Southgate accused the Portuguese winger of diving to win Manchester United a penalty as they moved six points clear at the top.<br><br>Ronaldo tumbled over Middlesbrough keeper Mark Schwarzer in the box despite there appearing to be no contact. Louis Saha converted from the spot before United were rocked by James Morrison's volleyed leveller. But Darren Fletcher regained the lead almost immediately as he headed home Ryan Giggs' centre.<br><br>Southgate was furious that Ronaldo failed to stay on his feet. He said: "There was no contact whatsoever. The keeper has tried his best to get out of the way and the player goes down ... again.<br><br>United boss Alex Ferguson was adamant it was a spotkick. He said: "I thought it was a clear pen to be honest with you. "HeÂ’s trying to evade it but would he have scored? I think he would have."<br><br><span style="color: brown;"><strong>Middlesbrough manager Gareth Southgate:</strong> </span><br>"Ronaldo made no contact with our keeper.<br>"Schwarzer tried his best to get out of the way. We've seen it so many times. It's clearly not a penalty."<br><br><span style="color: brown;"><strong>Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson:</strong></span><br>"I think that our away form has been fantastic.<br>"That's got to be needed because it's such a tight top of the league with ourselves and Chelsea.<br><br>"The lads showed great resolution, even when Middlesbrough equalised we were straight back at them and they wanted to win it. That's important."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Lol Ronaldo ronaldo.. There wasn't contact but I think he couldn't balance himself, it wasn't exactly a dive but it was a wrong call by the ref.. There was another one where he got a free kick. That one if see normally looks as if he got his leg caught but slow motion, its as if he purposely contact his leg with Boateng's leg.. Oh well bottom line Man U won!!!!!! But kind of disappointed with Rooney and Giggs performance yesterday in particular Giggs.. I think, yesterday the ball was kinda weird that's why Man U didn't play much passing.. Rooney couldn't handle the ball well.. And did you saw the free kick Giggs and Ronaldo were talking about? They were discussing about the spot on the ball to kick and when Ronaldo strike it, it was bloody sweet rocket. Is there a technique or something to strike the ball? And kudos to Flethcher. Improved quite a lot and he was outstanding last night with a hardworking performance yesterday. Maybe should try Ronaldo Scholes Carrick Flethcer formation one day. Let Giggs sit out.</div>
