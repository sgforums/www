              <p>Amos definitely has better kicking abilities. Also good decision-making skills, when to come out, when to punch, even quick delivery for a counterattack. Not bad.</p>
              <p>Bebe is like the other Valencia, he doesn't go down as easy as a few other Portuguese wingers that we know of. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> He's definitely giving a few Wolves players some trouble.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>They brought their sombreros to Old Trafford last night in honour of a new hero. Javier Hernandez, </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: windowtext;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span></a><strong>’s new Mexican forward, did not let them down. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Watching a goalscorer in full flow when the confidence is pulsing through the veins is a remarkable thing. You know, just as they know, that at some point they will score. United have two such strikers who were not required last night.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Michael Owen, one of the finest marksmen of his generation, was in the stands while Wayne Rooney was in a posh hotel in </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Dubai</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">. The one who mattered, though, was on the pitch. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">He is very much the man of the moment for Sir Alex Ferguson and his misfiring team and last night Hernandez - alias Chicharito or Little Pea - needed only nine minutes as a substitute to win this game. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">During a first half as wretched as anything you will ever see, an Old Trafford crowd of 45,000 was almost lulled in to a slumber. At full-time they roared their team from the field. That is what a goalscorer can do almost on his own.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">With the game at 2-2 and seemingly heading for extra time, deep into the 89th minute United mounted one last forward movement. And as Hernandez charged through the middle he was picked out by Darron Gibson. Once Hernandez collected possession it was clear he would score.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">He may only be 22 but he has the nerves of a veteran. Drawing his right foot back to shoot, he forced Steven Mouyokolo and keeper Wayne Hennessey to go to ground. When he then checked inside to set up the goal with his left foot, the rest was a formality.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">‘He was absolutely brilliant,’ raved </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Ferguson</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">. ‘They build up heroes very quickly here but he is justifying the praise and quite right. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">‘We just knew when he came on that if he got a chance then he would take it. It was an absolutely magnificent finish. He dummied the defender really well. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">‘The area that is improving with him is his touch and control and also his vision. That’s because the training is intense. We care about our training and we make sure our players improve.’</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Perhaps the only player in the United dressing room who may have felt a shred of envy when Hernandez followed up his two goals at Stoke with the winner here was the Portuguese starlet Bebe. </span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><br><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Starting his first game at Old Trafford since his £7.4million summer move from Guimaraes, Bebe crowned a performance of promise with a goal in the 56th minute. By full-time it had all but been forgotten.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">‘He doesn’t have the same advantage as Hernandez as he doesn’t speak the language,’ added </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Ferguson</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">. ‘But he is having his lessons twice a week and he will be fine. I was pleased with him.’ </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Bebe’s goal was somewhat overdue as this had been a wretched game early on. United had made 11 changes from the team that beat Stoke while <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/wolverhampton-wanderers.html"><span style="color: windowtext;">Wolves </span></a>had only four players remaining from their 2-0 defeat by </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Chelsea</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">. Frankly, it showed. The game desperately needed a goal, even if it was a rather peculiar one.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Tall and rangy, Bebe had shown a willingness to attack left back George Elokobi and it was one such run that led to the goal. Elokobi managed to get something on Bebe’s cross but it served only to loop the ball over keeper Hennessey. Kevin Foley looked briefly to have headed clear from the line but the goal was rightly given after crossing the line. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">From this point United should have eased towards the next round. However, </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Ferguson</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">’s team don’t do anything easily these days and Wolves could have won the game over the course of the peculiar 20 minutes that followed. </span></p>

              <p></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Riled by United’s goal, Wolves took just four minutes to equalise. A corner was swung in from the right and Elokobi rose to head in from only six yards. Stephen Hunt, usually reliable in front of goal, clipped the top of the bar when he really should have scored from 18 yards and then former United midfield player David Jones was similarly wasteful and his shot went wide. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Wolves were playing with confidence and spirit and manager Mick McCarthy deserves credit. Too few teams visit Old Trafford with two centre forwards but McCarthy’s did and with a little more composure from his players he could have been rewarded. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">As it was, United’s Ji-sung Park was next to score, running through to finish well with his right foot with 20 minutes left, only for Wolves to exploit more slack defending to equalise again through Foley.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Again Wolves had the chance to take the lead and this time it surely would have been the winner. Once again, though, a visiting player could not hit the target as the goal gaped. Sylvan Ebanks-Blake was the culprit and it felt like the defining moment of the game.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">‘We have to take our chances when we come to a place like this,’ said McCarthy. ‘Apart from that I was delighted with our performance.’ </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">His frustration was understandable. Wolves had stood toe to toe with United during an engaging second half. Goalscorers, though, make all the difference.</span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">Ravel Morrison<br>Midfielder, 17</span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt;"><br>Supremely gifted, but needs to stay on the straight and narrow. He made his senior debut in stoppage time last night.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">Robert Brady<br>Winger, 18</span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt;"><br>Quickly rose through the United ranks. An Ireland Under 19 international, he was handed a first-team squad number earlier this month.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">Magnus Eikrem<br>Midfielder, 20</span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt;"><br>Spotted at Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s soccer school four years ago.

Lots of players panic during that moment and will blast the ball as hard as they can and hope for the best... Mark of a top class striker, on 90 mins he still kept his composure and what a finish... What a signing indeed !</p></div>
