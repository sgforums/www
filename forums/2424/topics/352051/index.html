              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">MANCHESTER UNITED’S punishment for their 4-1 mauling by Liverpool was a DAY OFF. </h2>
              <p class="article">Boss Alex Ferguson decided against hauling in his shamed stars for extra training after Saturday’s Old Trafford embarrassment. Instead, he stuck to his original plan to use Sunday as a recovery day after their hectic recent schedule. </p>
              <p class="article">A United insider revealed: “It’s been three games a week almost since they got back from the World Club Cup in Japan, so with a free week ahead of Fulham it was decided a day’s rest would be better. </p>
              <p class="article">“The players don’t need telling again how much the boss hurts.” The FA have confirmed Nemanja Vidic will sit out United’s next two league games — including the home clash with Aston Villa — following his red card. It was the Serbian defender’s second dismissal of the season. </p>
              <p class="article">United have had some welcome news, with Owen Hargreaves taking the latest steps along the long road to recovery. The England ace has missed the whole campaign after a knee op to cure a long-standing tendinitis problem.</p>

              <p>Honestly, I would say that the defeat was partially due to Ferguson's tactical error. He played the insipid anderson instead of scholes or giggs. For such a major game, anderson is simply not up to the mark yet. Had giggs or scholes played from start, the distribution and flow of game would have been much better.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Secondly, vidic is the culprit too. Solid defender as he is, i have seen him on a few occasions bungle on the ball.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nevertheless, man u has always shown fighting spirit. Earlier in the season, they lost to liverpool and arsenal. But they went on to claim a stretch of clean sheets, surge forward in cup competitions and top the league. This embarassing defeat will serve as a wake up call. I'm sure man u will continue their glorious march. This sat's game against fulham will be interesting.</p>

              <p>please, don't blow your trumpet after just one win.. and least, not here.</p>
              <p>Inter was a more important game than vs Poo. U are talking about the last eight in the Champion League vs Poo in the league where we got pts advantage and game in hand. Any idiots can see that, however, the red mist is still before you, I see.</p>
              <p>Yes, Giggs/Scholes would have made a difference,maybe even Fletcher. But how's the best way to blood a youngster, Anderson. I questioned his selection, but on the other hand, I applaud SAF's audacity in picking him. Sure, Anderson won't never stand up to Weasel-face-heckler, or the "best" player in the world, whom, is often given a protective FA's "you-can-do-no-wrong", but what's a better learning ground. If Anderson is able to absorb this lesson, and grow from there. Then this lesson is worthwhile.</p>
              <p>I laughed at your self-assessment of giving "above 6" to your players.Typical ostrich who buries his head in the ground.. </p>
              <p>This is a blip,but fear not, for we will regain the momentum again..Pity we won't be facing Poo for the rest of the EPL season, but we will show you, end of day, we are still on top of the mountain looking down on you..</p>

              <p>I would rather they win Inter and lose to Liverpool as it is now
              than they had lost to Inter and won Pool... Cos if like that, they
              would have gone out of the CL already...</p>

              <p>Inter was a more important game than vs Poo. U are talking about the last eight in the Champion League vs Poo in the league where we got pts advantage and game in hand. Any idiots can see that, however, the red mist is still before you, I see.</p>
              <p>Yes, Giggs/Scholes would have made a difference,maybe even Fletcher. But how's the best way to blood a youngster, Anderson. I questioned his selection, but on the other hand, I applaud SAF's audacity in picking him. Sure, Anderson won't never stand up to Weasel-face-heckler, or the "best" player in the world, whom, is often given a protective FA's "you-can-do-no-wrong", but what's a better learning ground. If Anderson is able to absorb this lesson, and grow from there. Then this lesson is worthwhile.</p>
              <p>I laughed at your self-assessment of giving "above 6" to your players.Typical ostrich who buries his head in the ground.. </p>
              <p>This is a blip,but fear not, for we will regain the momentum again..Pity we won't be facing Poo for the rest of the EPL season, but we will show you, end of day, we are still on top of the mountain looking down on you..</p>

              Nvm lar. What is important is to win the title. If at end of season Liverpool didnt win the title, win 4-1 or 5-0 also doesnt matter isnt it.
              
              What counts is the title at the end of the season. After all, Man Utd lost 5-0 away to Newcastle in 1997 and in 2000, Man Utd also lost 5-0 to Chelsea away isnt it.
              
              Man Utd has a slim lead of 1 point, but having played a game lesser, we shall see if they can win the title come end of the season. If it does, Man Utd will tie with Liverpool of 18 league titles.

              the result flattered liverpool, as its the kamikaze defending that made the scoreline worse.
              
              when it was still 11 players, it was still alright, until Vidic was sent off late and the last goal was o shea's mistake.
