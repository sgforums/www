              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>The Manchester United squad were out on force with their WAGs in tow on Wednesday evening to celebrate a record 19th league championship.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">United wrapped up the Barclays Premier League title on Saturday with a 1-1 draw at Blackburn, and could secure a unique Double with a Champions League showdown against Barcelona to look forward to later this month</span>. </p>
              <div class="artSplitter"><span style="font-size: x-small;">To cap a phenomenal debut season, Javier Hernandez picked up the Fans' Player of the Year gong at the glitzy end-of-season gala at Old Trafford, as Nani was voted Players' Player.</span></div>
              <div class="artSplitter"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Wayne Rooney was also honoured after his fantastic bicycle kick won the Goal of the Season award.</span></div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Speaking after receiving the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award, Hernandez, who has bagged 20 goals since his £6million move last summer, dedicated his gong to the supporters:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'I have to say thank you so much to the fans,' the Mexico striker said. 'They have helped me a lot. I think this was a difficult decision to make and I don't think I deserve it because it hasn't been just one player who has played well. We are a team. </span></p>
              <p> <span style="font-size: x-small;">'I also must thank my family who came over to England with me and helped me a lot, and of course I've had great support from the boss, my team-mates, the coaches and all the staff at the club who have all helped me feel very happy and very comfortable here.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'I dreamt about playing for Manchester United and thought perhaps in my first season I'd play for the Reserves with maybe a few minutes in the first team. But thanks to the boss and all my team-mates I have played a little bit more!'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Nani, who also finished second in the fans' vote, was quick to laud his team-mates after winning the Players' Player accolade. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The 24-year-old winger said: 'I must say thank you very much to my team-mates. It means a lot to win this award.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'My team-mates have helped me a lot this season. That's why I'm stood here. I have done my best to help the team win the league and, of course, I have been very focused on working hard and improving as a player. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'This has been my most consistent season for United. Every year I've been here I have improved and this one was fantastic for me. I created a lot of goals and scored more than last season, so I'm very happy. I hope to do even better next season.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Rooney was caught up in a Twitter storm on Wednesday evening after warning a fan 'I'll put u asleep within 10 seconds'.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">But the United striker put his latest troubles to one side to collect his award for his fantastic overhead strike in United's 2-1 win over rivals City earlier this season.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'To score a goal like that in such a big game was a great feeling,' Rooney said. 'It's something I'll never forget and it'll stay with me until the day I die.' </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'It was just pure instinct. Nani's cross took a little deflection so I had to adjust my body, but thankfully it went in the top corner. There's no better feeling than scoring a goal like that in such a massive game.'</span></p>
