            <div class='col-md body'><strong>ALAN SMITH will return to FA Cup action. </strong><br><br>Smith, 26, broke his left leg just over a year ago in the fifth-round tie at Anfield. He has made only one full first-team appearance since Â— in the Carling Cup win at Crewe back in October. But boss Alex Ferguson has been impressed by his work and determination to return to the side and he will be in the squad for tonightÂ’s fifth-round replay at Reading.<br><br>Smith even rejected a chance to go out on loan in January to stick to his quest to get back in a United shirt as soon as possible. Ferguson declared: Â“At the time I said going away on loan would be a good thing for him. Â“But he had the ambition and drive within to say Â‘I want to get back in the teamÂ’. That showed great faith in himself.<br><br>Â“The one thing you know about Alan Smith is he has great courage and enthusiasm to play football, which always gives him a chance. Â“Alan has been unfortunate not to get his chance sooner, because of the form of the team. Yet he still has a long-term future at the club.Â” Ferguson is likely to bring Smith on from the bench at the Madejski Stadium. But he is intent on giving him some first-team football soon, as he prepares to lose Henrik Larsson from his striking department on March 12.<br><br>Another little-used player this season has been Kieran Richardson, who is set to start this evening. Ferguson added: Â“ThereÂ’s no question our options are better than last season. Â“Alan Smith and Kieran Richardson had another run-out in the reserves last week and enjoyed it. Â“IÂ’ve been saying for weeks that the more football I can give them, the better it will be for us if the time comes that we need them later in the season.Â”<br><br>With United firing on three fronts, Ferguson is assuring all his squad they will be playing a part at some time. He said: Â“Things can change with the team. Louis Saha is not in the side at the moment but a few months ago I couldnÂ’t see my team without him.<br><br>Â“Mikael Silvestre and Gabriel Heinze have been fantastic players for this club. Yet they are not in the side at the moment either. Â“We will use our squad and it is so important I do that in terms of getting minutes on the clock for all the players. The most important thing, though, is to play a team that wins.Â”<br><br>Ferguson will field a much-changed line-up from that which won at Fulham, as he has a key Premiership visit to Anfield coming up on Saturday.<br><br>Captain Gary Neville, axed at Fulham after a bust-up with his boss during the match in Lille, is expected to return and Cristiano Ronaldo should play after his stunning weekend winner at Fulham.<br><br>Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs and Larsson are likely to be rested. But Ferguson still expects to see off a Reading team which will also not be at full strength.<br><br>The Scot said: Â“Reading will play the same type of team as at Old Trafford. The interesting thing for me is whether they will play one up front or two.<br><br>Â“I expect a difficult game, because Reading are the team of the season so far. Â“They and their manager Steve Coppell have done fantastically.Â”<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>3-2 = a narrow escape.  I din watch the match, got to work, but blowing 3 goals in a spree of 6 min. is no joke.  But i am not sure, is it poor defending once more that let in 2 goals from Reading?<br><br>Reading is surely a strong horse this season - lets hope it can maintain its momentum - don't end up like Wigan, strong last season &amp; this season flirting with relegation.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was expecting this kind of result when United go 3 up in 6 minutes becos it's their tendency to take their foot off the pedal when they are 2 goals in front before halftime.<br><br>Credit to Reading who put on a brave fight despite being 3 down in the opening few minutes.<br><br>But den again, United field mostly their reserve team (apart from Van der Sar, Ferdinand, Heinze and Saha) and Reading were at full force when Lita was introduced. United team last night lack match fitness and experience becos they seldom play (together).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Cheers.<br>C.K</div>
