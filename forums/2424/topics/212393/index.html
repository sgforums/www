            <div class='col-md body'>Basically, since utd have not won anything yet, his price is still $14m lah to be fair, i know still quite high you may say but he is not known to be a scorer of goals even during his time at spurs mah... and since you say he is too identical to Scholes, then you got it right liao.<br><br>His strength is he has good link up play as you have said too thats why they want him... Scholes is old already and in a yr to 2 he probably won't be able to perform like his present form.<br><br>Most players need time to settle into a new surrounding and also new team mates so getting him in earlier would do good for them also as well as Carrick himself.<br><br>Give it some time, the jury is still out on him. He has done rather ok so far.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

So far I seldom seen Carrick playing full 90 mins with Ronaldo on the right wing and Giggs on the left wing. Let' say the two wingers are up, and centre having Carrick himself and Scholes, do you think it a will sort of an invincible formation? My personal feel towards Carrick that he has good potential in Man U as he has good visions in the field, such as predictions on where to pass the balls to.. I guess he do worth the 18m.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Whatever it is, from what I have seen so far from him, he's not living up to the number he is wearing. Hargreaves would be a better number 16. Not saying Carrick is lousy, he is good. Can pass well and has vision. But his hunger, work rate is kinda missing. He need to be running around like a mad dog and lunging in at people's feet for the ball. That is what a number 16 at Man U does.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, there is only one KEANO.<br><br>so we can use 16 to taboo Carrick.<br><br>to me, he is improving but given that with Scholes, and Rooney dropping back, and most opp. playing with 5 in MF, it is very tight.<br><br>I think they are playing more slick, and carrick is getting into the picture, but still not there yet.<br><br>surprisingly for newcastle, Fergie reversed and made carrick the apex of the mf, and scholes the DM, picking balls from defence for a start.<br><br>I believe the key is for carrick to blast in one or two goals, and his virgin run will come to an end.<br><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I would have thought that Carrick is a defensive midfielder not so much of creative midfielder?<br><br>Admittingly, the few matches that he's on, his passing has been accurate and potentially deadly at times - one of the better passer of the ball in Man U.  But my impression is that when SAF buys Carrick, he wants him to replace Keane - but he seems to lack the stature and aggression that strikes fear in opponents - like Vieria or Keane for the matter.  As a creative midfielder, he seems to be duplicating what Ronaldo and Giggs are doing - moreover, I feel he still lack the flair in that creative / playmakers have.<br><br>Perhaps SAF shld decide on what role he shld play and fill the gap come January.  We need someone of Keane's mould to sit in front of the defense. I like the current defense setup of Ferdinand, Vidic, Heinz and Neville. Oh boy, Heinz is injured again...sigh....O'Shea and Evra just cannot seem to fit the leftback role as well....</div>
