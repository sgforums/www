              <h2>The Mirror has claimed that Manchester United and England star
              Wayne Rooney embarked upon a gambling spree after England's World Cup
              qualifier in Belarus.</h2>
              <p>It's not the first time Rooney has gambled himself into hot water. In
              2006 he racked up a reported £700,000 via betting, before he and a
              group of United stars blew £250,000 in the 235 Casino a year ago.<br><br>His
              latest exploits took place at the same casino, with the in-form striker
              feeling lucky after bagging a brace for the Three Lions. However, his
              on-pitch prowess didn't extend to the blackjack table, according to the
              Mirror's report.<br><br>After flying home from Eastern Europe,
              confident Roo apparently headed to the city-centre casino looking to
              capitalise on his hot streak, but ended up having a terrible night on
              the tables.<br><br>A casino source told the paper, "When Wayne walked
              in a few people congratulated him on how well he had played a few hours
              before. He went straight to a blackjack table and started to play hands
              at the maximum - £500 a time. He was happy to chat to people and had a
              permanent smile on his face.<br><br>"It looked like he was thinking, 'My luck's in tonight - I'll keep it going and make a mint.'<br><br>"However,
              he was quickly into a serious losing streak. At first he was joking
              with the dealer, but when he kept losing the mood at the table changed.
              This was Wayne Rooney and he was losing tens of thousands."<br><br>The
              23-year-old then decided he'd give the roulette wheel a spin, hoping
              his luck would change quickly. However, things didn't pick up for the
              hitman and only closing time saved him from serious damage.<br><br>The
              source continued, "He switched to roulette and put hundreds of pounds
              on each spin of the wheel to try and recoup some of his losses, but his
              luck didn't change.<br><br>"The club closed at 6am and he was £65,000
              down. When he left, he had a face like thunder, but at least he can
              afford to lose that sort of money. Everyone knows the risks."</p>
