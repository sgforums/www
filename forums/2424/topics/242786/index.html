The Portuguese winger, who is in negotiations over a new contract with the Reds, has been the subject of constant speculation since last year's World Cup. And news he's in talks about extending his deal at Old Trafford has done little to dampen the optimism in Spain.</strong><br><br>Sports daily Marca claimed on Thursday: "Cristiano Ronaldo will sign for Real Madrid once the season is over. "That's the bombshell that the president (Ramon Calderon) is going to announce this summer. A galactic transfer, if he's one."<br><br>The paper goes on to claim Calderon has made the Portugal forward's signing "an absolute priority" even though "he will cost a fortune." Calderon has reportedly been informed by Madrid's sports director Predrag Mijatovic and marketing director Jose Angel Sanchez that the deal would be "viable and profitable" despite the size of the transfer fee.<br><br>Meanwhile Diego Forlan believes his former Manchester United teammate will sign for Real's huge rivals Barcelona. The Villarreal striker, who became great friends with Ronaldo at United, told DiarioSport: "I believe if they make him a good offer, there's little doubt he will accept it, because Spanish football has great quality and this Liga is the best in the world."<br><br></div>

The wing wizard expects to tie up the five-year, Â£110,000-a- week contract in the next month.</strong><br><br>Spanish giants Real Madrid have finally called off their chase for the Portuguese star. A senior Madrid source admitted: Â“Everything possible has been exhausted and Ronaldo will stay at United. "They have made their intention to keep him very clear.Â”<br><br>Madrid made a final attempt to prise Ronaldo, 22, from Old Trafford this week. But it is believed the Premiership leaders made it very plain to both Real and the player that he would not be allowed to leave under any circumstances, even if he requested a move.<br><br>Ronaldo is in stunning form this season, has hit 17 goals for his club and is one of the favourites to be named Footballer of the Year. He expects his new bumper contract will reflect his status as one of world footballÂ’s rising stars and it should be completed in the next three or four weeks.<br><br>United boss Alex Ferguson is believed to have played a big part in persuading Ronnie he can fulfil all of his footballing ambitions at Old Trafford.<br><br></div>
