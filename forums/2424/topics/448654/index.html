              <p><span><strong>David de Gea insists he is finally coming to terms with the demands of life as Manchester United's No 1 - and it's all down to learning English.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>The young Spaniard is starting to win acclaim for his performances between the posts following a shaky start to life in England.</span></p>
              <p><span>The 21-year-old, who joined United last summer for £18million from Atletico Madrid, was rested for a period in January.</span></p>
              <p><span>But an injury to rival Anders Lindegaard provided him a fast-track return to United's starting XI and the keeper believes his better grasp of English is helping him improve game after game.</span></p>
              <p><span>'I’m learning English little by little,' he said. </span></p>
              <p><span>'I’m already able to give more instructions to the defence. People in England are demanding.'<br></span></p>

              <div class="sport item"><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/ManUnitedMail"></a><span>Sir Alex Ferguson revealed last week he wants the keeper to bulk up in a further bid to help him adjust to the physical demands of the Premier League and De Gea admits he has had to become more aggressive.<br></span></div>
              </div>
              <p><span>'In England I’ve learnt to concentrate for the whole match,' he added. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>'People can score from any situation. </span></p>

              </div>
              <p><span><strong>'I’m also learning to be more aggressive because players challenge you hard. If I don’t, I’ll get hurt. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span>'I’ve had to change the way I come for crosses. A keeper in England has to be physical with the strikers.'</span></p>
              <p><span>De Gea also paid tribute to Ferguson, hailing the the 70-year-old Old Trafford boss as a 'great manager'.</span></p>
              <p><span>'There’s a lot of pressure on a Manchester United keeper but it is going well,' he said. </span></p>
              <p><span>'I try to stay calm so it doesn’t affect me. Ferguson is almost always with us and he often eats with the players too. He’s a great manager and few know about football like he does.'</span></p>
              <p><span>And De Gea revealed how criticism thrown in his direction at the start of the season has only served to toughen him up.</span></p>
              <p><span>'It encouraged me to keep fighting and keep working hard. The important thing is not to let yourself get down because you can turn it around,' he said.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Through hard work, I have waited for my chance and grabbed it. Fortunately now I am showing some good form. I hope this can continue right the way through until the end of the campaign.'<br></span></p>
