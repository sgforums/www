              <p>The Club World Cup might be grabbing all the headlines at the moment
              but tomorrow the eyes of the world will return to Europe as the draw is
              made for the first knock-out stage of the Champions League.<br><br>With
              the group stages producing plenty of drama and a few surprise
              qualifiers, there are sure to be plenty of interesting match-ups, with
              defending champions Manchester United and Spanish giants Barcelona
              looking like the two toughest opponents.<br><br>The rules for the draw
              are that teams from one country cannot yet face each other, group
              runners-up will be drawn to face group-winners (and vice-versa
              naturally) and the runners-up will play the first leg at home.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>GROUP WINNERS</strong></span><br><br><strong>Roma (Italy)</strong><br><br>Following
              a poor start in Group A, Roma emerged as surprise group winners above
              Chelsea and now await the runners-up from the other groups. The Italian
              side have improved dramatically lately, winning their last eight games
              in all competitions, and after they were hammered by Manchester United
              last season, they will be keen to show their worth this time around.<br><br><em>Possible Opponents:</em> Sporting Lisbon, Atlético Madrid, Villarreal, Lyon, Arsenal, Real Madrid.<br><br><strong>Panathinaikos (Greece)</strong><br><br>After
              picking up a superb win against Inter Milan in the San Siro,
              Panathinaikos emerged as the winners from Group B ahead of the Italian
              champions. The Greek side are arguably the worst side to win a group,
              at least on paper, but whilst they look like the easiest team to face
              for runners-up, complacency could be a problem.<br><em><br>Possible Opponents:</em> Chelsea, Sporting Lisbon, Atlético Madrid, Villarreal, Lyon, Arsenal, Real Madrid.<br><br><strong>Barcelona (Spain)</strong><br><br>The
              Catalan side absolutely ran away with Group C, despite losing to
              Shakhtar Donetsk in the last game, and no-one will want to draw them in
              the next round. Currently leading the way in Spain, they look like a
              side reborn this season and along with Manchester United are the best
              team in the competition.<br><br><em>Possible Opponents:</em> Chelsea, Inter Milan, Lyon, Arsenal.<br><strong><br>Liverpool (England)</strong><br><br>It
              took until the final day to make it assured but Liverpool eventually
              emerged as Group D winners ahead of Atlético Madrid. With their
              prestigious record in the competition in mind, they will be a test for
              any team in the next round.<br><br><em>Possible Opponents:</em> Inter Milan, Sporting Lisbon, Lyon, Villarreal, Real Madrid.<br><br><strong>Manchester United (England)</strong><br><br>The
              defending European champions might currently be in Asia but they will
              be keeping a close eye on the draw tomorrow. Whilst they might be a
              little off the pace in England they are still one of the favourites for
              the Champions League this year and with good reason. Their recent spats
              with Real Madrid could set-up a fiery background for a meeting with the
              Spanish side in the knock-out stages.<br><br><em>Possible Opponents:</em> Inter Milan, Sporting Lisbon, Atlético Madrid, Lyon, Real Madrid.<br><strong><br>Bayern Munich (Germany)</strong><br><br>The
              German side had a tricky group to top but they did so impressively in
              the end, beating Lyon in France 3-2 on the last day. They have a good
              record in this competition and as the only German team left they will
              feel they have something to prove for their country.<br><em><br>Possible Opponents:</em> Chelsea, Inter Milan, Sporting Lisbon, Atlético Madrid, Villarreal, Arsenal, Real Madrid.<br><br><strong>Porto (Portugal)</strong><br><br>Porto
              might not be doing so well at home but in Europe they have excelled so
              far, beating Arsenal on the final day to secure top spot in Group G.
              They might not have the strongest squad in the competition but they
              have a good team ethic and should be tough opposition.<br><br><em>Possible Opponents: </em>Chelsea, Inter Milan, Atlético Madrid, Villarreal, Lyon, Real Madrid.<br><strong><br>Juventus (Italy)</strong><br><br>The
              fallen giants have emerged as serious contenders this season following
              their successful passage from a group containing both Zenit St.
              Petersburg and Real Madrid. They have a superb history in European
              competition and will definitely be one of the trickier teams for
              runners-up to face.<br><br><em>Possible Opponents: </em>Chelsea, Sporting Lisbon, Atlético Madrid, Lyon, Villarreal, Arsenal.<br><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>RUNNERS-UP</strong></span><br><strong><br>Chelsea (England)</strong><br><br>The
              beaten finalists from last year looked as though they would top Group A
              on paper but a late showing from Roma, and some poor displays
              themselves, condemned them to second place. They could now face some of
              the bigger teams left in the competition, and a match-up with Barcelona
              is probably waiting to happen following their heated clash a few
              seasons ago.<br><br><em>Possible Opponents: </em>Panathinaikos, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Porto, Juventus.<br><br><strong>Inter Milan (Italy)</strong><br><br>For
              Inter Milan to finish runners-up in Group B is surprise enough but for
              them to be beaten at home by Panathinaikos was a complete shock. With
              Jose Mourinho at the helm they have the pedigree to go far and a
              match-up with any English side would grab the attention in the next
              round.<br><br><em>Possible Opponents:</em> Barcelona, Liverpool, Manchester United, Bayern Munich, Porto.<br><strong><br>Sporting Lisbon (Portugal)</strong><br><br>Did
              well to qualify from a tricky group that included Barcelona, but now
              they are likely to face a real test in the next round. The Portuguese
              side are one of the weakest left in the tournament and they will do
              well to beat a group winner.<br><br><em>Possible Opponents: </em>Roma, Panathinaikos, Liverpool, Manchester United, Bayern Munich, Juventus.<br><br><strong>Atlético Madrid (Spain)</strong><br><br>A
              lot was made of the return of Atlético to the European elite stage
              after over a decade out, and they did not dissappoint. The Spanish side
              could have won the group, had it not been for a draw on the last day in
              Marseille, and they will be tough for anyone.<br><em><br>Possible Opponents: </em>Roma, Panathinaikos, Manchester United, Bayern Munich, Porto, Juventus.<br><br><strong>Villarreal (Spain)</strong><br><br>El
              Submarino Amarillo might have been beaten by Celtic on the last day but
              they put up a good performance in Group E and are a side to fear in the
              draw. They have been far in this tournament recently and certainly have
              a solid enough team to trouble anyone.<br><em><br>Possible Opponents:</em> Roma, Panathinaikos, Liverpool, Bayern Munich, Porto, Juventus.<br><strong><br>Lyon (France)</strong><br><br>A
              permenant fixture in the Champions League as of late, Lyon are a side
              capable of causing an upset in the knock-out stages. They have some
              real quality upfront and despite finishing behind Bayern Munich, they
              are a good outfit and will want to continue French representation in
              the competition.<br><br><em>Possible Opponents: </em>Roma, Panathinaikos, Barcelona, Liverpool, Manchester United, Porto, Juventus.<br><br><strong>Arsenal (England)</strong><br><br>Arsene
              Wenger decided to rest some of his top players on their last matchday
              and that could well cost them in the long run. Defeat by Porto means
              they enter the draw as runners-up, and whilst everyone knows of their
              qualities, their weaknesses are not exactly secrets.<br><br><em>Possible Opponents:</em> Roma, Panathinaikos, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Juventus.<br><strong><br>Real Madrid (Spain)</strong><br><br>They
              are the most prestigious side to finish as runners-up this season, and
              whilst their season may be in turmoil at the moment, they have plenty
              of time to regroup. The Spanish side were defeated twice by Juventus
              but with their wealth of attacking talent they are a dangerous
              prospect, and a match-up with Manchester United looms.<br><br><em>Possible Opponents: </em>Roma, Panathinaikos, Liverpool, Manchester United, Bayern Munich, Porto.</p>

              <p><br>i agree......they started out patchy but to lead by 6pts now in serie a requires a certain level of consistency. this will be a battle of wit and who deploys the right strategy on the nite.</p>
              <p>SAF will be no walkover though...like i said, the top match on the draw.</p>

              <p>I don't think the Inter team is good enough to dispatch Man Utd. Inter's form in the UCL is inconsistent.</p>
