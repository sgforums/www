              <p>Ashley Young's representatives have reportedly held talks with Manchester United.</p>
              <p>The 25-year-old Aston Villa winger has been strongly linked with a move to Old Trafford this summer after admitting he wants to challenge himself at a higher level.</p>
              <p>No comment has been made by either club but Young's representatives have been in discussions with United this week.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson is already set to strengthen his squad with the arrival of Phil Jones and Young could be the second English player to make the switch to the Premier League champions during the transfer window.</p>
              <p>The England international enjoyed a fruitful season with Villa last term, producing a number of impressive displays despite it being a difficult year of transition at the club.</p>
              <p>Young has already revealed that he wants to play in the UEFA Champions League, suggesting that he is set on an exit from Villa Park.</p>
              <p>The former Watford midfielder has risen to prominence in recent years and is now considered an important player by England coach Fabio Capello, most recently scoring against Switzerland in a Euro 2012 qualifier last weekend.</p>

              <p>Which is why O'Shea + Brown + Gibson 12m deal to Sunderland must be accepted! At least it recoups some expense and boost the transfer kitty.</p>

              <p><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester United" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span></a><strong> will officially sign Ashley Young when the Aston Villa forward returns from holiday later this month but their capture of Phil Jones from Blackburn Rovers has been delayed by a dispute over the defender's transfer fee.</strong></p>
              <p>Jones passed a medical and agreed personal terms with United on Wednesday after the Premier League champions met the £16m release clause in the contract Blackburn awarded the 19-year-old in February. He then joined the England Under-21 squad in Denmark in preparation for the European Championships convinced, along with United and his agent, that the deal had been done.</p>
              <p>Blackburn's owners, Venky's, have since said they do not have to accept a £16m transfer fee and, mindful of interest from Liverpool, Chelsea, Tottenham and Arsenal, believe he is worth more. Venky's have refused to transfer the player's registration and it may fall to lawyers to decide whether the wording in Jones' contract allows him to be sold at £16m or merely speak to clubs who meet that price. United are said to have no concerns that Jones' transfer will be completed and for £16m.</p>
              <p>Young is believed to have agreed personal terms on an initial £16m move to Old Trafford from Villa Park but the transfer will not be formally announced until he has completed a medical. The England international is due to travel to the United States on holiday and is not expected to have had his medical before then. But Young, who had also been courted by Liverpool and Tottenham, has agreed to join United and, with an £18m deal in place for the Atlético Madrid goalkeeper David de Gea, will take United's committed spending to £50m.</p>
              <p>Wesley Sneijder has committed his immediate future to Internazionale despite interest from Sir Alex Ferguson as he attempts to rebuild the United midfield for next season. The Holland international and Tottenham's Luka Modric were both under consideration by the United manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, who is also keen on Arsenal's Samir Nasri but Sneijder has said: "There is a family atmosphere at Inter and there are all the ingredients to aim high. Milan is marvellous, picturesque and full of elegance. I love it. At the moment I am very happy here and I don't see why I should leave."</p>

              <p>These chicken sellers are really silly man... I can't understand what's the point of having a release clause in the contract when they don't want to sell at that price?</p>
              <p>The reason of it was so as they will get a good value for him (so they thought) at that time so they offered him an improved contract as well as giving him a wish to join a bigger club should they meet the clause sum...</p>
              <p>However, sensing he have outgrown that sum, with all the top clubs willing to pay the clause amount, they are now claiming the clause only allows him to talk... lol.</p>
              <p>I mean, whats the point of having a clause to talk in the first place?</p>

              <p><br>Not necessary... Torres and Reina had released clause put in by Pool... As we now know, Torres's was $50m and Reina's is said to be $20m... Ronaldo was rumoured to have an $80m one inserted 12 months before he left when he signed a new deal with United just like Bolton's Cahill's is reported to have a $17m or so one as well currently... It work both ways... But I belief normally it's the club rather than the player...</p>
