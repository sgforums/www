The forward Alexandre Pato and the defender Alessandro Nesta have been passed fit for tomorrow's Serie A match against Udinese.</p>
              <p>Pato has not played this year after a thigh injury and Milan's coach, Leonardo, has frequently given his place on the right of his front three to David Beckham.</p>
              <p>Nesta has been out since suffering a leg muscle strain against Siena last month and Milan have not won a league match since. The full-back Massimo Oddo is also in Milan's squad for the Udinese game after a long lay-off.</p>
              <p>However, Leonardo still has injury worries ahead of the United match with the defenders Gianluca Zambrotta and Luca Antonini, the midfielder Clarence Seedorf and the forward Marco Borriello all unavailable for tomorrow's match.</p>

              <p>Ronaldinho inspired AC Milan to victory over Udinese on Friday night, warming them up for the visit of Manchester United in the Champions League on Tuesday with three more points in Serie A.</p>
              <p>Although the Brazilian did not put his own name on the scoresheet, he set up all three goals as Milan regained second spot in the table.</p>
              <p>Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored the first after seven minutes and substitute Alexandre Pato added the second five minutes before the break.</p>
              <p>Antonio Floro Flores gave Udinese hope with a goal on the stroke of half-time before Huntelaar's second in the 57th minute restored the home side's two-goal advantage.</p>
              <p>Antonio Di Natale pulled Udinese back into the game in the 86th minute, but they could not find an equaliser.</p>
              <p>Milan coach Leonardo left David Beckham on the bench for the second game running, but Alessandro Nesta was back at the heart of the defence after a three-week injury absence.</p>
              <p>And it wasn't long before Pato entered the field too with Amantino Mancini forced off injured after just 13 minutes.</p>
              <p>By then, Milan were ahead with a bullet header from Huntelaar, who met Ronaldinho's cross at the near post in the seventh minute.</p>
              <p>Dida was nearly caught out by Gokhan Inler's shot which he initially fumbled before clasping. Not for the first time, and not for the last either, the Milan goalkeeper did not look too comfortable.</p>
              <p>United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, who was watching on from the stands, will certainly have taken note.</p>
              <p>He will also have been given a lot to ponder by Ronaldinho, who was pulling the strings in the Milan attack, setting up Pato in the 24th minute, but the linesman's offside flag was raised before the Milan striker eventually rolled the ball in.</p>
              <p>A poor clearance from Dida gave Di Natale a gift in the 27th minute, but the Udinese striker and Serie A top goalscorer failed to take advantage as the Milan defence recovered.</p>
              <p>There was no offside flag when another sumptuous delivery from Ronaldinho, straight into the path of Pato, set up the second goal in the 39th minute.</p>
              <p>Udinese defender Andrea Coda succeeded partly in putting the Milan number seven off as he prepared to pull the trigger, but the ball fell kindly for Pato, who was left with a simple tap-in.</p>
              <p>However, the Rossoneri continued to look susceptible at the back and Floro Flores headed Di Natale's cross in with the final touch of the first half.</p>
              <p>The actual last touch of the half was Dida's as he carried the ball into his goal rather than making what should not have been too difficult a save.</p>
              <p>Fortunately for Milan, they had Ronaldinho, who was the source of their third goal in the 57th minute.</p>
              <p>His free-kick was met with an unintentional flick by Massimo Ambrosini and Huntelaar was on hand to fire in his second and Milan's third from close range.</p>
              <p>Gennaro Gattuso missed the chance to wrap the game up in the 75th minute when Ronaldinho's vision and pass execution picked him out in acres of space, but Samir Handanovic blocked his shot behind for a corner.</p>
              <p>From the corner kick, Ronaldinho's header was cleared off the line by Simone Pepe before he made way for Beckham.</p>
              <p>Di Natale's honesty in not going down denied his side a penalty when he nudged the ball round Dida with 10 minutes remaining, but the Udinese striker was rewarded with a goal his performance deserved in the 86th minute when he beat the offside trap before beating Dida with an elegant shot.</p>

              <p>Ronaldinho isn't that jia lat liao. Just yesterday he assisted all 3 of AC Milan's goals against Udinese. They've still got some quality in them...Pirlo...Huntelaar..Inzaghi( who seems to have a knack for scoring against Utd). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="icon_evil.gif"></p>
              <p>I think just got to be cautious la cause Utd don't normally fair well away from home in the UCL.</p>

              <p>Ronaldinho isn't that jia lat liao. Just yesterday he assisted all 3 of AC Milan's goals against Udinese. They've still got some quality in them...Pirlo...Huntelaar..Inzaghi( who seems to have a knack for scoring against Utd). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="icon_evil.gif"></p>
              <p>I think just got to be cautious la cause Utd don't normally fair well away from home in the UCL.</p>

              <p>yes considering united doesnt have a stable central defensive partnership. so far its brown and evans to helm the centreback, but rio will be back against Milan. since the last defeat in 2007, united has progressed alot while Milan seemed to be stagnating. also their players are older as well. This time round, the favourites is United, I am sure they can beat Milan and progress to the QFs.</p>

              <p>David Beckham admits facing Manchester United this week will be emotional but says he won't be affected once the action begins.</p>
              <p>The 34-year-old is set to face the Red Devils in a competitive game for the first time since leaving them in 2003 when the sides meet in the last 16 of the Champions League at the San Siro on Tuesday night.</p>
              <p>But the England midfielder is adamant the game between two of European football's most glamorous names is about far more than that.</p>
              <p>He told the <em>Sunday Times</em>: "Obviously there will be emotions but I don't think it will be a problem. I've played in many big games.</p>
              <p>"There has been so much talk about me going back to Manchester United in the second leg, because it will be my first time playing for a club there in seven years. But this tie is not just about me playing against United, it's about AC Milan. It's about two great clubs coming together, and that's what makes it such a big game, for the teams, for the fans."</p>
              <p>Beckham, who is in his second spell at AC Milan, believes United striker Wayne Rooney is the man his side must be most wary of.</p>
              <p>"I have always thought that Wayne is one of the best goalscorers in football anywhere. He's proving that," he added.</p>
              <p>"He's at a great club and doing what he does best, which is scoring goals. United are playing so well for him, too."</p>
