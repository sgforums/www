              <p><strong>Manchester United chief executive David Gill insists the Old Trafford outfit have "a sensible business strategy". United confirmed another major sponsorship deal on Monday when Turkish Airlines were announced as the Red Devils airline partner.</strong></p>
              <p>Aside from pocketing another sizeable cheque, United will also benefit from the use of Turkish Airlines planes for European trips, plus summer tours.</p>
              <p>At a time when other major airlines, particularly British Airways, are continuing to feel a financial squeeze, it says much about United's pulling power that they are still able to complete deals most of their Premier League rivals can only dream of.</p>
              <p>It flies in the face of accusations from those behind the hugely successful green and gold campaign that United is badly run.</p>
              <p>And while the Glazer family will continue to attract hefty criticism for the debt mountain they built in order to complete their controversial takeover in 2005, Gill is staunch in his defence of them.</p>
              <p>"People presuppose we have financial problems," he said. "We do not believe that is the correct situation. "We are very comfortable and we have a sensible business strategy that will continue for many years to come."</p>
              <p>It has been argued by Keith Harris, part of the Red Knights group who aim to wrest control from the Glazer family, that player sales will become inevitable as the interest on PiK notes taken out by the Glazer family begin to bite.</p>
              <p>Yet Gill insists the Glazers are totally aware that United can only carry on being attractive commercial partners if Sir Alex Ferguson is allowed the finances to maintain a successful team.</p>
              <p>"We fully understand what happens on the pitch has a real effect on what happens off it," he said.</p>
              <p>"Over the years, since the Premier League came into existence in 1992, we have had sustained success under Sir Alex Ferguson, with the great players he has coached and managed.</p>
              <p>"It has produced significant financial returns that have been reinvested back into the team, the ground, the training ground and also the players; both in terms of new ones and new contracts for existing ones.</p>
              <p>"We are lucky to operate in a sport that produces those results." The Glazers do not need to be told United is a worldwide phenomenon, whose reach far outweighs any company of comparable size.</p>
              <p>It means United are still an attractive vehicle to be attached to, as the presence of Wayne Rooney, Ryan Giggs, Darren Fletcher, Park Ji-sung and Nani at this afternoon's launch made obvious.</p>
              <p>"We have 333 million followers and yesterday we celebrated 100 years at this great stadium," said Gill.</p>
              <p>"Our history and heritage means we can bring a lot to the table. "There is also a professionalism about us, so, whilst we are in an economic downturn, there are still many successful companies in the world who are investing in the future.</p>
              <p>"We are one of the quality partners big entities can still associate with."</p>
