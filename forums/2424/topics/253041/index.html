            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://images.skysports.com/images/playerpics06_07/Managers/Premiership/wenger_dour.jpg"><br><br><strong>Arsene Wenger stated his belief that Manchester United are worthy winners of the Premiership, following his side's draw against Chelsea which secured the title for Sir Alex Ferguson's side. Chelsea's inability to match United's victory in the Manchester derby on Saturday culminated in Ferguson claiming his ninth Premiership title. </strong><br><br>Wenger conceded that he was not hopeful of receiving a bottle of wine from Ferguson but nevertheless, was gracious in praise of his old rival.<br><br>"The table doesn't lie," he said.<br><br>"Manchester United have scored more goals than anyone else and you can only say they deserve the title. "No, I don't expect to receive a bottle of wine from Sir Alex Ferguson but congratulations to him anyway. "They have been the most consistent side and they also have individual players who can make a difference. "Chelsea and Manchester United were both strong sides but there were a few turning points when United didn't show any weakness and they had an offensive ability the others did not have."<br><br>While the champagne is being uncorked over in Manchester, in the capital, Wenger was left to reflect on the fact his side are currently 20 points behind the newly crowned champions. The French tactician admits that while his charges show an abundance of promise, there is still much work to be done before they are ready for a title challenge of their own.<br><br>"It is a big frustration," he said. "What I have to get right in the summer is to evaluate what we need but there are signs that when everybody is fit we have a good chance. "You could sometimes say we over-complicated things in our finishing this season and we have to consider that we are 20 points behind Manchester United."<br></div>
