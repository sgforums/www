              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">The Football Association have cleared Manchester
              United boss Sir Alex Ferguson and his assistant Carlos Queiroz of an
              improper conduct charge.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>The charge related to comments made following United's FA Cup defeat to Portsmouth on March 8.</p>
              <p>Ferguson's charge concerned comments about referee Martin
              Atkinson and Professional Game Match Officials (PGMO) general manager
              Keith Hackett.</p>
              <p>Queiroz's charge related to comments about Atkinson.</p>
              <p>Speaking after Sulley Muntari's penalty gave Pompey a shock
              victory at Old Trafford, Ferguson felt his side had earlier had a
              blatant spot-kick denied when Cristiano Ronaldo was blocked by Sylvain
              Distin.</p>
              <p>"It's absolutely ridiculous," Ferguson said. "I cannot explain
              it. Managers get sacked because of things like that and he's going to
              referee a game next week."</p>
              <p>He added: "He (Hackett) is not doing his job properly and he needs to be assessed.</p>
              <p>"I'm assessed as a manager, players are assessed, referees
              should be assessed properly by the right people. That performance today
              should not be accepted by our game."</p>

              <h1>FA set to appeal Fergie verdict</h1>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">The FA may appeal against the decision to clear
              Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson and assistant Carlos Queiroz
              of improper conduct.</span></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>The pair were charged in relation to comments made following United's FA Cup defeat by Portsmouth on March 8.</p>
              <p>Ferguson's charge concerned comments about referee Martin
              Atkinson and referees' chief Keith Hackett and Queiroz's charge related
              to comments about Atkinson.</p>
              <p>At an independent regulatory commission hearing on Wednesday the charges were found 'not proved'.</p>
              <p>The FA have confirmed they have the option to appeal - and
              refuted suggestions a transcription error led to the commission finding
              the pair not guilty.</p>
              <p>The governing body will await receipt of the full judgement and 'written reasons' before considering further action.</p>
              <p>As for suggestions their case failed because their belief
              Queiroz described Atkinson as a 'robber' proved to be incorrect, the FA
              insist the charge did not centre solely on that alleged comment.</p>
              <p>"The charges were brought on more than just the issue of the word 'robber'," said an FA spokesman.</p>
              <p>"At any disciplinary hearing the FA, as the prosecutor, argues
              its case, as does the defence. The fact that the commission found the
              charge was not proved does not mean that the FA made any errors in
              putting the case together.</p>
              <p>"The commission has to make a decision based on the applicable standards of proof, which is balance of probability."</p>
