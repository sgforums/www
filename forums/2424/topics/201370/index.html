            <div class='col-md body'>I think all along for the past 2 seasons that have been the reason. I have no doubts about our striker department and lately our defence looks buffed with addition of latest Vidic and a promising Evra. Heinze has been brilliant and hopefully he won't get injured again.. It has always been the midfield, especially the centre of the park. This area is the engine of any team. It is very important because it is the one that breaks down opposing team's attack and it is also the one that sparks its own team's attack..<br><br>Now, who do we have actually? Giggs has been used last season, but seriously is he in the mould of Gerrard, Lampard, Deco? And Keane's replacement is very very important. Such a waste Butt had to go last time. He had the tenacity. Park Ji Sung is hardworking but he is often outmuscled by others. Wondering why SAF is not making a move for Gattuso. Is it because he is old?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>TO SIR ALEX FERGUSON, GET THE MIDFIELDERS QUICK!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

Cos every team needs a defensive midfielder to do all the dirty work, i.e. Tackling, breaking down play and passing the ball to a more offensive player.<br>Arsenal uses Gilberto, since Vieira left. Chelsea have Essien and Makelele. Liverpool uses Alonso. United has no choice.<br>Ever since Butt and Keane left, the slot has been left open. Phillip Neville tried and failed. So too did Djemba-Djemba &amp; Smith. Ferdinand was once used there remember? This shows that United lack a defensive midfielder.<br>Players like Vieira, Carrick and Javier Mascherano has been linked to United becos of their defensive capabilities in the middle of the park.<br>Since O'Shea is a strong utility man. Fergie is left with no choice but to play him unless he signs a much better defensive midfielder.<br>I think signing Park is to a certain extent, a mistake.<br>He's too small size to fit EPL. Yes, he can take on defenders but does he has the stamina to run at them for a full 90 mins? I don't think so. If u've noticed, most of the time he'll be substituted before the final whistle.<br>I recommend Quaresma of Porto fame.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Cheers.<br>C.K</div>
