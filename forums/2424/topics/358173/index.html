              Sir Alex Ferguson got his wish: a 1-0 win to take the Emirates Stadium for next Tuesdayâ€™s Champions League semi-final, second leg. But he couldnâ€™t hide his disappointment at not making the most of Unitedâ€™s dominant display.
              
              The Reds boss admitted United could have all but booked a place in Romeâ€™s final next month, but instead heâ€™ll settle for a slender but certainly advantageous lead at the halfway point.
              
              â€œOf course you have to be disappointed that we didnâ€™t take more of our chances,â€� he told reporters. â€œThe goalkeeper [Manuel Almunia] made three fantastic saves. But the pleasing aspect for me was that we said before the game we wanted to score and not concede. Weâ€™ve done that.
              
              â€œThe performance level was very good and we have given ourselves a good chance of getting to the final. The tie isnâ€™t over, of course, but we have the players who can score a goal, and we will be a big goal threat at the Emirates.
              
              â€œWe did very well with some terrific play at times. But it was reminiscent of the FA Cup final we had against Arsenal in 2005, where they won on penalty kicks after weâ€™d had so many chancesâ€¦ at least we scored this time! And we havenâ€™t lost an away goal, that is the key to it all.â€�
              
              Sir Alex wants to see a similarly colossal defensive display at the Emirates â€“ although United may have to do that without Rio Ferdinand, who sustained a rib injury. â€œArsenal had possession, without really doing anything. They had a half chance from [Niklas] Bendtnerâ€™s header, but otherwise we contained them very well. Thatâ€™s credit to our defending. When we concentrate, we can produce excellent performances like that. We need that to get through this tie, but I think we can also score.â€�
              
              The Reds boss has promised a cracker at Old Trafford, but only his team kept up that part of the bargain. Arsene Wenger vowed that the world would see a different Arsenal in six daysâ€™ time. That may be the case, but United are ready to go the distance if necessary.
              
              â€œArsenal have to be [different next Tuesday],â€� added Sir Alex. â€œArsene will be thinking it was a good day for him. They could have been out of the tie, but theyâ€™re not. The other way to look at it is that we tend to do things the hard way, and tonight we perhaps frustrated our fans where we should maybe be in the final, but weâ€™re not. Thatâ€™s the nature of this club, weâ€™ve done it many times. We did it in the last round, and we might need to go right to the wire again.â€�
              
              Job is half done
              "Arsenal could've been out of the tie, theyâ€™re not. We do things the hard way, and tonight we perhaps frustrated our fans where we should maybe be in the final, but weâ€™re not. The tie isn't over."
