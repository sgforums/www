              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Manchester United star Darren Fletcher admits the Reds are prepared for a tough battle against Stoke on Tuesday night.</strong></p>
              <p>Tony Pulis's Stoke side are likely to provide the toughest of opposition for United, who have already played three games over the festive period.</p>
              <p>'We know what to expect from Stoke,' Fletcher told Manchester United's website.</p>
              <p>'They’ve really consolidated themselves as a Premier League side and Tony Pulis has done a great job. You know you’re in for a battle when you play Stoke and you have to win that battle and earn the right to play.</p>
              <p>“It’s going to be a difficult game. We experienced that at the Britannia and we’re expecting more of the same at Old Trafford. They always have a go. They look at home in the Premier League now and they know what it’s all about.</p>
              <p>'They have some players who like to attack and Tony Pulis doesn’t like his side to sit back. We expect them to come and have a go at us, as most teams have done at Old Trafford this season.'</p>
              <p>Stoke are known for their direct approach, but Fletcher insisted they could also play some good football.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>'Stoke have some good footballers in their side,' he said. 'Etherington and Pennant in the wide positions like to get at you and dribble. They’ve definitely got options.</strong></p>
              <p>'They can go direct if they want to but they also have some good footballers up front, players like Ricardo Fuller and Tuncay, who like the ball to their feet and can play some good stuff on the ground.</p>
              <p>'You know Stoke will be physical at times because they lump free-kicks and long throw-ins into the box but we can’t neglect the other ways they can cause problems. It’s important you defend as a team and that starts with the front players.</p>
              <p>'Our defensive performances have been very good and we’ll do our homework and prepare for Stoke’s threat. We know they’ll be a danger from set-pieces – they’re a big, strong, physical side, so we’ll have to match them and make sure we’re on our toes.'</p>

              <p>i think man utd are really strong at home, they string the kind of passes which they rarely do while away.</p>
              <p>Fletcher once again for me is the above average kind of player, dependable one moment and inconsistent the next. He's really not good enough for utd. Gibson was missing most times.</p>
              <p>And giggs lasted the entire match 2nd time in a row! haha he's no more running down the wings but playmaking these days. He had great ideas the whole 90 mins last night but i just wished his passes were more accurate. Nani was really on form and when the ball's at his feet, one can be sure things will happen. Hernandez as usual the natural goal poacher's instincts again.</p>
              <p>Smalling was excellent and steady. The next ferdinand? Kuhzcak was quiet, not really tested, he doesn't look assertive at the goalmouth too. Lacking confidence?</p>
              <p>Chelsea are behind utd by 9 points and i would consider them as out of the title race, no matter how mathematically possible their chances are. Spurs too. Depending on results tonight, either city or arsenal would be out too.</p>

              <p>i think MUFC's effort in blending the youth with the experienced is helping to give all a good run of games, and keeping all fresh for the last 18 games.</p>
              <p>hopefully, MUFC can go on and do their best..</p>

              <p>I watched the match last night and overslept this morning. I wouldn't have watched the entire match had Whitehead scored that equaliser because I thought the points were in the bag. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Kuszczak had nothing to do really, Stoke only made 5 shots in the entire match and only 1 was on target, which is of course the goal. I thought at times he was shaky and miscommunicate with the back 4 while rushing out to claim the ball. An experienced striker like Drogba or Torres would have stole in a couple of times.</p>
              <p>Rafael had a decent game but still lack the cutting edge in making decision: whether to press the opposition or to hold position to prevent crosses from coming in. Etherington threathened a couple of times because of his error in judgement.</p>
              <p>Smalling really had a magnificent game. He had Jones in his pocket the entire match. Maybe he should work on his clearance, which was rushed and wayward. Thank goodness Evans was on the bench!</p>
              <p>Skipper Vidic was at fault for Stoke's equaliser. He was sucked into Jones when Smalling had him covered.</p>
              <p>Nani returned from injury and it's actually quite nice to see him continue producing the form before he was injured. But sometimes he was selfish when Berbatov was in a much better position to play to.</p>
              <p>Fletcher produces yet another fine display, snapping at the heels of every Stoke's attacker. His workrate and stamina proved to be vital.</p>
              <p>Gibson had an average game. Tries a couple of long shots and thats about it. Hardly an attacking midfielder who threads ball through. I think he would be sold and make way for Cleverley who is doing really well at Wigan at the moment.</p>
              <p>Giggs is 37 years old? It certainly doesn't appear to be after he clocked in another full 90 minutes. He's more effective than Gibson.</p>
              <p>Chicharito is really the new Solskjaer. In terms of his boyish looks and poacher instincts. He always impressed everytime Fergie plays him and my guess is his place in United is all but cemented for the next couple of seasons.</p>
              <p>It's good to see Berbatov finally tracking back and help out with the defence. Did we see that from him last season? No right? But maybe he should work on short sprints like Rooney's. All he needs is a couple of yards further in front of defenders to make a shot.</p>
              <p>It's good to see a half strength United securing all 3 points but please try not to be complacent next time. It could well be a trashing had half the 19 shots be on target.</p>

              <p>fletcher's standard, can he handle the likes of barca and madrid? Honestly, I don't think he can. Out of 20 clubs in the EPL, he can easily walk into the lower 15s' first eleven but he cannot cut it as top class. Imo, it's a necessity for european success.</p>
              <p>I have seen him outmuscled from the ball on a few occasions. Yes he has a good workrate, retains good possession of the ball and has a decent distribution but he cannot cut it at the highest level.</p>

              <p>if players like babel &amp; kuyt can play 90 minutes against real, i think fletcher's good enough lah</p>
              <p>he won't be looked upon or marked like rooney, and i wouldn't rely on him to win a match singlehandedly or score a crucial goal, but he certainly has his 'place' in a team of 11 (or 16, on the bench =D)</p>

              <p>the funny thing about MUFC this season is the slotting in/out or the cut/chop of players, that i believe is giving a nightmare to opposing managers.</p>
              <p>Individually, MUFC's midfield can't match the barcas, but collectively, they are doing their job. i don't deny, replacements are needed, but @ the moment, I feel the players know what they are doing, what their team-mates are doing, bonds are strong. So the team dynamics is quite good @ the moment.</p>
              <p>rem, we used to have CR7, and we played eye-catching counter football, but somehow, the team dynamics is not their strongest. maybe now, with the goals shared, everyone getting some limelight. it is good too.. right?</p>
