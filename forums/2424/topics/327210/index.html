              <h1>Cristiano Ronaldo told by Man Utd: 'Anyone but Real Madrid'</h1>
              <h2>Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson told Cristiano Ronaldo he could join any club in the world apart from Real Madrid, according to reports in Spain.</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/00789/ronaldo_ferguson_46_789534c.jpg" alt="Cristiano Ronaldo told by Man Utd: 'Anyone but Real Madrid' " width="460" height="288"></p>
              <p><em>Fergie: Willing to sell at $35 million but not $70 million according to Marca.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Ferguson made the pledge when he met Ronaldo for talks in Lisbon last month after the Portuguese midfielder said he wanted a move to Real Madrid, Spanish newspaper Marca says.</strong></p>
              <p>United have been furious with Madrid's conduct throughout the Ronaldo transfer saga this summer, with the Spanish club constantly making comments in public about their desire to sign the winger.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Marca claims that Ferguson became so angry that he told Ronaldo he could join Barcelona for half the money that Madrid were reportedly willing to pay, which was around £70 million.</span></p>
              <p>Barcelona made tentative inquires about signing the 23-year-old, but Ronaldo made it clear that he only wanted to move to Madrid and will now stay at Old Trafford for at least another season.</p>
              <p>Marca, which itself was rebuked by Ferguson in May for what he claimed as its role as a "vehicle" for Real's activity, also reports that Ronaldo has told friends at Real Madrid that if he is not allowed to join the club next summer he will force the move himself.</p>
              <p>Reports at the weekend suggested Madrid are frustrated that the transfer has not been completed and could seek compensation from Ronaldo through a precontract agreement he had with the club.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo's future has been the main talking point at Old Trafford this summer with the club yet to make any signings despite seeking a striker.</p>
              <p>There have been comments from Madrid, Ronaldo and Manchester United since the end of last season but this week Ferguson said that Madrid had only ever made one bid for the former Sporting Lisbon player and also hinted that the saga had fundamentally damaged the relations between the two clubs.</p>
              <p>"We haven't had any recent contact with Real Madrid," Ferguson said. "Has there been any attempt to heal the rift? Yeah, that will be right. "They put a bid in. I don't know if it was fax or letter or whatever. Just one. It was sometime in the summer.</p>
              <p>"But the final decision was taken at the end of the season when the first nonsense appeared and Cristiano referred to his future being decided in the next few days. It was decided there and then he was staying. There was never any change in our stance."</p>
              <p>Speculation about where Ronaldo will play his football during the new season finally ended last week when the Portugal international, who scored 42 goals for United last season as they won the Premier League and Champions League, said he would be staying at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>He said: "Yes, I'm going to stay at Manchester United. I will stay at least for this season. [Sir Alex] Ferguson heard my reasons, I heard his, and indeed we had an agreement that the best solution for both parties would be if I stay. Therefore, I can confirm that next season I will play at Manchester United.</p>
              <p>"And before there are any rumours that I might stay against my will, I want to clear this up right now: whoever says or writes that is lying. I will play for Manchester United with my heart and soul. I will fight and honour that shirt with all the commitment and dedication that I have always had."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The most unconvincing part to this whole piece is... <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ferguson became so angry that he told Ronaldo he could join Barcelona for half the money that Madrid were reportedly willing to pay...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">   </span></p>
              <p>I mean how silly can they get to come up with something like this... The Real fans must be really dumb to belief this... Even if Fergie is crazy, will David Gill be as crazy too? Then there is The Glazers... If they are going to sell, why not take $70m instead of $35m  ? Who are they trying to kid...</p>
              <p>Marca, Marca... I think Real must have paid him good money or give him special seat in their stadium to come up with such things all the time... <span style="color: #ff0000;"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  </span></p>
