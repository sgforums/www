              <p>The home side monopolised the game but failed to turn their dominance into goals, yet the United boss, speaking to <em>Sky Sports</em> after the game, admitted he was pleased with his side’s performance.</p>
              <p>“We dominated the game possession-wise. We played some great
              football at times and I’m pleased with that,” said the Scot before
              adding, “We persevered with our football, which is not easy with some
              young players in the team. We kept our patience, kept our discipline.”</p>
              <p>However, the champions were poor in front of goal, although Ferguson
              revealed his side’s woeful finishing was not a concern. He said: “We
              missed a lot of chances again. That will turn. We’ll start taking these
              chance, it’s one area we are letting ourselves down at the moment.”</p>
              <p>With the scoreline goalless United sent on youngster Danny Welbeck
              for Rodrigo Possebon and his presence helped turned the tie in the home
              side’s favour, as his manager acknowledged: “Danny changed the game for
              us a bit. Something different for them to handle because he’s got that
              height and athleticism and he can run at them. He’s done very well for
              us once he’s come on.”</p>
              <p>United’s pressure eventually told and they were awarded a penalty
              after Peter Ramage brought down Welbeck in the area. Tevez converted
              from the spot and Ferguson was quick to praise his striker. He said:
              “He worked his socks off, he was terrific tonight, I thought he was our
              star man tonight, he was absolutely brilliant.”</p>
              <p>The goal saved the champions the embarrassment of extra time against
              a Championship side and ensured they progressed safely into the
              quarterfinals of the competition.</p>
              <p>After making eight changes to his starting line up for the game,
              Ferguson also revealed he would continue to use his youngsters in the
              next round. He concluded: “It’ll be the same squad as the next game.
              Those who need a game will get a game.”</p>
