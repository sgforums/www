              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson has tipped Anderson for greatness after handing the Brazil midfielder a three-year contract extension at <span style="color: #000000;">Manchester United</span><span style="color: #000000;">.</span></strong></p>
              <p>The 22-year-old's future appeared to be up in the air after injury and disciplinary issues, but he has returned to the United first team in style.</p>
              <p>Anderson started just 10 Barclays Premier League games last season and suffered a cruciate knee ligament problem in February.</p>
              <p>He hit the headlines again this summer after being involved in a serious car crash in Portugal, but has been attracting attention for the right reason in recent weeks.</p>
              <p>'We are delighted Anderson has signed a new contract,' said Ferguson. 'Anderson has developed tremendously since joining the club and he has fantastic potential at only 22 years of age, he is going to be a really top player.'</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>Anderson joined United in a big-money move from Porto in June 2007, signing a five-year contract, but the new deal extends his stay to 2015.</strong></p>
              <p>Clubs were lining up to prise him from Old Trafford in the last two transfer windows, but Anderson said: 'This is the best club to be at and I would like to thank everyone for the great support I have received over the years.</p>
              <p>'I am looking forward to winning many more trophies with this club and I am so pleased to have signed a new contract.'</p>

              <p>i laughed when i saw his lame duck free kick just before the stroke of half time in the arsenal game.</p>
              <p>This guy is not afraid to run at defenders and he is quite strong on the ball. He also has an eye for the defence splitting pass. Just that as a midfielder, he shd be scoring more goals. A good midfielder with goals is worth many cups to the club down the years. Think eric cantona, beckham and keane.</p>
