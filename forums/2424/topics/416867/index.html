              <p><strong>United's attacking ranks are set to be bolstered for the busy festive period by the return of Michael Owen.<br></strong><br>The Reds' number seven has been out of action since October but Sir Alex Ferguson says the striker is now back in full training and edging closer to a comeback.</p>
              <p>The boss told MUTV on Friday: "Michael Owen's training now, he's doing very well. He took part in the football side of it yesterday but I would say he's two weeks away [from playing]. We need to make sure he does a good stint of football training before we bring him into the games."</p>
              <p>Sadly, news on the other Owen - Hargreaves - isn't as promising at the moment.</p>
              <p>"Owen Hargreaves is still  recovering from his hamstring injury, unfortunately," said Sir Alex. "It's a bad blow for the lad and it's hard to take, given the length of time he's been out and the amount of football he's missed."</p>
              <p>As for Saturday's trip to Blackpool, the manager reported no new injuries in his interview with MUTV but he said he would monitor one of his senior midfielders before selecting his 18-man squad.</p>
              <p>"Paul Scholes is going to train today, we'll see what he's like," he added.</p>

              <p>But seriously, I doubt Owen will play much since Rooney is a shoo-in, Berba and Chicharito taking turns and Macheda making odd appearance. And since United is out of Carling Cup, FA Cup and occasional EPL appearances would be a decent target for Owen. <img src="../../../images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>owen still got some use lar. he can be a super sub when united is chasing a goal. he is crucial in the latter stages of the season, provided he does not get hamstrung again and out for a few months.</p>
              <p>I am wondering if fergie will give him a new contract at the end of the season? probably not, as he has to give macheda and wellbeck game time next season.</p>

              <p>Michael Owen took part in the open session of training on Monday morning, raising the possibility that he could be involved in Manchester United's Champions League encounter with Valencia at Old Trafford on Tuesday night.</p>
              <p>The 30-year-old striker has struggled with injury since pulling a hamstring in last season's Carling Cup final and has made only seven appearances this season.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson has suggested Owen was making good progress and that was confirmed at a snowy Carrington where the former England star was part of the group which also included Gary Neville.</p>
              <p>Whether Owen starts is unlikely, although it is possible he could be on the bench.</p>
              <p>However, to have the veteran forward back is useful for the United boss as his team approaches one of the most congested phases of the fixture calendar.</p>
              <p>Midfielder Paul Scholes and defender Patrice Evra trained separately and were watched by Ferguson as they went through their paces.</p>
              <p>Central defender Jonny Evans was absent, although there was no immediate indication as to the Northern Ireland defender's problem.</p>
              <p>United are already assured of their place in the last 16 and know a single point will be enough to seal top spot in Group C.</p>

              <p>Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson has ruled out the prospect of Michael Owen leaving in the January transfer window.</p>
              <p>Reports have suggested Owen could be loaned out by United next month, with a number of clubs linked with the former Liverpool hit-man.</p>
              <p>Owen, who is back to fitness after a hamstring problem, is also coming to the end of his contract at Old Trafford, fuelling rumours United could offload him in January rather than let him leave for nothing in the summer.</p>
              <p>However, Ferguson has dismissed the speculation and insists the 31-year-old is going nowhere, feeling he still has a lot to offer despite his injury problems.</p>
              <p>"He is looking really good," Ferguson told the <em>Mail on Sunday</em>. "He has trained really well this week. People may have forgotten just what a good player Michael is.</p>
              <p>"He's had a nightmare time with a bad hamstring injury but now he deserves a change of luck.</p>
              <p>"If he can stay fit, I believe he has an important part to play for the club between now and the end of the season; there's no doubt about that. He still has a great engine.</p>
              <p>"There has never been a problem with him since he came to United.</p>
              <p>"He is great to have around. He conducts himself well and is a great example to the younger players.</p>
              <p>"I know a few clubs have been thinking about him for a possible loan arrangement but it will not happen. He is definitely not going anywhere."</p>
