              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Patrice Evra insists reaching the Carling Cup final is Manchester United's only concern, while City's motivation is to beat the club they hate.</span><span><span id="intelliTXT"> </span></span></p>
              <p>Not since 1981 have the Blues enjoyed the feeling of reaching a major Wembley final.</p>
              <p>Since Spurs' Ricky Villa famously slalomed his way through the City defence to win the FA Cup, United have competed in 17, which merely confirms a dominance the Red Devils have exerted in a run of almost three decades.</p>
              <p>There is even a banner hanging from the Stretford End depicting the number of years since City's last trophy in 1976, which ticks on one with each passing season.</p>
              <p>And it is the mentality that comes from being the superior partner that Evra is sure will see United emerge victorious from the mouthwatering two-legged duel.</p>
              <p>"We know the City people are talking about this game," he said.</p>
              <p>"But we are playing it to go one more step closer to winning the cup, maybe they are playing it to beat us. That is the difference between the two clubs.</p>
              <p>"For us it is not just about beating Manchester City.</p>
              <p>"Yes, it is an important game but Manchester United play a lot of big games."</p>
              <p>Yet Evra does accept Tuesday will be a special occasion, just as it was at Old Trafford earlier this season when Michael Owen scored the stoppage-time goal that gave United victory in what has gone down as the best derby in history.</p>
              <p>Whether that assessment of a seven-goal thriller is accurate or not, Evra acknowledges it was a moment of football magic.</p>
              <p>Prior to that day, his favourite Old Trafford moments were the Champions League semi-final win over Barcelona in 2008 and the seven-goal rout of Roma a year before.</p>
              <p>"People always ask me what is the best atmosphere I have ever experienced at Old Trafford," he said.</p>
              <p>"Before it was Barcelona and the game against Roma.</p>
              <p>"But when we beat City 4-3 it was crazy. Everyone was on the pitch at the end, the noise was incredible.</p>
              <p>"More importantly, City had been doing well. But when they lost that game against us they started to struggle.</p>
              <p>"If we win this match it might affect them again."</p>
              <p>Evra is certainly happy to hear all the confident noises emerging from the City camp.</p>
              <p>While the France full-back is not getting drawn in by them, he hopes some of the City players do, to such an extent that they keep piling forward looking for goals.</p>
              <p>Evra believes that tactic will play right into United's hands, although Roberto Mancini does not seem quite as committed to the attacking game as Mark Hughes was.</p>
              <p>Until the Italian was brought crashing back to earth by Everton on Saturday, it appeared he could do little wrong.</p>
              <p>But Evra knows perceptions can shift quickly in football.</p>
              <p>"Every time it is the same. Now people say Mancini is a great manager because he won the first four games," he said.</p>
              <p>"But if he loses against United, they will say he is the worst. That is the way football is now. It is only talk."</p>
              <p>For Evra, the proof of greatness is medals.</p>
              <p>In that sense he is doing very well. Three titles on the trot, a Champions League, two League Cup winners' medals, including last year's shoot-out triumph over Tottenham.</p>
              <p>And Evra is by no means satisfied. He has standards to keep.</p>
              <p>"Every year I have been at Manchester United I have won two or three trophies," he said.</p>
              <p>"For me now, it is normal.</p>
              <p>"If we don't win the league it will look like I have not done my job properly. I only have the mentality to win, every year."</p>

              <h3>MANCHESTER UNITED have invited Sogndal defender Even Hovland back to Old Trafford.</h3>
              <p>The centre-back has already undergone trials with the Premier League champions as Sir Alex Ferguson looks to Norway again.</p>
              <p>Ferguson completed the arrival of striker Mame Biram Diouf from Molde this month and will now run the rule over Hovland in training.</p>
              <p>Sogndal have confirmed Hovland, 20, has been granted permission to spend a few days in Manchester but stressed no concrete offer has yet been received.</p>
              <p>Reckoned to be an uncompromising stopper in the Nemanja Vidic mould, the Norwegian will attempt to impress and earn a dream move to United.</p>

              <p><span class="italic">Ferdinand - poised for United return</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span class="italic">
              </span></p><p>Sir Alex Ferguson has confirmed defender Rio Ferdinand will make his Manchester United comeback against Hull at Old Trafford on Saturday.</p>
              <p>The 30-year-old has not featured since the defeat at Liverpool on October 25, since when he has been absent with a long-standing back complaint.</p>
              <p>After initially showing little sign of progress, Ferdinand's condition has improved markedly over the last three weeks and Ferguson believes it is time the former West Ham star re-entered the fray.</p>
              <p>Ferguson said on Friday: "Rio has been training very well in the last few weeks. He will play tomorrow."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In addition to missing three months' worth of domestic action, Ferdinand also sat out England's friendly with Brazil.</p>
              <p>However, the player himself was always confident he would eventually return and Ferguson feels the moment is right.</p>
              <p>"This is the time to bring him back," said the United boss.</p>
              <p>"We have gone through the whole situation with him in terms of enough training and endurance work.</p>
              <p>"It is a big boost because the defence has been the weakest part of our game this season.</p>
              <p>"At various times we have lost Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic, Edwin van der Sar, John O'Shea.</p>
              <p>"It has been a rough time, so to get them back can only be good for us."</p>
              <p>Ferguson confirmed Vidic was still a fortnight away from recovering from a calf complaint, although that would at least put him in contention to face AC Milan in the Champions League knock-out round.</p>
              <p>He revealed this week that O'Shea could miss the remainder of the season after suffering a blood clot in his leg, but Ferguson was at least able to confirm Dimitar Berbatov will be available tomorrow after recovering from a dead leg as United attempt to leapfrog Chelsea and Arsenal to reclaim top spot.</p>

              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson has called for unity on and off the pitch amid all the controversy over Manchester United's massive debts.</p>
              <p>Although a successful £500million bond issue appears to have removed any imminent threat to the club, supporters are now aware United's overall debt has topped the £700million mark.</p>
              <p>In addition, as part of the prospectus issued with the bond, it was revealed that options to raise cash include the sale of United's Carrington training base and their Old Trafford ground.</p>
              <p>That has been enough to mobilise the anti-Glazer faction within the United support.</p>
              <p>After a well-attended meeting last week, at which one fan called for Ferguson to resign, supporters inside Old Trafford for the win over Burnley chanted 'We want Glazer out'.</p>
              <p>Now, a green and gold 'Love United Hate Glazer" campaign has been launched.</p>
              <p>But, acutely aware of the divisive effect supporter unrest can have on the players, Ferguson is urging fans to stick with the team.</p>
              <p>"The family of Manchester United is under pressure as a result of all the issues surrounding the ownership and financial situation of our club," Ferguson said in the official match programme, United Review.</p>
              <p>"Some of our fans are clearly unhappy with our financial position, but we mustn't allow the situation to become divisive.</p>
              <p>"The danger is that we could be presented as being split, which would be harmful and inaccurate, because I believe the vast majority of United fans are behind us and appreciate the importance of standing together in support of the team.</p>
              <p>"I could see our opponents rubbing their hands with glee at the thought of watching us fall out among ourselves if we don't think carefully about what we are doing.</p>
              <p>"We must not lose our focus - which is about building a strong football team that will win trophies. That is what we are about, or at least it should be."</p>
              <p>Ferguson felt the rallying call needed to be issued now, knowing the campaign as a whole is about to enter its critical phase, including the decisive Carling Cup semi-final second-leg with Manchester City at Old Trafford on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>"We must remain loyal to the cause of Manchester United," he continued.</p>
              <p>"The staff and players should be quite one-eyed about that and stay true to the history of the club and all the work done by Sir Matt Busby and the other managers who have contributed to creating the great club we have at Old Trafford today.</p>
              <p>"This is not about stifling criticism. It is simply a plea to stand together rather than take action that will damage ourselves more than anyone else.</p>
              <p>"Manchester United is bigger than me, the players, the directors, the officials and fans. And, particularly at this critical stage of the season, we need to pull in the same direction.</p>
              <p>"It would be a shame to lose our concentration now because I can really see light at the end of the tunnel as we ready ourselves to push for the championship."</p>
