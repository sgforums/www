              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>ANDERSON feared a nightmare injury had ended his dream of joining Manchester United. But today all the Brazilian thinks about is beating Barcelona in the “biggest game of his life”.</strong></p>
              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7">Just a year ago, it was all so different after he picked up an horrific broken foot in Porto’s derby clash against Benfica. The injury left Anderson devastated and worrying his switch to Old Trafford might never materialise. Boss Alex Ferguson had wanted to nab the midfielder much earlier and blood him in United’s reserves — yet the setback put a stop to all that.</p>
              <p class="article">Anderson eventually went back to his homeland to complete his recovery and, after a six-month lay-off, Fergie splashed £18million to land him. Anderson, 20 last week, said: “I would have joined United earlier as they were following me for a long time. But I broke my foot and I was out of action for six months. “I did my recuperation in Brazil and when I arrived in Portugal I was told United continued to be interested. At the time I thought it was such bad luck because I would not be at the level United expected of me.</p>
              <h4>Anderson can't wait</h4>
              <p class="article">“But I did not worry about the scouts of Manchester. I just focused on making a full recuperation.” Anderson had goose-bumps when he finally made his debut for the Red Devils at the start of the season. And now he cannot wait to face Catalan giants Barca in the Champions League semi-final next week — the game he believes should have been the final.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Anderson added: “When I made my United debut I felt something special. It was a great moment and I felt so happy. "I’ve played in great teams — like Gremio or Porto — but the day I played my first game at Old Trafford wearing the red shirt against Sunderland, that is a day I will never forget.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">“For me, the semi-final against Barca will be like playing the final. “Playing against Barca is the most important game of my life and I will prepare myself as if I was playing the final of the Champions League. “I think it should be the final because if you look at the stats we are the two best teams in the competition.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">“Ronaldinho will not play and Messi will not be at his best but the squad of Barcelona is excellent. “I like Andres Iniesta a lot, he’s my favourite player from Barcelona. Then there is Xavi, Deco, Eto’o, Henry. It’s a great team.” Like Ronaldinho, Anderson comes from Porto Alegre and, inevitably, comparisons are made with the two-time World Player of the Year.</p>
              <p class="article">Yet Anderson insisted: “For me, Ronaldinho will always be the greatest. “He’s done it all and I’ve not won anything. I’m just starting out. But it gives me great pride that people compare me to him.” Anderson is just as proud of being part of the United set-up. He added:</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">“Cristiano Ronaldo has helped me adapt. “You work a lot here. I’ve trained like never before. Training sessions are hard and you live for football 24 hours a day. “Alex Ferguson is special. For me, he is the best. "On occasions, he gives the impression he is distant but he’s always on top of everything and he likes working with the young players.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">“Look at the work he did with Giggs, Scholes and even Ronaldo. “It’s an honour to be able to work with a manager like him.”</p>

              <p>It really doesn't matter if he hasn't scored at the moment cos he is still new to the premier league and he only just turn 20... Gattuso is 30, start 35 matches for AC Milan this season and he only scored 1 goal... Anderson only start 23, so i don't see a serious problem with it...</p>
              <p>This Anderson bring strength and power to our midfield which United clearly lacks... Scholes, Carrick and even Hargo don't seem to have the type of style this boy bring to the United midfield... Saw how he out muscled Adebayor easily... In my opinion, he is already as good if not better than the old Italian himself... Only difference is he is much younger.    </p>

              <p><br>lots? how come i watch united match and i seldom see he shoot... Once a match at most, sometime hardly even one... But his vision and through balls is brilliant... But most important is he was bought add cover to the defends and to win the 50 / 50 balls in the midfield and that he is doing just fine... </p>

              <p><br>nope he does'nt takes much shots...that 1st shot he took on the volley against arsenal although he did'nt score already gave me a great impression on him he can defender better then carrick pass almost the standard of scholes..his tackles usually gets the ball and he can make great runs only saf placed him in a more defensive manner</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>okie, all along I thought Anderson is to replace Scholes in being an attacking midfielder.</p>
              <p>and for me, scholes have scored many goals and I expected him to do the same.</p>
              <p>Frankly, I love his attitude and his energy. The ability to cover box to box is awesome given the fact he was supposed to be ease into the first team.</p>

              <p>his main position was all along an attacking midfielder and a left midfielder...strangely i thought saf will also put him into the scholes section but he placed him into a much box to box type like keano so he had'nt got much chances to score</p>
