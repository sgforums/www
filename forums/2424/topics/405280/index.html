              <p class="art-txt-first">Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes has indicated he could prolong his career beyond 2011 if both he and Sir Alex Ferguson are content.</p>
              <p>It was widely expected that the 35-year-old would retire at the end of the next campaign.</p>
              <p>He secured a one-year extension to his deal at the end of last season, when United lost their Premier League crown to Chelsea.</p>
              <p>Scholes was even approached by England manager Fabio Capello before the World Cup to see if he was willing to return to international football and help the nation in South Africa.</p>
              <p>Scholes, who has made 643 appearances for United, turned the request down - and is uncertain as to how his club future will pan out.</p>
              <p>"I do not know if it will be my last season," he said. "I will just take every game as it comes.</p>
              <p>"If I am feeling okay and doing the job that the manager wants me to do, then we will see how things are at the end of next season. Hopefully next season will be another good one for me."</p>
              <p>Scholes and Ryan Giggs are the senior players in the United squad training in Chicago ahead of their five-match summer tour.</p>
              <p>The temperature is expected to reach 33 degrees Celsius on Wednesday but, according to Scholes, United will reap the benefits later.</p>
              <p>"Pre-season is always a busy time of the year for us because we're focused on getting set for the start of the season," he told ManUtd.com.</p>
              <p>"We are doing lots of training in very hot conditions but hopefully that will stand us in a good stead for when the season begins.</p>
              <p>"As far as next season goes we want to get back on track. Hopefully we'll have better luck with injuries and win some more trophies."</p>

              <p>Paul Scholes accepts that playing two or three games a week for Manchester United is now out of the question.</p>
              <p>But the veteran midfielder is determined to win the Barclays Premier League title back from Chelsea.</p>
              <p>Scholes, 35, is building up his fitness on the North American tour and looks set to get another run-out on Thursday against the MLS All-Stars at the Reliant Stadium.</p>
              <p>Along with Ryan Giggs and Gary Neville - who has stayed at home because of a calf injury - Scholes concedes they are given more rest now by manager Sir Alex Ferguson.</p>
              <p>He said: "I know that playing two or three times a week it is not going to happen any more. So you just have to be ready when needed.</p>
              <p>"It is accepted, definitely, given there are that many games and at our age we have to be ready when the manager needs us.</p>
              <p>"You train every day and I did not miss a day's training last season, which was good. I managed to avoid injury. When you are at a club like this you have to be capable of doing that, especially like last season when we had that many injuries."</p>
              <p>United had to be content with the League Cup last year after finishing runners-up to Chelsea and exiting the Champions League at the quarter-final stage when they lost to Bayern Munich.</p>
              <p>They finished one point off the pace and Scholes reflected on a spell in December when a number of defenders were sidelined at the same time.</p>
              <p>He said: "We didn't win what we wanted to but were not that far off. You do not want to use excuses but the injuries we had were shocking really.</p>
              <p>"Hopefully most of us can stay fit this year and hopefully we can go one step further than last season."</p>
              <p>Nani could continue his comeback from a dislocated shoulder in the tour's showpiece match.</p>
              <p>The Portugal winger played all but the last 21 minutes in the 2-1 defeat by Kansas City Wizards on Sunday.</p>
              <p>He said: "It was good to come back and play my first game this season. Of course I still have a lot of work to do.</p>
              <p>"When I missed the World Cup it was a very bad time. But I was thinking, 'I can't wait for the season again so I can play and score goals and feel the crowd behind me again'.</p>
              <p>"Now I'm so happy to be back and I hope to get fit as quickly as possible because I want to play well this season."</p>
              <p>Ferguson's hand has been strengthened in the United States with new recruit Javier Hernandez linking up with the squad for the first time.</p>
              <p>The striker had been on holiday after the World Cup in South Africa, where he scored two goals for Mexico.</p>
              <p>Ferguson is debating whether to give Hernandez an immediate call-up.</p>
              <p>"We need to assess what he been doing physically in the last week or so," said the United boss.</p>
              <p>"We would like him to play a part in the game because there is a big Mexican population in Houston.</p>
              <p>"We want to try and integrate him into the team as quickly as possible but we need to have a chat with him first."</p>
              <p>Darren Fletcher and John O'Shea look certain to be rested for the match as they have picked up what Ferguson described as "niggling injuries".</p>

              <p><strong>Paul Scholes wasn’t overplaying the significance of lifting the Community Shield at Wembley on Sunday, but he says beating Chelsea and winning the season’s first silverware sets the Reds up to reassert United’s authority at home and abroad.<br><br></strong>“Both teams really wanted to win the game,” said Scholes. “It was a hot day, which made it a bit difficult. But I think it was a good game and we’re happy with the win. It’s the Community Shield and it’s only a friendly more than anything, but it’s a trophy at the end of it and we wanted to win it.<br><br>“It’s always nice to beat Chelsea. They’re a quality team and they beat us three times last season which was disappointing, but we’re off on the right start and hopefully we can carry that on throughout the season.”<br><br>Scholes believes the Reds can go a step further this season with a bit more luck and determination. “There is [determination to do well this year],” he told <em>Sky Sports</em>. “We weren’t that far off in the league and we went close in the Champions League. With a bit more determination this year, hopefully we can go one step further.”<br><br>The 35-year-old turned in a vintage display against Chelsea, dictating play in the centre of the park. Naturally, he plays down his own stature, and says that playing alongside quality players at United keeps him young and fresh.<br><br>“I just keep playing and training every day and try to stay fit,” he adds. “I’m still enjoying it, it’s great playing football, and playing for this club is brilliant.  I’m playing with great players week in, week out and it’s something to look forward to.”</p>
