              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson is enjoying the present and eyeing the future after guiding United into the quarter-finals of the Carling Cup.<br></strong><br>The boss fielded players as young as 17 - in the shape of injury-time substitute Ravel Morrison - as the Reds knocked out Wolves at the end of a pulsating second period.<br><br>"It was a really good cup tie in the second half and I thought Wolves played their part, they played well," reflected Sir Alex.<br><br>"We played well too. I think the future's bright, I think everyone at the club is very positive about that. We work hard at producing young players and they're definitely, without doubt, the foundation of the next team."<br><br>Javier 'Chicharito' Hernandez is already a big hit in the current team, after coming on to score his third goal in three days and win the cup tie just when extra time was looming.<br><br>"We tend to build up heroes very quickly here but the boy's justifying the praise at the moment," the manager commented.<br><br>"He's such a good professional, the kid. He's first out and last in at the training ground every day and his goalscoring is getting him a lot of praise and credit and quite rightly.<br><br>"When he came on, you just knew that if he got a chance, he'd take it. It was a magnificent goal. He’s dummied the defender really well, shaped to shoot, pulled it round onto his left foot and it was a great finish.<br><br>"His touch, his control of the ball and his vision are all improving. That's simply because the training is intense. We care about our training and make sure players do improve."</p>
              <p>Bebe's improvement since his arrival as a virtual unknown earned him his first start for the Reds, and after being the best player in a dull first half, the Portuguese winger opened the scoring with a cross that looped up off a defender and over the line.<br><br>"Bebe's goal was a bit fortunate but he did the right thing, he attacks the defender and it was either going to be a really good cross or, as it turned out, a deflection into the net," assessed Sir Alex.<br><br>"It was a good full debut for the boy. He’s been improving physically over the last few weeks and we’re very pleased with his potential. He’s brave, he’s quick and he’s a good crosser of the ball.<br><br>"It’s always difficult when you don’t speak the language. He hasn’t mastered that yet, he’s getting his lessons twice a week. It’s going to take time. Settling into Manchester United as a young boy does take time."<br><br>Sir Alex had three young boys from the reserve and academy ranks on the bench, with the afore-mentioned debutant Morrison being joined by unused subs Magnus Eikrem and Robbie Brady.<br><br>"They've been coming on really well this season. Last season Magnus was just a spindly little lad but he’s grown, he’s six foot one now and he’s getting stronger all the time. Robbie Brady has had a terrible time with injuries over the last two years but he had a good half-season last year and now he’s playing consistently, he’s getting better."<br><br><em>Sir Alex was speaking to MUTV and Sky Sports.
