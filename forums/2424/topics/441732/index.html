              <p>Manchester United striker <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/12724/Dimitar-Berbatov"><span style="color: #225fb2;">Dimitar Berbatov</span></a> is the latest player being targeted by newly-rich Russian side Anzhi Makhachkala, according to reports.</p>
              <p>Berbatov, 30, has played just five times for United this season after being left out of <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=30"><span style="color: #225fb2;">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></a>'s squad for last season's Champions League decider against Barcelona. The striker's agent, Emil Danchev, has now suggested the Russian club could make a £15 million bid for the Bulgarian during the January transfer window.</p>
              <p>"We would be interested when Anzhi make a concrete offer," Danchev told the <em>Mirror</em>. "We will sit down with Dimitar and ponder this. I don't know if Dimitar is happy in Manchester. He plays, then he just sits on the bench."</p>
              <p>Berbatov's contract with the reigning Premier League champions expires at the end of this season, adding to the possibility of United selling him in January. Anzhi, meanwhile, have signed the likes of Roberto Carlos, Yuri Zhirkov and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/11718/Samuel-Eto'o"><span style="color: #225fb2;">Samuel Eto'o</span></a> since being taken over by billionaire Suleyman Kerimov.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sell him I say. use the funds and fund a midfielder</p>

              <p><strong>Ferguson to keep Berbatov</strong></p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson has confirmed Manchester United are likely to activate a clause in Dimitar Berbatov's contract that will keep him at Old Trafford for another year.</p>
              <p>Berbatov, a £30.75 million record signing from Spurs, has found his appearances limited this season as both Javier Hernandez and Daniel Welbeck have forced their way into Ferguson's plans on a regular basis.</p>
              <p>This has led to speculation Ferguson may look to unload the 30-year-old during the January transfer window, with Russian side Anzhi looking to pounce. However, the United boss insists that will not happen.</p>
              <p>Instead it seems Ferguson is more likely to offer the additional year, which United have the unilateral option to do.</p>
              <p>''Dimitar is still in my thoughts,'' said Ferguson. ''I have read some things but there is absolutely no reason for me to let him go. He is an outstanding footballer and we will give the extra year.</p>
              <p>''It is unfortunate the form of Javier Hernandez over the last year has been outstanding but he (Berbatov) plays a great role and he trains well. He has no complaints. The boy is a great professional and we are happy for him to be here.</p>
              <p>''You need a good number of strikers in the modern day. If you look back to 1999, we had four great strikers. They all played their part. That is exactly what will happen today.''</p>
