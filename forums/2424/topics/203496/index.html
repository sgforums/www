If the referee includes the incidents in his report to the FA then both could receive suspensions.<br><br>The Reds were made to work for the win in the teamÂ’s toughest test so far in pre-season. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer capped off the win with UnitedÂ’s third before Pepe grabbed a late consolation. United earned six points for the victory at the Amsterdam Arena due to the competitionÂ’s scoring system, in which points are awarded for each goal scored.<br><br>United were forced into a change before the match had started, with Rio complaining of a sore ankle during the warm-up. John OÂ’Shea replaced him alongside Wes Brown in the centre of defence and performed well.<br><br>Porto began the game brightest, with 18-year-old midfielder Anderson dictating play in the middle of the park. But, after 11 minutes United took the lead. New signing Michael CarrickÂ’s corner found Scholes on the edge of the box. The in-form midfielder controlled the ball, feigned to shoot, shifted the ball onto his left foot and cracked his shot into the bottom corner. Porto keeper Helton didnÂ’t even move.<br><br>United were fortunate to be in front, but were even more fortunate after 19 minutes when Brown needlessly put van der Sar in trouble with a weak backpass. Only a sliding challenge from the Dutch goalkeeper prevented<br><br>A minute later, United doubled the lead thanks to Wayne RooneyÂ’s determination. He lost the ball but regained possession and raced through on goal. Helton went to ground early and Rooney delicately lifted the ball over the despairing keeperÂ’s reach.<br><br>PortoÂ’s approach play was impressive but, lacking presence up front, they lacked the finishing touch. Rooney continued to look lively, while Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ryan Giggs both had chances.<br><br>However, the game was tarnished on 41 minutes when Rooney was sent off. Rooney challenged Pepe for the ball in the air. His arm did catch the Porto defender, but a straight red card was harsh.<br><br>With only ten men, United began the second half in defensive mode and did well to keep Porto out. But the situation was exacerbated after 68 minutes when Paul Scholes, who had only moments before taken the captainÂ’s armband from the substituted Giggs, caught Quaresma from behind with a late challenge and was sent off.<br><br>Just as United were perhaps expecting a late barrage from their Portuguese opponents, the Reds scored their third courtesy of Solskjaer. The Norwegian forward weaved his way past Bosingwa and nutmegged the keeper with a fine finish.<br><br>Porto pulled a goal back on 76 Pepe, who had been involved in RooneyÂ’s sending off, hit an unstoppable shot past UnitedÂ’s substitute goalkeeper Ben Foster. The former Stoke keeper had early made a good save from AndersonÂ’s long-range effort. But he stood no chance as PepeÂ’s powerful nestled in the top corner.<br><br>Carrick was replaced by youngster Lee Martin after 77 minutes. He made a steady first appearance, but the two red cards ensured he was made to work hard in his first match back during pre-season.<br><br><strong>Team Line-ups<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">United: Van der Sar (Foster, 60), Bardsley, OÂ’Shea (Simpson, 59), Brown, Evra, Park (Fletcher, 73), Carrick (Martin, 77), Scholes, Giggs (Richardson, 67), Rooney, Solskjaer.<br>Subs not used: D.
