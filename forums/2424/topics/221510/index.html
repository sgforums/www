            <div class='col-md body'>i would rather Man Utd go for someone more proven then a player whom we have to gamble on, no offences to fans of Bent, but seriously he is not capable of holding on to a 1st 11 place in Man Utd (or at least not now) and if he dun why would we need him? think how would he be compared with players like Ronney or Saha?(our currently 1st 11 strikers) IMHO, he is at most on par to Saha (and thats already given him alot of credit) but might not have the potential to progress further to surpass Saha by alot, also SAF is probably going to retire soon maybe even against his will hence to get someone more proven and ready to jump into the 1st 11 while pushing Saha into reserves will certainly makes Man Utd a better team then they're currently is probably more important then to buy someone for the future, there used to be times when the world is fill with super good strikers but these days they seems to have flaten alot.. players like Totti, Owen, Fowler, Ronaldo, Raul, the Juv forward that knocks Roberto Baggio off his starting place and lots of others... but these days super strikers are far and few hence the more SAF should invest wisely, its either he get the right guy and bring Man Utd further forward or he'll run the risk of being sack even thou he is probably the most sucessful Manager in EPL History...<br><br>Just in my humble opinion!!!!! lets agreed to disagreed</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>as stated above, i agree that Darren Bent's potential is not fully realised yet - simply because he is in the wrong team.  If you don't have the correct team players to feed you the ball, its simply a waste.  And we all remembered last season when he was a prolific scorer for Charlton and ppl then was calling for him to be included in the England squad.<br><br>Bent is one player where his potential may not be discovered because he is not given the opportunity or the environment he is in is not condusive.  Saha, before he went to Man U was languishing in Fulham, no doubt he score goals for them (and Fulham having better players than Charlton - due in part to their rich owner).  After going over to man u, he shone.  Despite that, he was once down the pecking order behind RVN and Rooney.  I felt his breakthrough to the first team is down to more RVN losing his form towards end of last season.  Come Jan, should SAF signs a new striker, saha could find himself back to the benches again.<br><br>And credit to Alan Smith, last season (or season before last), when Man U was down on strikers, Alan Smith was the one banging in the goals.  And prior to his horror injury, SAF wanted to craft him into keane's mould, to be aggressive (Alan is aggressive already to begin with, look at the amount of cards he has collected).  I still believe Alan deserves to stay in Man U - his predicament today is due to his terrible injury.  He can play in the midfielder role - something like Scholes.<br><br>Moreover, Darren Bent has proven that he is good, just that he lacks the proper arena to show his talent.  I see no harm signing him, he is not going to be in the first 11 for sure, he can back them up, and give him two to three years, you never know.  Besides, he has premiership experience, he is not CL tied.  This will be a good buy.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Wasn't the latest striker to be linked to United Jermain Defoe?<br><br>Seriously, if given the chance, Bent can make it to be a top class striker. True, there may not be the time, but if SAF does get him, and he's thrown into the first team thru a lack of strikers, he might just perform beyond expectations.<br><br>As for Smith, i do believe that he's under-rated. He's played well wherever he's been asked to play, and while he does have the qualities to be a good midfielder in the mould of Keano, the very reason he even started in that role was because of a midfielder crisis. And he's done pretty well there to me. So lets give him some credit. He's unselfish, and willing to die for the team.</div>

He wanted to show his loyalty as SAF did during his injury at holland. But somehow he doesn't click with SAF.So end of story.<br><br>RVN has quality all over, but in this modern game, you do need extras.
