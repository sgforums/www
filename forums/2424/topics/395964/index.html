              <p>MANCHESTER (AFP) - – Manchester United have completed the signing of Mexico striker Javier Hernandez from Chivas.</p>
              <div class="content">
              <p>Hernandez, known as Chicharito, will join the English champions on July 1, provided he is granted a work permit, and the deal will involve United playing a pre-season friendly to open the new 45,000-capacity Chivas Stadium in Guadalajara.</p>
              <p>United boss Alex Ferguson, who has also secured the signing of Fulham defender Chris Smalling for next season, said he was delighted to sign, "an exciting young striker, who has been in such prolific form for both his club and his country.</p>
              <p>"He will be a great addition to our squad and we look forward to welcoming our first Mexican player in the summer.</p>
              <p>"We are equally excited to play our first game in Mexico, opening the magnificent new Chivas Stadium in July."</p>
              <p>Chicharito passed a medical in Manchester this week and has an impressive strike-rate at club level, scoring almost once every two games.</p>
              <p>However, he has done even better for his country, registering four goals in four appearances.</p>
              <p>If he makes his country's World Cup squad he could be in the Mexico squad for a pre-tournament friendly against England at Wembley on May 24.</p>

              <p><em>An introduction to United's 21-year-old strike acquisition Javier 'Chicharito' Hernandez...<br><br></em><strong>Where's he from?</strong><br>Hernandez currently plies his trade with Chivas de Guadalajara in Mexico's Primera Division. Chivas are the most successful team in Mexican history with 11 titles. Having been at the club since the age of nine, Javier scored within five minutes of making his first-team debut, in a 4-0 win over Necaxa in 2006, and helped his side win the title that season.</p>
              <p><strong>What's his record?</strong><br>Pretty impressive. He's scored 21 goals in 28 appearances for Chivas this term and has netted four times in as many games for Mexico. At 5ft 9in, he's not the biggest striker in the world, but he's quick and certainly knows his way to goal.</p>
              <p><strong>Where does his nickname come from?</strong><br>Javier is commonly known in his homeland as 'Chicharito', meaning 'little pea', in reference to his green eyes. He received the moniker as he's the son of Chivas legend Javier 'Chicharo' Hernandez, himself a top Mexican striker who played in the 1986 World Cup.</p>
              <p><strong>When can we see him in action for the Reds?</strong><br>Not until he has received a work permit. If that is granted, Javier will join United officially on 1 July and could make his debut in a pre-season friendly against Chivas in Guadalajara.</p>
              <p>Date of birth: 1 June 1988<br>Club: Chivas de Guadalajara<br>Debut: v Necaxas, 9 Sept 2006<br>2009/10 appearances: 28<br>2009/10 goals: 21</p>

              <p><strong>In an exclusive interview with MUTV, new signing Javier Hernandez, better known as 'Chicharito', labelled his move to Old Trafford "a dream come true"…<br><br>Firstly, Javier, how does it feel to have signed for United?</strong><br>It’s a dream and I feel so happy. I’ve really enjoyed my week in Manchester – the stadium, the atmosphere at the club and the history are incredible and I want to do great things here.<br><br><strong>You were at the Bayern game – what did you make of the experience?<br></strong>I felt a lot of things and, as I said, I’m living a dream. The atmosphere was incredible with all the fans singing. It was fantastic to see.<br><br><strong>What sort of player are you?</strong><br>I just like to enjoy myself. I want to win every day and I hope I can do great things.<br><br><strong>You’ve met Sir Alex – what were your impressions of the manager?</strong><br>He is a great person and probably the best coach of all time. All my impressions of the team, the club and the city are incredible.<br><br><strong>Your family must be very excited at the prospect of you playing for the Reds…</strong><br>Yes, they are. My family are my biggest supporters and have been there with me through the good and the bad times and they have supported me a lot, so they’re very pleased.<br><br><strong>United will play in Mexico this summer – what reception can the team expect?</strong><br>The best. In our country Manchester United are the top team and the reception they will get will be fabulous.</p>

              <p><strong>Manchester 
              United</strong><strong> have turned down the chance to sign David Villa, the Spain striker, 
              because of the financial restrictions placed upon Sir Alex Ferguson by the 
              club's ruling Glazer family.</strong></p>
              <p>Villa, one of the most revered forwards in the world 
              during five prolific years at <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Valencia" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/valencia">Valencia</a>, is to leave the 
              Mestalla in the summer and, after initially stating that he wanted to stay in 
              Spain and move to either Barcelona or Real Madrid, has changed his position with 
              information reaching United in the last few weeks that they are his preferred 
              destination.</p>
              <p>Ferguson is a long-time admirer of the 28-year-old but Valencia want around 
              £35m to £40m and United's position is that the fee will have to be lowered 
              otherwise it will be financially prohibitive at a time when the club has accrued 
              debts in excess of £700m. This is despite Ferguson's repeated insistence that 
              the balance from the £80m sale of Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid last summer 
              is available, United having already spent £20m.</p>
              <p>Instead, United responded to their eliminationfrom the Champions League by 
              announcing that they had agreed a deal with Chivas de Guadalajara to sign the 
              Mexico striker Javier Hernández, dependent on the 21-year-old gaining a work 
              permit.</p>
              <p>Hernández, also known as Chicharito or "Little Pea", has passed a medical and 
              becomes the seventh striker on United's payroll alongside Wayne Rooney, Michael 
              Owen, Dimitar Berbatov, Federico Macheda, Daniel Welbeck and Mame Biram Diouf. 
              However, his arrival for an undisclosed fee will do little to dispel growing 
              concerns among United supporters that Ferguson is being deprived of significant 
              transfer funds to bring in a player who can ease the level of dependence on 
              Rooney.</p>
              <p>Villa would have been one such man, second only to 
              Raúl in <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on La Liga" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/laligafootball">La Liga</a>'s list of 
              all-time scorers, and is so intrigued by the possibility of playing in the <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Premier League" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague">Premier League</a> he is 
              already taking English lessons. He has also spoken to Fernando Torres, his 
              international team-mate, about Liverpool but accepted they would not be able to 
              afford him. Villa thinks less favourably of Chelsea and Manchester City, the two 
              clubs who would have fewer problems matching the fee.</p>
              <p>As well as currently being out of United's price range, however, Villa does 
              not fit the Glazers' policy of avoiding spending large sums on players who are 
              26 or above and who would, in theory, have little resale value at the end of a 
              four- or five-year contract. The club made an exception for Dimitar Berbatov, 
              who was 27 when he signed from Tottenham Hotspur for £30.75m in September 2008, 
              but that transfer has been described by the chief executive, David Gill, as the 
              last of its kind.</p>
              <p>Hernández has scored 11 goals in Mexico's Primera División this season, 
              putting him joint third in the scoring charts, and has won four caps, scoring 
              against New Zealand, Bolivia and North Korea. As part of the deal, United will 
              play a friendly to open the new Chivas stadium in July.</p>
              <p>"I am delighted to reach agreement with Chivas to bring in such an exciting 
              young striker, who has been in such prolific form for both his club and his 
              country," Ferguson said. "He will be a great addition to our squad and we look 
              forward to welcoming our first Mexican player in the summer."</p>
              <p>"I feel like I am living a dream," Hernández told the club's television 
              station. "All the impressions I have of the club are good and Sir Alex Ferguson 
              is a great person, maybe the best coach in the world."</p>
              <p>The signing was announced as Wayne Rooney underwent further tests on the 
              ankle injury he aggravated during the Champions League quarter-final against 
              Bayern Munich on Wednesday. Rooney had initially been ruled out of the match and 
              is in danger of missing Sunday's game at Blackburn Rovers, but Ferguson said he 
              did not regret rushing him back.</p>
              <p>"I never force the medical staff into anything," he said. "It is important 
              they make the right decisions about players' fitness. And they made the right 
              decision. The medical staff did not see any problem."</p>
              <p>The Football Association has been monitoring the situation closely but, 
              despite Fabio Capello's obvious concerns about seeing his main striker limp off 
              for a second time in eight days, England's management team are said to 
              understand United's position and the reasons for playing Rooney. Capello and his 
              medical team had been aware since last weekend that there was a good chance 
              Rooney could play and that the injury was nothing like as serious as Ferguson 
              had portrayed when he ruled the player out for up to three weeks.</p>
              <p>After Wednesday's game Ferguson accused Bayern's players of deliberately 
              targeting Rooney and he was also angered by the way they had surrounded the 
              Italian referee, Nicola Rizzoli, to demand that Rafael da Silva be sent off for 
              a second bookable offence. United's manager described them as "typical Germans" 
              and the Bayern president, Uli Hoeness, condemned those comments yesterday.</p>
              <p>"When we lost the Champions League against Manchester United in 1999 we lost 
              like gentlemen," Hoeness said. "We were good and fair losers and I think that's 
              what Manchester should do now. It's an over-reaction on his part, maybe because 
              he is disappointed to lose. Normally he is a fine gentleman but I think what he 
              has said is not right."</p>

              <p><br>ya he was injured... but like the match vs BM... SAF should put him in rather than that cock man lah.... kiko is like rooney or other dangerous striker... everytime they in the box... u need to put 2 man on him.. that will mean someone else will be free up to shoot lor.... which is good for man utd case as they got alot of ppl that can shoot from everywhere</p>
