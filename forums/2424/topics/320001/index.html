              <h1><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Ronaldo: 'I Want To Go To Madrid'</strong></span></h1>
              <h2><strong>Cristiano Ronaldo has spoken out to <em>Terra</em> and apparently
              dropped the bombshell to Manchester United: he wants to play for Real
              Madrid, and seems to have urged the Spaniards to make a bid.</strong></h2>
              Speaking to the Brazilian website, Ronaldo apparently stopped hinting and explicitly stated his plans for the future.<br> <br> "Yes, I would like to play for Real Madrid," he allegedly said to <em>Terra.com.br</em>.<br> <br> "That's the truth, depending on what they are willing to spend on me and what Manchester United ask. But that's not up to me."<br> <br> Apparently
              speaking in calm, measured tones to interviewer Julio Gomes Filho,
              Ronaldo said his piece and then closed the subject for the time being.<br> <br> "I think I've put across an important message," he said.<br> <br> "As of today, I will speak no more about this with absolutely anyone. I'll only talk about it after the Euros.<br> <br> "Nobody is to ask me anymore, as I will not answer."<br> <br> These
              utterances, made in the tranquil surroundings of Portugal's Euro 2008
              training base in Neuchatel, will rock Manchester United's summer plans
              significantly.<br> <br> The Old Trafford side, who have slammed Real
              Madrid and the Spanish capital press for unsettling Ronaldo, have
              stated in no uncertain terms that they will do their utmost to hold
              onto their prize asset.<br> <br> Madrid, meanwhile, had previously
              pledged to break the bank for the goalscoring winger, although recent
              declarations about the difficult of signing Ronaldo have thrown such
              bravado into question. €80m could be the absolute bare minimum required.<br> <br> However,
              one must ask exactly in what context the Golden Shoe winner spoke, and
              whether or not he was definitely speaking about this present transfer
              window. Indeed, some pundits have already questioned the veracity of
              the interview.</blockquote>
              <p>Not very sure of how the paper managed to even talk to him coz of portugal camp's tight security, if its true, then GOODBYE AND GOOD RIDDANCE!</p>

              <p>Real Madrid CF dropped a bigger bomb on Old Trafford by offering C.Ronaldo £300,000/week after taxes. Lucrative.....he surely cannot turn this down. It's just strengthening the deal to be made in the very near future. All favors seem to be falling into the hands of the Santiago Bernabeu camp.</p>

              <p>Luiz Felipe Scolari spoke to C.Ronaldo at the Portuguese training camp. This is what he exactly said. "We have been talking alot, as i have been an older friend(towards Ron) and have given him some advice. Football does not live off memories, football is opportunities and sometimes if we do not take them, they won't come again."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Clearly his telling Ronaldo to move on to Real Madrid and leave Man United behind. It's quite some strong advice and as Luiz being the national coach of Portugal, this young lad will more likely follow up the advice given by his coach. Au Revoir Man United.</p>

              <h1>Another Twist As Mum Now Says Ronaldo Will Stay</h1>
              <p>The Portuguese ace has been heavily tipped for a move to the Spanish
              champions, with Ramón Calderón seeming capable of just everything to
              lure him into his ranks.<br><br>The former Sporting player said today
              that he would like to play for Real Madrid as long as the Merengues
              were willing to offer  him and Manchester United what has been reported
              for the past weeks.<br><br>However, Ronaldo's mother - who famously
              backed a move to Madrid in the past - seems to have put an end to this
              endless saga by affirming that his son will not leave the British
              outfit.<br><br>"He is fine where he is. Only God knows the future, but
              it's certain that he will continue in Manchester," Dolores Aveiro told
              TV station TVI.<br><br>With Manchester United uninterested in selling
              their star, who is currently in Switzerland with the Portuguese
              national squad, chances are that Cristiano Ronaldo will wear the Red
              Devils' shirt at least one more year.</p>

              </strong>Real Madrid president Ramon Calderon has claimed it is an 'honour' that Cristiano Ronaldo reportedly wants to join the Spanish giants from Manchester United.<p></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ronaldo, who has long been a transfer target of the La Liga champions, was quoted as telling Brazilian website Terra yesterday that he would like to move to Madrid if they were willing to pay what United demand.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Calderon appeared recently to concede defeat in his chase of the Portugal star, admitting it 'seems impossible' that they could land the 23-year-old, but Ronaldo`s latest comments will have given fresh encouragement.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ronaldo said: 'I would like to play for Real Madrid - but only if it is true they are ready to pay what Manchester United ask of them. However, it does not depend on me.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And a delighted Calderon responded in Spanish newspaper <em>AS</em>: 'For Madrid it is an honour to know that a player like him thinks that playing at Real Madrid would be good.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><span> Cristiano Ronaldo has delivered an amazing snub to his Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, it has been revealed.</span></p>
              <p><span> 
              <table style="height: 8px;" border="0" width="6" align="right">

              </tbody>
              </table>
              <em>The Times</em> says in an embarrassing snub, Ronaldo has told
              team-mates that Ferguson is not welcome in Switzerland, bringing a
              premature end to proposals for peace talks that surfaced in the light
              of his continued flirtation with Real Madrid.</span></p>
              <p><span>Ronaldo's decision comes after Ferguson's
              comments last weekend that the Glazer family would rather see him sit
              in the stands than sell him to Real. </span></p>
              <p><span>Ronaldo is understood to be furious at this
              perceived slight, but Ferguson was merely responding to the player's
              frequent expressions of admiration for Real. </span></p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Why would Ronny want to leave?</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong>Speculation continues to cloud Cristiano Ronaldo's future at
              Old Trafford, but former Reds no.7 Bryan Robson is crystal clear in his
              message to the Portuguese star: Stay at United.</strong><br><br>Robson
              can't understand the logic in a move away from the current Premier
              League and Champions League winners and says success in the immediate
              future is far more likely at Old Trafford than it is at the Bernabeu. <br><br>"I
              can't see much of a temptation to go to Real," the United legend said.
              "He is playing fantastic football and is admired by all the fans,
              players and coaching staff.<br><br>"He's on a massive contract so I don't see any reason to move to Real. How did they do in the Champions League last year?<br><br>"He's
              got everything he wants at United. They are a young team and could go
              on to be successful for years. I don't see why he should leave," he
              told the <em>Manchester Evening News</em>.<br><br>Robson, who recently took on an ambassadorial role at the club, knows the temptations that exist being a sought-after player.<br><br>"I
              went through the same thing," Robbo revealed. "Juventus and Sampdoria
              offered me a lot more money, but I was happy at United. This club is
              massive.<br><br>"Once they told me they wanted me to stay, that was all
              I needed to hear. If he weighs everything up, then why move if he is
              happy where he is? Money isn't everything."</p>
