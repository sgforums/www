There are many hurdles to be navigated in the run-in.<br><br>"To win the league, you have to have great consistency, particularly around March and April. Historically, we have done okay at that time of the year.<br><br>"All championship races are difficult, but the real test comes on the run-in when any mistake can cost you everything.<br><br>"That will be the test for us.
