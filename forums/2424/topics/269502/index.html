            <div class='col-md body'><strong>DAVID GILL has warned Chelsea they are wasting their time trying to match Manchester United's global appeal and 75 million-strong worldwide fan base.</strong><br><br>Despite Chelsea's plan for world domination and attempts to crack the US market, Gill claimed the fervent support for United on their current pre-season tour of Asia proves Sir Alex Ferguson's side remain the biggest box office draw.<br><br>United won the second game of their tour last night, beating FC Seoul 4-0. All 68,000 tickets for the match sold out with in six hours, while a staggering 750,000 of football-mad South Koreans are said to have a United credit card.<br><br>And with research claiming 50 per cent of South Korea's 49m population support United, Old Trafford chief executive Gill claimed it all proves they are still way ahead of Chelsea in terms of their ability to corner the key markets around the world.<br><br>"Chelsea have been having a great time in America the last few years, which is fine," said Gill. "We do what's right for us and we're comfortable with the opportunities with our history, our ground, our heritage and the way we play. Those are key assets for us.<br><br>"Is America ever going to be as passionate as the Asian market? I wouldn't have thought so. We had a good tour in America in 2003, but clearly there were issues in 2004, when we didn't take a full squad because of the European Championship.<br><br>"How we organise these tours is clearly related to the preparation of the team. That's a key factor. We also look at the commercial aspects and then make a final decision on where we go."<br><br>Of United's 75m fans around the world, 40.7m are in Asia, while only 4.6m are based in the US and Latin America, proof that the Far East is the most lucrative football market.<br><br>United boss Fergie said: "We consider ourselves a global brand, a club that is prepared to travel anywhere to promote our image and that of the game.<br><br>"Our hotel has been crowded with our fans, which doesn't surprise me. It's incredible the support we have over here and it's a phenomena we can create in certain parts of the world.<br><br>"There is so much respect and affection for our club in the Far East, so it's important for us to embrace that and visit these places."<br><br>Gill added: "We have amazing support in Asia. But I think Africa is an interesting area as well. There's clearly a great following for the Premier League in Africa. There's a lot of money in Nigeria, for example.<br><br>"The new TV rights for the Premier League in Nigeria have increased significantly for the upcoming years."<br><br>There's a huge following for English football in Nigeria, and as more African players come to England to play, you can see that getting bigger."<br><br>Gill revealed United, who have signed a Â£5m sponsorship deal with Korean company Kumho Tires, will take their pre-season tour to South Africa for the second time next year.<br><br>United's next game is against Shenzen FC in Macau on Monday, with Owen Hargreaves and Nani expected to have recovered from injury to make their debuts.</div>

The Premiership champions' own research also claims half of the country support United.</strong><br><br>With a similar stranglehold assured in Japan, Malaysia, Thailand and China, United are confident they have done enough in recent years to keep the burgeoning financial forces of Real Madrid and Chelsea at bay.<br><br>Even communist North Korea was not ruled out by Sir Alex Ferguson yesterday as a possible place to tour.<br><br>"The club are prepared to travel anywhere to promote our image and the game," he said. "North Korea would not be a problem, should the right conditions apply.<br><br>"I understand we have an enormous number of fans in Vietnam.
