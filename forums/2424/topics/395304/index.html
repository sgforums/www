              <p class="art-txt-first">Martin O'Neill insists there was no bust-up with Aston Villa owner Randy Lerner over reports that James Milner was to join Manchester United.</p>
              <p>And, while there has been speculation over his own future, O'Neill is also adamant that Lerner is not set to quit the midlands club.</p>
              <p>O'Neill said: "There was a story that I had fallen out with the chairman because of a supposedly imminent transfer of James Milner to Manchester United.</p>
              <p>"James would be worthy of playing in a side like that. I wouldn't think for one minute that top clubs wouldn't be interested in James Milner.</p>
              <p>"He has been splendid for us this season but there is not one ounce of truth in the story. It is ludicrous."</p>
              <p>O'Neill has spent a net £80million on new players in his four years at Villa.</p>
              <p>He believes those players have increased significantly in value should Lerner ever decide he wants to leave Villa.</p>
              <p>But O'Neill is confident that is far from the case with Lerner who also owns NFL side Cleveland Browns.</p>
              <p>He said: "Since I arrived here four years ago, I've invested £80 million of the chairman's money and if he wanted to sell some of those assets - which he has not intimated at all - he would get that money back, and with a bit of interest as well.</p>
              <p>"If you wanted to let four or five of the top quality players leave this club, you would get your money back but that has not been Randy's notion and I think he is trying to think about improving Villa Park as well.</p>
              <p>"I don't think he is ready to walk away or worry himself unduly about his investment at all because he knows it is there on the pitch. We have a number of top quality players at this club."</p>

              <p class="art-txt-first">TEAMtalk's Simon Wilkes thinks Sir Alex Ferguson needs to put Benfica winger Angel Di Maria at the top of his shopping list this summer.</p>
              <p>It appears Ferguson is going to stick around for another one, maybe two seasons after the end of this campaign.</p>
              <p>He is desperate to win a 19th league title for Manchester United and is also keen to get his hands on the Champions League trophy for a third time.</p>
              <p>Veteran trio Gary Neville, Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs all started against Chelsea at Old Trafford on Saturday - but this season needs to be their final hurrah in terms of regular action, meaning Ferguson needs to do some wheeling and dealing this summer in order to leave a lasting legacy for whoever has the nuts to fill the Scot's boots in the United hot-seat.</p>
              <p>I think Ferguson's number-one transfer target should be Di Maria, who put on a dazzling display against Rafa Benitez's Liverpool troops in Benfica's 2-1 Europa League win in midweek.</p>
              <p>The 22-year-old Argentinian was simply unplayable and ran the Reds defenders ragged.</p>
              <p>He has long been linked with a move to Old Trafford or Stamford Bridge, but Sir Alex should bust a gut to beat the Blues to his signature, as he could be the perfect replacement for the Rolls Royce that is Giggs on the left flank.</p>
              <p>With Antonio Valencia having made the right-sided role his own this season, and Nani able to play adeptly on both flanks, Di Maria's arrival would sort United's wide options for many seasons to come.</p>
