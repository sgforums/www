              <p>Manchester United launch their bid to secure a hat-trick of Premier
              League titles this weekend. And manager Sir Alex Ferguson is confident
              about his team’s chances and unfazed by rivals Chelsea’s taunts that
              they have already peaked.</p>
              <p>Ferguson says his players are ready to prove, starting against
              Newcastle at Old Trafford on Sunday, that they do have more gears to
              move up to.<br><br>"That is a challenge for us," he told the Manchester Evening News.</p>
              <p>"With the young players we have like Anderson, Ronaldo, Rooney, Nani
              there is improvement there. Our players have the capacity to improve.
              So we'll see.<br><br>"I am optimistic because I see no deterioration.
              We have to protect the dinosaurs a little bit more - Giggs, Scholes and
              Gary Neville - but they are fit guys. <br><br>"Giggs' endurance tests
              were the best in the club this summer. Unbelievable. He will play a lot
              of games for us. He is lucky because he has never carried any weight.
              He has always looked after himself.<br><br>"Scholes and Neville are
              much the same. There's a lot of football left in them. Edwin van der
              Sar is the normal van der Sar. He is looking fantastic for his age and
              he is a great example of how to look after yourself and give yourself
              extra years.</p>
              <p>“I am expecting a natural progression from the younger ones. It is the same as what I said about Rooney and Ronaldo last season.<br><br>"A year ago I was asked if Ronaldo could score more than 23 goals and I replied that I was looking for improvement.<br><br>"Improvement
              can come in different ways for Ronaldo this season. Forty-two goals is
              a target, it is still possible for him to achieve it given the talent
              of the boy and his goal-scoring ability but you have to say it's a big
              target for him.<br><br>"Where you will see the improvement is in his
              authority and decision-making which comes with experience, which gives
              you a lot of things, timing especially." <br><br>Ferguson added of Ronaldo, who is recovering from ankle surgery but expected to return to action ahead of schedule: <br><br>"There has been no problem at all. His progress has been great, he has never missed a session, morning or afternoon.<br><br>"He has been doing excellent. He is well ahead of schedule."</p>
