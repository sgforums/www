              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Eto'o: We are now favourites.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>SAMUEL ETO'O insists Barcelona have one foot in the Champions League final after last night's goalless draw with Manchester United. Cristiano Ronaldo's second-minute penalty miss meant United left the Nou Camp without a vital away goal. And Cameroon hitman Eto'o believes Barca are now the clear favourites to progress.</strong></p>
              <p class="article">He said: "I really think that if we go to Manchester and play like this then there is absolutely no reason why we shouldn't go through. "It's not an easy task to be the home side when you have drawn 0-0 away from home in the first leg of a knockout tie. "There's no real problem with our goalscoring and I say that because we continue to create chances. "I'd predict that we are capable of scoring in any away match no matter who it's against.</p>
              <p class="article">"When you have a team like ours which plays such good football and has so many different guys capable of scoring then the ball will eventually go in. "If we play at our true level then there are very few sides in the world who are capable of living with us. "Although I'm not disappointed that we didn't score because there are goals in this team, right throughout the side."</p>
              <p class="article">Midfielder Xavi reckons Barca deserved to win last night's semi-final first-leg. The Spanish ace said: "The only thing missing was the goal and that leaves a bitter taste in the mouth. "We dominated the 90 minutes. We are happy with the image we gave, but not the result. "This team is capable of going to any ground and winning, so I have no doubt we can make the final."</p>
              <p class="article">Argentine defender Gabriel Milito added: "The result is unfair because we deserved to win. "But it is not a bad result and there are still 90 minutes left in the tie. "We have had some bad luck. We have created some very good chances in the last few games, so I don't think we should worry.</p>
              <p class="article">"The important thing is that we are creating chances and hopefully our luck will change soon. "There is still a long way to go in this tie. "We will play next week's game as if it were a final and I think we have a great chance of getting through."</p>

              <p>Lord Wrigley now has the straightforward task of winning the next four games to realise the double.  Straightforward but fraught with difficulties.  It would be harsh if he ends up with no silverware this season but based on Chelsea's form, I wouldn't discount that possibility.</p>

              <h1>Gudjohnsen: We Need To Watch Scholes</h1>
              <h2>Barcelona forward Eidur Gudjohnsen has hailed Manchester United’s
              Paul Scholes as the dangerman, rather that Cristiano Ronaldo ahead of
              their Champions League semi final second leg at Old Trafford.</h2>
              <p>The Icelandic international claims too much is being made of the
              head-to-head battle between the so-called two best players in the
              world, Ronaldo and Lionel Messi.</p>
              <p>“It’s not about these two players” Gudjohnsen told the Sunday
              Mirror.  “If it was we could put them in a boxing ring at let them
              fight it out.</p>
              <p>“I'm more of an admirer of Paul Scholes than I am of Ronaldo.
               Ronaldo is a fantastic player but he has 10 other great players around
              him each week.  </p>
              <p>“Scholes is one of the most complete footballers I've ever seen.
               His one-touch play is phenomenal.  Whenever I have played against him
              I never felt I could get close to him.”  </p>
              <p>29 year old Gudjohnsen has first hand experience of Scholes and his
              United team mates from his time in England with Chelsea and will be
              advising coach Frank Rijkaard not to spend too much time thinking just
              about Ronaldo.  </p>
              <p>“Of course players like Ronaldo and Messi can change a game with one bit of skill” he explained.   </p>
              <p>“But there's a lot of hysteria about them and the tie will be all
              about which of us plays better as a team.  That is why Scholes and Ryan
              Giggs are both very influential.  When I was in England I watched them
              closely and I saw that what they both do for United is phenomenal.”  </p>

              <p><strong>Deco: Reds fear away goal</strong></p>
              <div class="newsStory">
              <p><strong>Deco feels United will be fearful of Barcelona's attacking capabilities in Tuesday's Champions League semi-final settler at Old Trafford.</strong></p>
              <p>A goalless draw in last week's first leg in the Nou Camp means United's aim is simple - win in Manchester. Conversely, Barca know a scoring draw will be enough to take them to Moscow next month.</p>
              <p>While the Catalans' form has been far from inspirational, their unquestioned attacking thrust will have nerves jangling in Sir Alex Ferguson's side, according to Barca's Portuguese playmaker.</p>
              <p>"The fear is with them now," Deco is quoted as saying in the <em>News of the World</em>. "They know if they concede at home they will have to score twice to win the semi-final. I'm optimistic."</p>
              <p>United are widely tipped to adopt a more offensive strategy than in last week's first leg, and Deco is confident that Barca star Lionel Messi will revel in the extra space he will subsequently be afforded.</p>
              <p>"In the first leg Messi had a lot of players on top of him when he received the ball, but he still caused problems," said Deco. "Now they have to attack us more and they will not be able to concentrate so much on covering Messi.</p>
              <p>"When I saw that Tevez, Rooney and Ronaldo were all starting on Wednesday, I thought they would pressure us high up the pitch. But they defended quite deep and can't do that at home."</p>

              <p><strong>Doubts remain over Reds duo</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson will wait until the final moment before deciding whether his injured warriors Wayne Rooney and Nemanja Vidic can face Barcelona.<br></strong><br>Both players were substituted during Saturday's defeat at Chelsea and there is concern that Tuesday night will come too soon for the pair as they recover from facial (Vidic) and hip problems (Rooney).<br><br>"Obviously for such an important game, we’ve got to give them every chance," said Sir Alex, at Monday's pre-match press conference.<br><br>"Nemanja didn’t train yesterday or today, neither did Wayne. It’s a difficult one. We think both could make it but I can’t be dead certain.”<br><br>What does seem certain is that Cristiano Ronaldo will return to the starting line-up, fresh from being a sub on Saturday and being crowned PFA Player of the Year on Sunday. <br><br>Patrice Evra could also come back in, despite being one booking away from missing the final. Mikael Silvestre performed impressively in his absence at left-back but has only just returned to the fold after a lengthy spell out with injury.</p>

              <p>our form is hard to gauge at the moment... the key is if we concede do we hav the will to recover from it. somehow i feel that we would lose by a single goal or  by the away goal. i hope i am proven wrong!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="icon_evil.gif"></p>
