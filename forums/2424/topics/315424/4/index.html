              <p>Glory Glory Man United! I think MOTM should be Scholes. He deserves it.</p>
              <p>Hmmm.. actually Brown played well in  CB as replacement for Vidic. Hargo was solid, Evra &amp; Park provided good threats when marauding down the left flank. </p>
              <p>Tevez is as hardworking as usual.</p>
              <p>But the second half was really risky when Fergie decided to close shop. I thought we should go out to score the 2nd goal and kill off the game.</p>

              <p>yep, if vidic and rooney are back, then the finals will be good..</p>
              <p>Park for me, did well, he tracked back and his energy was immense. I was surprised at Tevez, he was a terrier..</p>
              <p>Ronaldo for me, tried to do too much..</p>
              <p>Can anyone count the touches made by Giggs? I reckon he going to get a blasting by the UK Fans again.</p>
              <p>Rio was simply majestic.</p>

It was last updated at 00:11 on April 30 2008.</div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Stubbornness more than style ensured that
              Manchester United are bound for Moscow, where they will seek to raise
              the European Cup a third time, in a final against either Chelsea or
              Liverpool on May 21. On this evidence it will be hard to deny Sir Alex
              Ferguson's team and the players must have shed any misgivings about
              their readiness to retain the Premier League title as well.</p>
              <p>This
              was not the type of spectacle associated with Old Trafford. United's
              great virtue here and at Camp Nou has been the capacity to thwart
              Barcelona and secure clean sheets. The outstanding players in this win
              were the left-back Patrice Evra, carried off in stoppage time, and the
              centre-half Wes Brown. The captain, Rio Ferdinand, was nearly as
              unyielding.</p>
              <p>A place on the roll of honour must also be made for
              Paul Scholes. The veteran, rested for the defeat at Stamford Bridge on
              Saturday, notched the only goal of this tie from 25 yards in the 14th
              minute. There was all too much time left, with the crowd reduced to
              sighing over the absence of the injured defender Nemanja Vidic even
              more than that of Wayne Rooney, who is still troubled by the blow to
              his hip he suffered 11 days ago.</p>
              <p>This success is the sign of true
              substance. With their verve diminished, the side drew on their
              hardiness. It is difficult to say whether spectators or players were
              the more agonised as added time ran to six minutes because of Evra's
              injury. The action had been excruciating earlier, too, when, the
              substitute Thierry Henry connected with a corner, only to head it into
              the grasp of Edwin van der Sar.</p>
              <p>Admiration for Barcelona's purist
              football has to be qualified by the recognition that they were largely
              innocuous over the three hours of the tie. Evra was outstanding in the
              key task of containing Lionel Messi, the single Barcelona player
              untouched by the decline at the club as the Frank Rijkaard era comes to
              its end.</p>
              <p>For all that, the semi-final would have been a stalemate
              but for Scholes. The midfielder was suspended for the triumph over
              Bayern Munich in the 1999 final and time is racing away from him.
              Having been taken off, he still appeared exhausted when joining the
              celebrations at the end. Nonetheless United will dread the day when the
              33-year-old retires.</p>
              <p>There was no sentiment in Fabio Capello's
              efforts to talk him into returning for England either. The Italian will
              have appreciated his talent all over again. When Gianluca Zambrotta
              mis-hit a clearance in panic he met with the worst fate as the ball ran
              to Scholes. The handsome finish went high past the left hand of Víctor
              Valdés.</p>
              <p>Scholes, so renowned as a predator, had scored for the
              first time since striking at Portsmouth in August. Nowadays he tends to
              be placed in the deeper positions appropriate to a personage of such
              seniority. Many United players were to find themselves packed in and
              around their own penalty area. The sight horrifies spectators
              conditioned to expect that their team will be the one in the ascendant.
              The volume rose, with the crowd praying a wall of noise would block
              Barcelona.</p>
              <p>Ferguson himself had accepted that the semi-final
              would have this character. He is too experienced not to see the
              weariness in his side's ranks or to anticipate the desperate eagerness
              of Barcelona. Over the matches the United manager has put the accent on
              defence. A pair of clean sheets were achieved entirely by design.</p>
              <p>There
              was interest elsewhere and, if Park Ji-sung did not tear Rijkaard's
              line-up apart, he was a constant nuisance. United's durability and
              endeavour here went a long way towards vindicating Ferguson's decision
              to rest Scholes and others at Chelsea. The Premier League is still
              United's to lose but the club had no such leeway in the Champions
              League.</p>
              <p>Worse still, there was the trepidation that besets those
              with recollections of sorrow at this phase of the tournament. When
              Henry Ford said "History is bunk" he wanted to emphasise that all that
              matters is whatever comes next. Managers know that and Ferguson has
              special cause to agree fervently. He had, after all, been beaten in
              three out of his previous four appearances in the semi-finals.</p>
              <p>Now
              the manager can dwell on a 12th consecutive home victory in the
              competition. That target was met because Barcelona, for all their
              slickness, are disintegrating. Samuel Eto'o, to take one case history,
              is a woebegone character in futile search of the predatory skills he
              has mislaid.</p>
              <p>United, circumspect as they were, had a sharper
              edge. Cries for penalties went unheard as the visitors reeled following
              the interval. Eric Abidal just beat Nani to a Ronaldo cross and Valdés
              had to parry one strong attempt from Carlos Tevez. United may have been
              peeved not to have doubled their advantage but at least Barcelona were
              pegged back.</p>
              <p>That could not last and in the 64th minute a Deco
              free-kick was deflected wide. This was no Premier League saunter.
              United could not contain even a failing Barcelona on every occasion and
              it was telling that Ronaldo should be cautioned for a foul on Zambrotta
              committed well inside the opposition's half.</p>
              <p>Yaya Touré was no
              calmer when he slid into Park and collected a yellow card that would
              have kept him out of the final. Deep down he must have had the bitter
              consolation of knowing that no Barcelona player would be in Moscow. A
              resolute United simply would not allow it.</p>

              <h1>United boss Ferguson: Scholes will be the first name on my team-sheet in Moscow</h1>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/05_01/scholesgoalv2AH_468x281.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Screamer: Scholes lets rip after 14 minutes to open the scoring in spectacular style</span></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Paul Scholes will play in a Champions League Final at last after his wonder goal gave Manchester United a sensational victory over Barcelona. Scholes missed the 1999 Final triumph over Bayern Munich at the Nou Camp after picking up a booking in the semi-final at Juventus.</strong></p>
              <p>But last night the 33-year-old midfielder smashed home a 25-yard shot in the 14th minute at Old Trafford to make sure that Sir Alex Ferguson's team will be on the plane to Moscow. United will now go on to contest the first ever all-English Champions League Final on May 21 against the winner of the other semi-final between Liverpool and Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>Ferguson said: "We are all delighted. It is especially pleasing for Paul Scholes and he will be the first name on my team-sheet for the Final. "It was a fantastic goal. We can't expect him to score 14 or 15 a season like he used to, simply because he is getting older. He has delivered a goal at a crucial time for us because we were getting nervous in the early stages."</p>
              <p>Scholes had only scored one goal this season before last night but his brilliant strike put Barcelona on the back foot after the 0-0 draw in Spain last week and Frank Rijkaard's multi-talented team could not find a way through. United midfielder Michael Carrick said: "We see goals from Paul Scholes like that all the time in training but he saved one of his very best for the big occasion. "It was an awesome strike and there are some very happy players in our dressing-room. We had put so much pressure on ourselves to achieve and I suppose we just feel relieved now. "To play in the Final, whoever it is against, will be something special. We always back ourselves to topple any team we play."</p>
              <p>United captain Rio Ferdinand also paid to tribute to Scholes and the crowd, saying: "You can't put this into words. The fans played their part and backed us the whole way and we dug deep. Then there was a moment of quality from a fantastic player. Paul Scholes — what a goal. A great time to get one."</p>
              <p>United began the game nervously and came close to conceding a penalty in the first minute when Scholes brought down Lionel Messi inches outside the area.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Scholes celebrates his wonder goal</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With United missing the injured Wayne Rooney and Nemanja Vidic, it was always going to be a tough night. Barcelona dominated for long periods but never really threatened Edwin van der Sar's goal.</p>
              <p>Ferguson will travel to London tonight to watch the other semi, which is poised at 1-1 after the first leg at Anfield last week. Asked if a United-Liverpool Final would be the most attractive fixture, Ferguson said: "Well that's a good point and it would certainly be a great Final, wouldn't it? But I don't' really mind who we play as we are just delighted to be in the Final.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Perhaps if it's Liverpool we will get more tickets for our fans, because if it is Chelsea, I think Roman Abramovich will buy them all!</span> <img src="http://sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>"We needed a fantastic performance tonight and we got one. We knew it would be a long night because we were playing against a fantastic club and a great team. "Several things won us the game, including our concentration. We protected our space really well and I think we could have scored three or four goals.</p>
              <p>"In the first half I thought we were too nervous but in the second period we played with some conviction, confidence and belief. "Towards the end of the game I knew it would be tight. If you are 1-0 down then you always have a go and that is what Barcelona did. They had a good spell towards the end and we were hanging on.</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/05_01/084fergieceleDM_468x481.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The United bench start the party at the final whistle.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"But we are there now and that's important. The Final will look after itself when it comes around but I really think we deserve to be there. Our performances throughout the competition have been fantastic. We have shown great discipline and tactically we have been very good."</p>
              <p>United will contest the club's third European Cup Final, 50 years after Sir Matt Busby's first great team perished in the Munich air disaster of 1958 on their way back from a securing a place in that year's semi-finals. Asked if it would be more special to win it this year, Ferguson said: "Fate is fate and hopefully it turns out right. But the most important thing is to be in the Final."</p>
              <p>The loss added to Barcelona's disappointment this season, having already been eliminated from the Spanish championship, but Rijkaard does not think it is time to step down. "No. That thought has not entered my head," said the Dutchman, who has been linked with a move to Chelsea. "I have no intention of leaving. The players are very down, sad and disappointed. But it's easy to kick people when they are down. Instead they need help and support. I am proud of the fact that they gave everything tonight. "We did everything but score. It was an even game. If anything we possibly had the better of the play but we did not score."</p>
              <p>United now turn their attention to a vital Barclays Premier League fixture at home to West Ham on Saturday and hope Rooney will be fit for the first of two games they must win if they are to retain their title. Ferguson added: "Hopefully this result will bring the best out of us and it certainly won't do us any harm. It will give us confidence. I hope the supporters will be as good as they were tonight on Saturday."</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #008000;">Flash of vintage Scholes sends United back into dreamland</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Tuesday, 29 April 2008</span>  </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Goals:</strong> <span style="color: #ff0000;">Scholes 14.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u189/zomanu/mosco_478588a.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="first"><strong>Paul Scholes' spectacular strike sent Manchester United into their first Champions League final for nine years on a night of Old Trafford tension.</strong> <strong>Scholes rifled in a spectacular 25-yard effort after 14 minutes to beat Barcelona and set up an all-English clash with Chelsea or Liverpool</strong><strong> in Moscow on 21 May.</strong> </p>
              <p>There was added poignancy and significance in the victory, coming 50 years after the Munich air crash. And for Scholes, suspended for the 1999 final victory against Bayern Munich in Barcelona, it is a chance to make up for that bitter disappointment. United were dealt a double blow before kick-off when Wayne Rooney's hip injury ruled him out and Nemanja Vidic was sidelined by the concussion he sustained at Chelsea.</p>
              <p>And United almost made a nightmare start when Scholes tripped Lionel Messi as he raced into the area - there was only inches in it and fortunately for the home side German referee Herbert Fandel got the big call right and gave a free-kick. It took United time to settle, but Scholes eased their nerves with a thunderous strike to give them the lead in the 14th minute.</p>
              <p>Gianluca Zambrotta's wayward clearance landed at Scholes' feet, and he delivered a trademark rising drive from 25 yards that flew high into the net beyond the outstretched hands of Barcelona keeper Victor Valdes. It was only the second goal Scholes has scored this season - but it was a fitting strike to send United to the final.</p>
              <p>Messi was the real danger man for Barcelona, and he ended a slalom run with a left-foot shot that was turned away by United keeper Edwin van der Sar. United had chances of their own, with Ji-Sung Park side-footing just wide, but Barcelona regained their composure to enjoy a period of superiority, with Deco twice narrowly off target.</p>
              <p>Nani, preferred to Ryan Giggs, wasted a chance to grab the priceless second goal three minutes before the interval when he glanced Park's cross wide from eight yards. Barcelona began the second half with a spell of possession, but it was United who carved out a clear opportunity as Valdes blocked Tevez's close-range drive after 56 minutes.</p>
              <p>The Catalans made a change on the hour, sending on former Arsenal striker Thierry Henry for Andres Iniesta. Barcelona, inspired by the brilliant Messi, had United penned back, but they were resisted by defensive discipline and resilience of the highest class from a side normally noted for their attacking verve.</p>
              <p>United attempted to stem the tide with 13 minutes left by making a double change, with Ryan Giggs and Darren Fletcher replacing Nani and Scholes. Henry almost returned to haunt United with a point-blank header from from Xavi's corner which was gratefully clutched by Van der Sar.</p>
              <p>Barcelona weaved pretty patterns in the closing stages, but United's defence - superbly marshalled by Rio Ferdinand and Wes Brown - stood firm to spark wild scenes of celebration at the final whistle.</p>

              <p>Actually in the whole match, Vds only had one saved to make it it? From Messi.</p>
              <p>The rest all like not on target type... United had more chances with Nani, Tevez, Park, and Ronny's head back...</p>

              <p>actually my heart stopped, when I see henry heading the ball during the last corner, but kudos to OwenH for following Henry all the way, if not, gone.</p>
              <p><br>One thing, I did not hear the half time talk by the ex-Mys commentators, but I think he said MUFC will lose. Can anyone confirmed?</p>
              <p>just why do we need him? why can't we have some one from ex-Singapore Team?</p>
