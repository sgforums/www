Instinctive goal poacher who's sort of a mix of Pippo Inzaghi and RVN. Would likely be expensive and might resist a move away, especially since Ajax were just pipped to the title by PSV on the last day by goal difference.<br><br>I'd like Afonso Alves as always, tall, strong, with good movement and he's a dead-ball specialist in the mould of Juninho Pernambucano. I believe he'd suit United as of the times I've seen him, he's always passing and moving,the United way. The lure of European football from United might be too tempting to resist.</div>

Also, if he fufills his potential, he's likely to be an England regular, and with Rooney a regular in the striking department, any extra time spent playing together at such a high-level is always good for United.<br><br>Only thing is that he's unproven so he's a risk. Fergie might want more proven players in that field, so it might be unlikely that he'll come. Still, as always, we'll see.</div>
