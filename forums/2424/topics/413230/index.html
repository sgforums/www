              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Manchester United</strong><strong> are monitoring </strong><strong>Werder Bremen</strong><strong> star </strong><strong>Per Mertesacker</strong></span><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> as they look to add more quality to their defence, Goal.com UK can reveal.<br></span></strong><br>The German club and Mertesacker’s representatives are aware of Sir Alex Ferguson's interest but the Scot is likely to wait until next summer before making his move.<br><br>Mertesacker was heavily linked with a £10 million switch to Arsenal over the summer after a series of excellent performances for Germany at the World Cup.<br><br>The 26-year-old was happy to stay at the Weserstadion despite the interest from north London, but it is understood that he would find it hard to turn down a move to Old Trafford.<br><br>Mertesacker’s contract expires in 2012 and gives United leverage in any transfer negotiations over the highly-rated 6ft 5in defender, although Ferguson has been made aware he is very unlikely to get his man in January.<br><br>The Scot wants to add more quality to his central defensive options because of Rio Ferdinand’s persistent injury problems and Chris Smalling’s inexperience at the highest level.<br><br>“Ferguson has been interested in Mertesacker for some time and he is certainly flattered by the interest,” a source close to the deal told Goal “He loves Bremen but Manchester United is one of those clubs that, if they want you, you have to listen.”<br><br>Mertesacker intends to stay at Bremen until next summer but will assess his options at the end of the season, with sources close to the player not ruling out the possibility of him signing a new contract if the interest from top Europeans clubs fades away.<br><br>Should Mertesacker complete a move to United, it would fuel uncertainty over the future of Jonny Evans, the 22-year-old Northern Ireland defender who has had a shaky start to the season.<br><br>Goal understands Ferguson believes he needs to add more strength in depth to his defence and provoke a genuine battle for starting places in his side.<br><br>“There is no way Ferguson would guarantee Mertesacker he will play every week,” added the insider. “But the best players welcome competition and it makes them better – Nemanja Vidic, Rio Ferdinand and Per Mertesacker in the same squad would be very interesting.”<br><br>The former Hannover 96 man, who cost Bremen €5m (£4.3m) in August 2006, had a frustrating start to the season after fracturing his eye socket on international duty, but is now determined to help the Bundesliga outfit as they challenge for the domestic title and compete in the Champions League, where they are pitted against Tottenham.<br></p>
