That goes for everyone.<br><br>"We are all hopeful of being in the team but the only way to achieve that is by doing well."<br><br>United won their title, the ninth in Giggs' time at the club, in eye-catching attacking style and the Welshman is hopeful that the new editions to the squad will see standards improve.<br><br>"The players we have signed in forward positions particularly are young and can make a contribution now and in the future," said Giggs.<br><br>"Last year, we showed what a great attacking team we were and now we have these additional options, hopefully we can improve even more."<br><br>United are currently on a four-match tour of Asia and, in the absence of the injured Gary Neville, Giggs is set to lead his side in the tour opener against Urawa Red Diamonds in Saitama on Tuesday.<br><br>Owen Hargreaves did not take a full part in United's first training session of the tour due to a minor injury and is a possible doubt for the Urawa fixture, while Ferguson has also confirmed that Nani is unlikely to feature.</div>
