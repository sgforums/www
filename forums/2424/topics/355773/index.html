              Man Utd could potentially be out of cl by the time they face everton on sunday.
              
              Worse case scenario, Man Utd could be out of 2 competitions after Sunday, if they keep playing like that and leaking goals.
              
              Really worst case scenario, Man Utd could finish empty handed and the title go to Liverpool.

              I do hope that Man Utd qualify for semi finals, whatever the score, even if it has to be a pk to win the tie, dun care if its an own goal or freak goal.
              
              Otherwise, prepare yourself for bad news on Thursday morning after the match that Man Utd is out.

              <p><strong>David Moyes, the </strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/everton"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Everton</strong></span></a><strong> manager, has received mixed news ahead of Sunday's </strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/fa-cup"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>FA Cup</strong></span></a><strong> semi-final against </strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span></a><strong>, with Louis Saha going down with a virus at the same time as another striker, James Vaughan, has pushed his claims to be included in the squad for Wembley after returning from long-term injury.</strong></p>
              <p>Saha missed training yesterday and Moyes admitted the Frenchman is a "worry" although he hopes that the forward's condition will have improved in time to face his former club. The 30-year-old is unlikely to start against United irrespective of whether he recovers but his availability as an impact substitute could be invaluable to Moyes on an afternoon when the Everton manager will be without Jo, the on-loan Manchester City striker, who is ineligible.</p>
              <p>Vaughan has been out since November, when he underwent cartilage surgery, but he came through a reserve game last week and, subject to another second successful run-out on Thursday, could have an outside chance of being among the substitutes on Sunday. "[James] is not quite where we want him. But his enthusiasm is great. That's why we get him back so quickly," said Moyes, who also revealed that Joseph Yobo has returned to training following a hamstring strain.</p>

              <p>The Toffees head into the Wembley showdown in decent form, having lost just one of their last eight Premier League matches.</p>
              <p>There is further incentive for Everton as they are aiming to reach their first final since they met and defeated United in 1995.</p>
              <p>And Cahill has issued a rallying cry to David Moyes' charges as they aim to end the Red Devils' pursuit of an unprecedented quintuple.</p>
              <p>"We feel a lot of confidence at the minute and we've been training really well," he told the Liverpool Echo.</p>
              <p>"We are playing with a purpose and the character of the lads is really starting to show.</p>
              <p>"It's just so good to be a part of it. We are growing week in, week out and getting stronger on and off the pitch.</p>
              <p>"We take a few knocks here and there but we are managing them. The lads are getting through 90 minutes, and overall we have to be very pleased."</p>

              lose 1-0 to Everton?
              
              if have to lose, I rather Man Utd lose fa cup than CL or epl title?
              
              reason for that? Man Utd the most winners of fa cup, only 3 times european cup/CL title nia, need more of it. If this season retain CL, it will be 4, need another 1 more to tie w Liverpool of 5 European Cup/CL winners.
              
              As for BPL title, if win this season, tie w Liverpool for the most league titles at 18. If next season win the league, Man Utd surpasses Liverpool for the first time in its history at 19.
              
              lose also doesnt matter cos Man Utd has the most winners in Fa Cup anyway.
              
              For the record, Liverpool has the most winners in league cup.

              I hope Fergie rest players like ronaldo, rooney and rio ferdinand this weekend against Everton and give fringer players like gary neville, ben foster, nani, tosic, fletcher a chance to play. 
              
              League next weekend is more important as Liverpool is out of CL and fa cup liao, whereas Man Utd is still in CL semi finals, 2 hard fought matches against Arsenal still to play.

              <h1>Moyes not sure if Riley is right ref</h1>
              <p><img src="http://images.teamtalk.com/09/02/330/MikeRiley_1857921.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="248"></p>
              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Everton boss David Moyes has
              questioned the decision to appoint Mike Riley to referee Sunday's FA
              Cup semi-final with Manchester United.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>The Yorkshire official is a late replacement for Steve Bennett, who has withdrawn due to illness.</p>
              <p>But Moyes, who has frequently not seen eye to eye with Riley, has raised the suggestion that Riley is a fan of United.</p>
              <p>Riley upset Moyes way back in 2003 when he awarded a
              controversial penalty to United in the final game of the season that
              cost Everton a place in the UEFA Cup.</p>
              <p>Riley also sent off Tim Cahill in the 2-0 league defeat to Liverpool in September.</p>
              <p>And now Moyes has responded to questions about Riley's appointment ahead of Sunday's semi-final at Wembley.</p>
              <p>He said on the club's official website: "A member of the press
              asked me if Mike Riley is a Manchester United supporter - I think that
              is something you would need to bring up with the FA.</p>
              <p>"It is something that one or two managers would have something
              to say about. It is the FA's appointment; it was originally supposed to
              be Steve Bennett.</p>
              <p>"If you (the press) are saying that Mike Riley is a Manchester United supporter, you would hope the FA would look at that."</p>
              <p>Moyes added that, in general, he believes English referees are
              doing a good job, but he did question the influence of the so-called
              'big four'.</p>
              <p>He said: "Referees in this country are very honest. They try to get the decisions right.</p>
              <p>"I think they can be influenced, I think that has been seen in a couple of games I have been involved in recently."</p>
              <p>A FA spokesman said: "All our referees are fair, unbiased and objective.</p>
              <p>"Mike Riley is one of our top officials and we are 100% confident he will do a good job on Sunday."</p>
              <p></p>

              <h1>Everton will wreck United's Quintuple bid with FA Cup win, says Lescott</h1>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Fired up: Lescott insists Everton can beat United at Wembley</em></p>
              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1170774" rel="1170774|3| nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/sport/football/article-1170774/Everton-wreck-Uniteds-Quintuple-bid-FA-Cup-win-says-Lescott.html"> </a></p>
              <p><strong>They were like a Goodison branch of the <span style="color: #003580;">Manchester United</span> Supporters’ Club less than a fortnight ago, but Joleon Lescott is convinced he and his <span style="color: #003580;">Everton</span> team-mates are on the verge of dashing the Old Trafford dream of a clean sweep.</strong></p>
              <p>Already world club champions and Carling Cup winners, United still top the Barclays Premier League and are through to the semi-finals of the Champions League and the FA Cup.</p>
              <p>It will be Everton’s turn at Wembley on Sunday to try to halt United and disprove a theory aired by Cristiano Ronaldo after Wednesday night’s Champions League victory against Porto that United have enough in reserve to triumph on all fronts.</p>
              <p>Lescott insists they can knock out Sir Alex Ferguson’s side in the semi-final, and he is adamant that, while United’s renowned flair can intimidate some opponents, Everton will not be sitting back and admiring their opponents’ skill — unlike a week last Sunday.</p>
              <p>‘We had just beaten <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/wigan-athletic.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Wigan</span></a> 4-0 and we all piled into the players’ bar to watch what was left of United’s game with <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/aston-villa.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Aston Villa</span></a>,’ said Everton’s England centre back. ‘For a variety of reasons, we were all cheering for United, and we really were giving it everything.</p>
              <p>‘You’d got the homegrown lads, for a start, the likes of Tony Hibbert, who is such a Blue that he would get behind anyone who might stop <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Liverpool</span></a> winning the title. Then there were others, like myself, who were more concerned about Villa finishing empty handed, to give us a better chance of pipping them for fifth place.</p>
              <p>‘We were all crowding round the telly, screaming and shouting for United to see them off, but it wasn’t exactly going according to plan. I had to leave about five minutes from the end, and I was a bit downcast. United were 2-1 down, and it wasn’t looking good. ‘Next thing you know, I get a call in the car to say United had not only equalised but also scored a winner in injury time. I was made up. That really rounded off the perfect afternoon.’</p>
              <p>United may have made Lescott’s day, but he believes he is about to spoil theirs and he is confident enough to predict Everton will even take them on at their own game.</p>
              <p>‘There is a different mindset about playing United now,’ he said.</p>
              <p>‘They maybe don’t look quite as invincible as earlier in the season, and there is a growing self-belief about the way we go about things. ‘They are still top of the league and in every competition going, so it’s going to be tough. But we have come on so much, we are no longer just a team who make life difficult for opponents.</p>
              <p>‘There are times when we can outplay anyone. It’s difficult to maintain that over 90 minutes, but we are confident that, at any given time, we can pass our way through<br>any team. Of course, we also still have the spirit and determination to out-power sides.</p>
              <p>‘That’s why we are beginning to feel comfortable mixing it with the top four. I think we have reached the stage where we are going into these games focusing far more on ourselves than what the other teams can do. We are thinking of what we are capable of, and that’s giving us even more confidence.</p>
              <p>‘The league game with United at Goodison in October was a case in point. We turned it round, after going behind, and came away with a 1-1 draw. We were quite confident after that. It showed what we could do against teams right at the top, and we have taken points off the others up there since.’</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/04/16/article-0-04785848000005DC-149_468x304.jpg" alt="Best in the world: Rooney is on top of his game, says Lescott" width="468" height="304"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Best in the world: Rooney is on top of his game, says Lescott</em></p>
              <div class="clear">
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Lescott pinpointed Wayne Rooney as the biggest threat to a place in the final for Everton but claimed he was in prime form to contain his England team-mate after recovering from an error-strewn start to the campaign.</strong></p>
              <p>‘United’s strike force is amazing, and I would rate Wayne the best in England at the moment, if not the world,’ he said. ‘You just have to concentrate even more than normal and do our best, as a team, to try to limit the supply to him in the hope he gets frustrated. He’s the best around, so naturally gifted he can do things that are beyond  he average footballer.</p>
              <p>‘At least I feel I’m getting back to my best. I don’t know why, but my form dipped noticeably at the start of the season. I had hoped to carry on where I left off last season, but I made a few mistakes that cost us goals, and it affected me.</p>
              <p>‘My concentration level wasn’t all it should’ve been, but Steve Round (assistant manager) went to work on me, and boss David Moyes had a go about the mistakes. I needed that. I needed telling I was doing wrong and needed to improve, and I’d like to think I reacted to it.</p>
              <p>‘I’m quite pleased with how it’s going now, and I feel I’m developing a good understanding with Phil Jagielka again. I’ve had to work harder on the training ground, but I don’t mind if it brings rewards like reaching an FA Cup semi-final. We are not settling for that, though. We’ll only be happy if we are heading back to Wembley for the final.’</p>
