              Fergie gamble has failed. Why fletcher &amp; Nani wasnt playing is beyond me?
              
              On taking pk, why wasnt Tevez and Scholes took the pk? was it decided by fergie or by the players?
              
              I dun think Tevez would chicken out for taking pk? maybe scholes didnt volunteered cos he missed pk in 2005 fa cup final before, probably didnt want to go thru the pk process again.

              <p>To be honest, on the penalties...I felt Howard was going to do better than Foster cos Howard has a bigger frame and looked much more confident. I am beginning to feel this Foster is not good at all... They should sell him away or loan him out next season for experience...</p>
              <p>I am thinking should Vds eventually retires, they will need a new keeper. These present 2 can't take over from what I have seen.</p>

              <p>there was no drive in the team, the way they played from the starting whistle showed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I thought the only consolation we can have was that our youngsters hold up well against everton except that they lack a cutting edge in front of goal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, it was totall bullshit yest night and the attitude that SAF showed from his team line up clearly shows how much the FA cup means to him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He didnt even bothered to come onto the touchline during halftime in ET.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The team just followed what the leader did. And sensing it, the crowd at wembly did the same.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And berbatov deserved to be blasted. crap penalty, the attitude that he displayed dont come from champions. yea, he was never one last season.</p>

              <h1>Ferguson fears ref was pressured</h1>
              <p><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/45680000/jpg/_45680013_riley.jpg" alt="" width="466" height="260"></p>
              <p class="first"><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson said comments from Everton
              boss David Moyes might have ultimately denied Manchester United a
              penalty in their FA Cup semi-final.</strong></p>
              <p>Referee Mike
              Riley did not give United a spot-kick when Danny Welbeck appeared to be
              fouled by Phil Jagielka, and Everton went on to win on penalties.</p>
              <p>Everton boss David Moyes had queried the choice of Riley prior to Sunday.</p>
              <p>Ferguson said: "I've no idea if it affected the decision, but it may have. It can prey on a referee's mind."</p>
              <p>Riley's decision prompted Ferguson to storm angrily towards the
              pitch, but in his post-match media conference the United boss admitted
              there had been room for doubt over the decision.</p>
              <p>"I've
              seen the video and it looks a penalty kick but in the importance of the
              game the referee probably has to be dead sure," added Ferguson.</p>
              <p>"Why
              would Welbeck go down when he had the goalkeeper stranded out of his
              goal? It was a major decision and unfortunately it has gone against us.
              Nothing you can do about it. We have to move on now.</p>
              <p><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/45680000/jpg/_45680073_ferguson.jpg" alt="" width="226" height="282"></p>
              <p>"When Riley sees it he'll probably realise he's made a mistake but I can't say that's the reason for us losing."</p>
              <p>United
              captain Rio Ferdinand supported Ferguson's suggestion that referees are
              hesitating over giving the champions penalty decisions.</p>
              <p>"We
              don't get many penalties these days," said Ferdinand. "Referees are
              reluctant to give them to us. Maybe they're are being put under
              pressure by people in the media."</p>
              <p>Moyes had questioned the choice of Riley after it had been suggested he was a United supporter.</p>
              <p>Riley was appointed to referee the match at Wembley after original choice Steve Bennett withdrew due to illness.</p>
              <p>In
              January, Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez had claimed that Ferguson is
              "the only manager who will not be punished" for verbally attacking
              referees, a comment which has sparked an on-going feud between the two
              managers.</p>
              <p>But Moyes admitted that United had been unlucky not to have been given the penalty.</p>
              <p>"I thought it looked a penalty kick," said Moyes. "If I had been the manager I would have been calling for a penalty kick."</p>
              <p>Moyes
              was too nervous to watch Jagielka score the decisive penalty as Everton
              reached the FA Cup final for the first time in 14 years.</p>
              <p>"I'm
              really, really pleased. I'm pleased for myself and the team but, more
              importantly, the supporters. They were fantastic," Moyes told BBC Radio
              Five Live.</p>
              <p>"I have got to praise Manchester United
              because they gave us a real hard game. I know on another day they could
              have put another team out and it could have been even harder.</p>
              <p>"But my players have given everything again today and they have done all season."</p>
              <p>Everton's
              final clash with Chelsea on 30 May will be their first FA Cup final
              since 1995 and Moyes outlined his desires for silverware.</p>
              <p>"What we're doing at Everton is we are preparing for success and today was a preparation for a final," he added.</p>
              <p>"We have not won anything yet but we have given ourselves a real chance of doing it now."</p>
              <p>Captain Phil Neville was gushing with pride after leading Everton to victory over his former club.</p>
              <p>"We've beaten the best side in the world - it's just a really proud moment," he told BBC Radio 5 Live.</p>
              <p>And
              praising manager Moyes, Neville added: "The boss has stepped up to the
              mark. He wanted us to go out there and express ourselves.</p>
              <p>"He gave us that confidence - now we need to go and win the Cup final."</p>
