              <h1>Welbeck on his penalty claim</h1>
              <p>Extracted From: <a href="http://football365.com/story/0,17033,8652_5211472,00.html">football365</a></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT"></span></p><blockquote>
              <p><strong>Welbeck, meanwhile, felt he was denied an obvious spot-kick. </strong></p>
              <p>"It was a penalty," said the teenager.</p>
              <p>"I was blatantly barged as I went to take the shot and it put me off balance. Then the defender clipped my left heel.</p>
              <p>"There was no need to dive. I would have scored. I am very disappointed."</p>
              <p>Welbeck was spared the pressure of taking a penalty in the
              shootout, instead forced to watch the agony as former United keeper Tim
              Howard saved an awful effort from Dimitar Berbatov before keeping out
              Ferdinand's spot-kick as well to give Everton the win.</p>
              <p>"You have to get on with the game," he said.</p>
              <p>"When it goes to penalties, it is just a lottery.</p>
              <p>"I suppose you could say I am annoyed about it but you cannot blame it all on a penalty decision.</p>
              <p>"We were the better team and we should have won the game without that penalty decision going in our favour."</p>

              <p>actually foster is quite a steady keeper but when opposing players run at him when he has the ball, he has a tendency to take a little too long on the ball before clearing. This, he has much to learn from van der sar.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And berbatov took his penalty too casually. Just before he could kick the ball, Tim Howard was already diving to his right. Berbatov should have been more alert and changed his kick last min to send the ball the other way.</p>

              <p>And someone pls tell me why ferdinand of all people took the second kick. I think Fergie really made a big error. He should have let Scholes, Anderson or even Macheda, Welbeck take it. England defenders cannot take penalty kicks.</p>

              <p>Foster is too reliant on his left leg, I've noticed it in most of the

              <p>Welbeck too omg <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">, his left legged cross yesterday probably worst cross i seen all season. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Ferdinand ever scored in one of Utd's shootout before, but maybe yesterday too much pressure already.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px;">
              </span></p><p style="margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;">Sir Alex Ferguson has joined forces with Arsenal's Arsene Wenger in condemning the Wembley pitch, after the Frenchman described the pitch as a "joke" after seeing it cut up as Arsenal lost 2-1 to Chelsea in their FA Cup semi-final on Saturday.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;">Ferguson's actions were even more embarrassing for the Football Association as he revealed he had pulled established stars such as <a style="color: #000000;" href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=8860">Paul Scholes</a>, <a style="color: #000000;" href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=12724">Dimitar Berbatov</a> and <a style="color: #000000;" href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=21931">Patrice Evra</a> out of the starting line-up for yesterday's FA Cup semi-final defeat against Everton because of the state of what should be English football's premier playing surface.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;">Ferguson played a makeshift team of youngsters and reserves, who battled to a goalless draw after extra-time before losing agonisingly 4-2 in a penalty shootout.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;">The United manager said: "When I saw the pitch (in the Chelsea v Arsenal semi), what I didn't want was to go into extra-time with my strongest squad.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;">"It looked spongy and dead and difficult to move the ball quickly around it. They've got all these lights around the perimeter to help the growth and the standard of the soil. But it looks dead to me.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;">"So we had to go with the bold decision of playing the younger ones. After all, our club is built on giving young players opportunities and they didn't disappoint.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;">"Once we made our mind up, I was quite enthusiastic about it. It was the right thing to do. It was good for them."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;">Ferguson now has to pick up his team for a crucial league match against Portsmouth on Wednesday when <a style="color: #000000;" href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=8871">Darren Fletcher</a> will be available after injury and the big guns will return, including <a style="color: #000000;" href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=21046">Wayne Rooney</a>.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;">Ferguson, however, insists the experience of Wembley, where he made eight changes - including adding three teenagers - to the team that beat Porto in the Champions League last Wednesday, has convinced him United have a strong enough squad to succeed in their quests for the Premier League and Champions League trophies.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;">He said: "The most important thing is that I now know that, in the run-in, those young players of mine can play in any game, ability-wise.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;">"(Danny) Welbeck and (Federico) Macheda were absolutely outstanding and that is a big plus point. We have some massive games coming up now and we have the squad to cope with it."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;">The semi-final hinged on a 69th-minute decision by referee Mike Riley when he denied United a penalty after <a style="color: #000000;" href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=4745">Phil Jagielka</a> appeared to bring down Welbeck in the penalty area.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;">Ferguson suggested doubts might have been planted in Riley's mind by claims last week he was a United supporter, claims Everton manager David Moyes declined to deny.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;">"I've no idea if it affected the decision but you never know," said Ferguson. "It may have. It can prey on a referee's mind. I've seen the video and it looks a penalty kick but, in the importance of the game, the referee probably has to be dead sure.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;">"When he (Riley) sees it he'll probably realise he's made a mistake but I can't say that's the reason for us losing."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;">Ferguson, who saw Berbatov and <a style="color: #000000;" href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=7825">Rio Ferdinand</a> have their spot-kicks saved by former United goalkeeper <a style="color: #000000;" href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=34158">Tim Howard</a>, also claimed he never believed winning five trophies this season was realistic.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;">"It's impossible to think you can do that," he said. "You need a lot of luck. We've had a lot of injuries to defenders.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;">"If all my players had been fit, you would have to go for it but, realistically, it is very, very difficult."</p>

              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Dimitar Berbatov acknowledged he 'let his team down' by missing a penalty in Manchester United's shoot-out defeat by Everton. </strong></p>
              <p>United's bid for a famous Quintuple was ended at
              Wembley on Sunday after Everton prevailed 4-2 on penalties after a 0-0
              draw in the FA Cup semi-final.</p>
              <p>Tim Cahill missed the opening
              spot-kick for the Toffees before Berbatov saw his tame effort saved by
              former United keeper Tim Howard.</p>
              <p>Rio Ferdinand's penalty was also
              kept out by Howard before Phil Jagielka converted the decisive
              spot-kick to set up a final date with Chelsea.</p>
              <p>Berbatov, who came
              on as a substitute at the start of extra-time, outlined the thinking
              behind his seemingly lackadaiscal penalty.</p>
              <p>"I was looking for the goalkeeper and in the last moment he took the angle I was going for, so he saved it," Berbatov told <em>Sky Sports News</em>.</p>
              <p><span class="main-content">
              </span></p><p>The Premier League leaders now face Portsmouth on Wednesday and Berbatov is trying to look forward after his penalty miss.</p>
              <p>The Bulgarian added: "We have a game on Wednesday, which is very important with Portsmouth.</p>
              <p>"Of
              course, this loss is going to hurt us, but it's all behind us and we
              are going to concentrate on the Champions League and the Premier
              League."</p>
              <p>He continued: "It's always difficult when you lose, especially when you miss a penalty and you let your team down.</p>
              <p>"But that's why we're professionals and we must go on."</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Tim Cahill and Rafael battle for the ball as the Wembley pitch visibly cuts up</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson blamed a dodgy Wembley pitch for his decision to play a reserve team in an FA Cup semi-final. The United manager pointed the finger at Wembley, echoing complaints of the weekend's other semi-final loser, Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger.</strong></p>
              <div class="clear">
              <p>Ferguson said: 'We had a team picked after Wednesday's game in Porto but when I saw the pitch yesterday I didn't want to go into extra time with our strongest squad. 'I couldn't let that happen because of the affect it could have.</p>
              <p>'We had to take the bold decision of going with the younger ones but Berbatov and Scholes would have started, possibly Evra, too.</p>
              <p>'Looking at the pitch, it looked dead and today it looked the same. It looked spongey and dead and difficult to move the ball about quickly. 'You'd think the lights would help the growth and standard of the pitch, but it looked dead to me. You couldn't risk it.'</p>
              <p>Victorious Everton manager David Moyes agreed with Ferguson, suggesting that the pitch may need to be ripped up. Moyes said: 'It's very difficult to explain. The pitch is spongey, there's no speed, and it's all very slow. It's as if it needs the soil underneath taking out.'</p>
              <p>The pitch certainly contributed to a drab game but the FA have dashed any hopes of it being better for next month's final.</p>
              <p>Jagielka, who was to score the winning kick in the shoot-out, admitted later that he did foul the United youngster. 'I touched him but I do not know how much it caused him to go down. The penalty was not given, so maybe we were a bit lucky.'</p>
              <p>Ferguson suggested that Riley may have been influenced by Moyes' suggestion that the official was a United fan. Ferguson said: 'All that nonsense about him being a United fan was really ridiculous. Somebody filled David Moyes' head full of nonsense about it and it was used in the press conference. 'It can play on a referee's mind. I've no idea if it affected his decision but you never know, it might have. I hope not.'</p>
              <p>Everton defender Jagielka had to be persuaded to take a penalty. The former Sheffield United player, who missed one in a UEFA Cup shootout against Fiorentina last season, said: 'I didn't know what I was doing when I got up there but I am glad it went in.'</p>
              <p>Everton captain Phil Neville revealed that he felt compelled to take his kick, which he scored. He said: 'I had not taken one since I was 11 and I missed that one. But I had been practising.'</p>
