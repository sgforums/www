            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong>Patrice Evra admitted the players were all tired after Tuesday’s energy-sapping win over AC Milan, but he says the Reds cannot use that as an excuse for the 3-1 loss to Everton on Saturday.<br><br></strong>The defeat to David Moyes’ in-form Toffees was a major blow to United’s title ambitions, but it was the manner of the performance that left Evra feeling frustrated after the final whistle.<br><br>“We are all very disappointed and upset,” the Frenchman told <strong>MUTV</strong>. “I’d like to give the excuse that we are very tired after the amazing night in the San Siro. But I won’t give that excuse. I think that we didn’t believe in the win. We had the opportunity to win.<br><br>“We were tired, a lot of players were tired, but I think in our mentality we lost the game. It’s not about not having spirit, it’s that we didn’t believe enough. We did believe. We play every time for the United shirt and we want to win, we believe until the last second. But we didn’t believe enough. I am very frustrated. It was not an easy day and it was a tough place to go. It was a tough time to play Everton as well. But I think it was just about having a bit more belief in getting the victory.”<br><br>United had started well, taking the lead through Dimitar Berbatov after 16 minutes. But Everton then began to get a foothold in the game and the Reds couldn’t come up with the right response. “We started well but after they equalised it made it more difficult,” added Evra. “We lost a lot of challenges. We didn’t show the best of United, we can find excuses that we were tired, but I’m just very disappointed. Sometimes that happens.”<br><br>United now have three days to shake off the grogginess and prepare for West Ham’s visit to Old Trafford. The Reds need to get back on track in the title race, but Evra insists all is not lost.<br><br>“It’s not damaging,” he said of the defeat to Everton. “A lot of teams, big teams, have gone to Goodison Park and lost. The target before the game was that if we won there we could win the title. But we didn’t do that. There’s no damage, it’s just more difficult than we thought it was going to be to win the league. Now we have West Ham and we need to make sure we get three points before we play in the Carling Cup final.<br><br>“Are we are pleased [we have a game so soon]? Yes and no. It’s not easy. We only have three days to recover. But this is United. If we win on Tuesday we will all be pleased. But for now we need to recover and get ready for that game.”</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>its begs the question. is the game vs west ham important or the cup final against villa more important? I say sacrifise the league cup final cos the 3 points is more important than the worthless league cup. get the win against west ham and then rest the senior players and let the reserves play against villa.</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong>Last week summed up the rollercoaster ride of emotions so often experienced by United fans. <br><br></strong>On Tuesday, the Reds made history at the San Siro in one of the best games we've seen for years in the Champions League. Then, four days later, Sir Alex's men were outplayed and often outfought by a tigerish Everton side. That result has now put a real dent in United's title hopes. <br><br>You have to hand it to Everton. They were energetic and determined, and the team, which contained several homegrown players, was backed by a partisan crowd and cannily managed by a top young coach. No doubt about it: the Toffees deserved their win. But if you ask me, I think United’s exertions in the San Siro were a major factor in this strangely subdued performance.<br><br>I know I was exhausted at full-time in Italy... and I never kicked a ball! It was an emotionally draining game and I’m sure it took its toll on the squad. In the second half at Goodison Park it looked as though United had very little left in the tank. An early kick off at Everton is not what you need after returning from a midweek European trip.<br><br>I interviewed Patrice Evra after Saturday’s game and he admitted there was a lot of tiredness in the camp but refused to use that as an excuse for United’s performance. Players are often reluctant to do interviews after a defeat so you have to hand it to Patrice: he was honest and forthright, but clearly hurt by the result. <br><br>We did the interview by the side of the pitch at Goodison. After we finished, a few "merry" Everton fans on the balcony of an executive box called out to Patrice and asked him to sign a few autographs. Much to their delight (and, no doubt, surprise), the Frenchman clambered up the stand and obliged. He then headed back to the tunnel. Further along, a few more fans noticed him and called out for the same treatment. Pat must have been desperate to go back down the tunnel and get on the coach back home but, once again, he went up the steps to sign more autographs. He got a massive cheer and rightly so. This showed real class and generosity from a player who was very upset by the afternoon’s events. I imagine the same fans were probably giving him all manner of stick just an hour earlier...<br><br>While losing at Everton was disappointing, the good news is that United have a chance to quickly put things right with the visit of West Ham on Tuesday. We're now down to just 11 games to play, though, so any more slip ups could prove fatal. That said, I get the feeling that this compelling title race will contain a few more twists and turns...</p></div>
