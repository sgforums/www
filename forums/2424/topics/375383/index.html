              <h1>Man United Team-Mates Praise Anderson After Breaking Goal Duck</h1>
              <h2>It took 78 matches, but it was a crucial and impressive match-winner.</h2>
              <p>The plaudits have come thick and fast for Manchester United midfielder Anderson, after he scored the crucial second goal against Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday, in a match that the Red Devils eventually won 3-1.<br><br>It
              was his first ever goal for United after a whopping 78 competitive
              appearances. Not that you could tell, as the sweetly struck left-foot
              shot was drilled low past Spurs goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini with spades
              of composure.<br><br>Among the team-mates congratulating the Brazilian
              on breaking his duck was Rio Ferdinand, who said that there were signs
              that the goal was on the cards.<br><br>"I think the lads have seen it coming," Rio told United’s official website. <br><br>"The
              international break gave him plenty of time to train and we've seen
              glimpses of what he can do. He scored a good goal for the reserves and
              I think he's got the knack now of scoring.<br><br>"Hopefully he can go on a good run now and score more because if he does that he'll be a top-class player."<br><br>The
              21-year-old had previously only scored in competitive matches for
              United in penalty shootouts. He put one away in emphatic style against
              Chelsea in the Champions League final in 2008, and scored the final
              penalty that secured the League Cup against Spurs last season. <br><br>For
              a man that had waited so long to finally score, his celebration was
              remarkably calm and restrained. The Brazilian slid onto the ground,
              firing his arms in a machine gun spraying motion while seated on the
              pitch.  <br><br>The celebration wasn’t to everyone’s liking, according
              to team-mate Ryan Giggs, who curled home an emphatic free kick in the
              first half to cancel out Jermain Defoe’s acrobatic opener.<br><br>"He's had a bit of stick about his celebration," Giggs said. <br><br>"But
              we're all pleased. His performances have been really good since he's
              come to the club. He's a top player. He knows he needs to add goals to
              his game and hopefully he'll score a lot more."<br><br>Sir Alex
              Ferguson also praised the performance of Anderson and insisted that
              although he had been on the fringes of the squad in recent times, the
              Brazilian had an important part to play this season, particularly under
              the Scot’s midfield rotation system.<br><br>"I hope that drives him on to get more [goals] because he's capable of that,” Ferguson said. <br><br>“He
              hasn't played a lot of games but he's part of a squad, we have so many
              midfield players and we have to rotate it at various times in the
              season and Anderson will play his part. He had a marvelous performance
              for us today."</p>
