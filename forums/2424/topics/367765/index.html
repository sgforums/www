              <p class="excerpt">Carlos Tevez will finally seal his long-awaited move to Manchester City next week.</p>
              <p>The former Manchester United favourite is all set to join the City revolution and end weeks of speculation since Red Devils boss Sir Alex Ferguson refused to sign the Argentina international on a permanent basis.</p>
              <p>City, who leave for a pre-season tour of South Africa on Wednesday, are now in the process of paying Tevez's owner, Kia Joorabchain, the £26.5million they need to secure the 25-year-old's services, a move that would finally bury the third-party ownership row that has  dogged Tevez since his arrival in England.</p>
              <p>News of Tevez's imminent deal comes hot on the heels of City's decision to call a halt to their attempts to sign Barcelona striker Samuel Eto'o.</p>
              <p>With his path to City almost clear of obstacles, Tevez believes he will not be considered a traitor by the United faithful - despite the intense rivalry that exists between United and City,</p>
              <p>"If I play for Manchester City I don't think the United fans will feel I am a traitor," he told The People.</p>
              <p>"They have to remember that at least as far as I know I have been thrown out of the club and I have to study the best offers available."</p>
              <p>Tevez will become City's third high profile signing this summer following the arrival of Roque Santa Cruz from Blackburn Rovers and Gareth Barry from Aston Villa.</p>

              <h4>Manchester City is delighted to announce that agreement has been reached with Carlos Tevez over a proposed move to the City of Manchester Stadium.</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Personal terms with the 25-year-old have been concluded and the deal has been ratified by the Premier League and the Football Association.</p>
              <p>After a medical Carlos, who has won the league title in every country in which he has played, is expected to sign a five-year contract and will meet up with his new teammates on their pre-season tour to South Africa. He will sport the number 32 shirt.</p>
              <p>The only player to named South American Player of the Year in three successive seasons, Carlos has recently concluded a summer break following his successful World Cup exploits with Argentina.</p>
              <p>"It is terrific news," a delighted Mark Hughes told mcfc.co.uk. "Carlos is an international player of the highest class who possesses all the attributes that will help drive this club forward.</p>
              <p>"He is not only outstanding technically but he is a reliable goal scorer and someone who will contribute fully to the team ethic. He gives us another exciting, attacking dimension.</p>
              <p>"I cannot wait to welcome him to City. This is yet another deal that shows the commitment of the owner Sheikh Mansour to make this club the very best it can possibly be. I am sure our fans will give Carlos an exceptionally warm welcome."</p>
              <p>Tevez signs after an extended loan spell at Old Trafford where he spent two seasons and clocked up 99 league and cup starts and bagged 34 goals.</p>
              <p>He has previously spent a season at West Ham United having made his name in his homeland with Boca Juniors before transferring in 2005 to Brazilian club Corinthians.</p>
              <p>Carlos’ scoring ratio with Boca was better than one in three games and he improved that to better than one in two at his second club.</p>
              <p>Like Blues teammate Pablo Zabaleta, Tevez has an Olympic gold medal though from Athens in 2004 not last year in Beijing. He has clocked up 50 senior caps for his country.</p>
