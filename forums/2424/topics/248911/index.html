            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://news.bbc.co.uk/olmedia/2015000/images/_2016885_waddle300.jpg"><br><span class="small">Chris Waddle was one of England's most skillful players</span><br><br><strong>Former England winger Chris Waddle hopes Manchester United beat Chelsea to the major trophies this season "for the good of football". The teams meet in the Premiership and FA Cup final next month and could also contest the Champions League final. "For the good of football you need entertainers to succeed," Waddle, who won 62 England caps, told BBC Sport. </strong><br><br><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/42806000/jpg/_42806667_fergie_ronaldo203.jpg"><br><span class="small">Ferguson has won trophies the hard way - by entertaining<br><br>Chris Waddle</span><br><br>"I think it would be better for the game if United won the trophies because of the way they've played this season." Waddle added: "People obviously take notice if you're winning things. If Chelsea win three or four trophies, people will think that's the way to play.<br><br>"Chelsea are a no-risk team and I don't get out of my seat watching them. "In contrast, watching United encourages young kids to dribble and to entertain. Our country is desperately short of this type of player." Waddle also believes Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho cannot be classed as a "truly great manager" because of the football his side play.<br><br><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/42806000/jpg/_42806665_chelsea203.jpg"><br><span class="small">For the money and resources Chelsea have had, I think they should entertain more<br><br>Chris Waddle</span><br><br>"He doesn't like flair, he likes machines," said Waddle. "Fitness, strength and organisation are the key things for Mourinho. "A lot of people will say this means he can't be classed a great manager, even though he has been tremendously successful and has achieved a great deal. "Of course, he can turn round and put two fingers up and say 'I've won the trophies'. "But it's a lot easier to stop teams entertaining than to play entertaining football.<br><br>"This is why Manchester United's Alex Ferguson and Arsenal's Arsene Wenger are great, great managers. They've won trophies the hard way - by entertaining. "Ferguson has always entertained, mainly by playing two wide men who can produce magic.<br><br>"Think of Lee Sharpe, Andrei Kanchelskis, Ryan Giggs and Cristiano Ronaldo - they're unpredictable players who the fans love to watch. "Ferguson and Wenger have got the philosophy right and won trophies with entertaining football." Waddle says Mourinho should have produced more entertaining football because of the millions given to him by Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich.<br><br>"The majority of teams in the lower leagues play a percentage game," stated Waddle. "They succeed by being well-organised, playing at a high tempo and getting the ball forward quickly. "You can understand that because they don't have the resources to buy people like Cristiano Ronaldo. Players of that quality are hard to find.<br><br>"For the money and resources Chelsea have had, I think they should entertain more. "Mourinho can turn round and say 'I've got Arjen Robben, Shaun Wright-Phillips and Salomon Kalou' but he takes them off all the time. "He doesn't seem to want that type of player. If Robben was playing for Arsenal or Manchester United he would be unbelievable. He would be in the same class as Ronaldo by now.<br><br>"He needs a run of 10 games and to be told 'go out and enjoy it'. It's a confidence thing. Under Mourinho, if Robben loses the ball once or twice, he knows he's coming off." There has been widespread speculation that Mourinho could leave Stamford Bridge at the end of the season - largely because the rumours suggest Abramovich wants to see "champagne football" played by his team.<br><br>Waddle said: "Abramovich has probably thought everything is going well apart from the entertainment. "Apart from when they score, he never stands up. I bet he's not on the edge of his seat very often. "When everyone is raving about Manchester United and Barcelona, he's probably thinking 'why can't we play like that?'<br><br>"Even if Manchester United or Arsenal don't win, you know you'll see moments of brilliance that could be worth the entrance fee alone. "But, saying all that, the fans would be up in arms if Mourinho went because of the number of trophies he has won at Chelsea."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well... Chelsea has a habit of fighting back till the end and usually got the odd goal to win the match. So unless MANU kills the game off by scoring 7 goals, its hard to confirm MANU will win the matches against Chelsea.</div>

Which is why, Arsenal might be better off grooming an unknown and young player. I see Theo Walcott as that player.</div>
