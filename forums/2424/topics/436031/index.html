              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Manchester United's title defence begins at The Hawthorns, one of only five away grounds where they won in the Premier League last season. Lady luck was smiling on them on that occasion. Gary Neville should have been sent off and Peter Odemwingie missed a penalty for Albion.</p>
              <p>Despite United's impressive comeback against Manchester City last Sunday, which was inspired by younger legs, Sir Alex Ferguson is likely to put his faith in an experienced line-up here. Albion may give a debut to new signing Shane Long, with Odemwingie struggling to be fit. Stuart James</p>

              <p><strong>• Michael Owen needs to score once more to reach 150 Premier League career goals</strong></p>
              <p><strong>• Albion set a new record for the fewest clean sheets in a Premier League campaign (two) last season</strong></p>
              <p><strong>• David de Gea conceded more goals from shots outside the area (11) than any other keeper in the Spanish league in 2010-11</strong></p>

              <p>both CB are injured and replaced by Evans and Jones and Smalling playing the RB, the future united backline.</p>
              <p>heng eh, united did not buck the trend by drawing in their opening games, albeit the 2-1 scoreline. united still need a creator in midfield based on anderson and cleverley display in midfield today.</p>

              <p>Away matches are not easy... So even if they got a Sneijder in there, it may still not make a difference... Anyway, if base on today, I don't think Carrick would have done any better either... Cleverley did ok...</p>
              <p>Welbeck wasn't good today... But that's what you get from youngsters... They are not consistent...</p>
              <p>And on De Gea... What can you say, 2 matches, both disappointing... I always felt he was a risky choice... He is a good shot stopper but he don't seem to have a presence in the box... Moreover his small frame will be a problem in the Premiership...</p>
              <p>Now, all United fans can hope for is he improve fast... Cos their next few matches are going to be very difficult opponents...</p>

              <p>Alex Ferguson's men looked like having to settle for a point after the Spanish goalkeeper's howler allowed Shane Long to cancel out Wayne Rooney's first half opener.</p>
              <p>But despite a barrage of abuse from the Hawthorns faithful, De Gea ended the game all smiles thanks to Reid turning the ball into his own net with 10 minutes remaining after Young's superb solo run.</p>
              <p>The victory came at a cost however, with Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic both limping off injured.</p>

              <p>Away matches are not easy... So even if they got a Sneijder in
              there, it may still not make a difference... Anyway, if base on
              today, I don't think Carrick would have done any better either...
              Cleverley did ok...</p>

              <p>And on De Gea... What can you say, 2 matches, both
              disappointing... I always felt he was a risky choice... He is
              a good shot stopper but he don't seem to have a presence in the
              box... Moreover his small frame will be a problem in the
              Premiership...</p>
              <p>Now, all United fans can hope for is he improve fast... Cos
              their next few matches are going to be very difficult

              <p>feel that he is not ready to face our upcoming opponents.. so it may be wiser to withdraw him now. if he makes another howler to complete a hat trick.. his confidence will probably nosedive anyway. even with rio and vidic yesterday.. the defence looks shaky after that goal. against tougher opponents the youngsters will be better off with a solid presence behind them..</p>
              <p>better to slowly ease him into the team with league cup/fa cup ties/crappy epl teams, build up his body and work on his weaknesses before throwing him into the wild.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>De Gea should also adopt the right mentality in regards to being replaced for certain games because Lindegaard is obviously more stable and already used to screaming at everyone.<br><br>First things first, he needs to get language nailed down right, and bloody make friends with the defenders, 2 games already, Rio and Vidic like never talk to him like that, no communication is one thing but like I mentioned before, the veterans should show their support when he makes good saves, not expect him to save every single damn thing for the next 38 games.</p></div>

              <p>feel that he is not ready to face our upcoming opponents.. so it
              may be wiser to withdraw him now. if he makes another howler to
              complete a hat trick.. his confidence will probably nosedive
              anyway. even with rio and vidic yesterday.. the defence looks shaky
              after that goal. against tougher opponents the youngsters will be
              better off with a solid presence behind them..</p>
              <p>better to slowly ease him into the team with league cup/fa cup
              ties/crappy epl teams, build up his body and work on his weaknesses
              before throwing him into the wild.</p>
              <p>our youngsters are mentally stronger than arsenal's kids thats
              for sure.. but 15 pts is too much of a gamble.</p>

              <p>well, another angle of looking at tis, it forces the attack to score than the defense is leaking.. a dangerous proposition.</p>
              <p>the thing is who's to gurantee the backup is no better than DG? given how the team/saf is rounding to support him, I feel that it is not a bad time for DG to really brave it thru.</p>
              <p>Gunners is not a real threat with so many change, Chelsea a new manager, City, maybe. So why not bite the bullet?</p>
              <p>I still feel he should face the baptism of fire.</p>
              <p>even great dane has his hiccups.. if U track how he started for MUFC, in the first 10games or so.</p>
