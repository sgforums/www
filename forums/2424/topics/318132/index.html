              <p>Even now it still happens on a daily basis. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer
              quickly discovered that, when you have scored the winning goal in a
              Champions League final, there will never be a shortage of people
              wanting to remind you about it. Grown men clasp his hand and bearhug
              him. Nearly always he can guess what they are going to say.</p>
              <p>"They
              say, 'Thanks for giving me the best night of my life'," he says. "Then
              they usually add, 'but please don't tell my wife.' That's the comment
              they always come up with - 'It was even better than my wedding night' -
              and after a while you actually start believing it.</p>
              <p>"You come to
              understand that it was a great, great night for many, many people. I
              didn't realise that at the time. I just played a game, won a game. But
              over time you realise just how big a moment it was."</p>
              <p>It is nine
              years since Solskjaer jabbed out his right foot to score the most
              famous goal in Manchester United's history. In Sir Alex Ferguson's
              office there is a framed copy of Clive Tyldesley's television
              commentary throughout those three crazy minutes of stoppage-time,
              culminating in the immortal line: "And Solskjaer has done it!" But the
              goalscorer himself is less showy. There are few memorabilia at his
              house in Cheshire and he says he has never watched the game against
              Bayern Munich from start to finish, only the final 15 minutes on one
              occasion with his parents in Norway.</p>
              <p>He has, however, seen the
              winning goal "maybe a thousand times" and his eyes sparkle as he
              remembers the part of his anatomy that changed his life for ever. "My
              big toe," he says. "I've scored a lot of goals. But the one that night
              was just a lucky moment. Ninety-nine times out of 100 it would have
              gone into the hands of [Oliver] Kahn or on the head of the guy on the
              line."</p>
              <p>Solskjaer, as was so often the case, had been a substitute
              that night at Camp Nou. "At half-time," he recalls, "the manager went
              over to Teddy Sheringham to tell him to get ready to come on. I was in
              the background, hoping that he would come over to me, too. But he
              didn't. He just had a chat with everyone to say we should leave with no
              regrets: 'If we walk out of here losing, you have to walk past that cup
              without touching it. You can't touch it. That's the worst feeling in
              football. Just don't let yourselves down and give 100%.'"</p>
              <p>The
              most prolific substitute in football was on the bench for another 35
              minutes before Ferguson finally gave him the nod. "I was just warming
              up and warming up, waiting and waiting and trying to catch his eye. I
              was a bit - not frustrated but 'why don't you put me on?'"</p>
              <p>Solskjaer
              remembers being "springy" as he sprinted on. "That was always a good
              sign," he says. "I can see from the way I ran on that I thought I was
              going to score. I knew something would happen. I'd even phoned my best
              mate that afternoon to tell him. He had a night shift - he's a nurse in
              Trondheim - and was due to start at 10 o'clock [nine o'clock English
              time] so he didn't think he would see the last half-hour. But I made
              sure he got someone to step in for him. I said to him: 'Something big
              is going to happen tonight.'"</p>
              <p>He admits that United, 1-0 down,
              were fortunate still to be in the game when he came on with 10 minutes
              to go. "We have to be honest and say that Bayern Munich were the better
              team, at least for 85 minutes. We rode our luck as they hit the
              crossbar, hit the post. We never had a strike on target for 80 minutes."</p>
              <p>But
              then the game turned upside-down. "When Teddy equalised everyone ran to
              him to celebrate, except me," says Solskjaer. "I ran straight back to
              the half-way line. I was thinking, 'Right, extra-time, this is
              something I'm going to savour, learn from, enjoy.' And then I ruined
              it, I suppose."</p>
              <p>His celebratory knee-slide was subsequently
              reported to have caused the cartilage injury that ended his career.
              "That's a myth," he says. "I did get a medial ligament injury but
              that's nothing in football terms - three weeks, maybe. I didn't feel
              it, though. My mind was blank. I've seen it on television as I was
              running down there, sliding, but I cannot remember what I was thinking."</p>

              <p>For those old enough to remember '99 : The biggest irony of it all was, Solskjaer was supposed to have been a Tottenham player had Fergie had his way (a deal had actually been struck with Spurs only for Solskjaer to insist on staying at United to fight for his place) - so much for foresight. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/football/fa_carling_premiership/155822.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/football/fa_carling_premiership/155822.stm</a></p>
              <p>Who'd have expected Ferguson to bank on someone he didn't count on to actually deliver the most glorious night in his magnificent career?</p>
