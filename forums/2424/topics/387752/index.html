              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Referee Mark Clattenburg still feels he was right to send off Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher at Birmingham on Saturday evening.</span><span><span id="intelliTXT"> </span></span></p>
              <p>Fletcher was dismissed after collecting a second yellow card late on following a trip on Cameron Jerome.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson described the decision as "ridiculous" and "soft" after the 1-1 draw, leading to reports the United boss could again be in trouble with the FA regarding his comments about referees.</p>
              <p>However, Clattenburg is confident he made the right decision to dismiss Fletcher, having booked the midfielder for a challenge on Lee Bowyer in the first half.</p>
              <p>Clattenburg also warned the Scotland international about showing dissent and did not wish to be drawn into a row with Ferguson.</p>
              <p>"You'll have to ask him about his comments, that's not my business," said the official. "There were two yellow cards for Fletcher.</p>
              <p>"In the first half he was b*******d for dissent, I warned him for dissent.</p>
              <p>"He was cautioned before half-time for a foul, then he cynically tripped the Birmingham player."</p>
              <p>Clattenburg also explained the situation regarding the furore about United's equaliser when the linesman flagged for offside against Wayne Rooney despite Scott Dann turning the ball into his own net.</p>
              <p>He added: "I saw that a player from the home side had scored an own goal, but my assistant saw Rooney in an offside position and correctly put the flag up.</p>
              <p>"I went across to talk to him and he told me why he had flagged, but because Rooney did not score and it was an own goal, it must stand.</p>
              <p>"If Rooney had scored then he would have been given offside.</p>
              <p>"As the law stands, for a player to be offside he must be either playing the ball or interfering with play. In this case the defender tried to clear it and scored an own goal. Rooney was two or three yards away from him."</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Selling the Man United bond scheme to investors this week: United chief executive David Gill – offering financiers a chance to back football's "strongest" global brand, structured around a "comfortable" level of debt in a long-term "stable" financial model. Not mentioned as part of Gill's sales pitch: his stance on the debt-based financial model in 2004, a year before he agreed a £1.7m salary to work for the Glazers (plus £1.3m profit from selling his shares): a) Called the proposed takeover an "aggressive" move placing "significant strain on the business"; b) told a fans meeting the level of debt could "jeopardise 126 years of history"; and c) spelled it out: "Borrowing money is not good for a football club ... it's the road to ruin."</p></div>

              <h3>MANCHESTER UNITED'S American owners are considering increasing season ticket prices by up to 11 PER CENT as they try to reduce the champions' crippling £711million debt.</h3>
              <p>Sport Of The World understands the Glazer studying three different price-hike proposals which could increase matchday revenue at Old Trafford by over £2m.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If the club implement their most radical proposal, the cost of a season ticket in the Family Stand would rise from £646 to £722, an increase of ELEVEN per cent!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There would also be a seven per cent rise in prices for the North Stand, with the average cost of an Old Trafford season ticket soaring from £659 to over £690.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Two other less radical strategies are also being discussed, both of which would still see increases above the current rate of inflation - 1.9 per cent</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Last week United kicked off a world tour to drum up support for a bond scheme. They have even approached Dubai International Capital, but were turned down. Their efforts to secure the £500m funding needed to stabilise the club's enormous debts are also coming at huge cost. It is estimated that some of the sales pitches taking part across the globe are costing United up to £100,000.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>News of the proposed price increases provoked an angry reaction from supporters, who could be heard chanting "We want the Glazers out," at Old Trafford yesterday.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Duncan Drasdo of the Independent Manchester United Supporters Association, said: "The publication of the bid prospectus last week showed the true horrors and damage that the Glazers have inflicted on our club.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"They cannot expect the supporters to pay for the debt. If they press ahead they may be surprised how difficult it is to sell them."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A United official said: "season ticket prices are always discussed at this time of the year."</p>
