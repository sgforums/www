              <p>poolman,</p>
              <p>pls have some respect for where u r posting and grace in ur posting. this is a man u subforum. but u keep going that the victory was given to them by spurs and not fought hard for by the man u players. its not as if the spurs players stand one side and never run and tackle.</p>
              <p>do not keep saying gomes this gomes that. yes he was culpable in some of the goals, but the strikers have to be in the position to be able to take advantage of the mistakes the keeper made. that pool could not defeat spurs (actually almost all the top 4, home and away, according to the commentator) and yet man u could, does not mean u should feel defensive.</p>
              <p><br>lastly, your liverpool fought tooth and nail for your win over a 10 man hull. my man u also fought hard, if not harder, for the win over spurs. 11 man spurs. common logic tells u its harder to get past 11 men. some respect pls. hack, even ronaldo was chasing back more often last nite. how often to u see the whiner do that..</p>
              <p>if man u had lost last nite, i doubt that i would have blamed carl folan for kicking out at the pool player to get sent off and gift the game to pool. pool would still have had to put the ball into the net to make it count. so pls, dun keep harping that stupid referee give penalty that was not there, stupid keeper kelong cannot save properly, etc. Respect is the word. </p>
              <p>cheers</p>

              <p>Yeh man u may have had a lucky penalty but still, u win some u lose some. We would have enter the FA cup final if not for some dubious mike riley decision. On another day, Xabi alonso had a ghost of a goal against chelsea in a UCL semi-final match some time back.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Man u just had the luck of champions last night. For rooney's 2nd goal, gomes did not cover his near post becos from his view, the defender on rooney had it covered. he never expected a pin point shot from rooney thru the defender's legs and thats why he let the goal in. And rooney's cross for ronaldo to scored the 3rd goal, that was like from a bechham who plays on the left. (my views after watching youtube replays :) ).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Rooney was really world class last night. In order to make way for tevez to play in the center, he switched to the left and just look at the devastation he inflicted. He works so hard, he tracks back and defends all the time and this time being asked to play on the left, he happily obliged. He provided 2 assists and scored 1 goal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I really feel that ronaldo should work on curling his free kicks since most of them run into walls most times. He can do everything on the field, just need some fine tuning to his dead balls.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Kaka should come and then tevez goes. Kaka comes, who replaces ronaldo on the right?</p>

              <p>poolman,</p>
              <p>pls have some respect for where u r posting and grace in ur
              posting. this is a man u subforum. but u keep going that the
              victory was given to them by spurs and not fought hard for by the
              man u players. its not as if the spurs players stand one side and
              never run and tackle.</p>
              <p>do not keep saying gomes this gomes that. yes he was culpable in
              some of the goals, but the strikers have to be in the position to
              be able to take advantage of the mistakes the keeper made. that
              pool could not defeat spurs (actually almost all the top 4, home
              and away, according to the commentator) and yet man u could, does
              not mean u should feel defensive.</p>
              <p><br> lastly, your liverpool fought tooth and nail for your win over a 10
              man hull. my man u also fought hard, if not harder, for the win
              over spurs. 11 man spurs. common logic tells u its harder to get
              past 11 men. some respect pls. hack, even ronaldo was chasing back
              more often last nite. how often to u see the whiner do that..</p>
              <p>if man u had lost last nite, i doubt that i would have blamed
              carl folan for kicking out at the pool player to get sent off and
              gift the game to pool. pool would still have had to put the ball
              into the net to make it count. so pls, dun keep harping that stupid
              referee give penalty that was not there, stupid keeper kelong
              cannot save properly, etc. Respect is the word. </p>

              <p>hey, to be fair to spurs, even with the penalty, they still leading 2-1.</p>
              <p>so why did they collapse? cause they got stomach flu again?</p>
              <p>U have to give credit to MU for pressing and going for the win. But then, I bet U won't even acknowledged that..</p>
              <p>It is bit hard for a poo fan to swallow cause U were full of hope after hull win, and even the half time score 2-0, and then it all just went southwards.</p>
              <p>Don't worry about being offensive, everyone is different, and some just has higher threshold for thrash.</p>
              <p>if U have so much against spurs, please go to their forum and bark at them.</p>
