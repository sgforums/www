              <p>if Spurs goes out .... and gave it a good fight , and still lost
                  5-2 , absolutely no disgrace .</p>
              <p>Their first 30 minutes was good , very good controlling game ,
                  and i do not want to criticise Ferdinand and Vidic , the 2 goals
                  was well taken .</p>
              <p>Spurs was going places with their first half display ....</p>
              <p>Second half , yeah , Mu pressed ..... they still doing well
                  .</p>
              <p>U just don't concede unneccessary contact with players inside
                  the box , u must be professional enough to know that , opponent
                  being 0-2 down , Spurs playing away , opponent can't get any first
                  goal , the last thing they want it's a penalty if possible
                  . that situation  it's not even threatening , and
                  Gomes fell into Mu's trap this time , felling Carrick .</p>
              <p>The first MU goal was crucial at that point .</p>
              <p>MU were running out of ideas before the penalty .</p>
              <p>And please look at Gomes' positioning for that Rooney's goal
                  ! With a defender infront of him , Rooney's angle
                  was limited , leaving Rooney's to have a shot at that only
                  angle , that angle must be covered , but NO , Gomes' positioning
                  was bad , very bad .</p>
              <p>No doubt MU pressed for a win .... and they did it with some
                  blunders from a Brazilian keeper .</p>
              <p>I am saying , MU is always capable in winning at home , whether
                  or not they pressed for it , it's the way Spurs threw away the
                  match ...</p>
              <p>Mind you , i won $300 with a MU win , but why did i criticise
                  Spurs so much ?</p>
              <p>In a fan's prespective , it's sad Spurs , an establish club in
                  London , listed company in the stock exchange , has to go out the
                  pitch head down .</p>
              <p>Hull lost , but they lost with their head held high , no
                  disgrace display , one man down , they still do it like 11 men
                  .</p>
              <p>Liverpool played badly and won . Ugly win .</p>
              <p>Did i mention i blast my own team even if they're winning ?</p>
              <p>Go and YNWA and see my post .</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I am finding all these reasons about Gomez rather silly...
                  Blaming the guy for what? Its not as though we are new to his
                  game... He is a good keeper but yet not fully reliable at times...
                  Thats how he has been since he came to the Premiership... So those
                  saying kelong or Harry is Alex's friend are just plain upset that
                  United got 3 points from a game they were 2 goals down... Simple as
                  that.</p>
              <p>I wouldn't blame Gomez for the 2nd goal cos he had to move a
                  little to the left in case Rooney curl it to that corner... (Like
                  what Macheda did to Villa). From the replay, we could see
                  Rooney moving in, this being the case, he had to move in order to
                  cover the other side as he had a defender covering Rooney for his
                  near post... Its just unfortune for him or a piece of skill from
                  Rooney to shoot it with power under the covering defender's legs
                  and into his near posts corner thats all... And for some to suggest
                  Harry pull back... Think again, Harry was the West Ham manager in
                  1995 that upset Fergie in the title race on the last day or United
                  would have already equal Pool's 18th titles last season...</p>
              <p>The main thing here I belief why they are so upset with
                  Spurs is... Many non-United fans were really looking forward
                  and believed United could drop some serious points in
                  this match... I, to be honest also felt they might only get a
                  draw as Spurs have been in red hot form recently and taken points
                  off all the top 4 sides... Even at Arsenal and Chelsea's home
                  grounds... They even beaten Pool earlier in the season... So when
                  after taking a 2 goals lead then ended up losing... It could really
                  be frustrating for them... I guess they found it hard to swallow...
                  lol</p>
              <p>To be fair to United, go and watch the replay... It all started
                  in the last 10 mins of the first half after United went 2 down...
                  It wasn't after the penalty... Gomez made a number of good saved to
                  keep the score that way going into half time... And this was the
                  same Gomez that saved Giggs injury time free-kick back in Dec to
                  prevent United a win at WHL...</p>
              <p>Ok lah, like I have said at the start, bottom line is you
                  guys are just disappointed United got all 3 points from a
                  position of 2 goals down... It was an opportunity lost I
                  understand, it can be very upsetting but these things
                  happens... So to those upset Pool fans or anti-United fans, just
                  get over it... Look towards the next match lah...</p>
