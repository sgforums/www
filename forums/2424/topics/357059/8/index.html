              <p>Didn't really read all the posts, but basically what I feel is there's nothing wrong with Poolman giving his own views of the match in this topic. Although can tell emotion is getting the better of him a little.</p>
              <p>At least he not been crude and offensive or downright idiotic like some other so-called EPL fans. And I don't just mean those who keep posting under different nicks.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile Poolman, I think you meant to say "non-existent". "Not existent" and "inexistence" aren't really the correct forms.</p>

              <p>hey, to be fair to spurs, even with the penalty, they still leading 2-1.</p>
              <p>so why did they collapse? cause they got stomach flu again?</p>
              <p>U have to give credit to MU for pressing and going for the win. But then, I bet U won't even acknowledged that..</p>
              <p>It is bit hard for a poo fan to swallow cause U were full of hope after hull win, and even the half time score 2-0, and then it all just went southwards.</p>
              <p>Don't worry about being offensive, everyone is different, and some just has higher threshold for thrash.</p>
              <p>if U have so much against spurs, please go to their forum and bark at them.</p>

              <p>for mu to beat spurs , it's everyone's expectation . Whether or not u pressed for it , it's normal for MU to press for a win .</p>
              <p>It's the way Spurs conceded the match . And their 'keeper of course .</p>
              <p>it's easy to swallow a MU win , cos everyone expecting it !</p>
              <p>Again , it's the way how Spurs did it .</p>

              <p>if Spurs goes out .... and gave it a good fight , and still lost 5-2 , absolutely no disgrace .</p>
              <p>Their first 30 minutes was good , very good controlling game , and i do not want to criticise Ferdinand and Vidic , the 2 goals was well taken .</p>
              <p>Spurs was going places with their first half display ....</p>
              <p>Second half , yeah , Mu pressed ..... they still doing well .</p>
              <p>U just don't concede unneccessary contact with players inside the box , u must be professional enough to know that , opponent being 0-2 down , Spurs playing away , opponent can't get any first goal , the last thing they want it's a penalty if possible . that situation  it's not even threatening , and Gomes fell into Mu's trap this time , felling Carrick .</p>
              <p>The first MU goal was crucial at that point .</p>
              <p>MU were running out of ideas before the penalty .</p>
              <p>And please look at Gomes' positioning for that Rooney's goal ! With a defender infront of him , Rooney's angle was limited , leaving Rooney's to have a shot at that only angle , that angle must be covered , but NO , Gomes' positioning was bad , very bad .</p>
              <p>No doubt MU pressed for a win .... and they did it with some blunders from a Brazilian keeper .</p>
              <p>I am saying , MU is always capable in winning at home , whether or not they pressed for it , it's the way Spurs threw away the match ...</p>
              <p>Mind you , i won $300 with a MU win , but why did i criticise Spurs so much ?</p>
              <p>In a fan's prespective , it's sad Spurs , an establish club in London , listed company in the stock exchange , has to go out the pitch head down .</p>
              <p>Hull lost , but they lost with their head held high , no disgrace display , one man down , they still do it like 11 men .</p>
              <p>Liverpool played badly and won . Ugly win .</p>
              <p>Did i mention i blast my own team even if they're winning ?</p>
              <p>Go and YNWA and see my post .</p>

              <p>I think the spurs players got complacent.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For the past few weeks, Man U was playing very ordinary soccer and easily beatable.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All spurs had to do was just slow the pace of the game down and keep possession of the ball for the second half.  For a team like Tottenham, I don't think that was a tall order.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Worse come to worse, they allow Man U to come back from behind and draw 2-2.  At 2-2, you could still play possession football and play it tight at the back for the draw.  After all, spurs was the visiting team.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But to let in 5 goals like that, even teams like Sunderland, West Brom wouldn't have allowed Man U to score 5 goals in the 2nd half like that. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              I was wondering why fergie did not send in someone to help out evra at the left side, as Lennon was clearly owning evra easily.
              
              Earlier this season against chelsea, fergie did employ park to track back jose bosingwa.

              <p>Seriously i find it hugely amusing why its so difficult for people to accept the fact that 2nd half came on, man utd simply turn the tempo up, its quite evident to see that.</p>
              <p>Once, the whistle blew for kick off, Man Utd players were simply fired up and trying to chase the game and chase the ball, something which I havent seen for a very long time. However, I would even add on to the fact that after man utd were 4-2 up, they start to become more complacent and laid back and "arrogant".</p>
              <p>Controversial penalty lah, keeper blunder lah, conspiracy kelong lah. Fuckin wake up and listen to yourself. If the score would had remained to be 2-1 in favour of Spurs, would all these bullshit come up? Fucking ball is round, mixture of luck, hunger and class, adds up to that great display of come back football.</p>
              <p>How many times in history, did controversial penalties given against the leading team, lead to the leading team being whacked 5 goals? What a load of narrow-minded bull crap to say the penalty was the main reason that lead to the avalanche of 5 goals.<br><br>(No specific offense to Liverpool) Would it be fair to say Shevchenko was kelong for not being able to score during the Champs league final of AC Milan vs Liverpool match, that ended 3-3? perhaps he did kelong. Like I said, maybe Mas Selamat controls all these conspiracies and all you people who claim it to be kelong and all, your so fucking smart, your even smarter than FBI and CIA for making such claims. Go run for president, I will vote for you.</p>
              <p>And, you cant just compare Sunderland and West Brom to Spurs like that. Middlesbrough only let Arsenal scored 2 but Liverpool (No disrespect again, just  for example sake) let in 4, does that mean Middlesbrough better than Liverpool? No right? So cannot say like that mah..</p>
              <p>I'm not trying to say, Man Utd is superly brilliant here or anything. But I think people are awarding the scoreline to the discredits of so called controversies that are mere bullshit, rather than crediting the class and hunger showed by Man Utd for that period of time. I am not one who always gloat forever about Man Utd just because I'm a Man Utd fan. When they win but play like shit, I discredit the shitheads and gave credit to where it is due. Can go check the past few threads in this forum. But pls, don't come in here and try to discredit and ignore football at its best. Give credits and discredits where they are due. Don't come and talk shit.</p>
              <p>If you realise, I didn't mention names. Just a general rant.</p>

              <p>I am finding all these reasons about Gomez rather silly... Blaming the guy for what? Its not as though we are new to his game... He is a good keeper but yet not fully reliable at times... Thats how he has been since he came to the Premiership... So those saying kelong or Harry is Alex's friend are just plain upset that United got 3 points from a game they were 2 goals down... Simple as that.</p>
              <p>I wouldn't blame Gomez for the 2nd goal cos he had to move a little to the left in case Rooney curl it to that corner... (Like what Macheda did to Villa). From the replay, we could see Rooney moving in, this being the case, he had to move in order to cover the other side as he had a defender covering Rooney for his near post... Its just unfortune for him or a piece of skill from Rooney to shoot it with power under the covering defender's legs and into his near posts corner thats all... And for some to suggest Harry pull back... Think again, Harry was the West Ham manager in 1995 that upset Fergie in the title race on the last day or United would have already equal Pool's 18th titles last season...</p>
              <p>The main thing here I belief why they are so upset with Spurs is... Many non-United fans were really looking forward and believed United could drop some serious points in this match... I, to be honest also felt they might only get a draw as Spurs have been in red hot form recently and taken points off all the top 4 sides... Even at Arsenal and Chelsea's home grounds... They even beaten Pool earlier in the season... So when after taking a 2 goals lead then ended up losing... It could really be frustrating for them... I guess they found it hard to swallow... lol</p>
              <p>To be fair to United, go and watch the replay... It all started in the last 10 mins of the first half after United went 2 down... It wasn't after the penalty... Gomez made a number of good saved to keep the score that way going into half time... And this was the same Gomez that saved Giggs injury time free-kick back in Dec to prevent United a win at WHL...</p>
              <p>Ok lah, like I have said at the start, bottom line is you guys are just disappointed United got all 3 points from a position of 2 goals down... It was an opportunity lost I understand, it can be very upsetting but these things happens... So to those upset Pool fans or anti-United fans, just get over it... Look towards the next match lah...</p>

              <p>oh yeah , i do admit , first to admit , i expect Spurs to do better than that .... I really hope that night , Spurs can give MU a run for their $$$ . </p>

              <p>Absolutely alright if they played their hearts out and lost .</p>
              <p>They just did not live up to Tottenham's expectation .</p>
              <p>The good old times of Clive Allen scoring for fun ... was just a distance memory now .</p>
              <p>The current Spurs squad must see the good old Spur's video , on " How to play like Ossie Ardiles and Steve Archibald " .</p>
