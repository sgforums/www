              <p><strong>Wayne Rooney is readying himself for a pivotal season in his career, as he admits that he is desperate to realise his full potential.</strong></p>
              <p>The England striker is expected to shoulder more of the Reds' goalscoring burden following Cristiano Ronaldo's departure and, with the 2010 World Cup looming large, he is hell-bent on making it a season to remember.</p>
              <p>“For me personally, next season could be the season that transforms me from someone who could be a great player into someone who is a great player,” Rooney told <em>The Times</em>.</p>
              <p>“That’s what I’m hoping. It’s a massive season for the club and for me personally, with the prize at the end of it being the World Cup. It’s a season which I want to grab with both hands."</p>
              <p>Since bursting onto the scene as a gifted but volatile 16-year-old with Everton, Rooney's improvement as a player has been obvious. Now a highly-decorated 23-year-old, Rooney still simmers close to the boil in order to retain his on-field edge, and he has pledged to continue to give everything for the United cause this term.</p>
              <p>"The older you get, the more you try to set a good example rather than a bad example," he said. "On the pitch I’m a competitor and when you’re playing in the biggest league in the world, especially when I was starting at such a young age, there are a lot of emotions.</p>
              <div id="news05LeftStory">
              <p>“I’ve worked on that. Sometimes I get a booking or do something and it’s all over the papers or on the news or whatever. I see other players doing ten times worse and nothing is mentioned. But I understand it.</p>
              <p>“That’s the way I’ve been brought up. I’ve been brought up to try to do the best I can in everything I do. I don’t think I’ve ever come off the pitch and thought that I hadn’t done the best I could have done. Sometimes it goes to plan and sometimes it doesn’t, but I’ve never come off the pitch thinking I didn’t give my best and I don’t think I ever will.”</p>
