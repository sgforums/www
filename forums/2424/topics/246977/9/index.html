I am stunt for words.. I told my friend to wake me up at 330 at least watch a bit cos today got exam paper.. but he woke me at 300 say man u leading 3-0 and i watched the rest of the match and I saw a totally different team playing from the last 2 games. No stupid 4-3-3, no stupid tactics of long balls.. Simply fast paced passing and those nice 1-2 touches which Man U are known for. Each goal was a delightfull watch.. I love that Carrick second goal.. Never doubted Fletcher's industrious nature but his passing is still like crap but he did well today.. If you all realise, the difference between today and the last 2 matches, Man U applied more pressure on the opponents. Roma forwards couldn't have the opportunity to receive the ball and turn and shoot. But you can see that after about the 55th minute (yea I checked the time), can see that Man U starts to slack off.. Guess they are shag from all the pressurising.. Roma couldn't capitalise because psychological mindset kicks in. They are down by so many goals. Demoralise already.. Thank goodness for the early 3 goals in the first 20 minutes. Today was the day when luck was with us. It didn't go away. The shots were converted into goals. But it wasn't the best game ever to be played. It wasn't a perfect Man U game. Rooney, we can see that he starts to tire out and his passes became crappy.. Ferdinand was shag, can see that about 80+ minutes.. I think Fergie should improve the stamina of our lads.. No wonder, Chelsea and Arsenal could get last minute goals against us.. We are always bombarded the last part of the game..<br><br>Nevertheless, GLORY GLORY MAN UNITED! YOU DIDN'T DISAPPOINT ME, US AND ALL FELLOW FAITHFUL RED DEVIL FANS! KEEP THIS UP AND THE 3 TITLES WILL BE A REALITY!! LETS GO!!!!!!!

            <div class='col-md body'>I think Roma caught Man u on a bad night... Cos everything man u shoot seen to be flying in... Both of Carrick's goals were great shots which we hardly ever see him score like that before... And I thought Fletcher had a good game as well in midfield with him... He and Smith were running and cutting out most of the Roma attack... and winning back the ball in midfield.<br><br>He looks more like Owen Hargreaves than the Fletcher of late...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One thing i thought was strange, Patrice Evra came on and played in an unfamiliar right-back role... Perhaps O'shea has not been great in that role as a stand-in. Evra even scored playing in that position for the first time...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://images.skysports.com/images/playerpics06_07/Premiership/ManUtd/carrick_amazed.jpg"><br><br><strong>Michael Carrick admits Manchester United's 7-1 thumping of Roma was the 'stuff of dreams'. Trailing 2-1 from the first leg of their UEFA Champions League quarter-final with the Italians, United delivered a devastating display at Old Trafford to win 8-3 on aggregate.</strong><br><br>Carrick opened the scoring on 12 minutes and was soon followed on to the score sheet by Alan Smith and Wayne Rooney. Cristiano Ronaldo netted either side of half-time before Carrick arrowed in his second of the night, and Patrice Evra rounded off the scoring after Daniele De Rossi's consolation for Roma.<br><br>It was the biggest win in a European Cup or Champions League quarter-final tie in almost 50 years and Carrick was amazed at how United maintained their performance for 90 minutes.<br><br>The Â£18.6million signing from Tottenham Hotspur was brimming with delight after The Red Devils had set up a semi-final meeting with either Bayern Munich or Milan.<br><br>"To start so well and carve up the chances and score the goals we did was a great feeling," said Carrick. "To carry it on for the full game was the stuff of dreams."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think Smith was in cause he is like a terrier, snapping at people's unlike Ole or Saha...<br><br>And SAF didn't want Roma to settle and come at them like in the first leg.<br>Deny them possession and attack. that must be the plan. cause they can't hurt if they don't have the ball.<br><br>Well, it worked.<br><br>It was damn shiok to see Smith scoring again. After his injury, it was deserving.<br>Now for another injury-plagued to step up and do the same, and that would be Michael Owen for Newcastle against Chelsea.<br><br>Irregardless, I hope that the boys will take this feeling and magnified it in the following EPL games and get that bloody EPL title.<br><br></div>
