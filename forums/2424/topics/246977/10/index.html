On that night, there was nail-biting and nerve-shredding right until the final whistle.<br><br>But it had some echoes of that glorious night.<br><br>Before that game, United fans gazed at their programmes and wondered how on earth little Moses - all Afro hair and bad attitude - could hope to live with the football god which was Maradona.<br><br>The answer was a large dose of Mancunian snarl and snap, hustling and badgering the brilliant Argentine into errors.<br><br>A lingering look at last night's team-sheet brought on similar feelings of anxiety and anguish.<br><br>United were ravaged by injury and ruffled by two consecutive defeats, to the point where the subs' bench was populated by the unknown and the unlikely.<br><br>With Alan Smith coming back from injury, John O'Shea slotting in at right-back - hardly his best position - and Darren Fletcher and Michael Carrick handed a tough midfield job, there was every reason to be pessimistic.<br><br>And yet the sight of Fletcher digging into Francesco Totti, admittedly a mere demi-god in comparison to Maradona, while all around him red shirts bristled with serious intent, was enough to lift the spirits.<br><br>What turned out to be a feast of Champions League football was almost soured before a ball had been kicked as mobs of angry United fans roamed around outside the stadium, intent on revenge for the bitter scenes in Rome last week.<br><br>A few innocent Italians received bloody noses, missiles were thrown and threats exchanged. And all the while, the real culprits, the thugs in uniform who laid into the United fans last week, were probably at home, watching it all unfold on the telly, their overtime pay packets bulging in their pockets.<br><br>It is time UEFA made countries which cannot control their police pay for such outrages. If English clubs were banned from Europe in the 80s for the violence of some of their fans, the same should apply to state hooligans.<br><br>Unless the authorities take action, someone will die - the situation goes beyond football.<br><br>The only positive to come out of last week's horrible scenes and the misguided attempts at revenge was that it helped to give the atmosphere inside Old Trafford a real edge.<br><br>Frenzy<br><br>The club itself got it hopelessly wrong again, thinking that loud tannoy music and a pitch-side interview with Wilf McGuinness was the way to whip the masses into a frenzy.<br><br>When the team on the pitch is positively crackling with static, and lightning bolts are hitting the Roma net with frequency and ferocity, artificial attempts at getting things going just look pathetic. There were heroes in red shirts everywhere you looked, not least Smith, who defied all logic to put in a first half display of muscular poise and slick touch which showed that he can be a serious factor in United's run-in to the end of the season.<br><br>Michael Carrick came of age, a paragon of composure and invention in midfield, and capped it all with two of the best goals you will see all season.<br><br>And Cristiano Ronaldo will get plenty of the limelight too for his goals.<br><br>Wayne Rooney said on the day before this game that he felt Ronaldo was by far the best player in the world and was perhaps the one man who could single-handedly win it.<br><br>It was as bold a piece of Scouse con-artistry as you are likely to see, and it appeared that the Italians fell for it big time.<br><br>While the Roma midfield and defence gazed worriedly towards the Portuguese, the slight figure of Ryan Giggs was running them ragged.<br><br>Too old to play two games in three days, Giggs had sat on the bench at Fratton Park as his tired team-mates slumped to defeat.<br><br>You could say that the rest did him good. He roved down the left, he raided down the right, he terrorised the centre.<br><br>And once Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney entered the mood, the Italians were in serious trouble.<br><br>For a while it seemed like the club record win, a 10-0 demolition of hapless Anderlecht by the Busby Babes over 50 years ago, was in jeopardy as the Reds raced to a 6-0 lead within an hour.<br><br>Roma spoiled some of that fun with a goal of their own, but the joy remained unabated.<br><br>Jose Mourinho said at the weekend that he wished his Chelsea team was playing United next week, after that showdown was postponed to accommodate the FA Cup semi-finals. Still fancy it now, Jose?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>something occured to me after watching the goals..<br><br>the roman keeper is kinda lousy, anyway they always had lousy keepers.. even a few seasons ago, was it the italian no.3 or sth..<br><br>if they had a better keeper, i think 2-3 goals could have been avoided, esp those where he was caught off the line and went in via the near post.<br><br>but i'm not taking any credit away from man utd dun mistake me for doing so.</div>
