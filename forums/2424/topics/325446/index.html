              <p><em>By Gary Lim</em></p>
              <p><img src="http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2008-07-27/NP_IMAGES_GLBOY26I_8t.jpg" alt="" width="137" height="251"></p>
              <p>School was over.</p>
              <p>For a group of boys from the School of the Arts, it was watching a movie at Plaza Singapura that was topmost on their minds.</p>
              <p>But for one of their classmates, 12-year-old Nishok, there was only one
              thing on his mind - to watch his favourite player, Anderson, in action
              at the National Stadium, where the Brazilian Olympic team was holding a
              public training session yesterday.</p>
              <p><img src="http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2008-07-27/NP_IMAGES_GLBOY26A_8t.jpg" alt="" width="137" height="187"></p>
              <p>Despite the peer pressure, Nishok left them and made his way to the ground alone in the unrelenting drizzle.</p>
              <p>Nishok would never imagine how his persistence was to pay off.</p>
              <p>As the Brazilians were about to wind down their session, the Manchester United and Brazil fan suddenly broke into a song.</p>
              <p>It went: 'Anderson-son-son, he's better than Kleberson...'</p>
              <p>And it certainly caught the attention of the 20-year-old United midfielder.</p>
              <p>First he waved at Nishok.</p>
              <p>A while later, he pointed towards the boy while sitting down and talking to a team-mate.</p>
              <p>Then came the unexpected as his team-mates trooped off the field.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anderson stood up, and headed towards a stunned Nishok.</p>
              <p>With a swing of his arm, he threw up a boot.</p>
              <p><img src="http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2008-07-27/NP_IMAGES_GLBOY26Bt.jpg" alt="" width="137" height="59"></p>
              <p>It was caught by someone next to Nishok, but Anderson signalled for it to be passed to him instead.</p>
              <p><strong>SING</strong></p>
              <p>Then, he threw the remaining boot.</p>
              <p>It was enough for the Secondary 1 student to break into tears.</p>
              <p>He said afterwards: 'I just felt that he should know that I'm his fan, so I started to sing.</p>
              <p>'And the crowd was getting quiet, and I wanted to make it livelier.</p>
              <p>'His gesture was something I least expected.</p>
              <p>'I thought he was just going to come over and say 'hi'.'</p>
              <p><img src="http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2008-07-27/NP_IMAGES_GLBOY26Et.jpg" alt="" width="137" height="84"></p>
              <p>But that wasn't all.</p>
              <p>As Anderson warmed down at the side of
              the pitch, he signalled for the Brazilian media officer to invite
              Nishok down from the grandstand on to the field, to have a chat with
              him.</p>
              <p>For the second time, Nishok was the envy of the 500 plus spectators, as he chatted with the player for close to five minutes.</p>
              <p>At one point, Brazil coach Dunga even helped him to snap a photograph.</p>
              <p>Nishok, who plays football with his friends once a week, said: 'His first words to me were, 'How are you, my friend?'.</p>
              <p><img src="http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2008-07-27/NP_IMAGES_GLBOY26Ct.jpg" alt="" width="137" height="194"></p>
              <p>'Then, he asked me to sing him the song again, so that he could hear the lyrics clearly.'</p>
              <p>For good measure, Anderson also signed on the pair of boots.</p>
              <p>When it was all over, Nishok suddenly found himself becoming the
              darling of the media, as journalists converged around him for an
              interview.</p>
              <p>For the moment, he was the star.</p>
              <p>For sure, he was glad to have made the trip to the National Stadium despite having no one willing to keep him company.</p>
              <p><img src="http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2008-07-27/NP_IMAGES_GLBOY26Dt.jpg" alt="" width="137" height="82"></p>
              <p>He said: 'They were laughing at me.</p>
              <p>'They called me crazy to go to the stadium alone, and despite the rain.</p>
              <p>'But I didn't care.'</p>
              <p>Now, there's no doubt who's having the last laugh.</p>
              <p><img src="http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2008-07-27/NP_IMAGES_GLBOY26Ft.jpg" alt="" width="137" height="69"></p>
              <p>Added Nishok, as his eyes went moist once more: 'I will remember this for the rest of my life.'</p>
              <p>Fairy tales do come true after all.</p>
              <p><img src="http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2008-07-27/NP_IMAGES_GLBOY26Gt.jpg" alt="" width="137" height="218"></p>
              <p><strong>THE ANDERSON SONG:</strong></p>
              <p>Anderson-son-son, he's better than Kleberson.</p>
              <p>Anderson-son-son, he's a midfield magician.</p>
              <p>To the left, to the right, to the samba beat all night.</p>
              <p>He is fast, he is class, and he s***s on Fabregas.</p>
