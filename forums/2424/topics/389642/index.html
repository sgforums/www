              <p><strong>Both Sir Alex and Nani claimed the Portuguese winger produced his best performance in a United shirt on Sunday as United beat Arsenal 3-1 at the Emirates Stadium.<br><br></strong>A brilliant piece of skill and a cute, chipped cross led to United’s first (claimed by Nani but credited as an own goal) and it was Nani who laid on the Reds’ spectacular second. In fact, the Reds’ no.17 was at the heart of United’s most penetrating attacks time and time again.<br><br>“I played well,” Nani admitted. “I scored one goal, provided an assist and had a few other chances to score. It was a fantastic performance and I’m happy to help my team win this game.”<br><br>Whether or not Nani will be credited with the strike will probably be a matter for the Dubious Goals Panel. It will almost certainly rule on the goal, although most pundits on Sunday agreed it should go down as an own goal. Nani – surprise, surprise – had other ideas.<br><br>"Of course it's my goal," he said. "I put the ball into the goal so it should be my goal. I did everything to make it happen. I was very confident and the dribble [on the touchline to beat two Arsenal defenders] worked very well. I'm really happy to contribute to today's win."<br><br>Meanwhile, Sir Alex was thrilled with the 23-year-old's performance on Sunday and agreed it was his finest yet for the Reds. <br><br>“Nani's last three games have been absolutely first class and today was his best,” the United boss said. "He was absolutely outstanding. <br><br>“It’s difficult to say why we’re seeing his best form now, but maybe maturity is one reason. He’s a very shy boy and maybe his personality is getting stronger and better for dealing with playing for us every week. Today was an example of that maturity.<br><br>"Hopefully games like that will give him the confidence to know he’s a United player. When you talk to the other players, they all want him to play, they all think he’s fantastic."<br><br>Nani, who’s now made 50 league appearances for United, is confident he can produce more top performances as the Reds chase a record fourth consecutive league title.<br><br>“I’m working hard every day to be fit and ready to play. I’m very happy because I feel the confidence from my team-mates, the manager and the fans. I hope I can continue to show good form. I'm feeling better with every game I play."</p>
