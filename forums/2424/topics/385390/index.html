              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson insists he would be delighted if the Premier League did not turn into a two-horse race this season.</span></p>
              <p><span><span id="intelliTXT">Â </span></span></p>
              <p>Already this term, a general view has been concluded that Ferguson's Manchester United side will be scrapping it out with Carlo Ancelotti's Chelsea by the time May comes around.</p>
              <p>Yet a bizarre sequence of results last weekend - including Aston Villa's victory over United at Old Trafford - has cast doubt on such statements.</p>
              <p>And, with Tottenham returning to winning ways during the week, there is a sense of optimism about the possibility of a genuinely open title race, one that Ferguson would welcome.</p>
              <p>"It could be open," said Ferguson. "It is a tough league. The form of Aston Villa makes you look over your shoulder and say "Hey, wait a minute".</p>
              <p>"And Tottenham are challenging in that top group as well.</p>
              <p>"The history of the league points to it being between two teams but, from the spectator and general interest point of view, you hope it changes.</p>
              <p>"It would be good if four or five teams are involved in the last month of the season. It would be fantastic."</p>
              <p>It seems, even for someone like Ferguson, who has been involved in most of the title scraps over the past two decades, the predictability of the Premier League is becoming a bit boring.</p>
              <p>Not that he is likely to blunt his own team's edge to give anyone else more of a chance, hence confirmation, just as he was being pitched into a Champions League meeting with old friend David Beckham, that Ryan Giggs had signed a one-year contract extension.</p>
              <p>Over the past 18 months, Giggs has produced some of the most consistently high-class football of his career.</p>
              <p>It is certainly only this year that his incredible achievements have received an appropriate acknowledgement.</p>
              <p>Either side of collecting his 11th Premier League title, the 36-year-old was named PFA Player of the Year and BBC Sports Personality of the Year.</p>
              <p>Yet, after claiming Ferguson could carry on as United boss for another five years, Giggs has been tipped to terrorise top-flight defences for another two seasons after this.</p>
              <p>"Ryan deserves a new contract and I am sure that he will play for another two years," said Ferguson.</p>
              <p>"His form is fantastic at the moment and he is playing some of his best football."</p>
              <p>Giggs' longevity sets a standard few others will get close to matching.</p>
              <p>However, in overcoming long-standing hamstring trouble, he also gives hope to Rio Ferdinand and Owen Hargreaves, who are stepping up their own fight for fitness.</p>
              <p>Ferdinand has not featured for United since being exposed by Fernando Torres at Anfield in October, while Hargreaves has now been missing for almost 15 months after undergoing career-saving knee operations to cure a tendinitis problem.</p>
              <p>While Ferdinand stated earlier this week that he was not in danger of missing the World Cup with a long-standing back complaint, Fabio Capello has stated that Hargreaves must make his comeback soon if he is to stand a chance of getting to South Africa.</p>
              <p>The England coach will therefore be an interested observer to see whether Ferdinand and Hargreaves fulfil Sir Alex Ferguson's stated aims for a return to first-team duties.</p>
              <p>"Rio is improving," said Ferguson. "He is much better now and not too far away, probably two or three weeks.</p>
              <p>"And Owen is doing a bit better this week as well.</p>
              <p>"He is getting there slowly and we hope he will be back by the end of January."</p>
              <p>Neither will be involved at Fulham on Saturday though. And with Edwin van der Sar, who has returned to Holland for a further assessment on his knee injury, heading a catalogue of injuries, Ferguson can only cross his fingers that Nemanja Vidic will have recovered from a calf strain in time to face Fulham at Craven Cottage on Saturday.</p>
              <p>Roy Hodgson has won plenty of praise for his work at Fulham over the last couple of years, with suggestions even being raised that the 62-year-old could be asked to replace Fabio Capello when the Italian quits the England hot-seat.</p>
              <p>Ferguson is full of praise for Hodgson's achievements, which continued this week when a much-changed Fulham line-up earned a Europa League last 32 encounter with Shakhtar Donetsk by beating Basle in Switzerland.</p>
              <p>"There is no question Fulham's improvement is down to the manager," said Ferguson.</p>
              <p>"It is a remarkable turnaround. Who would have thought Fulham would not only qualify for Europe but got into the latter stages by winning away after they have made five changes Wednesday."</p>
