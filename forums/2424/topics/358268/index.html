              Darren Fletcher produced another all-conquering display in the Reds' midfield during Wednesday's 1-0 win over Arsenal, and the Scot has revealed he's revelling in his best season yet for United.
              
              Top-class performances have become the norm for Fletcher this season, he's been a regular fixture in the first-team this season with 38 appearances and influencing games with increasingly mature displays.
              
              "In terms of games played, consistency and level of performances, Iâ€™d say this is definitely my best season," he told United Review. "That comes with age, and Iâ€™m more mature now at 25. Iâ€™ve played a lot of games and that helps your performance levels; Iâ€™ve definitely seen the improvement for that.
              
              "In other seasons my performances have been a bit more staggered in terms of not playing for a few weeks and then coming in, which is a lot harder to do. This year, having a run of games has made my performances and my confidence improve. Iâ€™ve really enjoyed being in central midfield because itâ€™s my natural and best position. I just hope it continues now because weâ€™ve still got two trophies to win."
              
              Fletcher was a pivotal figure in United's first-half blitz of the Gunners in the first leg of the Champions League semi-final. The Scot is a recognised big-game player, which is just as well with plenty of crunch matches coming up before the end of the season.
              
              "The Champions League and Premier League arenâ€™t decided yet and all thatâ€™s gone has got us in this situation, so thereâ€™s still a lot to play for," adds Fletch. "This is the business end of the season now where big games decide league championships, weâ€™re in the Champions League semi-finals and want to be in the final, and these are the games you want to be part of."
