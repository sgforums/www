            <div class='col-md body'>Darren Fletcher may make a surprise return from a fractured leg in Scotland's crucial Euro 2008 qualifier against Georgia on Wednesday after being called into the national squad.<br><br>The 23-year-old midfielder hasnÂ’t played since fracturing his leg in ScotlandÂ’s monumental 1-0 win over France last month, but his return Â– in whatever capacity Â– would be a major boost for Scots boss Alex McLeish after the withdrawal of injury victims Scott Brown and Alan Hutton.<br><br>McLeish told Sky Sports News: "Sir Alex says Darren will play next weekend for Manchester United, therefore he can play for Scotland. It's fantastic news. Whether we start him, we'll have to wait and see, but he's got a big chance of playing."<br><br>The Scots are tantalisingly close to qualification for next summer's finals, and McLeish is well aware of the need for strong characters in what is a tricky away tie. "Darren is a big player," he said. "He's a United player and they exude an aura. To be fair, though, the squad already has that aura because of the results and performances we've had recently."<br><br>Elsewhere on the international stage, Patrice Evra played the full 90 minutes as France won 6-0 against Faroe Islands. He'll be hoping for another chance to impress against Lithuania on Wednesday.<br><br>Cristiano Ronaldo was on form again for Portugal, who beat Azerbaijan away 2-0. The home side had captain Aslan Kerimov sent off for an elbow on UnitedÂ’s wing wizard, but the 22-year-old dusted himself down and continued to terrorise the home sideÂ’s defence. Reds team-mate Nani came on as a second-half substitute.<br><br>Portugal face another away match on Wednesday against Kazakhstan. Luiz Felipe ScolariÂ’s men are now four points behind Group A leaders Poland (who don't play on Wednesday) with a game in hand. Serbia, however, struggled without Nemanja Vidic as they drew 0-0 with Armenia. Portugal and Finland are now both three points ahead of the Serbs in Group A.<br><br>There was good news for Wayne Rooney. The Reds front man grabbed his first England goal in 11 months in a routine 3-0 victory over Estonia at Wembley. Rio Ferdinand was substituted at half-time during the win as he is one booking away from suspension.<br><br>Steve McClarenÂ’s side now face a pivotal trip to Russia on Wednesday three points behind Group E leaders Croatia, who England play in the final qualifying match in November.<br><br></div>
