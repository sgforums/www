            <div class='col-md body'>Reds defender Rio Ferdinand says England need to gel as a team if they are to succeed in major tournaments.<br><br>The current crop of English players have been described as a "golden generation", with several of the national squad of world renown. But Ferdinand says individuals are not enough to win the big World Cups and European Championships.<br><br>"The players are as good as people say they are," he said. "On paper, the squad has as much quality as anyone out there. But what is written on paper doesn't win you matches and tournaments.<br><br>"Brazil are proof of that. Most of their midfield and attacking players would get into any side at the World Cup but they didn't win it. That shows great individuals do not necessarily make great teams, which is why it doesn't really matter what people say about the players themselves, it's the team that matters most."<br><br>Ferdinand is in Steve McClaren's squad for the fortchcoming fixtures against Macedonia and Croatia along with six United team-mates. The 27-year-old centre-back says the biggest task lying ahead for McClaren's men is to ignore the hype that so often surrounds the national side.<br><br>"People have spoken about this being the Golden Generation," he added. "They said that about us before the World Cup and we didn't do anything. But the management in place now will ensure the players do not get lulled into a false sense of security and think we have a divine right to be in the last four."<br><br></div>
