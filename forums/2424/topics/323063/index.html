              <p><strong>The Glazer family are resigned to losing Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid, according to reports in Spain.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Madrid-based daily <em>AS</em> reports that the American owners of Manchester United are currently working on the assumption that the Portuguese winger will make his 'dream' move to Real.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The paper claims - after several conversations with United chief executive David Gill - the Glazers realise that Ronaldo's departure is inevitable, and will have to begin negotiations with Real over what is sure to be a world record transfer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ronaldo's agent Jorge Mendes has reportedly told United that his client wants to make the move, and although definite negotiations have not yet started, a transfer is an inevitability.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>AS claims that a bid of around 70-75 million Euros (just under £60million) will be enough to persuade United to sell their prize asset.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If true, this news is unlikely to go down well with Alex Ferguson, who quite apart from losing his best player, had previously stated that he believed the Glazers would stand firm in the face of interest from Madrid.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ferguson said in June: "Their attitude is 'To hell with them'. "They'd sit a player in the stand, I'm telling you, absolutely no doubt about it, just to prove a point."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ronaldo is currently on holiday following Euro 2008, and is set to undergo surgery on an ankle injury in the next few days.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With a recuperation period of around four weeks, Ronaldo seems keen to avoid a potential meeting with Ferguson, telling a Portuguese newspaper: "I can only say that I will spend the period of my recovery in my house in Sintra."</p>

              <p><span class="D"><span style="color: #ff0000;">After weeks of Marca promoting the Portuguese star's increasingly problematic switch, the strongest Madrid-leaning paper, has now waded in with a claim that a deal will be done.<br><br>While AS recognise that Sir Alex Ferguson will continue to strongly object to the transfer, the owners of the Red Devils are tempted, according to the report.<br><br>It was reported some weeks ago that Madrid were considering by-passing the vociferous Scottish manager in order to try and tempt the Glazers and it may be working.<br><br>After a meeting with United executive director, David Gill, the club's bosses are even more convinced that the cash on offer is worth more than the player himself.<br><br>The latest reportes on Ronaldo requiring surgery have not thought to have dampened Madrid's desire, because as stated yesterday, they cannot afford to miss out on signing him.<br><br>Some figures within the Bernabéu doubt the sense in splashing out so much money when the club's debts are already alleged to be borering on €400m, but president Ramón Calderón is keen to press on.<br><br>Previous figures of €90m were mentioned, but AS now state that Madrid will look to bring it down to below €70m in order to keep some restraint.<br></span></span></p>

              <h1>United Accept Madrid's Ronaldo Bid?</h1>
              <h2>News sources in Spain suggest that Manchester United have accepted Real Madrid's offer for Cristiano Ronaldo.</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p>According to radio station Onda Cero, Real Madrid have reached a "principle of agreement" with Manchester United over the Portuguese star, who has been under the radar of the Merengues following a top-notch season at Old Trafford.<br><br>Although Manchester United are reluctant to part with Ronaldo, they prefer doing business for the 23-year-old rather than having one of their valuable pieces unhappy in their ranks.<br><br>It is understood that Ronaldo's transfer to Santiago Bernabéu will be finalised in the next few days and will involve a fee in the region of 90 million euros, thus becoming the most expensive transfer fee in football history, if confirmed.<br><br>The 2007/08 European Golden Shoe award winner, who joined Manchester United from Sporting CP in 2003 for a fee of €15 million, scored a total of 42 goals for The Red Devils last season.</p>
