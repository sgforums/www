              <h2>It looks like Nemanja Vidic will be giving a pair of guided tours
              around his beloved Manchester in the near future, as United snare a
              pair of up-and-comers from his homeland.</h2>
              <p>Serbian prospect Zoran Tosic has confirmed that he is set to sign for
              Manchester United in January, while compatriot and current Partizan
              Belgrade team-mate Adem Ljajic will remain on home-soil until the end
              of the season. <br><br>A deal was reached between the Red Devils and
              Partizan last month about the transfer of the pair, although the
              European champions had a nervous wait ahead of a work-permit appeal for
              Tosic. <br><br>With the paper-work in place, the 21-year-old is ready
              to move to the Premier League on the first day of the transfer window,
              although he admits that is it gut-wrenching to leave the Grobari. <br><br>Tosic told the press: "I'm going to Manchester to do a medical exam, but I will return in three days.<br><br>"I hope everything will be okay, but I must confess that it's hard to leave my club Partizan.<br><br>"When
              I was replaced in the game against Vojvodina, it was so strange and a
              hard feeling. I sat on the bench any said to myself this could be my
              last game for Partizan.<br><br>"But I hope that I will return one day.
              Of course, there is a big feeling of pride, I'm off to sign for the
              biggest club in the world, which is my favourite from my early years.<br><br>"My goal is to continue progress as footballer and I want to show Manchester United that my transfer wasn't a bad thing."<br><br>Meanwhile, Adem Ljajic looks set to remain with Partizan until the summer, when a mooted deal is due to take place. <br><br>The 17-year-old has been to Old Trafford as a guest and will reassess his situation at the end of the current campaign. <br><br>He
              told the press: "I was in Manchester once as a guest. I had a chance to
              look at how things are going on in a big club and now I will have
              another look.<br><br>"I'm staying in Partizan at least until the end of the season and then we will see what happens."</p>
