            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.teamtalk.com//Images/105006.jpg"><br><br><strong>Wing king Cristiano Ronaldo has claimed he is not interested in joining Real Madrid - and wants to extend his stay at Manchester United. The 22-year-old has been heavily linked with moves to both Real and Barcelona in recent weeks but Barca claimed on Tuesday they have made no approach, and Real's hopes of signing him now appear to have been dashed. </strong><br><br>The Portuguese winger said: "I consider myself a United footballer who is playing well and trying to help the team. "If things keep going well, I want to stay here. I'm not a Galactico. "I'm only thinking about United and I want to stay here for more than two more years. "I want to leave my mark on this era, win titles and be a figure in the history of this club."<br><br>Ronaldo is on track to surpass Ronaldinho as the best player in the world, according to United's skills development coach Rene Meulensteen. The Dutch coaching expert claims Ronaldo's courage to try new things on the pitch and willingness to learn will see the winger overtake the Brazilian.<br><br>Meulensteen, who has worked with Ronaldo from when he first joined United, said in his column on www.manutd.com: "He's got the same attributes as Ronaldinho, a complete range of skills, and he's heading very swiftly to becoming the best player in the world.<br><br>"I asked him what his aim was and he said he wanted to win plenty of prizes with the team, and be the best player in the world. That's good. If you're going to have a dream, it had better be a big one! "I asked him where he was on a scale of 1-10 towards reaching that goal and he wasn't sure. I told him he was at an 8. If he can add little bits to his game then 9 and 10 will come very quickly. "But, what I think will eventually make him the best in the world is that he's got the courage to try new things on the pitch. It might not come off at first, but it will sooner or later."<br><br>He added: "At the end of Cristiano's first season with United, I said he was the most talented, technically-gifted player at United in terms of tricks. All he needed was to become effective with his skills, and that's the transition he's made this season. "Top attacking players at the highest level possess an element of unpredictability. That's what I've talked to Cristiano about. If he gets the ball and always starts to run with it then the defender gets wise to it. It's the same if he always passes it.<br><br>"He's made tremendous strides forward. He knows now that every time he steps on a pitch he's going to make an impact. Because of what he's created already, defenders stand off him. That means he's already created the time and space to run." Meulensteen also believes Ronaldo's mental attitude will help him achieve his ambitions. He said: "It's his attitude that I like about him. He has got the mentality that he can always add to his game. He never gets complacent. He's a quick boy, a very intelligent learner. He's always trying new things.<br><br>"He's also learning the power of standing still, which is very under-rated. At the top level, defenders don't dive in. If they do, then one pass and you're gone. It's very functional, because you're standing still and then it's explosive when you move."<br></div>

SunSport revealed on Saturday the Portuguese ace is set to sign a new five-year contract worth a massive Â£28million. And Ronaldo, 22, has now told Real Madrid and Barcelona he is not interested in being their next superstar signing.</strong><br><br>His priority is to be one of Old TraffordÂ’s all-time greats Â— and not to line up alongside La LigaÂ’s galaxy of show-off stars. Ronnie said: Â“No, no, no. I consider myself a footballer at Manchester United who is playing well and trying to help the team. Â“If things keep going well I want to stay here. IÂ’m not a Galactico. IÂ’m only thinking about Manchester United and I want to stay here for more than another two years.<br><br>Â“I want to leave my mark on this era, win titles and be a figure in the history of this club.Â” The winger has received positive feedback from his agent Jorge Mendes about his new Â£100,000-a-week contract talks and does not envisage any problems.<br><br>He added: Â“WeÂ’re negotiating and everything is being defined for me to stay here. Jorge is talking with the club and I think everything will turn out well and I will stay here.Â” Ronaldo does not hide his desire to eventually play in Spain after fulfilling his United ambitions. He admitted: Â“I want to stay here but nobody knows whatÂ’s in the future. As I said a long time ago, one day I want to play in Spain. Â“But right now IÂ’m happy where I am and I want to continue because IÂ’m at a great football club.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s always important to know the biggest clubs are interested in your work as it means everything is going very well.Â” Ronaldo has finally silenced the jeers he faced after his role in Wayne Roo-neyÂ’s World Cup red card. He added: Â“The season is going well. IÂ’m happy things are better for me. The English fans are content and I want to carry on like this.Â”<br><br></div>

Speaking after his two goals eased Portugal to a 4-0 victory over Belgium, the forward contemplated his standing in world football: "Am I the best in the world? I have been improving my game and I'm in a great shape this year. I feel mature. The Manchester United players are by my side and I also have a great help in the national team. But of course I believe I am one of the best.</strong><br><br>"I have a good contract in financial terms and what really matters to me is to show my game. It's a good sign to know that I have so many clubs interested in me, but I'm very happy where I am and I hope to stay in Manchester United for many years."<br><br>RamÃ³n CalderÃ³n, though, has admitted for the first time that Real Madrid want to sign Ronaldo - and has revealed that he is prepared to break the bank to get his man. The Real president told a Mexican newspaper that he would attempt to sign Ronaldo and said: "The only way to convince Manchester United will be to put a lot of money on the table."<br><br>Ronaldo added that Belgium's goalkeeper, Stijn Stijnen, who had advocated putting him out of the game early on, apologised to him after the game.<br><br></div>
