              <p><br>Yup... Much better than Joe to me.</p>
              <p>And I can understand why he cost more than joe too...</p>
              <p>Another thing is he's 23 only... While he can still improve after going to a bigger club and playing along side better players, Joe is already at that point where he probably won't get any better...</p>
              <p>There could also be some problems to Joe's style as to why some managers like Mourinho and Scolari hardly play him... Maybe he is too selfish at times or something... Who knows but it is a fact Mourinho and Scolari seldom play him or don't think he is that important a player in their squad.</p>
              <p>I don't think one can judge him by only watching youtube... His overall game like tracking back to help defend, his speed or his teamwork with fellow team mates all could be part of it... Which could explain Wigan's good showing so far.   </p>

              <p><br>Not I say one... We all have eyes to see, we all know very well under Mourinho and Scolari, joe seldom play... I guess is they don't think he is that important a player to their squad or we would have seen him play much more under them right? You don't see them drop Robben or Lampard do we? Jose even prefer to go with SWP rather than Joe... Joe seems like quite a selfish winger... He is like Lampard also like to shoot and not pass to team mates... But Lampard can score he seldom...</p>
              <p>Valencia is also much younger than Joe right?</p>
              <p>Joe has been waiting for Chelsea to give him another contract which may not even come... While Valencia has 2 of the biggest clubs interested on him... Bruce already said they had a concrete offer from Real but they rejected it...</p>

              <p>lols i think if a player doesnt get to play i wouldn think he is lousy or something.. i've seen joe cole played and i think he is the best in england in his kind.. no other english player i have seen so far who is as technically gifted as him..</p>
              <p>i see joe cole played, and i only see valencia on youtube.. so my judgement is that valencia looks ordinary but thats cos i seen him on youtube so tats why i ask ppl if hes really that good.. and joe cole most of the time delivered both for england and for chelsea when he is called upon..</p>
              <p>under mourinho, dont think he didnt played bcos he's not gd enuff.. he cannot fit in the team and in mourinho's tactics i guess.. scolari dun say liao i aso dunoe this guy what he doing.. lolol..</p>

              <p>Yeah, when a player don't get to play it doesn't mean he is a bad player, just that he isn't view as an important member to the starting 11 by the manager thats all... And when I say not important, I guess we can say... not highly regarded by the manager compare to the others.</p>
              <p>When we talk about technically gifted, I think Rooney is way above him... 3 England managers consider him the best English player at present. Perhaps even Lampard, Gerrard or Carrick are more technically gifted... Joe is only good at dribbling and dribbling isn't really technically gifted... Kaka, Deco, Fabregas, Xavi, Berbatov are technically gifted but they are not known for their dribbling skills but more on control of the ball and the game and their vision of play...</p>
              <p>Those that are good at dribbling and also technically gifted I would say are Messi, Robben and Ronaldo... Joe doesn't really fall in that group tho... Joe is quite a selfish winger and his decision making is rather questionable a lot of times perferring to go for goal rather than make a pass to a better position player...</p>
              <p>Good dribbling skills are just that, it doesn't mean they are technically gifted... Maybe in another form i guess but if we look at the England setup, who does he have to compete with? England don't even have a proper left winger over the last 4, 5 yrs... That could explain why a right winger or a right footer ended up playing on the left...</p>
              <p>Well, like i said earlier... If one base judgement just by watching youtube... There are a lot of unknown players in there with their "great moments" but are they really good? or just moments of good? I can even find Fandi and Abbas on youtube too... Are they really good enough? There are worse players in there too with their "moments".  </p>
              <p>I belief if he was good enough and had impress Jose, whatever system Jose went with, he would still fitted in like Robben did. Actually under Jose, a 4-3-3 was perfect. Robben, Drogba, Cole but Jose opt for SWP instead... Probably because Swp wasn't as selfish a player...</p>
              <p>Honestly, I think Joe is quite like Nani... only a bit more experience but also waste alot of chances... lol</p>
              <p>At least I learn one new lingo... consperm = confirm    <img title="Laughing" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"></p>

              <h1>Manchester United firm up £18m summer move for Wigan star Luis Antonio Valencia</h1>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson will get the green light to sign Luis Antonio Valencia from Wigan in an £18million deal - after Latics boss Steve Bruce admitted he was leaving.</strong></p>
              <p>Ferguson's way to grab the Ecuadorian winger is clear with Real Madrid's deadline bid turned down and major rivals AC Milan opting to go for David Beckham instead.</p>
              <p>United can take Valencia in the summer as Bruce admitted his sale is a certainty - and that he is already working on a replacement for the flying right-sided star.</p>
              <p>Bruce said: "It's inevitable he is leaving. There is so much interest in him - not just in this country but around the world.</p>
