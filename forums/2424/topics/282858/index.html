His replacement did not disappoint, making one superb reaction stop in particular to help United towards yet another 1-0 victory. Sir Alex said: "Edwin's damaged his toe - to what extent I don't know but we'll send him for a scan. He'll be out for Tuesday, that's for certain. It's a worry when you lose a man of his experience but Tomasz Kuszczak is very able and I'm pleased we've got someone as good as that."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Hargreaves: No Roma repeat</strong><br><br>Owen Hargreaves says any thoughts of repeating last season's 7-1 thrashing of AS Roma should be instantly disregarded.<br><br>The 26-year-old could finally make his return from a thigh strain as the Serie A side head to Manchester on Tuesday, intent on reeking revenge for the defeat in April. Hargreaves, however, simply wants three points, whatever the scoreline.<br><br>"There will be no repeat of the 7-1," he said. "Those results happen perhaps once every four years in the entire competition. It's not going to happen again. As long as we get the three points, I'll be happy."<br><br>Hargreaves watched the game on television with his then team-mates at Bayern Munich, as they would have played the winners of the game if they beat AC Milan the following night.<br><br>Milan eventually knocked Bayern and United out. A tired, injury-ravaged Reds side were overpowered by a Milan team putting its entire efforts into the Champions League, while Sir Alex's men fought on two other fronts - the league and FA Cup. As a result, there's a clear determination to go a step further this year. But Hargreaves, a past winner with Bayern in 2001, says that's too far in the future.<br><br>"We're obviously one of the key teams in the Champions League but we can't think about winning it right now," he said. "We are in the same position as everyone else. It is only September, so the final is a long way off. The aim is to reach our peak later in the season. Hopefully we will get into the latter stages and then get the breaks any team needs to progress beyond that."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Rooney ready for Roma revenge</strong><br><br>Wayne Rooney knows precisely how determined AS Roma will be to exact revenge on United after the Reds'  7-1 victory back in April Â– because he has put himself in their shoes.<br><br>After thrashing the Italians in the Champions League quarter final second leg last season, the Giallorossi return to Old Trafford in Tuesday's Group F clash hell-bent on setting the record straight.<br><br>Asked what he would do if he had been in a team that had been beaten 7-1 and then had a chance to redeem themselves so soon after the event, Rooney smiled and said: Â“If it was me, IÂ’d be sitting here rubbing my hands. IÂ’d have been delighted as soon as the draw was made. I wouldnÂ’t be able to wait for the game and IÂ’d see it as an opportunity to put things right.<br><br>Â“IÂ’m sure that Roma will be fired up for this game. We need to be aware of that, but what we have to do is concentrate on our job and play the way we know we can.Â”<br><br>Rooney also says that the Reds must put the 7-1 scoreline out of their minds and concentrate on playing at full tilt against Luciano SpallettiÂ’s men.<br><br>"It was a great result for us, but I think we all know it wonÂ’t happen again,Â” he said. Â“We know it will be a difficult game. We have to do our job and try and win the game.Â”<br><br>The 21-year-old striker is looking for his first goal this season, and Tuesday night would be an ideal time for him to get off the mark.<br><br>Â“It was a disappointing start to the season for me because I got the metatarsal injury,Â” he added. Â“But IÂ’ve played three games now and hopefully I can start scoring again and help the team keep winning games.Â”<br><br>Rooney has been deployed as the main striker in United's attack this season, with Carlos Tevez dropping deeper. When asked to do a similar job last season, he went on a scoring run of 11 goals in 14 matches during March and April. He will be hoping to do that again, and says his partnership with Tevez has plenty of potential.<br><br>"I enjoy playing alongside Carlos," he said. "HeÂ’s a good player and he's starting to play really well.<br><br>"Playing with Carlos makes it a slightly different role for me. I have to play on the shoulder of the defender and let Carlos be the link between the midfield and the forwards. Of course, IÂ’m happy to do that role, and I think it could bring more to my game. I did it quite a lot last season. I got a few goals from doing that so IÂ’ve got no problems at all doing that."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/10_01/PanucciG_468x297.jpg"><br><span class="small">Claim: Panucci</span><br><br><strong><span class="large">Roma are hellbent on getting even for that 7-1 drubbing, warns Fergie</span><br><br>You do not need to be a devotee of the Godfather trilogy to know that revenge has more than played its part in Italian cultural history. Tonight against Manchester United at Old Trafford, the players of Roma will push forward their chests, jut out their chins and endeavour to make up Â— in some way at least Â— for one of the greatest humiliations in decades of Italian sport. </strong><br><br>Italian football teams just do not concede seven goals in a game. Their national team only let in two during their entire 2006 World Cup Finals success. So April's 7-1 capitulation to United in the Champions League quarter-final second leg remains buried deep in Roma's psyche.<br><br>United manager Sir Alex Ferguson said: 'I think there's a big motivation for them. I've seen some of the Italian papers and it's all about revenge. 'That's understandable after the defeat last year. They will want to turn that scoreline around.' Proud Romans such as Francesco Totti and Daniele de Rossi were among the first to disembark from their aircraft in Manchester yesterday.<br><br>But there had been differing messages from the various members of Luciano Spalletti's squad. Totti Â— the captain and talisman Â— has been promoting peace in recent days, sending a personal mess age to those United fans caught up in the trouble that marred last season's first leg at the Stadio Olimpico. That contrasts with defender Christian Panucci, ruled out last night because of a back injury, who accused United's players of whipping up anti-Italian feelings in the wake of that game.<br><br>Ferguson responded: 'I can't believe a player of Panucci's experience was affected by that. He has played for Real Madrid and AC Milan and has played for Italy 60 or so times. I can't believe that was a reason for our win last season. 'Players like him and Totti are very experienced Â— but I suppose it's a good story, isn't it?'<br><br>Given the events of last season Â— both off the field in Rome and on it at Old Trafford Â— the hype and interest around tonight's game exceeds what is normal for the second match of the group stages. For instance, there will be extra police on duty. United see the threat from wounded Italian players as real.<br><br>Asked how he would feel if he was returning to the scene of such a sporting disaster, United's Wayne Rooney was categoric. He said: 'I'd be delighted as soon as I saw the draw if I was them. 'I'd be pleased to have an opportunity to try to make it right so soon after. If it was me I'd be rubbing my hands and wouldn't be able to wait for the game. 'I'm sure they'll be fired up for this match more than any other after last season's result, so we'll have to be aware of that and just concentrate.'<br><br>Roma's players have discussed the impact of last season's events and it would appear the damage is still being repaired. Panucci yesterday described the night as the 'worst of my career', while Roma's Brazil keeper Doni Â— in goal at Old Trafford in April Â— said: 'That night changed our relationship with our fans.<br><br>'They still have not fully forgiven us. I have spoken with some of them recently and that much is clear. The 7-1 scoreline is imprinted in the minds of our supporters and that is why they are demanding we return this week and bring home a positive score for them. 'We have come to Manchester without fear but we are fully aware of our responsibility. If we win this week it would, for me, be one of the greatest nights and one of the greatest causes for celebration in my career.'<br><br>In order to get the result they crave, Roma will have to hustle United into conceding a goal, something the English champions' first team have not done for more than 350 minutes. Not since Manchester City's Geovanni breached the United defence in the first half of August 19's derby have United conceded in anything but the Carling Cup.<br><br>Tonight, United's Poland goalkeeper Tomasz Kuszczak will deputise for the injured Edwin van der Sar while defenders Nemanja Vidic and Wes Brown are expected to shake off minor knocks picked up against Birmingham on Saturday. In midfield, Owen Hargreaves may finally return from injury to play in the holding role he was bought to fill in Europe.<br><br>But it will be in attacking areas where United may have to improve if they are to build tonight on the 1-0 victory they secured at Sporting Lisbon a fortnight ago. United were once more moderate going forward in Saturday's 1-0 win at St Andrew's and it is clear Ferguson has not yet found the best way to use his collection of gifted offensive players.<br><br>Ferguson sought to reassure yesterday, saying: 'The important thing is we know that Wayne can penetrate and that Cristiano Ronaldo can penetrate, while Carlos Tevez in a different way can do that job. 'I'm happy. I don't think it's a problem at all. Good players, with the ability they have, should gel.'<br><br>Ferguson will hope he is right. Roma Â— for obvious reasons Â— will pray otherwise.<br></div>
