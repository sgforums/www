              <p>Lyon goalkeeper Hugo Lloris
               has revealed it would be a "dream" to play for Manchester United in the
               future, fuelling speculation that he may be set to move to the Premier 
              League this summer.</p>
              <div class="mod-inline image image-right">
              <div style="margin-left: 10px; width: 275px;"><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/2011/0216/hugollorisfrancetraining20110216_275x155.jpg" border="0" alt="Hugo lloris France training" width="275" height="155">
              <div style="width: 275px;"><cite>GettyImages</cite>Hugo Lloris has 20 France caps and is Les Bleus' current No. 1</div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p><strong><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/872389/manchester-united-confirm-interest-in-maarten-stekelenburg?cc=5739"></a></strong></p>
              <p>Lloris,
               24, has been linked with United for some time, with Sir Alex Ferguson 
              thought to be a long-term admirer of the France custodian.</p>
              <p>Ferguson has been stepping up his goalkeeper search of late after Edwin van der Sar confirmed last month that he will retire at the end of this season.</p>
              <p>Anders Lindegaard was signed from Aalesund in January, while Tomasz Kuszczak
               has regularly insisted that he can be United's new No. 1, but Ferguson 
              is thought to be keen on a more high-profile acquistion.</p>
              <p>Lloris would certainly fit the bill, having starred for both club and country since Lyon bought him from Nice to replace Gregory Coupet in 2008.</p>
              <p>"Manchester United is a great football institution," Lloris was quoted as saying in <em>The Sun</em>. "It's one of the clubs with the most titles in the world. So, of course, they're one of the teams I dream about playing for."</p>
              <p>United have been linked with moves for Manuel Neuer, Igor Akinfeev, Maarten Stekelenburg, Pepe Reina and David De Gea of late, but Lloris' latest comments may push him to front of the queue of potential candidates to fill Van der Sar's gloves.</p>

              <p>Suddenly so many keepers openly declare interest in joining United. Not sure how many are for real and how many are only doing this to have a wage raise. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>First there's Adler, next was Stekenlenburg, then Reina and now Lloris too. I guess only Neuer and De Gea are the only loyal players who did not declare such interest despite reports linking them to United.</p>

              <p>You seemed to have a preference for experienced players over up and coming ones? Right?</p>
              <p>Buffon will never play for United and I doubt Fergie would sign him because:</p>
              <p>1. He's too injury-proned<br>2. He's already hitting the 30s, danger of hanging up boots altogether if he gets injured too often<br>3. He's going downhill, Juve has gone from top 4 contenders to Europa contender.</p>
              <p>Same for Sneijder too, he will never come to United:</p>
              <p>1. He has recently signed a new mega contract with Inter. Imagine the millons United have to fork out for him. I can only imagine it to be in the region of 40-60m.<br>2. He has publicly declared interest at least twice and twice he minced his words and either joined other club or signed a contract extension. Are his words to be trusted? I personally don't think so. He's just eyeing the pay bumper.<br>3. Inter is slowly regaining momentum and push under Leonardo, surely he would rather stay on with Inter than to venture out into the unknown?</p>

              <p>Buffon is well into his 30s already... Anyway, I don't trust Italian players at the moment... Remember Aqua man from Pool?</p>
              <p>I suspect the league isn't as high in terms of individual team quality or across the whole league therefore he may not be really tested in recent seasons and our memory of him is of 5 to 10 yrs ago kind...</p>
              <p>Anyway, too many difficulties involvo... Like don't know if he can even speak or understand English, at his age, he never play in other league before only the italian one... Can he adapt to the English weather, the pouring rain that he isn't use to in Milan? The food, the culture and everything cos he is not a young man anymore... and how about his family members?</p>
              <p>A younger player might be more open to changes...</p>
              <p>I rather United get Reina than him... Even at $20m. Cos Reina has adapted to England already and doing well. I recall when he first came over, he also made quite a number of high profile mistakes for Pool... he also took a while to settle into the keeper he is today. So I think it's better to get one with Premier League experienced... Even Vds got a number of seasons under his belt at Fulham before he joint United... Had he came straight from Juve... Who knows, the outcome could be different...</p>

              <p>Reina seems the most logicial choice, and given torres's departure, may play on his minds a bit. And even with Pool's securing UCL spot,I feel may not secure his services, unless KK pulls something out of his hat.</p>
              <p>but given how MUFC's history with pool, (Heinze), I think either Pool will quote an astronomical price or it will be big 'no-no'.</p>
