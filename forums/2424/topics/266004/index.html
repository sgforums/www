            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Exit the dragon<br><br>Even the seasoned old pros knew the quiet kid was special. Neville Southall, twice a League winner with Everton, remembers Ryan GiggsÂ’ first training sessions with Wales clearly 16 years on. </strong><br><br>What astonished the goalkeeper, then 33, was not just the teenagerÂ’s natural prowess Â– but the fact he was so good, he was a touch embarrassed about it. Â“You could immediately see he had ability, but it was also clear he was holding back in training,Â” Southall says with fondness. Â“I always thought it was because he felt that, as a kid, he shouldnÂ’t really take the Mick out of all the big-name players in the squad as it might have seemed cocky. He could have if he wanted to, though.Â”<br><br>Cardiff-born Giggs made his international debut in October 1991 as a late substitute for Eric Young in Germany, the first of a 64-cap career that ended with last monthÂ’s 0-0 draw with the Czech Republic. Befitting his prodigious status, he was, at just 17 years and 321 days, the youngest player to represent his country. Two years later he scored his first goal for Wales, a memorable free-kick against Belgium at the old Cardiff Arms Park. A star was born, and Giggs soon assumed the captainÂ’s armband from Southall. The goalkeeper was in little doubt his replacement could lead by example, if not seniority.<br><br>Â“You could fire a cannon ball at him and he would still be able to trap it and do something special. Simply having his name on the teamsheet was enough to inspire fear in the opposition, and millions of people around the world now know of Wales just because itÂ’s the team he used to play for.Â”<br><br>While GiggsÂ’ international career sadly didnÂ’t take him to the final stages of a major tournament, he has many moments on which to reflect with a warm glow of pride. Victory over Italy in 2002 at the Millennium Stadium, in particular, will never be forgotten by players and supporters alike, while his performance against Brazil last year led to manager DungaÂ’s suggestion that the Welshman would look comfortable among his A SeleÃ§Ã£o.<br><br>Yet Giggs admitted the time was right for a curtain call, a move possibly prompted by the defeat against the Republic of Ireland that all but ended WalesÂ’ hopes of qualifying for Euro 2008. Â“I have loved playing for my country, and I have loved captaining my country,Â” he said prior to the Czech stalemate. Â“I think itÂ’s the right time to do this. It wasnÂ’t an easy decision for me.Â”<br><br>Bad news for Wales, naturally, but good news for those hoping it will prolong his Old Trafford career. Many have argued that playing for United was always more of a priority for Giggs, because he pulled out of friendlies for Wales through injury. But anyone who saw his commitment to the cause when he represented the Dragons would realise just how desperate Giggs was to lead his side on the biggest stage.<br><br>It was fitting that his last game for Wales should be one of his best. Performing like the Giggs of old, he demanded the ball, terrorised the Czech defence and, but for a couple of world-class stops from Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech, would have ended his international career with a goal to add to his tally of 12. Equally, if perversely fitting, was that Â‘nearlyÂ’ feel about the whole event Â– the game summing up so much of the Welsh footballing lot, as former skipper Kevin Ratcliffe concurs. Â“He is one of the greatest players to get global acclaim, but never to have played at a World Cup finals.Â” Along with fellow United legend George Best and football luminaries George Weah, Alfredo Di Stefano, Johnny Giles and Jim Baxter, Giggs finds himself on that elite list of truly world-class players who never graced a major championships in national colours.<br><br>For all his domestic glory it was always a case of close, but no cigar. In 1994, only Paul BodinÂ’s missed penalty cost Wales a place in the USA World Cup and, exactly 10 years later a 1-0 defeat to Russia in a play-off at the Millennium Stadium meant the flag of St David would be absent at the European Championships in Portugal. In both cases Wales were just 90 minutes away from appearing in their first international tournament since 1958, when Pele, scoring his first World Cup goal for Brazil, ended their hopes in the quarter-final stages.<br><br>But it would be wrong for Giggs to be remembered as a player who never truly shone on the international stage, he deserves better than that. He was recently voted as one of the greatest players to wear a Wales jersey. Â“IÂ’ve played with some good players over the years but I would say that Ryan was probably the best,Â” said Dean Saunders, WalesÂ’ fourth-highest goalscorer. Â“You get the full package with him,Â” enthuses the former Liverpool and Aston Villa striker. Â“HeÂ’s respectful to everyone, you never hear him saying anything ridiculous in the press or doing anything silly. It was a pleasure to be in the same national side as Ryan and heÂ’s done a magnificent job playing for Wales.Â”<br><br>That fact was acknowledged by just over 30,000 Welshmen at the Millennium Stadium. The importance of the event was not lost on the travelling contingent from the Czech Republic, either, who held up a banner in glorification of Giggs, which simply read: Thank you Ryan.<br><br>Not to be upstaged by their visitors, after 89 minutes the Welsh public got their chance to say their own thank you: Wales manager John Toshack replacing Giggs in the last minute so he could receive a standing ovation. Â“If he didnÂ’t know already, he now knows how highly thought of he is around here,Â” said Toshack. Â“We shall certainly miss him. We are talking about a very, very special person. I wish him all the best.Â”<br><br>Ratcliffe added: Â“Sometimes it takes a playerÂ’s departure for people to realise how good they are.Â” Luckily for those who have followed RyanÂ’s career in the red of United, we will get to cherish his deeds for a while yet. And if the man himself has a quiet moment to reflect on the might-have-beens, he knows a welcome in the valleys is his for eternity.<br><br><span style="color: green;">His days in Man Utd are numbered</span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
