              Ryan Giggs has called on Manchester United to repeat last week's first-half show against Arsenal in order to complete their passage to Rome.
              
              Such was the brilliance of United's performance at Old Trafford in the Championss League semi-final first leg, they are slightly unfortunate not to be counting down the days to May 27 already. 
              
              Certainly Arsenal are aware how lucky they are still to have a chance of going through and aim to take maximum advantage at the Emirates Stadium. 
              
              However, Giggs feels the Red Devils are capable of exercising their dominance once more and feels that will be enough to end any Arsenal comeback dream. 
              
              "If we play to the ability we did in the first half last week we will have no problems," said the former Wales skipper. 
              
              "We went out to get the crowd going and play at a quick tempo. That is what we do when we are at our best. 
              
              "Arsenal are a top team and they are capable of scoring goals so we are under no illusions about how difficult this is going to be. 
              
              "But our form in Europe has been excellent and we are in a good position." 
              
              Having started Saturday's win over Middlesbrough, Giggs seems set to be handed a spot on the bench. 
              
              The experience gained by 801 appearances and 148 goals at the highest level for United is an invaluable asset in the bid to become the first side to retain the European Cup since the Champions League era began. 
              
              Giggs is refusing to accept the Premier League title race is over even though the Old Trafford outfit only need seven more points from their remaining four games to be certain of holding off Liverpool's challenge. 
              
              However, the newly crowned PFA player of the year is now more interested in quelling Arsenal's threat. 
              
              "You have to look after Arsenal's quality players," said Giggs. 
              
              "They have so many matchwinners; Fabregas, Adebayor, Walcott, Van Persie, if he is fit. 
              
              "The threat is obvious, so you have to try and nullify it. 
              
              "But we have to try and stamp our own authority on the game because we have outstanding players ourselves." 
              
              Among that number are Cristiano Ronaldo, who was left on the bench yesterday, and in-form Wayne Rooney, who have both apparently pledged their long-term futures to United. 
              
              In Rooney's case that is hardly a surprise. However, Ronaldo's declaration that his "Real Madrid dream is dead" will be treated with an element of scepticism by the Red Devils support, who are anticipating another summer of rumour swirling around the FIFA world player of the year. 
              
              It is the kind of speculation Giggs has managed to avoid, with the exception of one period when he was linked with Inter Milan but never even considered leaving for the San Siro. 
              
              The 35-year-old's personal reward for such loyalty came with the PFA award for the first time in his career last Sunday. 
              
              Many have claimed the honour was recognition for a career that will boast 11 league titles if United, as expected, go on to lift the trophy again later this month. 
              
              However Giggs, who was making his 13th Premier League start - and scoring his second goal - at the Riverside, would like to feel it was for performances produced this term. 
              
              "I have been in the game for so long it might have been because of that but I would like to think it was just for this season because I have been happy with my form," he said. 
              
              Sir Alex Ferguson will need to check on Patrice Evra as well as Rio Ferdinand before finalising his plans for Tuesday night. 
              
              Evra limped off with a minor knock, although the United boss is confident his French full-back will make it. 
              
              More doubt surrounds Ferdinand, who was coughing up blood after suffering bruising to his lung in a collision with Edwin van der Sar. 
              
              It was anticipated Ferdinand would train on Monday but it appears Ferguson will not check on his Â£29.1million defender until Tuesday, although given the importance of the game, he is likely to give the England star as much time as he can to prove his fitness.
