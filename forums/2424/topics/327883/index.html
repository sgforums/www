              <p><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_6iX00OoqJz0/SKkaeQf1nMI/AAAAAAAACmU/Qn1oqz9VuBg/s200/waynecedes.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="159"></p>
              <p><strong>For a brand that prides itself on its exclusive, upmarket image, he
              was not, perhaps, the obvious choice for a new public ‘face’.</strong></p>
              <p>But
              despite his unequivocally down-to-earth attributes, luxury car
              manufacturer Mercedes-Benz has decided to sign a £1million contract
              making Wayne Rooney its new ambassador.</p>
              <p>The 22-year-old
              footballer sealed a two-year deal with the German car maker last week
              and has already taken delivery of a brand new customised Mercedes Benz
              CL63 Coupé worth £121,200.</p>
              <p>The deal means the Manchester United
              star’s new wife Coleen will be left to drive the rest of his fleet of
              luxury cars – as the contract stipulates Rooney must drive only
              Mercedes to matches and most training sessions.</p>
              <p>Some marketing experts last night questioned the new signing, suggesting the firm could lose out from ‘chavving down’.</p>
              <p>Brand analyst Peter York called it ‘extremely strange’.</p>
              <p>He
              said: ‘Ordinarily you’d expect Mercedes to choose someone aspirational
              and classy to advertise its cars, and it’s fair to say Wayne Rooney
              doesn’t fit that category.</p>
              <p>‘It’s extremely strange. You have to
              ask who chose him? Was it someone who has misunderstood his image or
              was it perhaps a calculated move to ensure people talked about it?</p>
              <p><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/08/16/article-1045966-024D1BF800000578-435_468x286.jpg" alt="" width="468" height="286"></p>
              <p>‘It’s possible it will backfire and put off traditional Mercedes
              customers – but perhaps their choice of Rooney reflects the fact that
              the kind of people prepared to spend a fortune on a smart car nowadays
              are not particularly smart people.’</p>
              <p>Rooney will have all the
              brand’s top-of-the-range models at his disposal, as well as use of a
              chauffeur-driven Mercedes to take him to any public engagements he
              attends.</p>
              <p>He took delivery of his black leather-upholstered
              eight-cylinder Coupé on Friday night and took it for its first spin
              around Manchester yesterday.</p>
              <p>The car, which has a 6.2-litre
              engine, a top speed of 155mph and can hit 60mph in 4.5 seconds, was
              described by Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson as ‘deadly’.</p>
              <p>Fellow footballer Rio Ferdinand and singer Jay Kay drive the same model and guitarist and singer Eric Clapton has one on order.</p>
              <p><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/08/16/article-1045966-024EA38B00000578-525_468x292.jpg" alt="" width="468" height="292"></p>
              <p>Rooney’s car has a fridge behind the rear arm rest and front seats
              with massage function,  radar-assisted cruise control, a night view
              camera and a ‘keyless go’ function.</p>
              <p>The £100,000-a-week
              footballer drove a BMW 5 Series until recently and has at least three
              other supercars – a £137,000 Bentley Continental GT, a £136,450
              Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder and a £177,000 Aston Martin.</p>
              <p>His fleet has also included a Range Rover Sport, an Audi A8 Quattro, a Cadillac Escalade, a Porsche 911 and a Mercedes G55 AMG.</p>
              <p>A
              source said: ‘Wayne is chuffed to bits with his new car. He is a car
              lover and has a beautiful collection of cars. Now Coleen will have to
              drive them, or he’ll have to make do with driving them off-road as he
              is only allowed to drive Mercedes to most events.</p>
              <p>‘Wayne’s a big fan of Mercedes and he bought Coleen an SLK 280 for her birthday two years ago.’</p>
              <p>A
              source at Mercedes said: ‘We very much wanted Wayne to be the face of
              the brand. Mercedes will set Wayne up as an icon with their cars. There
              is an option in the contract for him to feature in some adverts.’</p>
              <p>It is the latest in a string of sponsor deals for Rooney, expected to earn £100million by the time he hits 30.</p>
              <p>Rooney’s spokesman said: ‘I can confirm Wayne has just completed an initial two-year deal with Mercedes.’</p>
