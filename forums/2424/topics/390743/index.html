              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Darren Fletcher believes the first goal will be crucial in deciding Manchester United's Champions League destiny in three weeks' time.</span><span><span id="intelliTXT"> </span></span></p>
              <p>United will be nursing a 3-2 advantage when they tackle AC Milan again at Old Trafford on March 10.</p>
              <p>The lead would have been even greater had it not been for Clarence Seedorf's late strike for the seven-times winners, which at least gives them some hope of repairing the damage.</p>
              <p>Yet even with Seedorf's effort, Milan face a pretty stiff task.</p>
              <p>In 53 years of European combat, United have only twice suffered home losses - to Real Madrid in April 2000 and Deportivo La Coruna in October 2001 - that would consign them to extra-time.</p>
              <p>It would require new ground to be crossed completely for Milan to win outright given the Red Devils have never been beaten by two goals on home soil.</p>
              <p>Fletcher is keen not to give Milan the belief they can create history, which is why he wants the Old Trafford men to snuff out any chance of a comeback by scoring first when the two sides do battle again.</p>
              <p>"The next goal is going to be crucial," he said.</p>
              <p>"We went to win the first leg and we've done that but it is still all to play for in the tie.</p>
              <p>"We have seen the quality Milan have got in their side. They are capable of creating chances and scoring goals so we will have to be on top form to get through."</p>
              <p>Although it could be argued United were fortunate to record their victory given the one-sided nature of the opening period and the luck Paul Scholes had in levelling Ronaldinho's third-minute effort, the encounter was a far cry from their meeting with Milan in 2005.</p>
              <p>Already losing from the first leg, United were dispatched with clinical efficiency by a team that went on to lose an epic final with Liverpool in Istanbul, gaining revenge over the Merseysiders in Athens two years later.</p>
              <p>That was the high water-mark of a team coached by Carlo Ancelotti.</p>
              <p>For United it was the start of a journey that saw them triumph in Moscow two seasons ago, reach Rome, then perform disappointingly in the final against Barcelona last term. The team are now seeking to make it three on the trot by getting to Madrid on May 22.</p>
              <p>"We were maybe a bit naive when we first came here but we have come a long way," said Fletcher.</p>
              <p>"As players you get more mature every season and pick up more experience. You learn how to cope with these sorts of situations.</p>
              <p>"We need to maintain these standards in the Champions League though.</p>
              <p>"It is no good resting on your laurels thinking you have made it because there are too many other teams with so much quality."</p>
