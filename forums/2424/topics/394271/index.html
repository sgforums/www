              <p><strong>Fergie goes for goals against Bayern</strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Sir Alex Ferguson will send his side out looking for goals when Manchester United visit Bayern Munich on Tuesday.</span><span><span id="intelliTXT"> </span></span></p>
              <p>Although Bayern represent possibly the Red Devils' most famous opponents given they were the victims of that amazing Champions League final smash-and-grab in Barcelona 11 years ago, it does represent the only time the German giants have been beaten by United.</p>
              <p>Aside from two drawn matches in the group stage of the same season's competition, Bayern have emerged victorious on two occasions, one of which was due to a crucial away goal at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>History suggests there will be little between the teams again in their eagerly-awaited two-legged quarter-final, which is why Ferguson believes any advantage that can be prised out of the Allianz Arena this week could prove crucial.</p>
              <p>"A score draw or win is all you can hope for," Ferguson told MUTV.</p>
              <p>"It would give us a good chance."</p>
              <p>It is the same philosophy that served United so well in Milan for the last round, when despite falling behind to Ronaldinho's early goal, they maintained an attacking mentality and ultimately scored three times to put the tie well beyond David Beckham and his team-mates even before they were massacred at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>"We would like to equal our performance in Milan," he said.</p>
              <p>"If we get the same kind of performance and result we would have a massive advantage coming back to Old Trafford."</p>
              <p>United will encounter a different team, which relies on the pace of wing duo Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben.</p>
              <p>Both men are well known to Ferguson given he has looked often enough at the former, especially in the wake of Cristiano Ronaldo's departure, and thought he had got the latter until Chelsea stepped in to snap him up in 2004.</p>
              <p>Although Bastian Schweinsteiger is suspended, with the likes of Mark van Bommel, Philipp Lahm and Miroslav Klose in their squad, Bayern are not opponents Ferguson intends to take lightly.</p>
              <p>"The history of Bayern and our games against them in past European ties tells you it is going to be a very difficult game," said Ferguson.</p>
              <p>"It will be a fantastic atmosphere, in a great stadium, with a good pitch.</p>
              <p>"They are an experienced team. But hopefully we get everyone we need fit and we will have a good chance."</p>
              <p>With Ryan Giggs back after a broken arm, it seems Ferguson has got his wish, particularly given he brushed off any fears about Wayne Rooney's knee yesterday.</p>
              <p>If fit, Rooney would almost certainly be called upon to occupy the lone striker's role that suits both the player and his team so well.</p>
              <p>The energy of Park Ji-sung and Darren Fletcher will probably be required as well, leaving Giggs to scrap it out for one of the remaining slots which, amongst others, Michael Carrick is hoping to fill.</p>
              <p>"The fact we reached back-to-back finals got lost a little bit last year because of the result against Barcelona in the final," said the England midfielder.</p>
              <p>"Of course, that hurt us a lot.</p>
              <p>"We are looking to bounce back and to make it three in a row would be a great achievement."</p>

              <p><strong>Wayne, Rio fit for Tuesday</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Rio Ferdinand and Wayne Rooney will be ready to face Bayern Munich on Tuesday, despite missing United's victory over Bolton Wanderers.</strong><br><br>The first-choice pair were omitted from the eighteen selected by Sir Alex Ferguson at the Reebok Stadium but the boss says their absence was just a precaution ahead of a "big week" for the Reds.<br><br>"They were just a bit tender," Sir Alex told MUTV, in reference to the players' minor injury problems.<br><br>"Wayne’s got a bruise on his foot. If he’d played and got a whack on it, then he would have been doubtful for Tuesday.<br><br>"We’ve got a big week. We have to use our squad in situations like this. I’ve no qualms about that at all. They’ve all done their job well, and I’ll have Rooney and Ferdinand available for Tuesday."<br><br>The United squad flies out from Manchester on Monday morning and will remain in Germany until Wednesday afternoon. The extra overnight stay will enable the players to rest properly ahead of the Easter Saturday showdown with Chelsea at Old Trafford.</p>

              <p><img src="http://images.sportinglife.com/10/03/330/Bolton-v-Man-Utd-Dimitar-Berbatov-his-first_2436279.jpg" alt="" width="378" height="260"></p>
              <p><strong>BERBA BUOYANT BEFORE BAYERN BATTLE</strong></p>
              <p>Manchester United will board a flight for Munich tomorrow with Dimitar Berbatov able to hold his head up high.</p>
              <p>For the second time in three weeks, Berbatov stepped into the role Wayne Rooney has proved so adept at and helped United wrap up a crucial win in their pursuit of a 19th title.</p>
              <p>United's £30.75million record signing also found the goals to provide added gloss to his industrious performance at Bolton, scoring twice in a league game for the first time since his move from Tottenham in August 2008.</p>
              <p>During much of the intervening period, Berbatov's contribution has been derided, but now it appears United's fans are starting to understand what his team-mates already knew.</p>
              <p>"Dimitar's performances in the wins against Wolves and Bolton have showed fantastic determination," Gary Neville said.</p>
              <p>"He has played up front on his own in both games. He was a massive presence running the line for us against Bolton. It was really important.</p>
              <p>"It has been so important to us that when Wayne has not been playing Dimitar has been outstanding."</p>
              <p>Rooney was rested after suffering a bruised foot in training, which, at the start of a five-game period that sandwiches next Saturday's crucial clash with Chelsea between a Champions League quarter-final with Bayern, manager Sir Alex Ferguson was understandably not prepared to risk.</p>
              <p>Even a couple of months ago, there would have been trepidation about such a situation.</p>
              <p>Not now it seems, as United continue with the twin aims of recording an unprecedented fourth successive title and reaching a third European Cup final in succession.</p>
              <p>Bolton manager Owen Coyle branded Nemanja Vidic's challenge on Johan Elmander, which left the Swede needing five stitches, as "terrible", but the Serb was another player singled out for special praise by Neville.</p>
              <p>"Vidic was outstanding because Bolton pose a massive physical challenge," said the United skipper.</p>
              <p>Although Coyle claimed his team looked more like getting an equaliser than United adding to their lead once Jlloyd Samuel had inexplicably scored the visitors' 11th own-goal of the season seven minutes before the break, there was little doubt over the eventual outcome.</p>
              <p>Berbatov's double put it out of reach before Darron Gibson rattled in a fourth to provide a positive response to the seven goals Chelsea scored against Aston Villa earlier in the day.</p>
              <p>Neville only discovered the full extent of that Stamford Bridge massacre at full-time, when Arsenal's draw at Birmingham had also sunk in.</p>
              <p>It changed the overall picture slightly, although no-one will be writing Arsenal off given they have the easiest run-in and United and Chelsea still have to meet.</p>
              <p>"The league could be very tight," Neville added. "Over the years it has never gone down to goal difference but you never know, it may be the deciding factor.</p>
              <p>"The good thing for us is that we are in a position where goals don't have to matter. We could certainly do ourselves a big favour next Saturday, but so could Chelsea, and Arsenal will be looking for a draw.</p>
              <p>"It is still all to play for."</p>

              <p><strong>Rooney ready for bout with Bayern</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://images.teamtalk.com/10/03/330/Wayne-Rooney-celebrates-Manchester-United-v-F_2431072.jpg" alt="" width="392" height="257"></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Wayne Rooney hopes to deliver a knockout blow when Manchester United tackle hosts Bayern Munich in the Champions League on Tuesday night.</span><span><span id="intelliTXT"> </span></span></p>
              <p>Rooney has revealed he gets the punch bag out if he wants to get rid of some excess anger.</p>
              <p>The United star is no longer the firebrand he was in his younger days, flying off the handle at every little problem.</p>
              <p>But the 24-year-old, who aims to down Bayern in the quarter-final first leg, retains an ultra-competitive edge that occasionally requires an outlet.</p>
              <p>When those situations occur, Rooney is happy to pull the boxing gloves on, as he learned to do when he was still at school.</p>
              <p>"I used to do boxing and football," he told Champions magazine. "I was training every night with one of them and when I got to about 15, Everton said I had to stop boxing if I wanted to carry on playing football.</p>
              <p>"I had a good chance of making the first team, so I stopped.</p>
              <p>"I still love watching boxing. It is a big thing in my family. I can still do a bit now after training, but obviously not fighting.</p>
              <p>"I enjoy it. It is a good way to get rid of some anger."</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson hopes there will be no reason for Rooney to get angry in the Allianz Arena as the striker returns from a bruised foot for the quarter-final first-leg tie.</p>
              <p>Rooney has established himself as one of the most feared forwards in Europe thanks to his 33-goal contribution to United's season.</p>
              <p>However, Ferguson believes it is the presence of another England man who missed Saturday's four-goal destruction of Bolton that is even more crucial to United's chances of recording a record seventh successive away win in the competition, £29.1million defender Rio Ferdinand.</p>
              <p>"The return of Ferdinand and Vidic to keep our back four solid is significant," said Ferguson. "Along with Edwin van der Sar there was a time when all those players were injured. It wasn't easy and we were very fragile.</p>
              <p>"But you can see the solidity now. You can see the experience of these players and it is making a massive difference to the performances of the team.</p>
              <p>"It is a true saying strong at the back, strong as a team. We are looking very strong now."</p>
