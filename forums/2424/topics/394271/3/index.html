              <p>now must hear the news of Rooney's injury, sigh..........hope he is able to play in the return leg at old trafford, never mind the crunch match against chelsea. it looked like it was a bad injury to his leg, wasn't a pretty sight.</p>

              <p>I never like Neville and i never will. The stupid mistake he makes is really unforgiveable at this level.</p>
              <p>Thumbs up for Bayern for their impressive performance, especially Demichelis who shut Rooney out and Olic for running the show. Ribery didnt exactly have a good game but he scored via a deflected shot.</p>
              <p>Van der Sar is the man, saving United time and again. Neville is crap, just hang up your boots already! Rio and Vidic looked far from composed maybe due to the fact that they havent been playing together for quite some time. Evra makes the silly mistake which gifted Bayern the goal.</p>
              <p>Park is the invisible man throughout the match. Scholes is making ill-timed tackles. Carrick is forever drifting in and out of the match with his lack on concentration. Nani had a good game though, he attacks and defends well, the provider of the much important away goal. Fletcher is at his usual best, almost provided an impressive assist - i didnt know he could use his left foot!</p>
              <p>Rooney, Man of the Moment, but worrying scene at the end of the match. Hope Rooney's alright for the saturday's match and United need to buck up on the 2nd leg.</p>

              <p>BM didn't field a strong team. Abilities and fitness isn't an issue. It boils down to DESIRE. One team wanted to win the tie while the other was simply waiting for it to end. Typical pre-2007 United, after scoring an early goal, they step of the gas pedal and let BM come back to the game instead of going for the jugular. If United had lost 2-1 while playing wth desire (like against Chelsea earlier in the season), no one will complain. I pity the away fans who flew to Germany to watch such a heart-less performance.</p>
              <p>I prefer Neville to Rafael. Rafael has poor positioning due to his inexperienced and has to resort to fouls to stop the opponent. He was battered by Ronaldino in the San Siro so I don't think Fergie will field him against top players soon. Currently our best right back is either JOS or Wes Brown. GN is still good but he needs a winger to support him against pacy opponents. Plus Neville crosses the ball a lot better than Rafael :)</p>

              <p>I still think man u will prevail. This first leg loss is a good wake up call. What's more, we have got the away goal. Other seasons when we watch man u cruise through with comfortable wins in the knockout stages, they somehow falter thereafter. This year has been good, the laboured win over milan at san siro and now this battle with munchen.</p>

              <p>Actually, it is still very much ok... The result isn't a done deal. United can certainly turn this around at OT.</p>
              <p>To be honest, losing this match by a goal and coming away with one is still quite alright... The players would probably be hurt but it's good i think... Cos this way they might take it out on Chelsea to make up for it... This match is a 2 leg one so there is no lost of points. They can still set this right and this defeat would be like meaningless.</p>
              <p>Bayern defence doen't look great, and I belief at OT, United will have even more chances than last night... So all is not lost yet...</p>

              <p><img src="http://images.sportinglife.com/10/03/330/Alex-Ferguson-Louis-Van-Gaal-Chat-Bayern-v-Ma_2437364.jpg" alt="" width="365" height="255"></p>
              <p><strong>FERGUSON REGRET AT SLACK DISPLAY</strong></p>
              <p>Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson admitted his side simply did not play well enough after they went down 2-1 to Bayern Munich tonight.</p>
              <p>Ferguson added on Sky Sports 2: "We didn't play well enough to be honest, we kept giving the ball away. We caused our own defeat.</p>
              <p>Even as striker Wayne Rooney was tapping home a Nani free-kick that had looped straight to him off Mark van Bommel to give United the lead in just 64 seconds, Ferguson sensed there was something wrong.</p>
              <p>"I didn't think it was a fantastic start," he countered.</p>
              <p>"We gave the ball away far too easily from minute one. It is a part of our game we pride ourselves on and has been part of the reason for our progress.</p>
              <p>"But that was really disappointing for me."</p>
              <p>Instead of going on to consolidate their lead, United found themselves pressed further onto the back foot.</p>
              <p>Only the wasteful finishing of Hamit Altintop and Ivica Olic prevented Bayern from drawing level by the break.</p>
              <p>Instead, it took a needless handball by United skipper Gary Neville to offer Bayern a lifeline 13 minutes from time.</p>
              <p>Man-of-the-match Edwin van der Sar appeared to have Ribery's free-kick covered.</p>
              <p>But when it ricocheted off Rooney, the veteran Dutchman was helpless as the ball flew into the opposite corner.</p>
              <p>The goal ended United's hopes of becoming only the second English team to beat Bayern on their own ground, and ended a six-match winning streak away from home.</p>
              <p>Yet little were they aware the worst was still to come.</p>
              <p>After Nemanja Vidic thudded a header against the bar, Gomez emerged with the ball from his fateful tackle with Rooney.</p>
              <p>As Rooney lay on the ground in obvious pain, Gomez raced away.</p>
              <p>Vidic knocked Gomez off his stride but Patrice Evra was then hesitant on the ball and Olic stole in to calmly beat Van der Sar, without whom Ferguson admitted the damage would have been far worse.</p>
              <p>"Edwin saved us time and time again," he said.</p>
              <p>"He made so many fantastic saves and kept us in the game.</p>
              <p>"Yes, we had some chances but Edwin kept us in the game.</p>
              <p>"It wasn't a good goal to lose but the second leg is at home and I believe we have a strong chance."</p>
              <p>"Bayern were the better team, we can't complain about that, but we're better than that in possession. We kept giving it away and that was our downfall.</p>
              <p>"The first goal was a bit of luck with a deflection but the last goal, I don't know how you describe it.</p>
              <p>"The game was done and we gave a terrible goal away."</p>
              <p>The second leg is at Old Trafford next week and Ferguson added: "Old Trafford will be a different game obviously.</p>
              <p>"We will be much better, no doubt about that, and hopefully we can recover.</p>
              <p>"We have the away goal and we'll go out to win the game."</p>

              <p class="photoDesc"><strong>Ji-Sung Park was disappointing against Bayern Munich</strong></p>
              <p>Manchester United midfielder <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=21544"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ji-Sung Park</span></span></a> remains confident about reaching the Champions League semi-finals, and insists that things "will be different" when <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=30"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></span></a>'s side host Bayern Munich in the quarter-final second leg at Old Trafford next week.</p>
              <p>United surrendered an early lead against Bayern on Tuesday and Ivica Olic's injury-time winner means they will have to overturn a 2-1 deficit if they are to book a meeting with either Lyon or Bordeaux.</p>
              <p>English clubs have endured mixed results in similar situations this season as Arsenal came from behind to defeat Porto in the last round, but Chelsea were unable to claw their way back against Inter Milan.</p>
              <p>And Park, who failed to impress as he did against AC Milan and Liverpool recently, accepts United will have a tough job at Old Trafford next Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Yet the South Korean is optimistic that his team can make it through, even though they could be without <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=21046"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Wayne Rooney</span></span></a> who is waiting to discover the extent of an ankle injuryhe picked up at the Allianz Arena.</p>
              <p>"We are disappointed because we were leading,'' Park said. "The early goal was good for us but we weren't able to build on it and get the result. But we have our chance to go through at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>"Bayern have an experienced team, and the club has a proud history. They did well but the situation will be different at Old Trafford. We're waiting for them to come there.''</p>

              <p>like fark lor. that old fart completely misjudged the ball and decided to intervene by using his hand to touch the ball. he must be damn naive after playing for a few hundred matches for england and united, that he hoped the referee would miss the handball, what a fool he is.</p>
