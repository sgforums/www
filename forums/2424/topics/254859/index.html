            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Neville op a success<br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson says Gary Neville's ankle operation was a success and the skipper should be fit for the start of next season.<br></strong><br><br>The Reds' defender has not played since injuring his ankle ligaments during United's victory over Bolton Wanderers on 17 March and has also been ruled out of Saturday's FA Cup final.<br><br>Neville was initially expected to be out of action for around six weeks, but there was no improvement and consequently an operation was deemed the best possible treatment.<br><br>"We felt like we should give him every chance of making the Cup final with him being our captain," insisted Sir Alex at his pre-Cup final press conference. "But it just wasn't working.<br><br>"It was a blow when it happened, but we didn't think it was serious. We thought he'd be out for around five or six weeks, but it just didn't get any better.<br><br>"Strangly his sprinting was not a problem, it was when he was jogging that the problem seemed to surface again.<br><br>"It came to the point that he just wasn't going to make the final. So we wanted to get him fit for the start of next season. The operation was successful. They've cleaned the problem up and he should be ready for the new campaign."<br><br>John O'Shea or Wes Brown are the probable candidates to fill in at right-back on Saturday, while the United boss confirmed that Ryan Giggs will captain the Reds at Wembley. Neville will however be at Wembley to see the Reds in action.<br><br>"He'll probably travel down to the team hotel on Friday," added Sir Alex.</div>

Guess it depends also on what kind of football you appreciate.</div>
