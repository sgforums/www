            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong>Cometh the hour, cometh Carlos Tevez... so goes the story of the Argentine striker's first season at United.</strong><br><br>The Reds' number 32 has demonstrated a talent for scoring goals at decisive times, as appreciated by his manager Sir Alex Ferguson on the eve of Lyon's visit to Old Trafford.<br><br>"I think he's proved that this season," said Sir Alex. "That one in Lyon (1-1) was obviously really important to us, as were his goals at Liverpool (1-0), Tottenham (1-1) and at home to Chelsea right on half-time when we were searching for that first goal (United won 2-0).<br><br>"He's proving to be an important player for us, no question. He's now on 15 goals. I think that's a great return in his first season with us so we're delighted with him."<br><br>Tevez's 87th minute goal at Lyon's Stade Gerland was his third in the Champions League for United, giving him the same tally in this European campaign as Wayne Rooney. Cristiano Ronaldo leads the way with five. <br><br>Tevez's two other goals in the competition were both scored at Old Trafford - he scored the second in the 4-0 drubbing of Dynamo Kyiv and netted United's second-half equaliser against Sporting Lisbon after coming on as substitute in the eventual 2-1 win.</p></div>

              <h1>Tevez The New Cantona - Ferguson</h1>
              <h2>Sir Alex Ferguson compared Carlos Tevez with his former charge and
              Manchester United legend Eric Cantona ahead of the vital Champions
              League clash with Lyon.</h2>
              <p>"Carlos reminds me of Eric Cantona in the way that he has a knack of
              rising to the occasion with a goal just when it's needed," Ferguson
              wrote in the match programme.</p>
              <p>The Argentinean arrived after drawn-out legal wrangle last summer,
              but Ferguson and the fans have been more than satsified with
              the important contributions Tevez has shown since.</p>
              <p>"He often comes up with the goods away from home when you are up
              against it. I don't think anything fazes him and he keeps his cool in
              the box", said his delighted manager.</p>
              <p>"Tevez is proving a master at scoring the really important goals -
              the ones that give you a win or a draw, especially away from home."</p>
              <p>The 24-year-old has scored 15 goals in 33 appearances for his new
              club already this season, and the forward nicknamed ‘the lion’ by
              team-mates has already set his sights high in his debut season by
              claiming nothing less than a trip to Moscow for the Champions League
              final will do for the club.  </p>
