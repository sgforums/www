            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Fergie vows to keep Pique</strong><br><br>Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson has ruled out letting Gerard Pique leave Old Trafford.<br><br>The Spanish defender has been linked with a move way from United when the transfer window reopens in January, with Atletico Madrid the latest club credited with an interest in the highly-rated stopper.<br><br>"I am not surprised people are saying they are interested in him," said Ferguson.<br><br>"Zaragoza tried to buy him in the summer. They offered a lot of money for him. But no. The boy's future is here.<br><br>"I have no fears for him. The course we have set is a good one and there is absolutely no intention of letting him go."<br><br>Ferguson believes Pique understands that he will have to wait for his chance at Old Trafford, but is confident the young Spaniard will make his mark at the club.<br><br>"Gerard understands perfectly well the form of Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic, who are tremendous players, has been so good, he is going to have to wait a bit," added Ferguson.<br><br>"But waiting is not a problem for a 20-year-old. He will have many opportunities to play when I need to rest defenders and I have the great option of being able to play him in midfield or at right-back."</div>
