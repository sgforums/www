              <p>Could it be 13th time lucky for Wigan? Current form says absolutely not. The Latics have faced United 12 times since being promoted to the top flight in 2005 (11 in the Premier League, once in the League Cup) and lost every one, conceding 37 goals and scoring just four in the process. On paper, Sir Alex Ferguson could not wish for a better start to three consecutive away games that will shape his team's title challenge, with Stamford Bridge and Anfield awaiting next week. But this is where Wayne Rooney and Dimitar Berbatov must respond to their manager's call to improve outside of Old Trafford. <strong>Andy Hunter</strong></p>

              <p>Michael Owen could return to the Manchester United squad for Saturday's trip to Wigan.</p>
              <p>The former England striker last featured in the FA Cup win at Southampton last month.</p>
              <p>Since then though, he suffered a groin injury in training that it was feared could rule the 30-year-old out for an extended period, possibly the remainder of the season.</p>
              <p>However, the damage was not as severe as had been depicted and Sir Alex Ferguson confirmed Owen is in contention for Saturday's encounter at the DW Stadium.</p>
              <p>"Michael is back training and could be available on Saturday," said Ferguson.</p>
              <p>Owen was one of seven senior players to miss Wednesday's Champions League draw with Marseille at the Stade Velodrome, when Ferguson admitted: "Nothing happened."</p>
              <p>Of the rest, only veteran winger Ryan Giggs is in contention to play, either at Wigan or Tuesday's crucial clash with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>"The situation has not changed very much," admitted the Scot.</p>
              <p>"We are trying to get Ryan fit."</p>
              <p>It means Rio Ferdinand, who has not played since suffering a calf injury in the warm-up ahead of United's shock defeat at Wolves earlier this month, will sit out the Chelsea encounter.</p>
              <p>"Rio Ferdinand and Jonny Evans will be available for next week, and that means the Liverpool game."</p>
              <p>Ferguson might not be too concerned given Chris Smalling's recent outstanding performances, culminating in Wednesday night's effort when, for the sixth time in seven Champions League games this season, United kept a clean sheet.</p>
              <p>Antonio Valencia, Park Ji-sung and Anderson will all be out for longer, presumably not until a potential FA Cup sixth round tie with Arsenal on March 12 at the earliest.</p>
              <p>"It is difficult to assess Antonio Valencia because he is doing very well, he is in contact training now," said Ferguson.</p>
              <p>"He has been taking part in all the sessions, so it is just that decision to play him in terms of his own confidence after such a long time out. It could be two weeks. We are hopeful.</p>
              <p>"Park Ji-sung will be another two weeks and Anderson three, depending on how his progress goes because he is over in Portugal at the moment."</p>

Wigan has beaten chelsea and liverpool this season, so this makes an interested match to see if Wigan can beat united. if wolves can beat united few weeks back, Wigan might be thinking, why not, we have nothing to lose and everything to gain the 3 points at stake.</p></div>

              <p>Flattering scoreline for United to be honest. Van der Sar was in top top form last night, making one on one saves twice in the first half or United would be fighting a very different battle altogether.</p>
              <p>The Right and Left Back of the night, O'Shea and Evra, had a tough time with N'Zogbia and Moses although most of the time Wigan played route one with Rodallega the lone target. Smalling and Vidic stood firm and once again Smalling played well altough he did get himself into sticky situation a couple of times for being too clever by side-stepping.</p>
              <p>United looked really really weak in midfield. Apart from Nani, the rest are really not performing. Scholes is especially disappointing, his backpass was intercepted and presented Moses with the 1st one on one opportunity. Fletcher was all over the place and was never effective on the wings without an overlapping support which O'Shea is unable to provide because he has no pace and if Wigan breaks into counter, he will never be able to stop speedy Moses. Having said that, the right wing was severely crippled because Fletcher play square passes infield instead of taking on defenders. Carrick, hmmm, ok he did win back some balls but we have yet to see the laser-guided passes from his first season at United. Nani played from left to right wing and did well although he was really selfish at times where his teammates are in better position to score, and what's with that freekick? Not rugby leh.</p>
              <p>The subs, Gibson for Scholes and Fabio for Nani, did not have much to do because Wigan is more concerned at keeping the score down. Well done Fabio for keeping his composure and scored a goal.</p>
              <p>Rooney and Chicharito didn't click that well, they misread each other's intentions and runs a couple of times although the 2 goals Chicharito scored was either envisioned by Rooney or assisted by Rooney. Berbatov came on for Chicharito and I must say his partnership with Rooney is starting to look World-Class. They know each other's movement and Rooney scored on the counter thanks to an unselfish Berbatov.</p>
              <p>Frankly, United did not cruised through as written in some reports as those who watched the match last night would have lost a few hair and a few nails with the Wigan's one on ones.</p>

              <p>yeh i thought wigan were rather unlucky though...at one point they were 6-0 in terms of corners lol. Nevertheless, a closely fought match like this calls for star players to win it. This hernandez anticipated nani's cross perfectly.....the latter didn't even look up before sending the ball in! How often has he started this season? And he has 13 goals! Says a lot about his potential.</p>
              <p>He reminds me of owen in some shades...they both lurk around the box and wait for their chance. So if their opponents are attacking, they may look anonymous because they are always higher up awaiting the chance. Difference is....... owen when younger depended a lot on his pace. Hernandez uses his goal poaching instincts to seek out the right positions.</p>

              <p>It's interesting how fergie uses the players these days. He would rest 
              rafael when everyone thought he's the first choice right back now. 
              Likewise for berbatov.</p>
              <p>He seems to be sowing seeds of hunger before harvesting them at the right place and time lol. Well, I mean stadium and match hehe.....</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, it brings joy unto united fans like me to see the calibre of players on the bench.</p>

              <p>The refereeing is very poor throughout the entire match la.</p>
              <p>Not siding any team but how can that malicious and very late tackle from Caldwell against Evra not warranty at least a yellow but Chicharito preventing an early freekick results in one? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="icon_confused.gif"></p>

              <p>Flattering scoreline for United to be honest. Van der Sar was in
              top top form last night, making one on one saves twice in the first
              half or United would be fighting a very different battle
              altogether.</p>
              <p>The Right and Left Back of the night, O'Shea and Evra, had a
              tough time with N'Zogbia and Moses although most of the time Wigan
              played route one with Rodallega the lone target. Smalling and Vidic
              stood firm and once again Smalling played well altough he did get
              himself into sticky situation a couple of times for being too
              clever by side-stepping.</p>
              <p>United looked really really weak in midfield. Apart from Nani,
              the rest are really not performing. Scholes is especially
              disappointing, his backpass was intercepted and presented Moses
              with the 1st one on one opportunity. Fletcher was all over the
              place and was never effective on the wings without an overlapping
              support which O'Shea is unable to provide because he has no pace
              and if Wigan breaks into counter, he will never be able to stop
              speedy Moses. Having said that, the right wing was severely
              crippled because Fletcher play square passes infield instead of
              taking on defenders. Carrick, hmmm, ok he did win back some balls
              but we have yet to see the laser-guided passes from his first
              season at United. Nani played from left to right wing and did well
              although he was really selfish at times where his teammates are in
              better position to score, and what's with that freekick? Not rugby
              leh.</p>
              <p>The subs, Gibson for Scholes and Fabio for Nani, did not have
              much to do because Wigan is more concerned at keeping the score
              down. Well done Fabio for keeping his composure and scored a
              goal.</p>
              <p>Rooney and Chicharito didn't click that well, they misread each
              other's intentions and runs a couple of times although the 2 goals
              Chicharito scored was either envisioned by Rooney or assisted by
              Rooney. Berbatov came on for Chicharito and I must say his
              partnership with Rooney is starting to look World-Class. They know
              each other's movement and Rooney scored on the counter thanks to an
              unselfish Berbatov.</p>
              <p>Frankly, United did not cruised through as written in some
              reports as those who watched the match last night would have lost a
              few hair and a few nails with the Wigan's one on ones.</p>

              <p>funny thing is while MUFC seems to be "struggling" in our eyes, they are chalking up the results. either the old fox is doing something right or the whole EPL is moving backwards.. I prefer the former.</p>
              <p>saying such, I do echo what you said.  and I do agree with what one gunners who shared, MUFC lacks flair. I think MUFC has become more mechanical than flair unlike barca/gunners. </p>
              <p>not sure what's a good solution given now the news (rumours) about SAF's retirement floating if MUFC were to win this season's title, the glaciers not selling to qatars, and 135M surplus for transfers.of course, tops is to get a good keeper, and then a creative MF.</p>
