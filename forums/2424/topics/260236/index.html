            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Darren Fletcher isn't concerned over the arrivals of midfield trio Nani, Anderson and Owen Hargreaves at Manchester United.</strong><br><br>He said: "We've spent money to bring in three new midfielders and it's exciting.<br><br>"Owen is a great player and has never quite received the praise he deserved. But he had a terrific World Cup last summer and is a main player for England. Anderson and Nani both have excellent reputations and I'm sure the signings will prove to be money well spent.<br><br><strong>"It will make it even more difficult to get into the team but it's a challenge I'm ready for. From the outside I'm looked upon as a squad player - that's a label you're given. It's not a tag I like and I try to fight against it.</strong><br><br>"But that's the way it is for a lot of players at a club this big. I played nearly 40 times last season, so it's not that bad being a squad player!<br><br>"I'd love to play in every game but you have to be realistic and know that few achieve that. I believe I contributed to winning the title and deserved my place as the season got down to the business end.<br><br><strong>"When I was left out of the side I didn't sulk. I kept my head up, worked hard and was patient.</strong><br><br>"It paid off because it meant I was in the right mind when I was called upon by the gaffer.<br><br>"There were games I thought I played well in and then the boss would drop me in the next game.<br><br>"Obviously, I was disappointed when the manager left me out but I had to get over it quickly."<br><br><span style="color: red;">What a good professional. </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>he's a great professional who's stepped into positions when someone was needed.<br><br>when i first saw him, he wasn't exactly quality but his recent performances have won my dad, and eventually me over.<br><br>i remember that he very willingly played at right-back for awhile. he seriously can't play as a winger, but seems rather effective when a high-energy central midfielder is needed to close down opponents. his determination has won him the ball in quite a few ocassions and while he isn't the best technically, his raw will to win makes up for it rather well.<br><br>i do believe that even with the situation now, he's gonna get a fair number of games. Scholes will be used more sparingly and Carrick might be pushed to do the deep-playmaking role when paired with Hargreaves. Fletcher can learn plenty from Hargreaves, and might just be needed to fill that gap from time to time.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>to be fair, he matured and played better with each game in last EPL season..<br><br>hopefully, he can further improve..<br><br>also, think Fergie may tinker with the team during pre-season games to find the best formation.<br><br>perhaps now he has other options to play.</div>
