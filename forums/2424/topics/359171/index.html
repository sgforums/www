              Can United take another step towards an 18th league title by winning the 151st Manchester derby?
              
              Form Guide: Unitedâ€™s midweek Champions League triumph over Arsenal was the fifth straight win since losing the FA Cup semi-final to Everton on penalties. The Reds will be desperate to avenge last yearâ€™s 2-1 home defeat to City but more importantly three points would leave the champions needing a maximum of four points from the remaining three games to retain the title (86 points is the highest possible total Liverpool can achieve). City come to Old Trafford on the back of four straight wins including an impressive 2-1 away victory over Unitedâ€™s FA Cup conquerors Everton, only their second away league win this campaign. Mark Hughes' men currently lie eighth and are battling with West Ham, Fulham and Spurs for seventh place in the league and with it, Europa League football next season.
              
              Ins and Outs: Correctly predicting Sir Alex Fergusonâ€™s starting line-up has often proved difficult this season and it's no different for Sundayâ€™s match. There will likely be starting berths for Paul Scholes and Carlos Tevez, who played no part in the Champions League semi-final second leg win over Arsenal, and Darren Fletcher could be given a chance to put his final heartache behind him and drive the Redsâ€™ midfield. City are without injured duo Craig Bellamy and Benjani, who scored both goals at Old Trafford last season, though versatile defender Pablo Zabaleta is expected to return after a hamstring problem. Shaun Wright-Phillips is in contention after missing five games through injury, but in-form Brazilian midfielder Elano may keep him out of the eleven.
              
              Star Man: Brazilian striker Robinho has scored in each of Cityâ€™s past three games, but these have been his only three goals of 2009. Undoubtedly a precocious talent, his form has suffered away from Eastlands - only three of his 15 goals this season have been scored on the road. United should also be wary of the impressive Stephen Ireland, who was nominated for PFA Young Player of the Year alongside Reds duo Rafael and Jonny Evans.
              
              Referee: Chris Foy (Merseyside). Foy will be taking charge at Old Trafford for the first time this season, though he has refereed the Redsâ€™ away games at Portsmouth, Stoke City and Aston Villa plus the Carling Cup final against Spurs. In 34 games this season, he has shown 112 yellow cards but only two reds.
