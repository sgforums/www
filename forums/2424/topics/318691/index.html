              <h2>Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney has claimed that a pre-match
              team talk by manager Sir Alex Ferguson inspired the team to go on and
              win the Champions League.</h2>
              <p>United were crowned European champions in midweek after beating Chelsea
              in a penalty shootout after the game had finished one all. This, added
              to the Premier League title, claimed a week earlier ensured the side
              claimed yet another historic Double. <br><br>However Rooney has
              revealed that it was Ferguson’s words in the dressing room before the
              game that inspired the team to victory against Chelsea.  <br><br>“Just
              listening to him in the team meeting before the game made the hairs on
              the back of your neck stand up,” he said before adding, “I am not going
              to say exactly what he said but he really inspired us.” <br><br>Rooney
              went on to lavish praise on his manager who has now guided the club to
              two Champions League titles. He said: “You have to respect him so much.
              He's been there before and with all his experience you have to listen
              to him.” <br><br>He also revealed that Ferguson’s appetite for the
              game remains undiminished, saying: “Sir Alex has been fantastic for
              Manchester United. Since I have been there he has been amazing. His
              desire to win after all these years is unbelievable. It proves how good
              he is with the trophies he has won.”<br><br>Rooney also dismissed any
              talk of Ferguson retiring in the near future and revealed how much his
              manager loved his job: “On the training pitch he is laughing and
              smiling and joking. He is really happy. He enjoys coming in every day
              and just passing his knowledge down to the younger players. I can't see
              him leaving now.”</p>
