              <p>http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/news/Exclusive-Manchester-United-transfer-news-Inter-Milan-midfielder-Wesley-Sneijder-has-hinted-he-is-ready-to-listen-to-United-overtures-possibly-paving-way-for-a-record-breaking-30m-plus-transfer-article717892.html</p>
              <p>Wesley Sneijder has offered the first indication he is ready to listen to Manchester United's overtures.</p>
              <p>And
               that could pave the way for a record-breaking bid by the Premier League
               club, as manager Sir Alex Ferguson looks for the final piece in his 
              latest Old Trafford jigsaw.</p>
              <p>The world renowned Dutch international
               midfielder snubbed a move by United last season, insisting he preferred
               instead to stay with reigning European champions Inter Milan.</p>
              <p>That
               was a real blow to Ferguson, who had targeted the 26-year-old World Cup
               star as the last - and most valuable - big-money player he will bring 
              to Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>The United boss was so determined to land Sneijder that when he failed
               he had no viable alternative, so decided not to make any significant 
              summer signing.</p>
              <p>The Mirror understands the classy Dutch midfielder
               has now decided the time is right to move on from the rigid constraints
               of Italian football and try the Premier League, which he has always 
              admitted was a lure for him.</p>
              <p>Sneijder signed a new deal with Inter
               only last summer when he turned down United's offer, but sources close 
              to the player have made clear his desire to reconsider his situation at 
              the end of the season.</p>
              <p>United have been made aware of the player's
               intentions, and have already been encouraged to make an offer serious 
              enough to persuade cash-strapped Inter to sell.</p>
              <p>Inter's president,
               Massimo Moratti, said only last week that he is determined not to sell 
              to the English club, but if the Holland international remains determined
               to go and the fee is high enough, he will have few options but to 
              relent.</p>
              <p>Ferguson, for his part, has identified midfield as the key
               area to strengthening his current squad, which has a remarkably young 
              average age, and real, exciting potential.</p>
              <p>He has more than a 
              dozen players under the age of 25 with significant first-team experience
               but wants more bite in midfield and more creativity going forward.</p>
              <p>Sneijder
               is now widely regarded as the best in the world at the latter, and 
              would be an exciting addition to a forward line that already boasts 
              Wayne Rooney, Javier Hernandez, Dimitar Berbatov, Nani and Antonio 
              Valencia.</p>
              <p>Ferguson also wants a mobile, combative, more 
              defensively-minded midfielder, and has made clear his admiration for 
              Everton's exciting youngster Jack Rodwell.</p>
              <p>But Sneijder is 
              undoubtedly his number one target, and the latest news from Italy will 
              only encourage the United boss to step up his efforts to land the 
              midfielder as a long-term replacement for Paul Scholes.</p>
              <p>The Glazer
               family, United's American owners, have already sanctioned a significant
               summer outlay. The Red Devils could be willing to smash their transfer 
              record - the near-£31million fee that brought Berbatov to the club.</p>
              <p>The
               key will be the Dutchman's desire to taste English football, and he has
               indicated that he is determined to now do that, after spending two 
              years in the tactically constrained limitations of Serie A.</p>
              <p>Ferguson
               also wants a keeper, and sources in Spain have this weekend suggested 
              he has taken a step closer to agreeing a near £15m deal to land Atletico
               Madrid's highly-rated David de Gea.</p>
