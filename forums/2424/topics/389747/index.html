              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">MANCHESTER UNITED have £100million to spend on players and there are no problems with their debt.</h2>
              <p class="article">That was the astonishing claim from chief executive David Gill, who clearly does not understand what everyone is worrying about.</p>
              <p class="article">While recent figures revealed the Glazers' ownership had resulted in a £716.5m debt for all things United, Gill says it is half that.</p>
              <p class="article">And while staff are denied tea and toast at the training ground, boss Alex Ferguson is sitting on a huge transfer kitty.</p>
              <p class="article">Asked if he still had the money from Cristiano Ronaldo's £80m sale, Gill said: "Without doubt. We used £15m to buy Antonio Valencia but we have well over £100m sitting in the bank."</p>
              <p class="article">And he called talk of a £716m debt "a misconception", adding: "As of Friday last week, we had £140m of cash in the group, so our net debt within the group is £360m."</p>

              <p>yep, not only Owen,maybe even Vidic, he is having a start-stop season.</p>
              <p>well, not sure about selling berba, he seems to add another dimension to MU's game in that, he is able to control the tempo. Benzema and Rooney are like one gear machines, chiong.  but MU will need a striker soon, Owen won't last, right?</p>
              <p>btw, how much did Smalling cost?</p>

              <p>David Gill confirms what I have been arguing all along - United's debt woes are grossly exxaggerated by the ABU press who would love to see us fail.</p>
              <p>United Long Term Debt - 500 million pounds</p>
              <p>United Cash in Bank - 140 million pounds</p>
              <p>Net Debt - 360 million pounds</p>
              <p>Net Assets - 500 million pounds</p>
              <p>You will find many other popular counters listed in Singapore with a much greater debt gearing level.</p>

              <p>well, purely as a football fan, if the club get one or two big signings, season ticket doesn't increase, watching football is still as cheap over the cable, then all things green. </p>
              <p>if they keep missing in transfer market, season tickets increase, people get laid off at club, then maybe, things are on a orange alert.</p>
              <p>if mass mobs gather to ask for owners' exit, the season ticket prices escalates, and club is selling off their best players, red alert.</p>
              <p>so where are we now??</p>

              <p>How come people just don't understand that ticket price increased isn't purely just at United... It's happening across the board at most Premier league clubs... and in terms of percentage, theirs is just average and certainly not the highest...</p>
              <p>Does anyone realised its cheaper to watch a United match than a Newcastle one? Check this out... <a href="http://english-premier-league.suite101.com/article.cfm/premier_league_ticket_prices_0809">http://english-premier-league.suite101.com/article.cfm/premier_league_ticket_prices_0809</a></p>
              <p>And United's OT despite being up in the North, they are paying tax comparable to London's rates... <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/premierleague/6440756/Premier-League-and-Championship-season-ticket-prices-to-rise-after-tax-rate-hikes.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/premierleague/6440756/Premier-League-and-Championship-season-ticket-prices-to-rise-after-tax-rate-hikes.html</a> </p>
              <p>Ticket price increased is sometimes not just the owners who are doing it for their own gains. Sometimes they are force as the government tax them very high on their stadiums. Some fans are only making too much out of it cos they have other agendas on their minds... You don't hear other club fans making a fuss about it even when they are paying more... Only those anti-Glazers ones are making all the noise... Imagine City's ticket is only $4 lesser than United's and it's at OT that you get to see more of the star quality players over the years... But we don't see City fans complaining...</p>
              <p>And if you say selling off their best players, who are you referring to? Danny Simpson? Richardson? Heinze? Alan Smith? Rossi? Or just Ronaldo? Cos apart from him, the rest are quite ordinary players...</p>
              <p>Ronaldo was not the club's or owner's wish to sell, He wanted to leave on his own will... To play for his boyhood dream club. He actually delayed his departure cos the club retain his service year after year before they finally allowed him to go and fulfil his dream...</p>

              <p><strong>Transfers under Glazer's Regime - </strong></p>
              <p>IN:</p>
              <p>Carrick (18 mil), Anderson (18 mil), Nani (17 mil), Hargreaves (20mil), Park (3 mil), Vidic (7 mil), Evra (5.5 mil), Berbatov (31 mil), Smalling (10mil), Valencia (18 mil), Foster (5 mil)</p>
              <p>OUT</p>
              <p>Heinze, Richardson, Alan Smith, Simpson, Silvestre, Ronaldo, Rossi, Saha, Pique</p>
              <p>The list isn't entirely accurate as I can't recall all of the transfer activities over the past 5 years. But based on this high profile transfers, it is clear that Glazer has given Fergie a blank chequebook to sign players of great value. The only player that left our club at his prime was Ronaldo but he chose to go.</p>
