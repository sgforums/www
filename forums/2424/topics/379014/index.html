              <p>Brazilian midfielder <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=88360"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Anderson Oliveira</span></a> insists he is happy with life at Manchester United following a difficult start to the season.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="sp-inlinePhoto"><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/JonMC/January2009/port-275.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="275" height="200">
              <div style="width: 275px;">
              <p class="photoCredit"> </p>
              <p class="photoDesc">Anderson has had to cope with losing good friends Ronaldo and Tevez.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It was a disappointing start to the campaign for the midfielder but after being involved in just one of United's opening four Premier League games - the shock defeat at Burnley - Anderson is starting to find his form again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The 21-year-old added another five appearances to his tally during September - and also managed to score his first goal for the Old Trafford outfit against Spurs, over two years after his £17million arrival from FC Porto.</p>
              <p>And the midfielder admits he is enjoying himself again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I feel happy here,'' Anderson revealed. "Everybody has times that are not the best but I am at home here. I have been at Manchester United for three years. Everyone at the club is nice to me. It is like a family.''</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anderson suffered more than most in the summer upheaval that marked the departures of close friends Cristiano Ronaldo and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=72490"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Carlos Tevez</span></a>.</p>
              <p>He is still in touch with the pair, but feels it is time for United to look to the future.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Ronaldo is still a big friend of mine," Anderson said. "Wherever he and Tevez are, nothing will change. We are great friends. "They were both very important players for this club.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"However, this often happens in football and the club has to move on. We still have great players here like <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=8853"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ryan Giggs</span></a>, <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=21046"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Wayne Rooney</span></a> and Nani. Now we also have <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=65629"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Antonio Valencia</span></a>. United must go forward and not get stuck in the past.''</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=30"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></a> will certainly be intending for United to go forward this weekend, when his side entertain Bolton looking for a win after that unexpected and controversial slip-up against Sunderland a fortnight ago.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Wayne Rooney and Jonny Evans will both be checked after pulling out of midweek international engagements, while <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=8884"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Edwin van der Sar</span></a> is expected to earn a recall after breaking his fingers during a pre-season game in Munich.</p>
              <p>As for Anderson, he is just hoping for another opportunity to add to his scoring tally.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I should score more goals but the way the team plays it can be very difficult to get inside the area,'' he said. "Hopefully I will have more chances in the future and I can score lots more for Manchester United.''</p>

              <p>Always followed Anderson's career and just think he's a bit lost in
              Manchester and could see him out on loan... I think it would help him
              realize where he's at in the United team.</p>
