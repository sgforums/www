            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson is refusing to put a timescale on any potential retirement, despite reports in the press that he will quit in three years.</strong><br><br>The manager was quoted in the UK press as saying “maybe three more years, then I’ll finish”. But he was less committed to a specific date when asked about his intentions at his Friday press briefing at Carrington.<br><br>“I’m not putting a time limit on it, it’s impossible,” he told reporters. "You never know what happens in life.<br><br>“It’s something I have said for quite a while. If you are fit and healthy and enjoying your job, then who knows? Two, three, maybe four years, it’s difficult to pigeon-hole myself on that one.”<br><br>Sir Alex, of course, did plan to retire in 2002, but went back on his decision. The boss admitted that pre-announcing his retirement had an affect on the team, and in February 2002 agreed to stay in charge for at least another three years.<br><br>He is currently on a rolling one-year contract, and shows no sign of retiring soon.</p></div>

              <p><strong>Giggs - Fergie has the hunger</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong><img src="http://img.skysports.com/08/02/218x298/Ferguson_Giggs_664677.jpg" alt="" width="218" height="298"></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ryan Giggs believes Sir Alex Ferguson has the hunger and passion to stay at Old Trafford for the foreseeable future.</strong></p>
              <p>The club's longest serving player claims the 66-year-old Scot "is enjoying it more than ever", and will stay at United to ensure the younger players fulfil their potential.</p>
              <p> Giggs said: "He will retire some time but I cannot see it in the near future.</p>
              <p> "He has a hunger for the game and is enjoying it more than ever.</p>
              <p> "He is enjoying the way the team plays - his desire is there for all to see as well."</p>
              <p>Ferguson has a core of bright young talent to call on in the shape of Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney, Carlos Tevez, Owen Hargreaves, Michael Carrick, Anderson, Nani and Darren Fletcher.</p>
              <p>The future looks rosy for United and that is why Giggs believes the boss will stay at the helm for some time to come.</p>
              <p>"He has brought exciting young players to the club and I am sure he will want to see it through and watch them fulfil their potential," said Giggs.</p>
              <p>"It is exciting for all of us, like myself, players who have been here a long time.</p>
              <p>"You can see their desire every day in training and in games. There is a determination among the group to improve.</p>
              <p>"The manager enjoys watching them go through their paces, like we all do.</p>
              <p>"While he has mellowed from my days in the youth team, it is plain to everyone here that he is still intent on winning more trophies."</p>

              <p>In my opinion:</p>
              <p>First choice: Martin O'neill.</p>
              <p>Reason: Has demonstrated his managerial capacity through winning cups with top-flight teams like Celtic in the SPL and transforming mid-tier teams like Aston Villa and Leicester City into credible forces in the BPL. Only sticking point here is that he has yet to win a BPL or CL title.</p>
              <p>Second choice: Jose Mourinho.</p>
              <p>Reason: Sound tactical mind and has a proven track record and knowledge of the BPL through winning titles with Chelsea and the CL with Porto. However, might have a tendency to force top management to sign even more players (thus falling out with top management) and not a long-term replacement target as he might possibly move on after 4-5 seasons (or earlier if things don't go the way he wants to).</p>
              <p>The above are my personal 2cts worth. Interestingly enough, O'neill's Celtic once faced Mourinho's Porto in the 2003 UEFA Cup Finals (Celtic lost 3-2 in extra time to a silver goal). <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>frankly, i dun mind either one either.. both has proven track record to succeed... it'll also be a slap on the face of roman.. but i think there was a hidden agreement for Jose not to manage an EPL club for a couple of yrs maybe when they paid out his compensation??</p>
