              <p>SIGH..</p>
              <p class="first"><strong>Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson has said he
               may not add any more players to his squad this summer.</strong></p>
              <p>Ferguson
               has already signed Mexico's Javier Hernandez from Guadalajara and 
              defender Chris Smalling from Fulham.</p>
              <p>But a host of more signings 
              were expected, particularly after chief executive David Gill indicated 
              funds are available to his manager.</p>
              <p>"There may be one signing but
               it's not easy in the present climate. The market is very difficult," 
              said Ferguson.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Speaking alongside Gill at a press 
              conference in New York to promote United's four-game North American tour
               this summer, Ferguson added: "The structure of our squad is good in 
              terms of ages, the balance, the numbers and there's a lot of good young 
              players.</p>
              <p>"Sometimes you have to trust in the development of the 
              last few years and I'm going to stick with that, or most of it."</p>
              <p>Gill
               added: "The Premier League is bringing in squad limits next year of 25 
              but there will be unlimited under-21s and other rules and we'll be 
              taking all that into consideration."</p>
              <p>Ferguson revealed he would 
              not be replacing goalkeeper Ben Foster, instead promoting England 
              Under-21 international Ben Amos to the first-team squad alongside Edwin 
              Van der Sar and Tomasz Kuszczak.</p>

              <tr>
              <td width="5"><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/shared/img/o.gif" border="0" alt="" width="5" height="1"></td>

              <p></p>
              <p>Foster is close to completing a £6m move to Birmingham, having missed
               out on England's squad for the World Cup in South Africa.</p>
              <p>"When 
              we decided to let Ben (Foster) go, we were in the process of letting a 
              good young goalkeeper, Ben Amos, go out on loan," Ferguson said.</p>
              <p>"He's
               in the England Under-21 team but we can only accommodate three 
              goalkeepers. So when the situation with Ben's future at Manchester 
              United came into it and we agreed to let him go, we stopped Ben Amos 
              from going on loan.</p>
              <p>"He will now be our third goalkeeper, he's 
              very talented and has a good future ahead of him."</p>
              <p>Supporters' 
              groups opposed to the Glazer family's ownership of Manchester United 
              have argued that Ferguson's transfer dealings are being limited by the 
              level of debt carried by the club.</p>
              <p>But Gill said: "We're very 
              confident the business model we have in place will ensure the club can 
              continue to compete at the top of football for many years to come."</p>
              <p>"Our
               season ticket sales, renewals, for this upcoming season are on track 
              with previous years. Our executive ticket renewals are on track," he 
              said.</p>
              <p>"The owners have been true to their word since they took 
              over the club in 2005. They've brought commercial expertise and 
              commercial benefit to us in a numbers of areas, and we've seen our 
              revenues grow significantly."</p>
              <p>The club's summer tour will begin 
              with a training camp in Chicago followed by friendlies against Celtic in
               Toronto on 16 July, the Philadelphia Union in Philadelphia on 21 July, 
              the Kansas City Wizards in Kansas four days later, and the MLS All-Stars
               in Houston on 28 July.</p>
              <p>Ferguson will give his World Cup players 
              leave of absence from the tour, which will move on to Mexico and a game 
              against Guadalajara, which was agreed as part of the deal to sign 
              21-year-old forward Hernandez.</p>
