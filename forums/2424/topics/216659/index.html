            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe its abit too late...<br><br>Wayne's best moments<br><br>Wayne Rooney is indeed blessed with a remarkable talent for one so young. As he celebrates his 21st birthday we look back at 21 of his finest Red moments so farÂ…<br><br><strong>1. Fenerbahce (W 6-2) September 2004, Old Trafford</strong><br>What better way to start repaying your Â£27million price tag than a hat-trick on your debut in the Champions League? It was the stuff dreams are made of. RooneyÂ’s debut treble helped United to a 6-2 win over Fenerbahce. A hero was bornÂ… Â“What a nightÂ… what a player,Â” enthused United Review.<br><br><strong>2. Middlesbrough, (W 3-0) January 2005, Old Trafford</strong><br>Two goals, could have been more. One of WayneÂ’s two strikes was a delectable, deft chip, the other an unstoppable volley.<br><br><strong>3. Liverpool, January 2005 (W 1-0), Anfield</strong><br>Always one for the big occasion, RooneyÂ’s solitary goal gifted United a crucial away win at Anfield. He showed his delight by puffing his cheeks at the baying Kop End Â– one of the lasting images from the 2004/05 season.<br><br><strong>4. Manchester City (W 2-0), February 2005, City of Manchester Stadium</strong><br>The only Reds scorer on the day (Richard Dunne got an own goal) Rooney endeared himself to UnitedÂ’s fans with a stunning display against our nearest and (not so) dearest.<br><br><strong>5. Portsmouth (W 2-1) February 2005, Old Trafford</strong>Rooney grabbed this game by the scruff of the neck and won it almost single-handedly. Â“This wasnÂ’t just about goals, they merely put the seal on a great all-round game by Rooney - every facet was perfect,Â” said Sir Alex.<br><br><strong>6. Southampton (W 4-0), March 2005, St MaryÂ’s Stadium</strong><br>Rooney was rampant in this comfortable 4-0 FA Cup win on the South Coast. The Saints had no reply to his powerful, driving runs nor his incisive, subtle passing. Unfortunately goalkeeper Paul Smith denied him the goal he richly deserved.<br><br><strong>7. Blackburn Rovers (D 0-0), April 2005, Old Trafford</strong><br>Wayne was electric. His hard-working display was spoiled only by Brad FriedelÂ’s right post, denying him a 30-yard corker that would have won the game.<br><br><strong>8. Everton (L 0-1), April 2005, Goodison Park</strong><br>Always a threat against his former club, RooneyÂ’s explosive pace and strength tested EvertonÂ’s ageing back line. Unfortunately his endeavour was not matched by his team-mates as the Reds fell to a 1-0 defeat.<br><br><strong>9. Newcastle United (W 2-1), April 2005, Old Trafford</strong><br>Having already run the Geordies ragged in the most one-sided FA Cup semi final youÂ’ll ever see, Rooney scored a stunning 25-yard volley that left an indelible mark on everyone in the stadium.<br><br><strong>10. Charlton Athletic (W 4-0), May 2005, The Valley</strong><br>Â“A Wazza masterclass,Â” said United Magazine. His display oozed class and he threatened as early as the first minute. Rooney finally got his first after earlier setting up Scholes and UnitedÂ’s fourth with a chip on 68 minutes.<br><br><strong>11. Debreceni (W 3-0), August 2005, Old Trafford</strong><br>A hugely influential performance. Announcing his intent with an early opening goal to settle UnitedÂ’s nerves, Rooney then turned provider for UnitedÂ’s second and third after the break. United Review described him as Â“a joy to watch.Â”<br><br><strong>12. Everton (W 2-0), August 2005, Goodison Park</strong><br>Reds were treated to a clinical, devastating display that underlined RooneyÂ’s growing maturity. He scored the first on returning to his old stomping ground and had a hand in RuudÂ’s opener.<br><br><strong>13. Newcastle United (W 2-0), August 2005, St JamesÂ’ Park</strong><br>Scoring the first in a 2-0 win over the Magpies, Rooney played with a prodigious skill and power, as well as a level of intensity only the giants of the game can reach.<br><br><strong>14. Sunderland (W3-1), October 2005, Stadium of Light</strong><br>Star of the show once again. Rooney was at the centre of everything Rooney, scoring one, setting up another and playing with passion, guile and direction. Unstoppable.<br><br><strong>15. Charlton Athletic (W 3-1), November 2005, The Valley</strong><br>Â“Rooney and Van Nistelrooy were great,Â” said Sir Alex after UnitedÂ’s first game after Roy KeaneÂ’s departure. Wazza couldnÂ’t find the score sheet but he was inspirational throughout in a 3-1 win, setting up one of the goals of the season with a winding run.<br><br><strong>16. West Ham (W 2-1), November 2005, Upton Park</strong><br>On a night when United (both Manchester and West Ham) celebrated the life of George Best, Wayne put in a scintillating display, scoring UnitedÂ’s first. Â“HeÂ’s only 20 and without question the best young player IÂ’ve seen in my time,Â” enthused Sir Alex after the game. Â“If he keeps developing and maturing, goodness knows what he can become.Â”<br><br><strong>17. Wigan Athletic (W 4-0), February 2006, Millennium Stadium</strong><br>Wayne picks up his first winnersÂ’ medal having contributed two goals in a mesmerising performance against Wigan in Cardiff.<br><br><strong>18. Newcastle United (W 2-0), March 2006, Old Trafford</strong><br>Wazza scored his fifth and sixth goals against Newcastle in a Red shirt in a 2-0 win at Old Trafford, He stole the show with a bright, intelligent, lethal and powerful performance.<br><br><strong>19. Arsenal (2-0), April 2006, Old Trafford</strong><br>Scored, createdÂ… awesome once again.  As well as leading the line he chased and harassed back when called for Â– he showed he is the man for the big occasion. One touch was all that was needed before rifling past Lehmann for UnitedÂ’s first, and it could have been two had the referee seen ToureÂ’s Â‘saveÂ’.<br><br><strong>20. Fulham (W 5-1), August 2006, Old Trafford</strong><br>One rebound and another that went in off Ian Pearce and Wazza was back after his injury-hit summer. This performance also dispelled the myth that there was a rift between Rooney and Ronaldo as the duo ran the Cottagers ragged.<br><br><strong>21. Wigan Athletic (W 3-1), October 2006, JJB Stadium</strong><br>Â“In my opinion heÂ’s the best player in the world,Â” said Paul Jewell after Wazza had helped blitz his side in a devastating 45-minute period. Â“He wonÂ’t care what I say, what you say or what the television people say. HeÂ’s got such strong belief in himself it doesnÂ’t matter to him.Â” Rooney was revitalised and scintillating in attack. After hitting the bar in the first half he contributed three assists in the second.<br><br><a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA%2D9A47%2D47BC%2DB069%2D3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=373571" rel="nofollow">http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA%2D9A47%2D47BC%2DB069%2D3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=373571</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>21 today: Wayne in words</strong><br><br>Wayne Rooney turns 21 today, from Ryan Giggs to Ronaldinho, Michael Owen to Mick McCarthy, football peers and opposition managers queue up to praise his ability.<br><br>"Rooney is one of the best players in the world. He's already very important, but in the future his contribution is going to be even greater."<br>- <strong>Ronaldinho</strong><br><br>"There are players that have fire in them and he's one of them. Take it out of him and you won't get the same player. It's about striking a balance. Roy Keane was the same, as was Paul Ince. You just hope the character of the player and the experiences of playing create that balance."<br>- <strong>Ryan Giggs</strong><br><br>"As a player he's got everything. He can play deep, left, right or in the middle. He scores goals inside the area but can also score from outside the box. As if that wasn't enough, he sometimes plays in goal in training."<br>- <strong>Wes Brown</strong><br><br>"Wayne is the best young player in the world. He has everything."<br>- <strong>The late George Best</strong><br><br>"There isn't another player in the world who has the ability Wayne has. He's achieved so much at a young age - he's the main man for club and country. He astounds me. He is a phenomenon."<br>- <strong>Sir Bobby Robson</strong><br><br>"Rooney can do the lot. Eventually he'll have all the United records. He has the ability and goal power to beat my 18 hat-tricks and, as for my 46 in a season, I don't see any reason why he can't overtake that. Every time he gets the ball there's a buzz of expectation from the crowd and ppposition defenders are in a panic."<br>- <strong>Denis Law</strong><br><br>"I could go on all day about Wayne because he's such a big talent. He's going to keep breaking records and I'm just glad he's English."<br>- <strong>Steven Gerrard</strong><br><br>"I think England have got some super players and an extra special one in Rooney. If you look back at the history of football, great sides have always had special players that lift the team. Platini did it for France, Maradona for Argentina and Rooney does the same."<br>- <strong>Glenn Hoddle</strong><br><br>"Wayne came into the England team at an even younger age than I did. If you play well and keep your form, you are going to play a lot of games for your country. And with the ability Wayne has, that means many more goals and many more records."<br>- <strong>Michael Owen</strong><br><br>"When a manager of the standing and knowledge of Sir Alex Ferguson spends Â£27m on someone, that speaks volumes. I don't want to say too many nice things about him because he's peed me off always scoring against me."<br>- <strong>Mick McCarthy</strong><br><br>"His aggression is one of his big strengths. He has no fear at all. Wayne knows he has the ability, but he has this knack of being able to go out there and not be scared of anyone no matter who he is up against."<br>- <strong>Frank Lampard</strong><br><br>"The first time I realised how special he could be was when I took an under-11 team to play Manchester United. It was eight-a-side on small pitches with small goals. All the parents were on one side of the pitch with the coaches on the other. At 11, Wayne scored an overhead kick from about 15 yards out that flew straight into the top corner. There was a silence around the pitch. I don't know where it came from but someone started clapping and within seconds everyone was clapping - including the parents from the other team."<br>- <strong>Ray Hall, Everton Academy Director</strong><br><br>"He has remarkable physical and creative power and the belief and determination to achieve whatever he sets out to do."<br>- <strong>Arsene Wenger</strong><br><br>"I would pay to watch Wayne Rooney because he plays with no fear and I like the sort of striker who will score all on his own if he wants to. He has the sort of forward's instinct no coach can teach. You are born with it."<br>- <strong>Thierry Henry</strong><br><br>"I know from personal experience that he's an absolute nightmare to mark."<br>- <strong>John Terry</strong><br><br>"He has the potential to be a legendary player. Pele had all the ability in the world. But one of his great qualities was that he could take anything and any situation in his stride. From what I have seen of Wayne, I think he can do that too."<br>- <strong>Zico</strong><br><br>"Every man and his dog has an opinion on him. The good thing is that he has his feet on the ground. He's at the right club and we know he can handle it. We will guide him."<br>- <strong>Sir Alex Ferguson</strong><br><br>"I was there when Ryan Giggs made a similar impact. Rooney, like Ryan, takes your breath away when he plays. Ryan is still playing at the top level now now and that's because he has had the right people around him like Alex Ferguson."<br>- <strong>Mark Hughes</strong><br><br>"Wayne knows all eyes are on him but he goes out and does his own thing. That's fantastic."<br>- <strong>Ruud van Nistelrooy</strong><br><br>"Football needs heroes like Wayne Rooney."<br>- <strong>Brian Clough</strong><br><br>"Have I got any plans for his birthday? What, like a cake? ...You never know. But, seriously, it was his 100th United game against Liverpool, that in itself is an incredible landmark for a boy of 21. I would say he is the best 21-year-old I've had at this club, and I hope he plays 1000 games here."<br>- <strong>Sir Alex Ferguson</strong><br><br><a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA%2D9A47%2D47BC%2DB069%2D3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=373373" rel="nofollow">http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA%2D9A47%2D47BC%2DB069%2D3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=373373</a></div>
