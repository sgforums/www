              <h2><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/37703_news.jpg" alt=""></h2>
              <h2>Wayne Rooney has poured cold water on the idea of a transfer
              overseas, insisting that he would like nothing better than to play out
              the rest of his career with Manchester United.</h2>
              <p>When questioned about the possibility of moving abroad, Rooney told <em>The Mirror</em>:<em> </em>“Come on, can you ever see me playing for a foreign team? I love England, I love being close to my family.<br><br>“To
              be honest I don’t even like going down to London. I am not comfortable
              there. I’m a northern lad and I’d like to think I could stay here for
              the rest of my career.<br><br>“The fans here at United appreciate
              players who give their all for the team and that’s what I try to do,
              and that’s all I want to do.”<br><br>Rooney has been enjoying an
              excellent run of form over the last fewweeks, although it must be said
              his performance against Everton yesterday was not among his finest.<br><br>The
              23-year-old grew visibly frustrated upon his return to Goodison Park,
              the stomping ground he abandoned in a £31million move in 2004. He was
              substituted shortly after receiving a yellow card and taunting the
              Toffees faithful by kissing the badge on his shirt.<br><br>The latter
              incident is indicative of Rooney's passionate, heart-on-sleeve attitude
              towards United, and he insisted that he would happily sacrifice his
              superstar status for a few more medals with the Red Devils.<br><br>He
              said: “I am more concentrated on helping United to win the Premier
              League, the Champions League and the FA Cup. I am more interested in
              that.”<br><br>That is not to say Rooney has no individual ambitions.
              Unselfish and hard-working he may be but, as a forward first and
              foremost, he understands that his job is to score - or at least create
              - goals.<br><br>The England star is one strike away from his century in
              club competition; however, it would seem that cracking one tonne in a
              season is simply not enough.<br><br>“I’m only at the start of my fifth
              season with United but I’m only 15 or 16 goals off my first hundred for
              the club, and it would be nice to beat my best tally so far which is
              23,” Rooney added.<br><br>“I certainly believe I can break that 100 mark this season and if I do that then in goals it would be my best ever.”</p>

              <p><strong>What did Wayne really do wrong?</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>So why is it that the behaviour of Everton fans towards one of their best ever players means the police have to arrange a 12pm kick off in order to try and keep order?</strong></p>
              <p><a id="more"></a></p>
              <div class="entry-more">
              <p>Wayne Rooney broke the hearts of Everton fans. He waited until the last possible day before signing for United and has never been forgiven. No thanks for that wonderful goal against David Seaman or the amazing skills he lit up the Premier League with. Just raw bitterness and anger that he is not there now. Everton did not even suffer without him, they went from strength to strength after he left, until Graveson left that is. </p>
              <p>And why should he be there now? To throw away an England career like Le Tissier did? To not be winning the European Cup solely because he felt he owed something to the same animals who now pelt him with missiles? Everton fans have now shown their true colours (like Rooney they would add) and if Rooney had stayed at a club oozing with mediocrity just to keep the peace with those idiots then more the fool him.</p>
              <p>I know that many Everton fans are angered but are not as hostile in their actions, which I respect, but far too many behaved disgracefully yesterday.</p>
              <p>And well done to Rooney for kissing the United badge yesterday, those fans deserved it. I'm not sure why the referee felt compelled to threaten him with a second yellow for it, but the Park End deserved what it got.</p>
              <p>Perhaps Everton fans think they are our rivals as that this somehow equates to Sol moving across North London or Paul Ince signing for Liverpool. Well that is strange if they do, they wouldn't appear in our top five list of rivals ahead of Liverpool, City, Leeds etc. Football clubs have different cultures and perhaps Everton epitomise Boris Johnson's comments about Liverpool being a self pity city wanting to be bitter rather than celebrate the fact that brought through one of the best talents in world football and are accept they were not big enough to keep him. One thing for sure is that Rooney is not as bitter though, and has little time to care as he looks at his trophy cabinet and his England career. </p>
