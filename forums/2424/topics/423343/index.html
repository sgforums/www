              <p>The chances are you may never have seen him play but, at <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester United" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united"><span style="color: #005689;">Manchester United</span></a>, they are already talking about him being the most naturally talented footballer to come through their ranks since a young Paul Scholes skipped into view. His name is Ravel Morrison: 18 years old, supremely talented and tipped to be one of the pre-eminent English footballers of his generation. Morrison scored a beautiful goal to help United reach the FA Youth Cup quarter-finals last week and was in Sir Alex Ferguson's mind for a place in the squad for the FA Cup tie against Crawley, though he did not make the bench. In ordinary circumstances, it should be a time for celebration, of toasting the future in contemplation of a prodigious career and vast earning power.</p>
              <p>Yet the Morrison story is not that simple. What United hoped would never become public knowledge is that, three weeks ago, Morrison stood in the dock of Trafford youth court, alongside two accomplices, waiting to find out if he was to be sent to a young offenders' institution.</p>
              <p>Morrison had admitted two charges of intimidating a witness. He had subjected the victim of a knifepoint robbery to a two-day ordeal in an attempt to stop him giving evidence at the trial of his muggers. He had been warned he could face a spell in detention and, with that, United would almost certainly have given up on him. Instead, Morrison was given another chance: the judge decided on a 12-month referral order, warning him that if he did not comply he would be sentenced to a year behind bars. He was told his behaviour had been "appalling" and this was his last chance. What happens next? It is difficult to predict.</p>
              <p>Morrison, in terms of ability, is the real deal: balance, speed, control, vision, flair, strong on either foot, an eye for a pass and a prolific scorer for a wide, left-sided player. One clip on YouTube encapsulates what he does best: a preposterous trick to bamboozle an opponent from the Blackburn youth team, incorporating a triple drag-back and a backheeled nutmeg. Let's not judge a player on internet footage, but this was a moment that would have brought Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo to their feet. "Silks", as Rio Ferdinand calls it.</p>
              <p>He has played for England at under-16, under-17 and under-18 level and made his United debut, as a substitute, in the Carling Cup tie against Wolves in October. One FA Youth Cup tie in 2008 prompted the <em>Times</em> to wonder "when [we] last saw such balance and daring from an English 15-year-old". The <em>Daily Telegraph</em> has tipped him as "a potential gem for 2014 [World Cup]." The <em>Independent</em> identified Morrison in a feature about 'Five Young Players to Watch in 2010.'</p>
              <p>He is not the first young footballer to end up in court. The club's view is that the good outweighs the bad and they are determined to give Morrison the help he needs, in all parts of his life. "The club does not in any way condone Ravel's actions, but he is a very talented player with a bright future ahead of him," a spokesman said. "The right thing to do now is to support him and help him in the process of his rehabilitation."</p>
              <p>Even so, there is a genuine concern at United that he has fallen in with the wrong crowd and is in danger of frittering away what could be a dazzling career. Two of his friends were locked up for the robbery. The court was told Morrison subjected the victim of the mugging to threatening phone calls ("you don't know what I'm capable of") over the course of two days a year ago and was among three teenagers who threatened the boy on the street. The three later appeared in the victim's front garden in the early hours. They were chased away but then came back in a mob of 15 to 20 people. A brick was thrown through the window. The victim was so traumatised his family have put the house up for sale and want to leave Manchester.</p>
              <p>Since the verdict Ferguson and his coaching staff have spent many hours debating how to handle the teenager, and are still uncertain of what is best. There are already stories of Morrison missing training, or turning up late for matches. "There's always something going on with him," has become a popular refrain.</p>
              <p>More seriously, his temperamental nature and apparent dislike of authority have manifested themselves on the training ground. It is said Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, then the reserve-team manager, had to intervene in one incident. The teenager is described as someone who acts impulsively and does not think of the consequences, a fragile personality in need of a role model.</p>
              <p>Morrison was born in Wythenshawe, a sprawling council estate on the southern tip of Manchester. He lives with his grandparents, Chris and Maureen Carlway, in Denton, five miles to the east of Manchester, while his mother, Sharon Ryan, still takes an active part in his life but lives in another part of the city with her two younger boys, Rio and Zeon.</p>
              <p>Morrison has contemplated moving out, complaining that he does not like being under the watch of his grandmother, but the club would rather he stayed in the company of adults, and it is said that Rio Ferdinand and Gary Neville have both offered to take him in at different points.</p>
              <p>His friends, like many lads of 17 and 18, tend to hang around on bikes, wearing hooded tops and dark clothing. Morrison himself wore a hoodie to one court appearance. For his sentencing, he looked what he was: a teenager in Nike trainers and a tie knotted <em>Grange Hill</em>-style, ie as short as possible. There was no emotion when the judge told him he was being spared detention. However, Morrison seemed appalled when he was informed he had to pay costs, including £500 compensation to the victim. The court was told United's No49, described on the club's website as a "supremely gifted talent", had nothing in the bank despite receiving £3,400, after tax, on the 25th of every month, as part of the professional contract he signed when he was 17.</p>

              <p><strong>United's U18s followed up their impressive derby win with a 3-0 victory at Blackburn thanks to fine goals from Jesse Lingard and Ravel Morrison, who struck twice in the second half.</strong></p>
              <p>It was a well deserved victory for the Reds who always looked in control of the match and were a constant threat going forward.</p>
              <p>Lingard opened the scoring on 24 minutes following a well-worked move by Paul McGuinness' side. Michael Keane spread the play from right to left to Sean McGinty who played a lovely one-two with Paul Pogba. McGinty fired in a first time cross towards Lingard who guided a lovely volley into the far corner.</p>
              <p>Ryan Tunnicliffe almost doubled the advantage 11 minutes later after a bursting run forward, but he dragged his low drive from the edge of the box just wide.</p>
              <p>Sam Johnstone was on hand to make a fine fingertip save from Vastic just before the break, but that was the United keeper's only save of any real note such was the Reds' dominance.</p>
              <p>Lingard went close to netting his second on 71 minutes but saw his right-foot effort from close range tipped over by Urwin in the Blackburn goal.</p>
              <p>The danger wasn't over for Blackburn though and from the resulting short corner, Lingard crossed into Pogba who laid the ball off brilliantly for Morrison to blast home through a crowd of players inside the box.</p>
              <p>Further chances fell to Tunnicliffe, Cole and Morrison before the latter capped a fine afternoon for United with a rasping drive past Urwin in injury-time.</p>

              <p><strong>United's under-18s contested an entertaining 2-2 draw with their Derby County counterparts, in which the Reds twice came from behind.</strong></p>
              <p>Midfielders Tom Lawrence and Paul Pogba struck for Paul McGuinness' side, with the French midfielder's late leveller particularly eye-catching.</p>
              <p>The Reds' character was tested early on as Derby forged ahead inside the opening minute, but a positive response saw United dominate before levelling when Lawrence clinically slotted home after patient approach play from Jack Barmby.</p>
              <p>As United pressed to overturn the early setback completely, Derby struck once more on the break. That goal did little to alter the flow of the game, with United bossing matters.</p>
              <p>An equaliser seemed inevitable, but few could have foreseen the style with which it would arrive. Pogba, in what is fast becoming his hallmark, danced past a pair of challenges with around 15 minutes remaining, before unleashing a rocket of a finish into the top corner.</p>
              <p>Although United pressed in vain for another dramatic victory, the spirited fightback still provides Paul McGuinness' injury-hit side with plenty of positives.</p>
              <p><em><strong>United: </strong>Johnstone; Maccacci, Giverin, McGinty, Blackett; M Keane (Cole, 70), Lawrence, Pogba, Barmby; Lingard, van Velzen.</em></p>

              <p><strong>Gabriel Obertan struck twice in the second half as the Reds claimed a hard-fought away win at Newcastle United on Monday afternoon.</strong></p>
              <p>The Frenchman made the breakthrough in the 68th minute, controlling substitute Davide Petrucci's ball over the top before advancing to beat Magpies keeper Tim Krul. Obertan then doubled the Reds' lead five minutes from time after again being picked out by Petrucci.</p>
              <p>Newcastle pulled a goal back through Michael Richardson's close-range finish, but the Reds then held firm for the final few moments to end a winless streak of three games.<br><br>The three late goals reflected an improvement on the first half, when the most notable action reduced both sides to ten men. The Reds' Ravel Morrison and Newcastle's James Perch were both sent off on the brink of the interval following an off-the-ball incident. Morrison had come closest to opening the scoring just a few minutes before his red card, when a wind-assisted 30-yarder hit the crossbar.</p>
              <p>Two goalline clearances prevented further goals, one for each team. Reds defender Oliver Gill thwarted Jeff Henderson's effort from a Newcastle corner when the score was 0-0, while Ryan Tunnicliffe's attempt, shortly before Obertan's second goal, was brilliantly blocked by Magpies sub Patrick Nzuzi.<br><br><em>United: Johnstone; R Brown, Wootton, Gill, Dudgeon; Vermijl (Petrucci, 53), Norwood, Tunnicliffe, Obertan; King (Blackett, 64), Morrison.
