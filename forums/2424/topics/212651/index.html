            <div class='col-md body'>Rio Ferdinand wants to win more major trophies at United Â– and the Reds defender thinks the current squad is capable of delivering top silverware this season.<br><br>Ferdinand lifted the Premiership trophy in his first season at the club in 2002/03 but, since then, he has only added a Carling Cup winnersÂ’ medal to his trophy cabinet after being suspended for the FA Cup triumph over Millwall in 2004.<br><br>The 27-year-old says United are Â“definitelyÂ” capable of pushing for top honours this term, and says turning a poor first half against Benfica into a victory has instilled belief in the squad.<br><br>Â“TuesdayÂ’s result went a long way to putting belief into the squad in Europe,Â” he said at the launch of his new book, Rio: My Story. Â“It was a hard game in a hostile atmosphere against good opposition, but we came through it.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s a long time since we won away in the Champions League. But I think itÂ’s the sort of game that will bring us on in the next few games in Europe.Â”<br><br>United are fighting on all fronts to win major honours this season, according to Rio, who wants to cap his fifth season Old Trafford.<br><br>Â“The reason I came to United was to take my football to another level,Â” he said. Â“Winning trophies elevates you a step further. And at this club we donÂ’t set to finish second, third or fourth in the league. We want to come first, not only in the league but in the cup competitions as well. Collectively, thatÂ’s the teamÂ’s aim.<br><br>Â“Looking back on last season, we were a lot of points behind early on in the campaign. WeÂ’ve had a decent start this season, albeit only a few games in. We want to be there or thereabouts come Christmas because thatÂ’s when the nitty-gritty starts.<br><br>Â“WeÂ’ve just got to concentrate on ourselves,Â” he added, deflecting the notion that Chelsea could be there for the taking. Â“If we keep our house in order and weÂ’re consistent then it will take a very good team to finish above us. ThereÂ’s a genuine belief in the squad that that is the case.Â”<br><br><a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=366734" rel="nofollow">http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&amp;newsid=366734</a><br>___________________________________________________<br><br>i will be happy if he don't switch off to sleeping mood when defending <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
