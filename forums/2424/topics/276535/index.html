            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">As Ole Gunnar Solskjaer announces his retirement from playing, ManUtd.com's Steve Bartram gives his take on the Norwegian's sparkling Reds career...</span><br><br><img src="http://picsrv.manutd.com/?fif=/manu/img_10_18490.jpg&amp;obj=iip,1.0&amp;wid=480&amp;hei=179&amp;rgn=0.02404809619238477,0.08171206225680934,0.9619238476953907,0.6964980544747081&amp;cvt=jpeg"><br><br>It's safe to say you're going to see a fair few replays of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's Champions League-winning goal against Bayern Munich over the coming days.<br><br>The Norwegian's instinctive flick of a boot in Barcelona ensured his place in United folklore and instantly became an iconic moment in the Reds' history.<br><br>So, now that Ole has announced his retirement from football, you can expect to relive that magical moment in the Nou Camp again and again. Which is fine. Don't get me wrong, I could watch that match on a perpetual loop and still fill up with pride every time.<br><br>One of my biggest bugbears, however, has always been that the importance of Ole's winner seems to have overshadowed what has been a glittering career.<br><br>A banner simply declaring '20LEGEND' hangs poignantly on the Stretford End second tier as a reminder not just of May 26, 1999, but of the indelible mark Ole has made on Manchester United throughout his career.<br><br>Had Jonathan Greening, for example, left the Nou Camp bench and poked a winner past Oliver Kahn, it's safe to say there wouldn't be a flag flown in his honour.<br><br>The Norwegian's legendary status was pretty much secured regardless of events in Barcelona. A gentleman off the pitch and a predator on it, Ole endeared himself to supporters with his commitment, professionalism and, of course, his goals.<br><br>"Ole is a marvellous finisher," Sir Alex once said of the lethal marksman. "The lad is one of the best finishers I have known. We have had a few good natural finishers at the club but he is exceptional."<br><br>Barcelona aside, there's the four-goal cameo at Nottingham Forest and the injury-time FA Cup winner against Liverpool - all from the Treble season - and many, many more besides if you're looking for examples.<br><br>My own personal favourite moment of Ole's career has nothing to do with his goals, however, more the moment his relationship with United fans was set in stone.<br><br>18 April, 1998. An injury-beleagured United were limping towards the finishing line of another hard-fought title race with Arsenal. By this point, while still mathematically well in the hunt to retain the trophy, the Reds were down to the bare bones and the Gunners had built up an unstoppable momentum.<br><br>Ole was thrown into the action against Newcastle with the score locked at 1-1. United were laying siege to the Magpies' goal, but just couldn't get a vital winner. With a minute remaining, such was United's commitment to attack, that one cleared corner left Magpies midfielder Rob Lee with a free run on goal from inside his own half.<br><br>Having only been on the field 10 minutes, Ole used his freshness to sprint after Lee in a nail-biting race. Should United concede, that would be the season over. The gap continued to narrow until Lee got to the edge of the United area, when Ole flung himself into an awful challenge and was, quite rightly, sent off.<br><br>In ensuring the foul was outside the box, however, he had prevented an almost certain goal and a potential penalty. In recognition, he was handed a standing ovation by the Old Trafford crowd.<br><br>It's not the proudest moment of Ole's career, I'd imagine, and he was carpeted by Sir Alex for his lack of sportsmanship after the game, but it was a deliberate self-sacrifice which laid bare his worth as a player and a man.<br><br></div>
