              <p><strong>Wayne Rooney and Michael Owen have both been included in the squad for Manchester United's friendly against an Irish League XI at the new Aviva Stadium in Dublin on Wednesday night.</strong></p>
              <p>Although Sir Alex Ferguson has opted to rest a number of senior players following the recent tour of North America including Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes and Edwin van der Sar, the presence of Rooney and Owen will generate plenty of interest in the Irish capital.</p>
              <p>It will be Rooney's first appearance since his disappointing World Cup campaign, which was followed this week by pictures of him smoking and chanting songs during the early hours of the morning in Manchester earlier this week.</p>
              <p>For Owen, it marks the start of his comeback following the hamstring injury he suffered during his goalscoring contribution to the Red Devils' Carling Cup final triumph over Aston Villa at Wembley in February.</p>
              <p>With record signing Dimitar Berbatov and new arrival Javier Hernandez also in the squad, it is by no means certain the one-time England international colleagues will be paired together by Sir Alex Ferguson, although it is an important evening for both men.</p>
              <p>After returning late to training following World Cup duty, Michael Carrick, Park Ji-sung and Nemanja Vidic, who is on the brink of signing a lucrative contract extension, make their first appearances of a truncated pre-season that reaches its conclusion in Sunday's Community Shield showdown with Chelsea.</p>
              <p>Patrice Evra was absent as he only returned to training on Tuesday, which at least spared the Frenchman a warm reception following his controversial comments in the wake of France's victory over the Republic of Ireland in the World Cup play-offs last November.</p>
              <p>John O'Shea was set to skipper United on the landmark occasion, although organisers have been criticised for the price of tickets for a match which will be shorn of any representatives from Shamrock Rovers, who take on Juventus in the Europa League on Thursday.</p>

              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1300470" rel="1300470|3| nofollow" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1300470/League-Ireland-XI-1-Manchester-United-7-Michael-Owen-stakes-claim-Wayne-Rooneys-World-Cup-hangover-continues.html"></a></p>
              <h2>FORM GUIDE <br></h2>
              <p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Manchester United </span></a>were in town to open Dublin's new Aviva Stadium and they certainly put on a show by hitting seven goals past the Airtricity League XI.</p>
              <p>The United defence was rarely stretched, while attacking players such as Park Ji-sung, who scored twice, Antonio Valencia and Michael Owen enjoyed plenty of space.</p>
              <p>Mexico's Javier Hernandez has made a good start to his United career, impressing on the tour of America and producing a sharp display here. Fergie must be considering him for when the serious stuff starts.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <h2>STAR PERFORMERS </h2>
              <p>Michael Owen was making his first appearance since suffering a hamstring injury in the Carling Cup final in March which required surgery, but he looked sharp before making way for Dimitar Berbatov at half-time and took his goal well.</p>
              <p>Ferguson has indicated that Owen will not be fit enough to face his old club Newcastle in United's first Premier League fixture of the season but, on this evidence, the former Liverpool and Real Madrid striker is not far away.</p>
              <p>Park Ji-sung also looked fresh despite his exertions at the World Cup with South Korea this summer. It was his perseverence and sense of anticipation that led to United's first goal and one of several penetrating runs set up the second.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/08/04/article-1300470-0AB08D0E000005DC-628_468x410.jpg" alt="Settling in nicely: United new boy Javier Hernandez (left)" width="468" height="410">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Settling in nicely: United new boy Javier Hernandez (left) got on the scoresheet</em></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <h2>NEW FACES </h2>
              <p>Chris Smalling played with Nemanja Vidic in central defence for the first time. The £10m signing from Fulham was rarely troubled.</p>
              <p>Javier 'Chicharito ' Hernandez took just 93 seconds to get on the scoresheet after replacing Wayne Rooney at half-time - evidence that the £7m Mexico striker is a natural predator.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/08/04/article-1300470-0AB08A06000005DC-309_306x423.jpg" alt="Frustration: Wayne Rooney reacts to a challenge" width="306" height="423">

              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <h2>MANAGER'S VERDICT </h2>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson said: 'Our goals were good, some of them very good. Hernandez's goal was fantastic - no drawback at all.</p>
              <p>'We've got good, young strikers in the club and they're exciting me very much alongside the experience of Rooney, Owen and Berbatov.</p>
              <p>'The only injury we've got is Michael Carrick, who has an ankle problem which will put him out of Sunday's game (Community Shield).</p>
              <p>'Rooney has only been training for six days, along with Owen and Park, and they're definitely not ready for real games so 45 minutes was fine for them. I'll have to play them against Chelsea on Sunday because that will help to bring them on.'</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">(4-4-2)</span>: Kuszczak (Amos 65min); Evans, Smalling, Vidic, O’Shea; Valencia, Carrick (Fletcher 37), Gibson, Park (Nani 64); Owen (Berbatov 46), Rooney (Hernandez 46).</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <h2>WORLD CUP HANGOVER <br></h2>
              <p>If Wayne Rooney thought the spotlight was on him after his sorry displays for England in South Africa and a much-publicised night out in Manchester, he must have wished the ground would swallow him up after 22 minutes when the goalkeeper saved Darron Gibson's shot and Rooney blazed over an open goal from 15 yards. </p>

              <p>Owen's goal was the best, under pressure and yet the control and the shot....  Just so cool... Park's 2nd was the second best... lol.</p>
              <p>But this Mexican guy is becoming the surprise buy of the season... No one knew or even heard of him and the way he is playing is like he is worth $18m rather than $7m kind of a player... Go, Go Chicharito ! ! !</p>
