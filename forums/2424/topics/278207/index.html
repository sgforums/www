            <div class='col-md body'>England boss Steve McClaren has confirmed midfielder Owen Hargreaves is a doubt for Saturday's Euro 2008 qualifier against Israel at Wembley.<br><br>Hargreaves missed training on Wednesday with a thigh injury and is struggling along with Steven Gerrard, while Frank Lapmard and David Beckham are out.<br><br>"Thankfully a scan only revealed a small problem," said McClaren.<br><br>"We're still hoping he will be available for Saturday, and he is definitely not ruled out."<br><br>He added: "We'll give Owen as much time as we can before making a decision.<br><br>"He's a determined character and we know that he really wants to play. Naturally, we won't take any unnecessary risks with him though."<br><br>The Manchester United player was recently sidleined for his club with tendonitis and has yet to play two games in a week following his Â£18m summer switch to Old Trafford from Bayern Munich.<br><br>McClaren says the two problems are not related and also revealed Liverpool midfielder Gerrard is being closely monitored as he recovers from a broken toe.<br><br>"We did have some positive news on Steven Gerrard yesterday, when he played a part in training without any problems," he said.<br><br>"We will continue to assess him closely and stay in regular contact with the medical staff at Liverpool, before making any decision as to whether he will play.<br><br>"As I've already said, regardless of who is injured, we are looking forward to Saturday with confidence.<br><br>"I've told the players we have enough ability in the dressing room and it's up to us to go out and the get result. We're good enough to do so."<br><br>Chelsea midfielder Lampard is ruled out with a thigh injury, while Beckham's knee problem has ended any hope of the LA Galaxy star playing any part.<br><br>The absence of Hargreaves, who missed the recent friendly against Germany because of a knee injury, would mean McClaren having to seriously reassess his midfield options.<br><br>England, who are three points behind leaders Croatia in Group E, have not ruled out giving Gerrard an injection to enable him to play against Israel, though Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez is against giving him a jab.<br><br>Despite being a doubt for Saturday's game, Hargreaves has been in confident mood about England's qualification chances.<br><br>"It doesn't matter where we are in the table just now," said the 26-year-old Hargreaves.<br><br>"Croatia, Russia and Israel have done well so far but we are only halfway through the group, so we will see who is there at the end."<br><br>"I don't see any more anxiety around the camp for this game," added the Manchester United midfielder.<br><br>"We know what we have to do. Israel will pull everybody behind the ball. They hardly tried to get forward when they were at home, so I don't imagine it will be any different on Saturday.<br><br>"I am sure they will be happy with a draw but if we can take our chances early on, and score a goal or two, it could be a comfortable game for us."<br><br></div>
