              <p>Obertan lacks confidence? Remember when nani first came, he didnt really dare to run at defenders and lost the ball very often too. Wayward crosses and all that crap....but with that surge of confidence, look what it has done.</p>

              <p>Obertan is a kanjiong spider la, i believe he will do well if he has the confidence. I mean just look at his face says it all. He's afraid to screw things up and by being more afraid, he's actually playing more crappy.</p>
              <p>Bebe is really really useless. I stood by my word a few months ago after watching him make his debut. Both goals he "scored" were deflections and his crosses, can we even term it as crosses in the first place? I think Ahmad Latiff plays better than him siol.</p>
              <p>No idea why he was signed and why other clubs are actually scouting him at that time. And i remember debating the fact that for 7m, the least we can expect from this player is more than good ball control (I doubt he controls the ball well, look at how many throw ins he gave away for pushing the ball out of play) right?</p>

              <p>well speaking about ahmad latiff, this may sound a bit remote but I've just read in the indo papers that baihakki khaizan is now a $300,000 bi-annually defender with this club called Medan Chiefs. And they languish in mid table lol.</p>

              <p>Bro, I dared to stake my money down that at least one weekend warrior team (aka amatuer team) can easily beat the crap out of any S-League Club. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>They kept asking Singaporeans for support? Do they deserved the support in the first place?</p>
              <p>Anyway, I think this report will only make more Singapore footballer's head turn. Highly likely that there will be an influx of players there because of the jackpot.</p>

              <p>There are already about 10 singaporeans playing there. This includes agu, and what's that midfielder who's previously african...forgot his name lol.</p>
              <p>Alam shah is doing well there, scoring goals on a good basis....his pay shd be around the same. This christian gonzalez, the uruguayan who's naturalised as an indonesian...his pay is around USD 200,000 a year.</p>
