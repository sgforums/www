              <p class="excerpt">Sir Alex Ferguson accused referee Andre Marriner of dismissing Paul Scholes purely on reputation during the 3-1 win over Tottenham.</p>
              <p>Manchester United ended Spurs' 100 [er cemt start to the season with goals from Ryan Giggs, Anderson and Wayne Rooney but they had to play the final half an hour with 10 men after Scholes was sent off for two bookings.</p>
              <p>The veteran midfielder was cautioned for clattering Jermain Defoe and a slide on Tom Huddlestone, although Ferguson felt it was an unfair second yellow card.</p>
              <p>He said: "It was terrible sending off, I think the referee got it wrong. I have looked at the video twice and I don't see any sending off.</p>
              <p>"The Tottenham player is the one who has committed the real foul. Scholesy was a foot above him. He's never touched him. He's been sent off because his name is Paul Scholes. That is why he was sent off. It was a ridiculous decision.</p>
              <p>"It could have mattered. You are down to 10 men against Tottenham and only have a one-goal advantage. It's not easy."</p>
              <p>Defoe had given Spurs the lead with less than a minute on the clock with a spectacular scissor-kick, then Giggs levelled with a free-kick.</p>
              <p>Giggs told ESPN: "It was always going to be a tough game, especially after the internationals, you don't know how players are going to react - but we played really well today.</p>
              <p>"They started really sharply, closing us down and obviously the goal.</p>
              <p>"But after that we recovered and after I scored I think we controlled the game really well."</p>
              <p>Anderson's goal was his first for United, then Rooney wrapped up the scoring.</p>
              <p>"With 10 men it is always tough, they have a lot of the ball and you have to defend really well," Giggs added.</p>
              <p>"They have a lot of attacking options so when you are down to 10 men you just try to get behind the ball and get a breakaway goal, and that's what we got."</p>
              <p>Ferguson felt it was one of United's strongest performances of the season.</p>
              <p>"It was probably the best we have seen of us this season, given the fact that we were a goal down after one minute," he said.</p>
              <p>"We had to gather our game and show composure."</p>
              <p>Spurs had won their previous four league games but their run comes to an end.</p>
              <p>Boss Harry Redknapp said: "I have never got carried away. It's still a great start, 12 points from five games. It wasn't an easy start for us in terms of games this season, with Liverpool and Man United at home, but I fancied us to get something.</p>
              <p>"We had a fantastic start and we were seeing three points again. But we knew they would come back - that's why they win titles and European titles. They have outstanding players - (Darren) Fletcher was fantastic, I thought."</p>
              <p>Redknapp, however, believes Manchester City could be surprise challengers this season.</p>
              <p>"City will threaten everyone," he said.</p>
              <p>"They have to with the players they have brought in. It will be interesting game between City and United next week, they look like they can beat anyone.</p>
              <p>"I tried to sign three or four of them but I couldn't get near them.</p>
              <p>"Lescott, Toure, Adebayor, Barry are top players. It will be an interesting title race. They could do anything, anything's possible. They have a strong enough squad."</p>
