              <p><strong>Key men Cristiano Ronaldo and Carlos Tevez have left the Premier League champions since the end of the season. </strong></p>
              <p>Already, it has been suggested that Rooney must step up and
              fulfil his potential this season if United are to maintain their lofty
              standards of recent campaigns.</p>
              <p>And the England striker feels more than ready to meet that obligation.</p>
              <p>"We've lost two key players and obviously I hope we can get a few players in," Rooney told The Times.</p>
              <p>"Between them Cristiano and Carlos scored a lot of goals for us
              last season and the season before, but I would like to think I'm
              capable of filling that gap.</p>
              <p>"I've said before that, if I can play in my right position, I'm capable of doing that."</p>
              <p>Rooney has often been asked to operate out wide by manager Sir Alex Ferguson since joining from Everton.</p>
              <p>The Liverpudlian is adamant that has prevented him from showing
              his best form on a consistent basis, and believes the time is right to
              make a permanent switch to the centre.</p>
              <p>"I want to play in the position where I feel I'm best," he said.</p>
              <p>"A lot of people think I'm best as a centre forward.</p>
              <p>"To play in a Champions League final and to play week in, week
              out for Manchester United is a privilege and it's something I'm very
              lucky to be doing, but I don't think playing on the wing I can express
              myself as much as I like to."</p>

              ya play him as a striker next season onwards and every season onwards.
              
              he has sacrifised alot for Man Utd cause for the past few seasons, its high time he revert back to being a striker.
              
              I hope he will fulfil his potential, only showing glimpses so far. I know he can do it, no doubt. 27m paid to everton in 2004 is considered as peanuts now :)

              <p><br>if Benzema comes, then berbatov can be on the bench or sell him off to recoup back some of the 30m paid. I am more worried that Rooney will again be sacrifised as left or right winger. Should play kiko as supersub.</p>

              <p>I am a Liverpool fan but would like to offer some opinions on this.</p>
              <p>I think Fergie should build a team around Rooney. Rooney has loads of talent and firepower, is young and most of all, he stays loyal to the team. I can foresee him staying with Man U for a long long time.</p>
              <p>Rooney can do the job that Torres does for Liverpool or what Henry does for Arsenal. All these players are FAST, STRONG and has a good footballing brain. I think if Rooney plays that central role, his explosive plays will but alot of defences on the back foot.</p>
              <p>Thus, I think Fergie should really buy players to compliment him rather than to use him in positions that he can play well because of his talents but  he should play in the central role where he can really excel. Berba can be the backup striker but he should be the new KING of Old Trafford from this season onwards.</p>

              <p>yes. Rooney can be the new king after Ronaldo left.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think fergie accommodated Ronaldo as king so that he can change his mind playing for RM, but alas it was not to be.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>although Rooney does not have the silky and tricky skills of Ronaldo, who does anyway, but he is still a skillful and explosive striker, a world class talent.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I feel that Rooney is like a Steven Gerrad. A very complete player. He is excellent in attack. He is passionate. Brings the team into the game. Chases ball. Tackles back. And defends right from the front. A very balanced and complete player. He is still young and can only develop into one of the very best.</p></div>

              <p>Hmm, i sort of differ, play Rooney as central but more like Zizou..</p>
              <p>for me, Rooney's strike-rate isn't fanastic, but his contributions are.</p>
              <p>From left, right, he is able to bring something to the table, and even in England team, when he plays, there is a certain added dimension.</p>
              <p>I still feel, he needs a out and out striker like a RVN to prosper.</p>
              <p>Yes he is young and explosive, but his legs have more injury than Ronaldo in the last few seasons, and that's a worry.</p>
              <p>And given WC coming, Rooney normally tried harder and I fear he may not get enough rest..</p>

              <p>berba will have to warm bench or shipped out should SAF prefers a 4-3-3 with an out and out striker(which berba isn't) and 2 wide players... Probably he will find a place in a classic 4-4-2 as a support striker with benz as the main striker and rooney playing on the flanks...</p>
