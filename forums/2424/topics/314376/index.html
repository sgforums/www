              <p><strong>Owen Hargreaves had no doubt he was the man to take the free-kick which gave United a decisive 2-1 victory against Arsenal.</strong></p>
              <p>The midfielder had earlier been denied the chance to take a free-kick by Cristiano Ronaldo, but revealed he didn’t even listen to the Reds’ top scorer before stepping up to curl home the winner in the 72nd minute.</p>
              <p>The 27-year-old said: “We had an earlier free-kick and I said ‘I’ll take that’, but Ronny said ‘it’s too far for you’.</p>
              <p>“The second one was a bit closer and it was a good distance for me so I didn’t ask him!</p>
              <p>“I score goals on counter-attacks, from long distance or free-kicks and if I can get a chance to contribute, I’m very happy with that.”</p>
              <p>Hargreaves admitted United were stretched too often by the Gunners in the first half, but was pleased with the way the Reds responded after the break.</p>
              <p>“I thought it was an open game – too open in the first half,” he said. “The distances were too big and there was a lot of running to be done.</p>
              <p>“We needed to tighten up a bit in the second half because Arsenal were the better team and made it difficult for us.”</p>
              <p>Rio Ferdinand had another excellent game in the heart of the defence and was delighted by United’s fighting spirit.</p>
              <p>Emmanuel Adebayor converted from close range early in the second half to put Arsenal ahead, but the Reds roared back through Ronaldo’s re-taken penalty and Hargreaves’ strike.</p>
              <p>With four games to go, United are now six points ahead of Chelsea, who play Wigan on Monday, and nine ahead of Arsenal, who are all but out of the title race.</p>
              <p>Ferdinand said: “It’s a massive game for us. We don’t go a goal down at home very often, but we showed true grit, determination and a great team ethic to claw our way back into the game.</p>
              <p>“The three points, no matter who you play against, are important. But there are more games to be played – the title’s not handed out now. We need to win our remaining games and if we do that, we’ll be champions.”</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>i seriously thk that his free kick striking rate will be better than ronaldo if he is given equal opportunities at fk. i hav seen him take like 5 fks... 2 scored, 2 great saves and 1 over the bar... thats all i can recall. a majority of ronaldo's fks hit the wall. ronaldo could be given a free role and hargreaves our new right winger with carrick and anderson playing in the centre.</p></div>

              <p>yes wat u said is true... it's jus that i thk that owen can excel at long range too. pretty sure that in term of striking on target from long range... owen has the edge with his style. no doubt ronaldo has the power.. but his free kicks struggle to get past the wall. owen's curl of the ball allows it to evade the wall even from short range... which i thk is fantastic. anyway... hope that thay can push each other to improve on their fks, esp ronaldo.</p>

              <p>i think a couple of long range bombs/goals will give him even more confidence.</p>
              <p>recalled him trying a few long range shots but now, like none..</p>
