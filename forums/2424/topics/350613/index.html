              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson claims
              referee Steve Bennett has done Manchester United a favour by clearing
              Newcastle defender Steven Taylor. </strong></p>
              <p>The United boss reacted angrily on Wednesday night after Taylor
              escaped punishment for catching Ronaldo with a flailing arm when the
              two sides met at St James’ Park.</p>
              <p>The defender has since avoided a possible ban after Bennett, who
              missed the original challenge, reviewed the incident and deemed it only
              worthy of a booking.</p>
              <p>And with Newcastle facing both Chelsea and Arsenal in the coming
              weeks, Ferguson admitted he was relieved Taylor has not been ruled out
              of either game.</p>
              <p>"The disciplinary situation does confuse you at times," he said.</p>
              <p>"No-one is really clear about it. But in actual fact we did not want
              the boy suspended because now he can play against Chelsea and Arsenal.</p>
              <p>"In Newcastle's position, with the injuries they have at the moment,
              it would have been devastating for them to lose that player. I am not
              really upset about it at all."</p>
              <p>The Taylor incident was the second talking point involving Ronaldo
              this week after the United winger was harshly booked for diving in the
              Carling Cup final.</p>
              <p>Arsene Wenger, who has had his fair share of run-ins with the United
              boss, waded into the debate claiming it was the player’s arrogance that
              made him a target for the Premier League’s hatchet men.</p>
              <p>Ferguson, however, refused to be drawn into a slanging match with
              the Gunners manager, preferring instead to put a positive spin on his
              remarks.</p>
              <p>"What Arsene said was it appears like arrogance," said Ferguson.</p>
              <p>"There is a difference and I can understand what he is saying.</p>
              <p>"When a player expresses himself in such an entertaining way, defenders don't enjoy it.</p>
              <p>"It was exactly the same when George Best was a player.</p>
              <p>"It is not so much that they are prepared to do what they do, it is that they are encouraged to do it.</p>
              <p>"That is the great asset Ronaldo holds. He has this wonderful
              courage. He just wants to entertain and do something good with the
              ball."</p>
