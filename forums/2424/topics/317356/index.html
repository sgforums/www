              <h1>Hammers board meet to iron out striker Ashton's Upton Park future</h1>
              <p><strong>Dean Ashton hopes to stay at West Ham but has revealed he is growing concerned over his future due to the lack of dialogue from the club. Manchester United are rumoured to be ready to test the Hammers' resolve to keep Ashton by tabling an £8million bid for the England prospect this summer.</strong></p>
              <p>Portsmouth and Newcastle are also reported to be interested in the 24-year-old, who returned this season after a year out spent recovering from a broken ankle. Hammers boss Alan Curbishley is meeting with the board today to review the season and discuss plans for the transfer window.</p>
              <p>Curbishley is determined to keep Ashton and after yesterday's 2-2 draw with Aston Villa denied that he is under pressure to slash the wage bill. But a big offer could tempt the board to sell and Ashton is seeking reassurances over his future with two years left on his contract.</p>
              <p>"As far as I know I'll be at West Ham. The only worry is that the club haven't spoken to me yet so I don't know where I stand," he said. "Obviously I'd like to speak to the club about my future. I'd just like to know where my future lies. "Obviously I had to prove myself after spending so long out injured and I feel I've done that now. West Ham is the team I play for. I want to talk to the club because I've really enjoyed myself here and that's all I'm really thinking about."</p>
              <p>Ashton was complimented by Sir Alex Ferguson after scoring in the 4-1 rout at Old Trafford on May 3, but has taken little notice of his words. "A lot has been written about me but the thing I'm most worried about is what West Ham think of me," he said. "I suppose it (Ferguson's praise) is flattering but you don't really read a lot into what goes into the papers."</p>
              <p>It is understood that West Ham chief executive Scott Duxbury has had preliminary discussions with Ashton's representatives about an improved deal but nothing could be decided until the player himself had proved his fitness. Owner and chairman Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson was expected, at today's meeting, to confirm that Curbishley must trim his squad and reduce the wage bill.</p>

              <p>well, after watching football focus, they did touched on this point.</p>
              <p>due to saha's injuries, MUFC then played their fluid, fast paced way.</p>
              <p>but we saw when opposing teams packed their defence, mufc can't find a way in.</p>
              <p>and hence, we need an out and strong striker to come in and pry things open.</p>
              <p>the key is to have allow SAF to have more options.</p>
              <p>but I still have reservations about this fella. seems injury prone.</p>

              <p>The thing was when he started to develop and people started to take notice of him, he got a serious injury... It was very unfortunate cos he was about to get into the England team then... But now back after a year plus out cos of injuries and fitness problems, he seems to be showing that form again... If they get him now, he could cost less than $10m but I think in a year or 2 time, he could cost more than double if he takes off next season...</p>
              <p>I hardly see a lone striker give Rio and co so much problems... But he did...</p>
              <p>I feel that he is the most potential England striker around... and if play among better players, he could do better... and if Blatter's plan of 6+5 come true, his will come in handy...</p>
              <p>United can accommodate 4 strikers, they only have 2 right now so why not add him when he is still cheap and can bring another form of striking style which they currently lack to their frontline...</p>
