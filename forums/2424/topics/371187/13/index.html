Certainly had his work cut out, and when the ball broke for him at the other end from a corner, he couldn't quite get past the man on the line.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.goal.com/en/people/portugal/2195/ricardo-carvalho"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Ricardo Carvalho</span></span></a> - <strong>8</strong> - Was a solid, if not occasionally cynical figure, at the back and was in the right place at the right time with a cool head - in every sense of the word - to draw Chelsea level just when they needed it.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.goal.com/en/people/england/1639/john-terry"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">John Terry</span></span></a> - <strong>7</strong> - Made a series of strong last-ditch challenges and looked a man fully focused on the season ahead, with the weeks of Manchester City transfer speculation firmly behind him.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.goal.com/en/people/england/1142/ashley-cole"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Ashley Cole</span></span></a> - <strong>6</strong> - Wasn't always at his best with the ball at his feet going forward, but manned his flank well enough to avoid United getting too much joy.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.goal.com/en/people/nigeria/12697/jon-obi-mikel"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Jon Obi Mikel</span></span></a> - <strong>5</strong> - Overrun from early on, struggled to contain United's fast-moving forward runners. As time went on, he got better adjusted to getting his foot on the ball and easing the pressure on Chelsea, but he's not quite looking like Makelele just yet.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.goal.com/en/people/ghana/782/michael-essien"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Michael Essien</span></span></a> - <strong>7</strong> - Energetic as ever and looked to be first to every ball. As the game progressed, he certainly played a vital part in closing down United's passing game and ensuring Chelsea were the stronger side in the second half.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.goal.com/en/people/france/788/florent-malouda"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Florent Malouda</span></span></a> - <strong>6</strong> - Had a big miss on the volley and was otherwise tidy, without being particularly impressive in possession. Never really able to penetrate the United defense either on a run or with a cross.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.goal.com/en/people/england/1642/frank-lampard"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Frank Lampard</span></span></a> - <strong>7</strong> - Shadowed by Fletcher in the early stages but grew into the game in the second period, kept his head to score the goal that put Chelsea in front and also scored in the penalty shootout, albeit not with one of his best efforts.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.goal.com/en/people/france/1936/nicola-anelka"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Nicolas Anelka</span></span></a> - <span style="font-weight: bold;">7</span> - Showed good movement and energy, not to mention a willingness to shoot and shoot well. Perhaps deserved more for his efforts.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.goal.com/en/people/c%C3%B4te-divoire/497/didier-drogba"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Didier Drogba</span></span></a> - <strong>6</strong> - Was his usual physical presence up front and showed glimpses of his powerful shooting ability and clattered into Ben Foster which led to Chelsea's first. Good penalty as well - and the cliched question is: would he have done the same in Moscow?<br><br>Substitutes<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.goal.com/en/people/portugal/5338/bosingwa"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Jose Bosingwa</span></span></a> - 7 - Showed in the second half why he is a better right-back than Ivanovic. His pace and more natural positional sense made him a lot more difficult to beat.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.goal.com/en/people/germany/2140/michael-ballack"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Michael Ballack</span></span></a> - 6 - Didn't do a whole lot after coming on, other than cause controversy. First for going to ground a little too easily and winning a foul, then for bodychecking Patrice Evra and not being disciplined for his trouble, as Chelsea went down the other end and scored. Put away his penalty, of course.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.goal.com/en/people/portugal/2201/deco"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Deco</span></span></a> - n/a.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.goal.com/en/people/c%C3%B4te-divoire/12696/salomon-kalou"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Salomon Kalou</span></span></a> - 7 - Didn't do a lot in open play, but scored the winning penalty in sensational style.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.goal.com/en/teams/england/97/man-utd-news"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">MANCHESTER UNITED</span></span></a><br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.goal.com/en/people/england/13424/benjamin-foster"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Ben Foster</span></span></a> - <strong>5</strong> - Shaky all round. Perhaps could have claimed under threat from Drogba and almost certainly should have done better to prevent Lampard putting Chelsea in the lead.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.goal.com/en/people/ireland/1943/john-oshea"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">John O'Shea</span></span></a> - <strong>7</strong> - Showed good touch early on and confidence up and down his flank.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.goal.com/en/people/norhern-ireland/16933/jonathan-evans"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Jonny Evans</span></span></a> - <strong>7</strong> - Looks like carrying on his impressive form from last season into this one. Very solid and dealt with the threat of Drogba quite well.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.goal.com/en/people/england/1941/rio-ferdinand"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Rio Ferdinand</span></span></a> - <strong>7</strong> - A bit off the pace, but didn't let it show too often in what was generally a comfortable performance.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.goal.com/en/people/france/838/patrice-evra"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Patrice Evra</span></span></a> - <strong>7</strong> - The center of attention. He was outstanding for the majority of the game, and was controversially fouled after which he was down and out and Chelsea went on to score. Played an eventual part in United losing the encounter with his penalty in the shootout, which made Gareth Southgate's look like vintage Zidane.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.goal.com/en/people/korea-republic-of/4239/ji-sung-park"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Ji-sung Park</span></span></a> - <strong>5</strong> - Quite simply lacked finesse when it mattered. He missed a chance under difficult circumstances early on, but from then on, as United played their deft touches going forward, far too many of his were misplaced.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.goal.com/en/people/england/6910/michael-carrick"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Michael Carrick</span></span></a> - <strong>6</strong> - Not bad, but not good enough. There will be a vast amount of onus placed on Carrick's shoulder's to be United's heartbeat from center midfield all season, and while he enjoyed a fruitful and fairly carefree opening 25 minutes, when Chelsea began to squeeze, he struggled to make an impact.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.goal.com/en/people/scotland/1953/darren-fletcher"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Darren Fletcher</span></span></a> - <strong>7</strong> - Tracked Lampard well early on and had a good shot of his own when at his most confident. A solid outing.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.goal.com/en/people/portugal/10351/nani"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Nani</span></span></a> - <strong>7</strong> - Certainly did his best Cristiano Ronaldo impression on the afternoon, full of running, skill, goal-threat and, for good measure, a sweetly struck opening goal from outside the area. He did, though, let Carvalho go to head home the equalizer.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.goal.com/en/people/bulgaria/2320/dimitar-berbatov"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Dimitar Berbatov</span></span></a> - <strong>7</strong> - Showed great touch and more work rate than he is often credited with, but never quite hit top gear or got into the box to really make his classy touches count in front of goal.<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.goal.com/en/people/england/1681/wayne-rooney"><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Wayne Rooney</span></span></a> - <span style="font-weight: bold;">8</span> - Already looks a little more like the Rooney of which every England fan has been dreaming. A relentless forward free role, always classy in possession and perhaps his only flaw was a lack of a consistent goal threat. Just to prove a point, then, he showed quite incredible composure to latch onto a Giggs throughball and stick a left-footed effort past Petr Cech at the death to take the game to penalties.<br><br>Substitutes<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.goal.com/en/people/ecuador/8295/luis-antonio-valencia"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Luis Antonio Valencia</span></span></a> - 6 - The new signing looked short of pace and ideas. Certainly had the work rate to put in a solid shift down the right flank, but not a lot more beyond that.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.goal.com/en/people/wales/1947/ryan-giggs"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Ryan Giggs</span></span></a> - 7 - Played a delightful through ball for Rooney, from which he equalized, but disappointed with an abysmal penalty at the beginning of the shootout.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.goal.com/en/people/england/1909/michael-owen"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Michael Owen</span></span></a> - 6 - Certainly eager - maybe a little too eager - to prove himself in his first competitive game for United. A couple of inches away from potentially heading home from a Giggs set-piece, though.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.goal.com/en/people/england/1950/paul-scholes"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Paul Scholes</span></span></a> - 6 - Some good distribution, as always, in his brief cameo.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.goal.com/en/people/brazil/24274/fabio-da-silva"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Fabio da Silva</span></span></a> - 7 - Looked full of running and smart in possession, though not overly involved during his short appearance.</p>

              <p>It kinda worked in the 2nd half mah when Bosingwa came on.</p>
              <p>But I dont think he's got the right personnel yet for this formation la. Essien playing on the right wing at the start just didn't look right. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="icon_confused.gif"> and Lampard played on the left towards the end of the match too.</p>
              <p>Everyone knows Lampard's best position is through the middle...Maybe once their wingers Zhirkov and Cole return then can see the real diamond formation.</p>

              <p>well, play to whistle la. No-one can assume just because ref blowed the whistle earlier for someone seemingly "injured", will blow the whistle again when MU player was fouled right? Given that FA is clamping down on ref's protection, hopefully, MU doesn't get into trouble, trying to give the ref a "warm" discussion.</p>
              <p>Anyway, my comments -&gt; even in a charity match, I am amazed by the blues' relentless pursit of much-starved success.</p>
              <p>was reading some of the UK fans' comment. rather interesting.</p>
              <p>some are still asking for berbacock's blood given his seemingly non-existence.but for me, I think a few times, he was able to burst clear and almost had a goal. Was quite surprised @ his sudden "acceleration", Bolt-inspired?</p>
              <p>Valencia is rather disappointing, given his limited time, he seems to push the ball forward and tried to use his pace, but against Cole who also got pace to burn, he was quickly shutdown.. A big worry.</p>
              <p>but the biggest worry is still deserved for foster. Despite the one-handed save against drogba, he seems really nervous. His kicks and placement are a worry.</p>
              <p>Chelsea did a change to their RB, and that changed the momentum for the 2nd half.</p>
              <p>Sadly, Rooney seems to come alive only after the "injustice", the equaliser seems marginally, and was quite good fortune.</p>
              <p>I do like Fabio for his energy is good. And he seems to have better anticipation than brother leh.</p>
              <p>Overall, despite what Chelsea was doing, not too amazed by their "diamond", maybe it takes time for it to sparkle, but nothing to shout about. Similiarly, MUFC seems to start well but finish poorly. Anyway, just a good appetiser for all of us.</p>

              <p>well, often whenever such incidents occur, you will get people defending the ref as to whether he actually see the incident and whether there was any doubt as to what happened. Like a penalty claim.</p>
              <p>nevertheless, this incident may speaks volume of the ref's consistency. but given they are often "protected" and simply "untouchables". Do hope the FA will do a simple "pull up your socks"..</p>
