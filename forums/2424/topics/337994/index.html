              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Sir Alex Ferguson admits he
              recall Fraizer Campbell from his loan spell at Tottenham in January -
              but will not let Danny Welbeck leave on loan.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>The Manchester United boss
              reluctantly allowed Campbell to join the White Hart Lane outfit on
              transfer deadline day as part of the deal that saw Dimitar Berbatov
              move north for a club record Â£30.75million fee.</p>
              <p>Although Campbell struggled to impress former boss Juande
              Ramos, he has been given his chance by Harry Redknapp and scored three
              times in two games as Spurs' revival gathered pace.</p>
              <p>The 21-year-old also scored for England Under-21s in their
              victory over the Czech Republic at Bramall Lane on Tuesday, confirming
              he is a man in form.</p>
              <p>Redknapp has spoken of his desire to sign Campbell on a
              permanent basis. However, Ferguson has revealed a clause in the
              youngster's loan agreement that would allow him to go back to United in
              January.</p>
              <p>And, if Campbell keeps going at his present rate, Ferguson would not be scared to use it.</p>
              <p>"We could pull him back in January," said Ferguson. "We have to
              the option and it is a possibility. The boy has been fantastic at
              Spurs.</p>
              <p>"He is a good player but we needed to get him first-team experience, so we agreed to it so the deal with Berbatov went through."</p>
              <p>However, while Campbell's short-term future remains undecided, Welbeck's is very much at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>The Longsight-born star does not celebrate his 18th birthday
              until next week but he has already made a big impression on Ferguson.</p>
              <p>Welbeck scored on his Premier League debut against Stoke last
              Saturday and, with Berbatov sidelined for at least a couple of games
              after picking up a hamstring injury in Bulgaria's encounter with Serbia
              on Wednesday, will retain his place in Ferguson's squad for Saturday's
              visit to Aston Villa and the Champions League trip to Villarreal.</p>
              <p>His improvement has been so rapid, some pundits have suggested
              Welbeck will be the next United player to further their education
              elsewhere for a short time.</p>
              <p>But Ferguson feels Welbeck is too young to lose day-to-day
              control of his development and by mixing infrequent appearances in the
              first team with events like next Thursday's Youth Cup tie with Chelsea
              at Old Trafford, he can get enough football by staying where he is.</p>
              <p>"It would be crazy to let Danny go out on loan," said Ferguson.
              "He is too young. He is still that gangly lad who has not fully
              matured.</p>
              <p>"We can work on his physique knowing we are not playing him all the time.</p>
              <p>"He trains with the first-team squad all the time now but he can
              also go and enjoy himself playing for the youth team or the reserves."</p>
              <p>The attention on Welbeck has only increased because Ghana have made a bid for his services.</p>
              <p>Capped by England at Under-19 level, Welbeck could continue
              along the Three Lions path or choose to represent the country of his
              parents.</p>
              <p>Ferguson has offered some sound advice - ignore both and play for Scotland instead.</p>
              <p>"His parents are from Ghana so it is not a surprise," he added.
              "It is the boy's choice, although I would be surprised if he didn't
              play for Scotland. That is my big challenge now."</p>
              <p>Meanwhile at the other end of the age scale, Paul Scholes' has been pencilled in for a December 10 comeback against Aalborg.</p>
              <p>The former England star has been out since suffering knee ligament damage against the Danish outfit in mid-September.</p>
              <p>Scholes' recent recovery has been so rapid there had been suggestions he could feature against Manchester City next weekend.</p>
              <p>That will not happen. But Ferguson says the 34-year-old could be
              in action immediately before the visit to Tottenham on December 13,
              which precedes the Club World Cup in Japan.</p>
              <p>"Paul is coming on fine," said Ferguson. "He will be ready for the week of the Tottenham game.</p>
              <p>"He has started to involve himself in some of the first-team
              training sessions because, as always with that type of injury, he has
              made good progress.</p>
              <p>"It will be a few weeks yet but he is not far away now."</p>
