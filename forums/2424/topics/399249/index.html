              <p><strong>Fergie Interested in signing Borriello<img src="http://view.picapp.com//Images/clear.gif" alt="" width="1" height="1"></strong></p>
              <p>Manchester United are reportedly considering a shock move for AC Milan forward Marco Borriello. Sir Alex Ferguson is a big admirer of in form Italian international and is looking for an effective partner for Wayne Rooney and has earmarked the big powerful San Siro man as a potential target.</p>
              <p>The £18m rated Naples born striker has been a member of the Rossoneri since 2002 but has spent loan spells at a number of Serie A sides during that spell but a successful stint at Genoa, where he netted 19 goals, led to his return to the AC Milan fold and he hasn’t looked back since.</p>
              <p>This season Leonardo has put a lot of faith in the 27 year old and he has netted 14 goals this term, making him the club’s top marksman. His form this term has led to his inclusion in Marcello Lippi’s 30 man provisional World Cup squad.</p>
              <p>Ferguson may well feel that Borriello’s physical attributes would lend themselves to a role in the Premier League and could well make him a perfect foil for England goal machine Rooney.</p>

              <p><strong>Fergie interested in signing David Villa</strong></p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson is ready to offer up to £45m to seal the signing of Valencia striker David Villa. The Manchester United boss has earmarked the Spanish international as his must have target this summer as he looks to improve his striking line up.</p>
              <p>With Dimitar Berbatov reportedly set for a potential exit and with Michael Owen once again sidelined with injury problems the Old Trafford side is looking for another goal scoring option to help carry the burden with Wayne Rooney.</p>
              <p>David Villa has had another consistent season at the Mestalla, netting 28 goals in all competitions. Valencia are still in staggering financial debt and may well have no choice but to sell the 28 year old this summer. The La Liga side may find it hard to turn down an offer of £45m and Villa himself would probably jump at the chance of a move to the Premier League.</p>
              <p>The Glazers have stated that funds will be available for Ferguson to invest in his squad but given the debt the owners have saddled the club in such funds may have to come from sales of some of the club’s squad players such as Ben Foster and indeed the faltering striker Berbatov.</p>

              <p><strong>United step up hunt for Benfica winger</strong><br>Manchester United have made further enquiries about Benfica winger Angel di Maria. Benfica value the Argentina star at £38m and at that price Real Madrid remain favourites to sign him. United are also among clubs monitoring Ajax's Uruguay striker Luis Suarez.<br><em>Sports desk, Daily Mail<br><br></em>In other transfer speculation, <em>The  Mirror </em>claim United are keeping tabs on Marseille winger Hatem Ben Arfa. <br><br>There's not a great deal of United news in the papers today. Instead, the sports pages are dominated by the state of England's 2018 World Cup bid. The media claim it now hangs in the balance after FA chief <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup-2010/teams/england/7731606/Lord-Triesman-endures-day-of-despair-as-he-is-forced-to-quit-as-FA-chairman.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Lord Triesman levelled bribery allegations</span></span></a> at Spain and Russia. He stood down from his post on Sunday.<br><br>The weekend papers also linked United with moves for Everton midfielder Jack Rodwell (<em>Times</em>), and a £20m bid for Ajax forward Luis Suarez (<em>News of the World</em>).</p>

              <p>Fergie will make a move for Wesley Sneijder as soon as Mourinho heads off to Madrid. A bid of £22m will be enough to secure the services of Snieijder who has no interest in staying in Italy when Jose leaves. Expect Mourinho to go all-out to sign no other than Frank Lampard when he takes over at Real Madrid. Lampard came closeto signing for Inter not so long ago and wont turn down the chance to work under Mourinho again this time. Chelsea to join in the hunt for James Milner as Lampard's replacement.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile Manchester United and Real Madrid have been told David Silva is not for sale. Manchester United are also targeting a £20million swoop for Real Madrid star Rafael van der Vaart.</p>
