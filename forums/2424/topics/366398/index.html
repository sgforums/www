              <p>Olympique Lyonnais have confirmed they have received a substantial offer for star striker <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=46858"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Karim Benzema</span></a> but insist there is no agreement with Real Madrid or any other club.</p>
              <p>French and Spanish media reported on Wednesday that a €35m deal had been agreed with Primera Liga giants Madrid but Lyon's director of communications insists that is not the case.</p>
              <p>"We certainly did receive an offer of a sum appreciably superior to the sum that has been mentioned, but nothing says that it comes from Real,'' Olivier Blanc told <em>L'Equipe</em>. "There is no agreement with anyone.''</p>
              <p>Earlier on Wednesday, French radio station <em>RMC</em> quoted Benzema's agent as saying only personal terms needed to be settled before a deal with Real was complete.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Spanish newspapers <em>Marca</em> and <em>AS</em> both claimed the highly-rated 21-year-old would shortly join £80m <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=22774"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cristiano Ronaldo</span></a> and £56m <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=21364&amp;cc=4716"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Kaka</span></a> in Madrid as president Florentino Perez continues to build a new team of <em>galacticos</em>.</p>
              <p>Benzema, who is due to return to training with Lyon on Thursday, has been linked with a number of Europe's top clubs, including Barcelona, Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United.</p>
              <p>On Tuesday Bosnian newspaper <em>Sportsport</em> quoted Lyon forward Miralem Pjanic as saying Benzema was close to completing a £38m move to Premier League champions United, but Pjanic has since denied making those comments.</p>
              <p>"I have not granted any interview to the media," the Bosnian international said. "I do not know any other answer to say to you because I said nothing."</p>

              <p>Pjanic: I never said Benzema would sign for United </p>
              <p>Olympique Lyonnais forward Miralem Pjanic has denied saying that hot shot team-mate <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=46858"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Karim Benzema</span></a> was close to completing a £38m move to Premier League champions Manchester United.</p>
              <p>A Bosnian newspaper quoted the 19-year old as saying United were leading the race to sign his hot shot colleague but Pjanic insists he never spoke to <em>Sportsport</em>.</p>
              <p>"I have not granted any interview to the media," the Bosnian international said. "I do not know any other answer to say to you because I said nothing."</p>
              <p>Benzema has been linked with a number of Europe's top clubs, including Real Madrid, Barcelona, Arsenal and Chelsea, and the 21-year-old is widley expected to leave Lyon in the transfer window.</p>
              <p>On Tuesday <em>Sportsport</em> reported that Pjanic said: "Benzema is nearly gone to Old Trafford. The English club are willing to pay €45m (£38m) for him and it is just a question of the day when he will move to England."</p>
              <p>Benzema, who has netted 43 goals in 112 league outings for Lyon, is a full France international and has already experienced Champions League football with the deposed Ligue 1 champions.</p>
              <p>Manchester United manager <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=30"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></a> is believed to have been handed £100m to spend in the transfer window, following the £80m sale of <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=22774"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cristiano Ronaldo</span></a> to Real Madrid and the departure of striker <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=72490"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Carlos Tevez</span></a>.</p>
              <p>The Reds completed a £16m deal to sign Wigan Athletic winger <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=65629"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Antonio Valencia</span></a> on Tuesday and are now out to sign a forward, having also decided not to take up an option on Carlos Tevez.</p>
              <p>Lyon coach <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=97"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Claude Puel</span></a> has admitted <em>Les Gones</em> would let Benzema join another club if the striker wished to do so and the bid was high enough.</p>
              <p>"We know his importance at Olympique Lyonnais and his efficiency in our squad," Puel said on Tuesday. "He's an exceptional player, but we also know the financial figures of the club.</p>
              <p>"We will evaluate the situation with him when he comes back - July 2 - what he wants to do, we'll listen to him.</p>
              <p>"If he has any dreams of leaving we will discuss them with him if there are any concrete offers, which is not the case at the moment."</p>

              <p>Lyon have accepted an offer from Real Madrid for striker Karim Benzema.</p>
              <p>Madrid and Manchester United have been vying for the services of the 21-year-old but Lyon continued to insist before today that the France international would remain at the Stade Gerland for another season at least.</p>
              <p>However, Les Gones announced on their official website this afternoon that they have accepted a fee of at least 35m euros (£30m) from Madrid for the player, with performance clauses set to see that fee rise to 41m euros.</p>
              <p>The statement on Lyon's website read: ''Lyon announce they have reached an agreement with Real Madrid on the details of the transfer of their international attacker Karim Benzema.</p>
              <p>''A few days ago Karim Benzema informed the club president Jean Michel Aulas of his desire to move to the Madrid club, which had always been his favourite club after Lyon, earlier than he had foreseen.</p>
              <p>''The player wanted to seize the opportunity which Real Madrid offered him to be one of the major elements in their new ambitious project based around the greatest players of the world.</p>
              <p>''Lyon accepted Karim Benzema's decision and negotiated the conditions of a transfer which satisfies all the different parties. The club wishes Karim the greatest success with Real Madrid.''</p>
              <p>Benzema will become Florentino Perez's fourth signing since returning to the Madrid presidency a month ago, following the arrivals of Kaka, Cristiano Ronaldo and Raul Albiol. The deal will take Madrid's summer spending to over 200m euros.</p>
              <p>The France forward came through the ranks with the French giants and burst onto the scene in the 2007-08 season with 31 goals in 51 games, a streak that saw him named Ligue 1 player of the year as well as top the league's scoring charts.</p>
              <p>The last campaign was less impressive for both club and player, as Lyon ended the season without the Ligue 1 title for the first time in eight years, but Benzema nevertheless scored 23 goals in all competitions - an average of a goal every other game.</p>

              <p>A statement on the French club's <em>official website</em> said: "Lyon announces the agreement with Real Madrid of the transfer of
              international attacker Karim Benzema for a net minimum value of €35m.</p>
              <p>"It
              will also be possible to add various no-claims bonuses related to
              athletic performances, allowing the deal to reach a maximum amount
              €41m."</p>
              <h4>Preference</h4>
              <p>It was thought that Benzema would remain at Lyon for one more season in order to concentrate on the 2010 World Cup.</p>
              <p>However,
              the Ligue 1 outfit have announced that the attacker told the club's
              hierarchy that he wanted to join Real, who he preferred to United, this
              summer.</p>
              <p>The statement continued: "A few days ago, Karim Benzema
              informed president Jean Michel Aulas of his wish to join Madrid, which
