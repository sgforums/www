              <h1>I was due some luck - Fletcher</h1>
              <p class="story_panel_text"><span id="intelliTXT">Manchester
              United midfielder Darren Fletcher makes no apology for getting away
              with his challenge on Arsenal's Andrey Arshavin on Saturday.</span></p>
              <p><img src="http://images.teamtalk.com/09/08/330/Andrey-Arshavin-Darren-Fletcher-Manchester-Un_2353999.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="248"></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Fletcher must live forever with the red card
              he picked up at the Emirates Stadium in May which stopped him appearing
              in the Champions League final.</p>
              <p>The Scot has taken his disappointment manfully, refusing to be crushed by such a blow.</p>
              <p>But after suffering such a setback, he is not going to start worrying about the ones he gets away with.</p>
              <p>"I went for the challenge and felt I got the ball," Fletcher said.</p>
              <p>"Maybe I am due a bit of luck after what happened in the Champions League semi-final last season.</p>
              <p>"These things happen in football. I know I played a bit of the
              ball and a bit of the man but in the heat of the moment you are not
              100% sure."</p>
              <p>Fletcher again put in a performance that confirmed his growing
              reputation as one of the most influential midfield players in the
              Premier League.</p>
              <p>Arsene Wenger was probably singling out the Dalkeith-born star
              when he declared "someone had committed 20 fouls and didn't even get
              booked," but the fact remains when United needed solidity in their
              midfield, Fletcher provided it. When they required drive, they got that
              too.</p>
              <p>"I enjoy the challenge of playing against Arsenal," he said. "I
              did my usual thing. I got about people and tried to raise the tempo of
              the game.</p>
              <p>"I put tackles in and tried to get the guys playing a little
              bit. It is no different to what I do in other games but it sometimes
              gets noticed more in big games."</p>
              <p>Fletcher is certainly getting noticed more, with many believing
              his absence in Rome was responsible for United being completely overrun
              by Barcelona's magnificent Andres Iniesta and Xavi.</p>
              <p>Certainly, there was little time for Arsenal to get themselves
              on the ball, even if Arshavin made the most of space he found so
              regularly before half-time, after which he faded dramatically.</p>
              <p>Fletcher will continue to stress the need for a sensible
              approach, questioning why United went four-against-four in attack at
              the end, risking victory in a desire for more goals, only an offside
              flag denying Robin van Persie right at the death.</p>
              <p>"We got carried away with the fans and the emotion," he said.</p>
              <p>"We were winning the game but we were lucky because we nearly threw it away."</p>
              <p>However, the voice of reason is also backing Wayne Rooney to
              ensure a belated transition from Cristiano Ronaldo as penalty taker
              after the hiccup of a miss by Michael Carrick at Burnley.</p>
              <p>"We have a lot of penalty takers who have scored penalties. But
              Wayne likes to take penalties and is a fantastic penalty taker. He
              grabbed the ball and scored so hopefully he will go on a run taking
              them now."</p>
