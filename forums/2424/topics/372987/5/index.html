              <p>As I said before, depending on an own goal and a penalty is not the way champions are supposed to play. The better team lost this time.</p>
              <p>Attack was ineffective. Even the commentator seemed surprised that Fergie didn't bring on either Berba or Owen sooner after half-time to bolster the attack.</p>
              <p>Either Berba or Nani should have scored in the final minutes and shut the game down for Arsenal. On a normal day, they should have been able to score easily.</p>

              <p>Man Utd's first goal? or the one Fletcher slid in on Arshavin 24secs before Arshavin scored ? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>It was a soft penalty to give imo. Rooney had definitely.prodded the ball away, I guess then the ref could have deemed the ball unplayable. But Almunia had also clearly fouled Rooney.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On the Fletcher tackle, at first glance it looked like he got the ball. But from the replay it looked he slid in and the ball hit his arm or was it his chest? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>one thing, the official very 'on-the-ball'.. Mike dean right? he is like our parking warden leh.. the more yellows, the merrier... </p>
              <p>I think he spoilt the game a bit.. </p>
              <p>In the 1st half, MU was on the back pedal. SAF's ploy to play Giggs, to shore up the MF, but Giggs' contribution, holding on the ball is below par. It is as if, they were playing for the first time.</p>
              <p>Dumb-struck by Gunner's goal, Arshavin. He was the man, MU needs to nail down. Instead he was given a free look @ goal, and with little backlift, just let fire a thunderbolt. When he cuts in from wings, a MF should pick him up but given MU's two MFs were plugging holes left, right &amp; centre. Bobianlah..</p>
              <p>Fletcher is really molding into a Keano-type player. He is everywhere. On Current form, he is head over shoulders over all. I am quite disappointed in carrick, no fire. He put in a professional display, but expected more.</p>
              <p>I think all of us know can see how limited Valencia is. Against a fast LB, he is restricted, n lack creativity. A worry whether as matches come, will he "mold" into a MU player??</p>
              <p>lastly, berba-cock.. I scream at the top of my lungs @ 2am, when this joker hits the corner flag when given a rare chance at goal, and to kill off the game. What boots he is wearing? can he take one of Rooney's?? He is good at shielding, passing, but he should be better @ finishing. @ 30M pounds, I think SAF must be pulling his hair out.  I just imagine, if Owen was there, at least, he would have troubled the keeper. </p>
              <p>I think all in all, MU got a lucky escape. Gunners did deserve something. And they showed their young squad is good enough. However, sometimes, football doesn't play out like the way we all want..</p>
              <p>P.S. did we see another gooners diving??</p>

              <p>giggs was horrid.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Its okay if you play him against a team with one youngster since he can outgun the opponent with his wits.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But when u play him against a team of youngsters, they just run round and round him all day long. It just renders him ineffective.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i dont know what the hell he was suppose to do, didnt support rooney well, didnt hold the midfield well also.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Wrong match to use him in.</p>
