              <p>Looking at Arsenal 1st team, i thought they have indeed played their strongest side in whatever they have available</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1st choice keeper, 1st choice right back, 2nd choice Left Back (Due to clichy injury), 1st and 2nd choice Centre Back (Due to injury to Gallas)</p>
              <p>1st Choice Right Winger, 1st Choice Left Winger, and 1st choice CM</p>
              <p>1st choice Forwards</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The subs are mainly those CMI players like Denilson, Diaby, Bendtner</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And still got trashed 3-1 ??? at home???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Gosh...</p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT"> Teamtalk ratings </span></p>
              <p>ARSENAL:</p>
              <p>Manuel Almunia: Man-of-the-match last week but should not be getting beaten from that distance, no matter how powerful the free-kick. 7/10.</p>
              <p>Bacary Sagna: Worked hard and tried to get forward but his performance, like so many, was shaped by the opening 11 minutes. 6.</p>
              <p>Kolo Toure: A number of Arsenal players will be asking where do they go from here. Not bad, but not enough. 6.</p>
              <p>Johan Djourou: Preferred to Mikael Silvestre and did OK. It's not like he could have stopped the early goals. 6.</p>
              <p>Kieran Gibbs (off 46): How sorry do you feel for the youngster, whose unfortunate slip gifted United their perfect start. 6.</p>
              <p>Theo Walcott (off 62): Has the pace to petrify anyone but did not really get round Evra. 6.</p>
              <p>Alexandre Song: Better than last week but found himself out-numbered at times as United swamped the midfield. 6.</p>
              <p>Cesc Fabregas: Wanted to impress so much but must have had the heart ripped out of him by that start. 6.</p>
              <p>Samir Nasri: Probably Arsenal's most creative player and kept trying no matter how great the odds. 7.</p>
              <p>Robin van Persie (off 79): Was supposed to bring a greater cutting edge to Arsenal's attack. It did not work. Took his penalty well though. 6.</p>
              <p>Emmanuel Adebayor: Not that much better than seven days ago. The sound of knives being sharpened cannot be far away. 5.</p>
              <p>Emmanuel Eboue (on 46): Did his job well but the shape of the game has already been dictated. 6.</p>
              <p>Nicklas Bendtner (on 62): Thankless task given the position his team were in when he was introduced but had a few good chances. 7.</p>
              <p>Carlos Vela (on 79): Too late to make an impact. 6.</p>
              <p>The Self aclaim best striker got a 5 ! This guy is like that kanu. sometimes good, sometimes bad.. mostly is bad</p>

              <p>well, arsene's gamble with youth did not pay off.</p>
              <p>Was quite happy to see MU sewing up the game so fast, only 11 mins, and it was almost no way back for Gunners.</p>
              <p>I think as a MU fan, we have to give a bit of thanks to Pool for they kick our butt and wake the whole team up, cause over the two legs, we just did not give gunners any spaces to play their football.</p>
              <p>And credit to SAF for trying new ways of playing such as playing Ronaldo up front, Rooney on left. Ironically, it shows MU doesn't need Berba or even Tevez.. Since eons ago, my theory is that Ronaldo can do a Henry and "move" from Winger to striker, and now it show, it works.</p>
              <p>Yes, the only sore point is Fletcher's sending off, but on the other hand, we managed to perserve Rooney and Evra for the finals, and a trade off which i take with two hands. Also, if the referee or UEFA would look @ the event from the other angle, instead of behind, they would see that fletcher touch the ball. Funnily, given how Gomez did the same b4 hitting Carrick, a bit of deja vu bitting MU back.. :(</p>
              <p>I do like this referee, cause although, he seems to sway towards MU, he is fair and take no nonsense.</p>
              <p>Again, I think the key to winning this leg was energy. With Anderson, Carrick, Rooney, Park and Fletcher in the middle, they just almost cover all blades of grass and restrict Gunners from their flow. Even Evra managed to put Walcott in his back pocket.</p>
              <p>I do hope that Rio will regain his top form cause he seems just a bit off.</p>

              <p>boss, totally feel your pain.. but all thanks to your team for 'waking' MU up.</p>
              <p>maybe, just maybe, when Pool reaches the semis or finals and meet MU, then we can all discuss in depth..</p>
              <p>now, just lets not be too emotional and let the red rage covers you okay?</p>

              <p>Great display from Man Utd although I was disappointed at how toothless Arsenal was. Should have had my sleep and watch the Chelsea-Barca match tonight instead.</p>
              <p>Flethcher's red was extremely harsh considering he toed the ball away. But with his sending off, Park will be guaranteed a place in the squad for the finals.</p>
              <p>You can see why Berbatov gets on the nerves of the Man Utd's fans.  He came on as a sub in the 60th plus minute (naturally feeling fresh) and gave up tracking back on an Arsenal player just minutes later. I must say C Ronaldo displayed more defensive commitment than his usual prima donna style.</p>
              <p>If C Ronaldo were to convert into a forward, he really needs to check his runs.  He tends to stray easily into an offside position.</p>

              <p>actually, the first tackle on Ronaldo does set the tone for the game..</p>
              <p>when the ref blows the whistle when Ronaldo was tackled by Persie, it sets the tone. No one would imagine Manunia to miss the shot despite from 30m out, and with a 2-0, effectively, game over.</p>

              I must say Fletcher's sending off was harsh. He was the last man, but Fabregas wasn't cynically brought down. After all, Fletch touched the ball. I hope they can overturn the red card decision or downgrade it to a yellow. 
              
              Overall, the whole team played well. Rooney seemed to make the left wing his own. But the only disadvantage is he has to cut in to cross with his right foot. 
              
              Ronaldo was pretty awesome. 1 assist 2 goals and a great free-kick for his first goal. His second goal was team goal-cum-counter attack. Sweeping from back to front with sublime passing involving Ronaldo starting the move himself, through Park and Rooney and finally ending off with Ronaldo himself finishing with aplomb. 
              
              We're off to Rome! Barca or Chelski awaits...

              <p>So many firsts for man u. This is their maiden victory at the Emirates. This is a special season. They will be the first team to retain the trophy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, can't blame almunia for letting in the free kick. It was lightning speed and the ball dipped just before it reach the goal. Almunia thought it was going in that particular trajectory. No one noticed that?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fletcher is my man of the match really. He made a world class tackle, it's out of this world. And after getting the red card, he didnt complain despite knowing the consequences of missing the final. But there's a silver lining among the clouds. Everytime a man u player misses the final due to suspension, they win the cup lol. So it's great that fletcher got the red card lol.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, in all honesty, i think the liverpool debacle jolted them up. It may have shaken them but it gave them a great reminder that they are vulnerable and have won nothing great yet. Some teams like newcastle, once they drop the points, they lose the plot. (remember that season where they lost to man u despite a 12 points lead). Such positive reactions from man u justifies why they the best are different from the rest.</p>

              man u player misses the final due to suspension, they win the cup
              lol. So it's great that fletcher got the red card lol.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, in all honesty, i think the liverpool debacle jolted them
              up. It may have shaken them but it gave them a great reminder that
              they are vulnerable and have won nothing great yet. Some teams like
              newcastle, once they drop the points, they lose the plot. (remember
              that season where they lost to man u despite a 12 points lead).
              Such positive reactions from man u justifies why they the best are
              different from the rest.</p>

              <p>well, they did tried to play their football, their only style.</p>
              <p>but apparently, they still did not learn from the first leg of MU's strangle hold of the ball.</p>
              <p>Cupped with their inexperience, the first goal was a mistake, and 2nd, Gk's error.</p>
              <p>It drives a stake in their morale, and without an experienced leader to pull them, and crowd just went dead, it is near impossible.</p>
              <p>as a mu fan, we would really love to play Liverpool cause they did hit our butt at OT. and also with their great leader, Gerrard, we won't see such a collapse like Gongers. Maybe next season, or next, or next.. U get the message.. :P</p>

              <h1>Graham Poll: Forget the final emotion, ref Rosetti was spot on to show red</h1>
              <p>Italian referee Roberto Rosetti had a fine match and can justify in
              law the penalty he gave after Darren Fletcher brought down Cesc
              Fabregas.</p>
              <p>When commentators and former players say: ‘He got the ball, it can’t be a foul,’ they are wrong.</p>
              <p>Even though Fletcher got a slight touch on the ball, Rosetti felt it
              was impossible for the Manchester United midfielder to avoid taking his
              opponent in the follow-through. Therefore, he had no option but to
              dismiss the Scot.</p>

              <p>As for an appeal, UEFA do not entertain them except in cases of mistaken identity.</p>
              <p>They follow FIFA’s mandate that the referee’s decision is final and
              any player shown a red card must serve a minimum one-match suspension.</p>
              <p>That match, unfortunately for Fletcher and United, is the showpiece event of European club football.</p>

              <p>Walcott is young and shows promise for the future. In order for him to improve you have to give him oppurtunity. Adebayor is like a younger Kanu, finishing isn't first rate, but he is better at headers. No comments on Almunia though.</p>
              <p>I agree a Henry still dedicated to the Arsenal cause would be best, but towards the end of his time there, the pressure of being captain and all was taking it's toil on him. He was getting jaded. It was best for the team that he left.</p>
              <p>About Pires, as much as I liked him as a player at Arsenal, he is no longer the same player. Even at Villareal he doesn't always start. The only thing if he was still at Arsenal is that he would give options coming off the bench. His experience and maturity in the dressing room would help too.</p>

              <p>They were unlucky to concede that first goal the way they did. Once Man U got the away goal, it was always going to be tough. Arsenal have no choice but to attack and this makes them more susceptible to counter-attacks. Already being one down from the previous leg makes it even harder.</p>
