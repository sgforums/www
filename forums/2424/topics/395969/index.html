              <p> </p>
              <br>
              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson was jumping for joy again the day after Manchester United 
              were knocked out of the Champions League, as his horse What A Friend romped home 
              to win the totesport Bowl on the first day of the Grand National meeting at 
              Aintree.</strong></p>
              <p>In a dramatic race Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Imperial Commander fell, but 
              nothing could stop 5/2 shot What A Friend, ridden by Ruby Walsh.</p>
              <p>Rarely has a victory for Sir Alex been cheered so loudly in Liverpool.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">Ferguson said: 'I'm very pleased, it's fantastic and I was so 
              excited.</div>
              <p>'It's great. That's the beauty of the racing game. Every fence you're jumping 
              yourself, that's the beauty of it.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Imperial Commander never looked comfortable, and he eventually unseated 
              jockey Paddy Brennan at the 14th fence.</p>
              <p>Carruthers had a big chance to win the race but a poor jump on the final 
              fence saw him finish in second place. Nacarat, ridden by Tony McCoy, came home 
              third.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>Ferguson added: 'We knew the form of Carruthers because we've run against him 
              in the past, so I was quite happy, but the other fella (Nacarat) gave me a 
              fright.</strong></p>
              <p>'I've had a lot of great winners, but to win a race of this magnitude and 
              class is fantastic. I'm really pleased.</p>
              <p>'He's a young horse and the aim is to go to the Gold Cup next year.'</p>
              <p>Speaking about United's defeat against Bayern, joint-owner Ferguson said: 
              'Life is like that. Every day is a different day.</p>
              <p>'You have your disappointments and no-one died last night. That's the 
              important thing and you move on.'</p>

              <p><strong>Trainer Paul Nicholls said: 'That makes me feel better now. We set out for 
              this race today.</strong></p>
              <p>'He's a bit like Big Buck's. When he hits the front he pulls up a little 
              bit.</p>
              <p>'He's always been a bit green, but he's only a baby. He is only seven and 
              he's won two Grade Ones now.</p>
              <p>'The best is yet to come from him next year, we feel.'</p>

              <p><strong>Winning rider Ruby Walsh said: 'He jumped so well and I always had something 
              to aim at.</strong></p>
              <p>'I landed in front after the second-last and I had to stop him, but then 
              Nacarat came after me and then it was Carruthers at the last.</p>
              <p>'I didn't know Imperial Commander had gone, but he had been jumping so bad 
              all the way. I'd already given up on him and was only worried about those in 
              front of me.'</p>
