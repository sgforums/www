              <p><strong>David Moyes has revealed Everton will not pay a penny when Louis
              Saha first arrives at Goodison Park, subject to a medical this weekend. </strong></p>
              <p>Moyes admits he has no idea of when the
              Manchester United striker will be ready to boost his small Toffees
              squad, and that formed the basis of complicated financial agreement
              between the two clubs.</p>
              <p>The Everton boss is awaiting news of a medical but he believes Saha is currently struggling with a calf problem.</p>
              <p>“He’s had no pre-season games and I have no estimate as to when he may play,” Moyes was quoted as saying in The Daily Mirror.</p>
              <p>“As far as I know he’s in pretty good nick. He had just picked up a calf strain in training.</p>
              <p>“That’s not far away from being OK. Yes, he’s
              had problems and if he had been playing every game, we wouldn’t have
              got him for next to nothing.</p>
              <p>“There will be some money after he’s played games, but there is no initial outlay. He has to play before we pay.”</p>
              <p>Injuries aside, Moyes promised Toffees fans
              that they will not be subjected to a season of frustration with Saha,
              revealing he has no plans to wrap the Frenchman in cotton wool.</p>
              <p>“If I can get him out 20 times a season, that gives us a chance of winning 20 games.</p>
              <p>“I won’t use him sparingly. I’ll use him at every opportunity if he is fit.”</p>

              <p><strong>Louis Saha is ready to kick off his Everton career after declaring he is fit and ready to play. </strong></p>
              <p>The France international admitted he is on the brink of a move to Goodison Park having fallen out of favour at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>The 30-year-old is expected to sign over the weekend and explained
              he needed only a brief talk with Toffees boss David Moyes before he
              decided to join.</p>
              <p>"Nothing has been signed yet," Saha told L'Equipe.</p>
              <p>"But it is true there is a verbal agreement for a two-year contract
              with Everton, and both clubs' officials have agreed transfer details.</p>
              <p>"I had a brief talk with the Everton manager. He has been very
              honest with me, and explained the way he wants to use me. It went
              smoothly.</p>
              <p>"I am fit again. I spent the whole pre-season with United without feeling any pain.</p>
              <p>"I just need to play. That is what Alex Ferguson told me."</p>
