              <p>given the market prices and club debts, instead of finding readied diamonds, managers need to spot raw diamonds, much like Wenger with Henry/Vieira, and SAF with Ronaldo/Rooney to a certain extent.</p>
              <p>Of course, all clubs would welcome a big sugar daddy like what Mcity/Chelsea has.</p>

              <p>brown is plagued by many injuries due to the way he plays, but I always enjoy his full bloodied tackles, fair and hard. No compromise one. but sadly, it takes a lot on his body.</p>
              <p>Rio can lead, but sadly, still abit too quiet for my liking, &amp; not productive in terms of scoring. Ideally, someone who can control the tempo, and yet make things happen or even score would be best.</p>

              <p>United better get a new RB in the off season lar knn, after the petulance and naivety of rafael. rafael is still naive defending and making rash challenges. I dun mind him taking a yellow for mistimed tackles, but getting a yellow for petulance in an important knockout match is really unacceptable. gary is really over the hill and wes brown is always out injured. I am not sure if O Shea's best position is right back, but he is versatile and can cover all the defensive positions and even as back up goalie <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>dun ask me which RB to buy cos I really dunno. maybe can get sagna from arsenal <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">, as the best right back in the world right now are maicon and daniel alves. they will cost a bomb if want to buy them.</p>

              <p>true, but rem the time when Jterry was doing a lot of scoring, and uplifting the team. Well, Pool/Gunners have MF's captain cause they are the catalyst.</p>
              <p>I would prefer MU to have someone like that. Def is a bit too far from action and goals.</p>

              <p>well, I am 50/50 on what you said.</p>
              <p>While there are times where injuries/form dip, but this is ManUnited, one the big EPL clubs that should have ready subs to jump in and keep the bandwagon running @ top speed. Questions asked -&gt; How can MU be out of defenders/midfielders? Is SAF pushing the boundary of the team's /players' adaptability abit far?</p>
              <p>Also,EPL is no longer a jogging thingy where MU can make a run only after Christmas, Mourinho has turned it into a sprint.</p>
              <p>While MU may not end the season empty, it is still a major disappointment that they fail to retain their title, fail to go beyond the UCL semis or even progress further in the FA cup.</p>
              <p>End of day, there are many lessons learnt this season where seemingly, MU had had a roller-coaster ride -&gt;</p>
              <p>a) how to effectively move away from an one man team? Berba, sell or keep?</p>
              <p>b) what happens when Rooney's form dipped? Blackburn's Big Sam painfully point out that after Rooney's goals, Own goals is the next highest in MU's Goal?</p>
              <p>c) what happens with Giggs/Scholes/Neville? They are on their last leg. Playing them together is potential sucide as seen in Chelsea game.</p>
              <p>d) what happens with both Owens? or even Wes Brown? they are at the moment, potential time-bombs with their injury records.</p>
              <p>e) Anderson? is he going to make it? Or sell before his value depreciates further? Carrick?</p>
              <p>f) EdwinVanDeSar, he hits 40, replacements?</p>

              <p>probably 1 day fergie will come up and admit that letting Tevez go was a mistake like what he did to Jaap Stam..lol.</p>
              <p>I think the piority should be central midfield.Need one playmaker-a world class 1.The current squad DOES not possess any.Scholes's pass his best,with due respect to him.Carrick's been disappointing this season and thru out his career nv see him as a dictating playmaker.</p>
              <p>Get a suitable partner for rooney.Berbatov time at OT's probably expired.Benzema would be gd and more readily available.</p>
              <p>Get a capable winger-Ashley young?James Milner? Villa should not be able to resist $$</p>

              <p>Benzema won't wanna go to Man U lah................when people go from Real to other clubs, they no motivation liao..............</p>
              <p>unless they go to Barca............</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the decline is here and it's unstoppable...............most of the influential players old liao..........the young ones not that great..................can't compete with other mega clubs for big name signings.............</p>
              <p>last season depend on Ronaldo.............this season depend on Rooney...............all these are telling signs.................</p>
