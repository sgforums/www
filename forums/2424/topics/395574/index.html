              <p>1) Dun think so, that will mean SAF made a 30million mistake. Could be the bench warmer like teddy or ole</p>
              <p>2) Agreed. (Giggs could well contribute though)</p>
              <p>3) Benzema probably? chamkah ? or dzeko ?</p>
              <p>4) i think velso looks good. I think carrick, fletcher and owen could still be doing good</p>
              <p>5) rafael is good and the dodo guy is watchable. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think Nani and valencia can't really play together as Nani is better on the right and valencia can only play right. So we need a left winger also. Obertan has the chance to prove his worth.</p>

              <p>well fergie alrdy made a record mistake from that veron purchase? haha. so another one like berba wouldn't make a difference. keeping berba would be preventing another world class striker from coming in.</p>
              <p>fully agree with u on the nani valencia right flank thing. But nani issue seems more of confidence, when ronaldo was around, he was probably comparing with him all the time. When ronaldo has gone, he probably still suffered the after effects. Once he has found confidence, his right foot and trickery can be lethal.</p>

              <p>I think best if Berba can be used as bait instead, to get Benzema.</p>
              <p>Neville is way way past his expiry date. He's playing because he's the captain. Scholes is still the master of passes, I've not seen anyone capable of replacing him yet. Giggs can provide cameo appearances.</p>
              <p>I think the best is to get Agbonlahor in. His pace plus Rooney's bullfighting spirit might just be the best combination. Villa is another option but his price tag is er...</p>
              <p>Defensive Midfielder? I think Hargreaves time is up. Not to be superstitious but the previous players who donned the number 4 jerseys didnt really do well:</p>
              <p>David May - Super Sub at Best<br>Juan Sebastian Veron - Super Expensive Flop<br>Gabriel Heinze - Superb first season, dip of form, drop to the bench before he openly declared his wish to join Liverpool. Judas!</p>
              <p>Carrick still has 3-4 years left in him. Fletcher has at least 5 more years. I think United should really try to get Lee Cattlemole. I reckon he'll be the next Keano.</p>
              <p>The flanks should be of some concern. Valencia is really one dimensional. Right Wing, Right Foot and nothing more nothing less. Nani is blowing hot and cold, very inconsistant. We need another creative spark. Angel Di Maria sounds good. So is Hartem Ben Arfa. Or we could let Obertan or Tosic to prove their worth.</p>
              <p>Rafael can step up to fill the right-back berth. O'Shea and Brown can be able backups.</p>

              <p>Benzema looks like the only Sc that's available in the market...</p>
              <p>How about Ashley Young?i think he's better then agbonlahor..more consistent.He's the top few players on the assist charts along with Fabregas.Young would not have problem playing on the left as he always does at Villa cutting inside and feeding Carew and co with crosses and chipping in goals.Just take a look at his goal against Bolton..a bid of 20m could do the trick.</p>
              <p>We badly need a midfield dictator who can distribute the ball well..Carrick is too inconsistent passes always straying.He can be brilliant at times and awful in big matches.</p>

              <p>Oops, my bad, i thought he was already 28. Hehe. I think De Rossi might cost as much if not more than Aqualani and thus i think it's better to invest on younger players. Lee Cattlemole! De Rossi is good but the price tag that Roma slapped against him is like... Hargreaves should be sold ASAP.</p>
              <p>Players like Van Der Sar are very rare, not many goalies can last so long at the top flight. Buffon is on the way downhill, look at Juventus now. And why buy a keeper that can only last for a few season when United should invest on younger ones that can last longer.</p>
              <p>Just my opinion though. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>

              <p>we need a young n promising back up centre back, to cover for rio in case his back acts up again, n also maybe the departure of vidic, and also to prepare for the future with evans. right back got da silva can already lo.</p>
              <p>need natural left winger like di maria or joe cole, also need a playmaker bcos schole cmi alr, carrick not good, anderson dunno when he will come good. flecther n hargreaves are not midfielders that can cr8. they re more like destroyers. best if we can get a experienced one, like van der vaart or silva?</p>
              <p>then need another striker, world class one. we shld sell berba, period. recoup a bit of the money we spent on him. edin dzeko or villa will be good. if not can buy huntelaar too. we have able replacement in macheda n owen.</p>
              <p>buy GK too. buffon la, or nuer hopefully.</p>
              <p>we need to sign 5 players lor like that, 1 young n upcming, the other 4 shld be very near world class standard, or has alr attained worldclass status. </p>

              <p>I feel with rooney's injury, the spotlight has never been brighter than ever on the team. Most feel Pool is an one man team, but now, with Rooney out, cancel out his superb form this season, and the whole team seems a bit flat.</p>
              <p>MU of the past, have many attacking options, but now, it seems, we are putting alot on Rooney upfront, alot on Fletcher to do double/triple his work to cover the Midfield.</p>
              <p>Hopefully, the next season, MU is able to get back to 99 team where the attack is potent and balanced with 4 strikers not a stop gap like Larson or Owen.</p>

              <p>we need a young n promising back up centre back, to
              cover for rio in case his back acts up again, n also maybe the
              departure of vidic, and also to prepare for the future with evans.
              right back got da silva can already lo.</p>
              <p>need natural left winger like di maria or joe cole, also
              need a playmaker bcos schole cmi alr, carrick not good, anderson
              dunno when he will come good. flecther n hargreaves are not
              midfielders that can cr8. they re more like destroyers. best if we
              can get a experienced one, like van der vaart or silva?</p>
              <p>then need another striker, world class one. we shld sell berba,
              period. recoup a bit of the money we spent on him. edin dzeko or
              villa will be good. if not can buy huntelaar too. we have able
              replacement in macheda n owen.</p>
              <p>buy GK too. buffon la, or nuer hopefully.</p>
              <p>we need to sign 5 players lor like that, 1 young n upcming, the
              other 4 shld be very near world class standard, or has alr
              attained worldclass status. </p>

              <p>hi, for discussion, didn't we get smalling from Fulham to shore up the defence? I think we may miss JohnOshea (the utility man) and Brown.</p>
              <p>As for RB, I think we should let Rafael to develop his game, and Kiko.</p>
              <p>Primarily, we still need someone like Keano, someone who who everyone looks to. The memories of him leading the team back against Juventus despite a yellow card still seems like yesterday to me. Currently, we got only Rooney leading.</p>
              <p>Can we nick Gerrard if Pool fails to finish 4th? the coup of the EPL if that happens.. :)</p>

              <p>brown is plagued by many injuries due to the way he plays, but I always enjoy his full bloodied tackles, fair and hard. No compromise one. but sadly, it takes a lot on his body.</p>
              <p>Rio can lead, but sadly, still abit too quiet for my liking, &amp; not productive in terms of scoring. Ideally, someone who can control the tempo, and yet make things happen or even score would be best.</p>
