              United fan Mark Froggatt praises Ji-sung Park's impact on the Reds...
              
              When Sir Alex Ferguson announced the signing of Ji-sung Park in the summer of 2005, my immediate reaction was one of complete scepticism. I theorised how the South Korean was only bought to boost shirt sales in Asia and would provide very little influence on first-team action.
              
              At the time, United were two seasons without a league title and some of Sir Alex's signings, uncharacteristically, had not worked out, most notably in the shape of Kleberson and Eric Djemba-Djemba. I feared Park would be next.
              
              Typically, my doubts over the manager's transfer activity were exposed as a naÃ¯ve assumption about Asian football, as Park excelled in a United shirt and won over my respect (not that itâ€™s worth much).
              
              At present, the South Korean midfielder is a cult hero among the Old Trafford support and holds membership to a select group of players at United who may not command many column inches, but make enough impact to deserve them.
              
              Iâ€™m talking of course about the likes of Darren Fletcher, John Oâ€™Shea and Michael Carrick - who are the complete 21st-century squad players and unsung heroes. The types of players that will walk away with nothing at this Sundayâ€™s end-of-season awards ceremony, but deserve everything.
              
              Park has proved to be a vital cog in the United machine after scoring big-game goals against Middlesbrough and Arsenal - and if you believe what you read in the papers, his starting place against Barcelona is guaranteed.
              
              However, I am beginning to lose count of the arguments Iâ€™ve had with opposition supporters, who still fail to recognise the talents of South Koreaâ€™s captain and question his adulation at Old Trafford. But my response is always simple.
              
              Contrary to reports, United fans are not the fickle, glory-hunting prawn sandwich brigade the media portrays us to be. We recognise when players give everything theyâ€™ve got for the cause and Park does just that - and more. His attitude is a joy to behold and barring perhaps Carlos Tevez and Wayne Rooney, he covers more ground than anyone else on the pitch.
              
              A more critical individual may point to Park's lack of end product in important areas, but for me, he more than makes up for that in heart and soul.
              
              Credit is due of course to the big man himself, Sir Alex, who not only recognised a raw talent but saw in him the right kind of spirit and determination that was going to take the club forward. Also, a fee of just Â£4million looks a real bargain when measured by today's inflated transfer market.
              
              So in a time when some professional footballers are spotted in nightclubs more often than on the training pitch, Ji-Sung Park is not only a credit to himself, but to the game as a whole. And I am proud to call him a United player.
