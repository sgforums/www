              <p>Atletico Madrid goalkeeper David De Gea has played down suggestions he could be set to join Manchester United.</p>
              <p><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=30"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></span></a> is known to be looking for a replacement for Edwin van der Sar, who turns 40 next month, and he has long been linked with a move for 19-year-old De Gea.</p>
              <p>As his side took on Scunthorpe in the Carling Cup last week, Ferguson and his goalkeeping coach, Eric Steele, went to watch Atletico's 1-1 draw with Valencia, United's next Champions League opponents.</p>
              <p>However, De Gea insists he is happy to continue his development in Madrid and has no intention of leaving before his contract expires in 2013.</p>
              <p>"I learned [that Ferguson was there] the next day on TV and the news," he told <em>Radio Marca</em>. "I think that rather than seeing me he was watching Valencia, who they are facing in the Champions League.</p>
              <p>"The important thing is that I have a contract here and I'm an Atletico player until 2013. That's what matters. The truth is that everything is turning out well here and I'm with family and friends, which is what I need. I think that is very important."</p>
              <p>He added: "When the year is out, we'll see if things are going well, and those who have to talk [about an extension] will talk."</p>
              <p>De Gea's agent told <em>ESPNsoccernet</em> in January that <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=731584&amp;cc=4716"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">United were showing interest in De Gea</span></span></a>.</p>

              <p>Juventus goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon has once again dismissed reports that he could join Manchester United at the end of the season.</p>
              <p>Buffon has yet to play for Juve this season after undergoing back surgery in the summer and he did not turn up for an official team photograph last week.</p>
              <p>His absence from the photo call prompted fresh rumours that the Italy international could be ready to end his nine-year association with Juve.</p>
              <p>However, after rejecting the idea that he could move to United last month, the 32-year-old has again stressed there are no developments regarding his future.</p>
              <p>"Manchester United? I am used to living with these rumours, people have been speaking about this for six years now, but nothing has happened," he told <em>Tuttosport</em>.</p>
              <p>Juve's general manager Beppe Marotta, meanwhile, played down suggestions that Buffon's absence from last week's photo had caused a rift with his team-mates.</p>
              <p>Marotta said: "Juve have nothing to reproach Gigi for.</p>
              <p>"Actually we expect him on the pitch as soon as possible. No such incident with Buffon exists."</p>
