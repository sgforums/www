Joorabchian's company, MSI, have agreed to pay West Ham Â£2million to release Tevez's registration and clear the way for him to complete his move to United.</strong><br><br>The Premier League are expected to rubber-stamp the details of the deal today, an action which will also end a very uncomfortable period for chief executive Richard Scudamore. Tevez, 23, has long since agreed personal terms with United and the Argentina forward will fly into the country this weekend to tie up the details of his move. He has already passed a medical at Old Trafford Â— before West Ham withdrew permission for his move Â— so another will be a mere formality. United will pay Joorabchian Â£10m to acquire Tevez on what is effectively a two-year loan deal Â— worth Â£4.5m in wages a year to the player Â— and then have the option to make the transfer permanent for another three years for a further Â£25m.<br><br>Last night's negotiations ended a long running and often bitter dispute between West Ham and Joorabchian, who owned Tevez's economic rights. Joorabchian, who masterminded the deal to bring Tevez and Javier Mascherano to Upton Park from Brazilian club Corinthians last year, took West Ham to the High Court to claim breach of contract. He believed an agreement had been signed for Tevez to leave for Â£100,000 this summer but the matter had become confused when the Premier League fined the London club Â£5.5m in April for striking a deal which gave a third party influence over the player.<br><br>Joorabchian eventually decided that Tevez needed to return to training and complete the move, without the prospect of a long drawn-out court battle. After weeks of arguments, the parties clashed in court on Tuesday with West Ham's lawyers querying the authenticity of a Tevez signature on a contract amendment, dated December 1, 2006.<br><br>Joorabchian had hoped to secure the release of Tevez's registration for a lesser fee but was concerned by the fact that the striker, after competing in the Copa America, was still in South America, training alone as the Community Shield looms. Tevez was desperate to take part in the Wembley showpiece against Chelsea on Sunday but will not now feature. Instead, he will join up with his new team-mates next week to start his preparation for the Premiership season.<br><br>For United, it marks a successful conclusion to another transfer hunt. They have already added Owen Hargreaves, Nani and Anderson to their championshipwinning squad for a combined fee of more than Â£50m. Manager Sir Alex Ferguson and his chief executive, David Gill, have always maintained their belief that Tevez would be in their squad before the transfer deadline on August 31 and they have been proved right.<br></div>

But the fact is Tevez still belongs to Kia Joorabchian's Media Sports Investments (MSI) and Just Sports Inc (JSI).<br><br>Kia Joorabchian could have damaging documents that could hurt WH. If its proven that Tevez still belongs to Joorabchian while he was playing for them in the closing stages of last season... WH could be in very big trouble. Like going down to League Championship instead of remainding in the Premier League. Sheff United could be making a lot more noise, and the premier league bosses could be in trouble too for backing WH and not investigating fully.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Premier LeagueÂ’s climb-down on TÃ©vez will anger Sheffield United, who are expected to start proceedings against West Ham in the next few days. The Yorkshire club will seek compensation after estimating that relegation to the Coca-Cola Championship will cost them Â£50 million. Sheffield United may believe that their case has been strengthened by the revelations in the High Court this week that the East London clubÂ’s Icelandic owners had signed a second agreement with the Â“ownersÂ” of TÃ©vez.</strong><br><br>West Ham had maintained that they should not be penalised for the misdemeanours of a previous regime, an argument that was supported by an independent commission when it fined the club Â£5.5 million, with no points docked when many considered it a more suitable punishment, for a breach of Premier League rules over the arrivals of TÃ©vez and Javier Mascherano, his Argentina teammate. West Ham are believed to have shown an unsigned version of the document to the commission.<br><br>Â“West Ham failed to disclose crucial documents,Â” Kevin McCabe, the Sheffield United plc chairman, said. Â“The League have been proved to be shambolic.Â”<br></div>
