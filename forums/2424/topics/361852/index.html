              Cristiano Ronaldo has said ''everything went wrong'' in Manchester United's 2-0 defeat by Barcelona in the final of the UEFA Champions League and said their tactics were ''not good''.
              
              United set out at the Stadio Olimpico with the same formation which overcame Arsenal in the semi-finals, with Ryan Giggs replacing the suspended Darren Fletcher. However, after a positive start, the Premier League champions failed to recover from conceding a 10th minute Samuel Eto'o goal and were outplayed for the remainder of the game.
              
              Sir Alex Ferguson altered his tactics at half-time by bringing on Carlos Tevez for Anderson, but the change failed to improve United's performance.
              
              Ronaldo started the match up front before moving out to the wing and the Portuguese ace felt 'everything went wrong'.
              
              "I cannot explain," he told RTP. "We, the players, were not well, the tactics were not good... everything went wrong.
              
              "We have to give credit to Barcelona, but they were a bit lucky to be here because Chelsea did not deserve to lose and no-one has mentioned that.
              
              "I have to congratulate Barcelona, they were better, but football is just like this: only the winners get talked about."
              
              The former Sporting Lisbon man also refused to comment on his future amid fresh reports linking Real Madrid with a renewed interest in his services.
              
              He added: "My future now is the national squad, so that we can win, so that we can be in a good position in our qualifying group.
              
              "About clubs, I do not want to talk about that, I want to rest, go on holiday, I am very tired, I have played a lot of games, a lot of pressure. The future, we will see."
