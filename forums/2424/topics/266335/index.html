            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Edwin: It's good to be back<br><br>Despite only having been back in training for the best part of three days, Edwin van der Sar says there is already a real determination to build on last season's success amongst the squad. </strong><br><br>The Dutch stopper was reunited with his United colleagues at Carrington on Wednesday as the Reds reported back for pre-season training.<br><br>Van der Sar insists it is great to back with his team-mates after a well-earned break.<br><br>"We've been training hard for a week now and this period before the new season kicks off is crucial if we are going to have as good a start as we did last year," he explained on his personal website at Icons.com.<br><br>"I had a six-week break and it was nice to have a proper holiday with my family and really relax. But now it's great to be back with the lads, hearing all the banter and the stories from their vacations.<br><br>"There are some great characters at Manchester United and the spirit in the locker room is good. The first week back in pre-season is where the hard work gets done and everyone is digging in."<br><br>The Reds' No.1 described lifting the Barclays Premier League trophy last season as a 'fantastic feeling' and asserted his desire to repeat Edwin: It's good to be back<br><br>"We know it's going to be another tough season, but we are determined to keep the league title in Manchester. We don't want to give it up," he insisted.<br><br>"I'm not sure you can say we have specific priorities this year as we want to go out and win every game. We just aim to beat anybody we play Â– it's as simple as that."<br><br>Like most pundits, the 36-year-old expects the title race to once again be fought out by the big four.<br><br>"I'm sure our main rivals will be Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool," he said. "Arsenal lost Thierry Henry and obviously he's a major player, but they'll be looking to fill that gap and I think they will be more determined than ever.<br><br>"The others have also strengthened their squads so it could be a real battle. But it's one we are all looking forward to."</div>
