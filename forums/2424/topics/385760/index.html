              <p><strong>United can add to the Christmas cheer with a resounding win over Hull this Sunday – so back the champions accordingly!</strong></p>
              <p>These Tigers look a toothless bunch without Jimmy Bullard pulling the strings and have picked up just one point from the last nine available, scoring no goals in the process.</p>
              <p>United may have suffered two defeats in the last three, but should have no problems getting back on track against Hull. So which of the Betfair markets have the most appeal?</p>
              <p>United’s attacking resources have been largely unaffected by the recent injury crisis, so goals seem likely against a team that has lost 3-0 twice this month. That scoreline can be backed at <a href="http://sports.betfair.com/Index.do?mi=101021462&amp;ex=1&amp;origin=MRL&amp;rfr=8805&amp;pi.brandId=betfair"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">12 (11/1)</span></span></a>.</p>
              <p>At the same time, a cover bet on a 3-1 United win – just in case the Tigers break their three-game scoring duck – is recommended.</p>
              <p>If you fancy a bet at shorter odds, a victory for the Reds can be backed at <a href="http://sports.betfair.com/Index.do?mi=101021468&amp;ex=1&amp;origin=MRL&amp;rfr=8805&amp;pi.brandId=betfair"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">1.45 (4/9)</span></span></a>. <a href="http://sports.betfair.com/Index.do?mi=101021468&amp;ex=1&amp;origin=MRL&amp;rfr=8805&amp;pi.brandId=betfair"></a></p>
              <p>Convinced United can win big? Then back the Reds with a -1.5 goal start at odds of 2.25 (5/4).</p>
              <p>You’ll be a winner should United emerge victorious by two goals or more.</p>
              <p>Away from the KC Stadium, some of United’s biggest rivals are set to go off at short odds and a bet on the minnows may reward.</p>
              <p>Birmingham are top of the current Premier League form table yet can be backed at <a href="http://sports.betfair.com/Index.do?mi=101020462&amp;ex=1&amp;origin=MRL&amp;rfr=8805&amp;pi.brandId=betfair"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">7.4 (13/2)</span></span></a> to take three points from a suddenly wobbly Chelsea side.</p>
              <p>If you don't think Brum can take all three points, a lay of the leaders at <a href="http://sports.betfair.com/Index.do?mi=101020462&amp;ex=1&amp;origin=MRL&amp;rfr=8805&amp;pi.brandId=betfair"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">1.6 (8/13)</span></span></a> might just be the bet. You’ll be a winner should the home side triumph or the game ends in a draw.</p>
              <p>Over at Eastlands, Manchester City start all over again under a new manager, with Stoke the visitors.</p>
              <p>Do City really deserve to trade at <a href="http://sports.betfair.com/Index.do?mi=101020609&amp;ex=1&amp;origin=MRL&amp;rfr=8805&amp;pi.brandId=betfair"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">1.48 (40/85)</span></span></a> to win? Should the Potters be as big as <a href="http://sports.betfair.com/Index.do?mi=101020609&amp;ex=1&amp;origin=MRL&amp;rfr=8805&amp;pi.brandId=betfair"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">9 (8/1)</span></span></a> to spoil Roberto Mancini’s welcome party? If you’re not swayed by the Citizens, you know what to do… </p>

              <p>Ryan Giggs does not feel Mark Hughes' treatment at Manchester City should come as a surprise to any prospective manager.</p>
              <p>In the wake of Hughes' exit from Eastlands, Sunderland manager Steve Bruce suggested the dismissal, coming in the wake of a 4-3 victory over the Black Cats and 17 matches into a Premier League season that has seen City suffer just two defeats, could put young coaches off entering the management game.</p>
              <p>It is not a problem Giggs has to deal with, having just signed another one-year contract at United that will see him complete two decades at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>But, while he feels for Hughes, a team-mate for both United and Wales, Giggs is not convinced Bruce's theory will prove to be correct.</p>
              <p>"It is the football world we live in," observed the 36-year-old.</p>
              <p>"There is not much patience around now. Managers know that going into a job after a few bad results, the press and the fans will get on to them.</p>
              <p>"You don't have as much time as you did 10 or 15 years ago. That is difficult when you are trying to build a team</p>
              <p>"But all managers find themselves in that situation now.</p>
              <p>"Sparky did a relatively good job at City but he is no different."</p>
              <p>One of the other few obvious downsides about life in the football business is having to work over Christmas.</p>
              <p>When families across the country are tucking into their traditional roast dinner before slumbering in front of the fire, top flight stars tend to snatch a couple of hours in the morning before heading off to training and then spending a quiet evening in a hotel somewhere, preparing for a Boxing Day fixture.</p>
              <p>Not this season for Giggs though.</p>
              <p>For the first time in his illustrious career, he has been able to spend the whole day at home with wife Stacey and children Libby and Zach, having been given the day off by Sir Alex Ferguson because United are not in action again until they face Hull at the KC Stadium on December 27.</p>
              <p>"Until I had kids I never got excited about Christmas," said Giggs. "You just can't.</p>
              <p>"You have to concentrate on playing on Boxing Day and you are always travelling on Christmas Day.</p>
              <p>"That is one of the downsides about being a footballer.</p>
              <p>"Once you have kids it is hard opening the presents, then going off to training, so, to have Christmas Day off for the first time in my career is definitely welcomed."</p>

              <p>Hull boss Phil Brown knows better than to take an under-strength Manchester United lightly - but is hopeful of surprising the champions tomorrow.</p>
              <p>Injury-hit United are again likely to be forced to play with midfielders in their defence as they face Brown's side at the KC Stadium in the Barclays Premier League tomorrow.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson's makeshift rearguard was exposed in a shock 3-0 defeat at Fulham last weekend but Brown knows all too well United's understudies should not be underestimated.</p>
              <p>With a Champions League final to prepare for, United fielded a virtual third-string side in the corresponding fixture last season - and still won 1-0.</p>
              <p>That result, on the final day of the campaign, would have relegated the Tigers had Newcastle not been beaten on the same afternoon.</p>
              <p>Brown said: "There have been one or two surprises there this year, probably lads in the reserves at the start of the season that didn't think they would get a chance.</p>
              <p>"But they are Manchester United players, it is as simple as that.</p>
              <p>"They made a lot of changes last year and beat us 1-0, playing some great football.</p>
              <p>"We have got to be prepared for that. Whatever comes out of Manchester United's changing room is good enough.</p>
              <p>"But we are at the KC Stadium, where we feel we are playing some good football. It's not a fortress yet, that takes time, but we are undefeated in six there.</p>
              <p>"We have got to put our best foot forward and perform to the best levels of our ability.</p>
              <p>"When you play the Premier League top four you have got to hope they are on an off day but it is an opportunity for us to try to take three points."</p>
              <p>Brown expects his players to bounce back quickly from last weekend's 3-0 defeat at Arsenal.</p>
              <p>The scoreline at the Emirates Stadium was ultimately emphatic and the game was marred by an unseemly fracas involving 21 players, but Brown was pleased with the Tigers' performance.</p>
              <p>Brown described the decision to charge his club with failing to control their players over the melee as "scandalous" and felt decisions went against them.</p>
              <p>"You have got to dust yourselves down," he said. "It is about your response to adversity.</p>
              <p>"Our response to a 3-0 defeat is what I am focusing my attention on. We have got to get on with it.</p>
              <p>"We are looking for a level playing field. We want to be able to perform as well as we did against Arsenal, a top-four side, and get a fair bounce of the ball and decision-making process."</p>
              <p>Brown did admit, however, that Hull did benefit from one generous decision - a penalty award Geovanni failed to take advantage of.</p>
              <p>He added: "We did get a soft penalty but there was an infringement."</p>
              <p>Brown expects veteran Nick Barmby to be fit despite being unable to train throughout the week with the calf injury that curtailed his involvement last week.</p>
              <p>The match is presently the last for which the likes of Seyi Olofinjana (Nigeria), Daniel Cousin (Gabon) and Kamel Ghilas (Algeria) will be available before linking up with their countries for the African Nations Cup.</p>
              <p>With the tournament in Angola not starting until January 10, Brown is in negotiations to push their departures back, with Olofinjana the player he is especially keen to retain for longer.</p>
              <p>Ideally the manager would like the 29-year-old to face Wigan in the FA Cup on January 2 before heading to Africa.</p>
              <p>He said: "My argument is quite simple.</p>
              <p>"Seyi Olofinjana played 45 minutes at Arsenal, he could play 90 minutes against Manchester United and 90 minutes against Bolton.</p>
              <p>"Then you'll have a Premier League-fit player going to the African Nations as opposed to if he doesn't play and flying out with 45 minutes of work under his belt.</p>
              <p>"It makes a lot of sense. It is a win-win situation to me, but I am not the Nigerian Football Federation.</p>
              <p>"I am trying to keep him until after the Wigan game and I guarantee the NFF I will give them a fully-fit player on January 3.</p>
              <p>"I can't guarantee he will be a fully-fit player ready for the African Nations if he leaves on December 27."</p>
