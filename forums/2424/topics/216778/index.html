            <div class='col-md body'>Sir Alex Ferguson says there is belief in the squad that United can truly test Chelsea's resolve to hang onto the Premiership trophy they have claimed for the last two seasons.<br><br>After two relatively under-par campaigns, the United boss now thinks his side, who are above Jose Mourinho's team on goal difference following the victory over Liverpool, are definite contenders.<br><br>Asked about United's title challenge after seven wins from nine games this term, he said: "There's a growing belief. I'm looking to step forward and make sure we have a real go this year.<br><br>"We started the season with the hope, desire and intention to do well - and so far the players have not let anyone down. There's been a good attitude and great confidence. Winning gives the confidence and some young players are starting to develop very, very well."<br><br>United were by far the more positive side against Liverpool as Rafael Benitez opted to play Dirk Kuyt up front on his own. And, despite the away team's tight and compact set-up, Sir Alex says the plan was to not go behind.<br><br>Â“I think it was an excellent performance. We hoped to get in front,Â” he said. Â“That way they have to come out and go for it. They are difficult opponents to play against, but we played some good football.<br><br>The performance of Paul Scholes in an excellent four-man midfield was also key to UnitedÂ’s win, according to the Reds boss.<br><br>Â“I couldnÂ’t be any more proud of him, itÂ’s his 500th game and he scores against our biggest rivals. It was a great moment for him,Â” he said.<br><br>Â“I told Paul that RioÂ’s goal reminded me of the one he scored against Liverpool some years ago (September 199<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. He said, Â‘youÂ’re joking arenÂ’t you, mine was about ten yards further out and Rio miss-hit his!<br><br>Â“It was a great goal,Â” Sir Alex added. Â“I think it showed fantastic balance to bring the ball down with his right and then hit it with his left. He put the defender off balance. You donÂ’t see many centre-backs scoring goals like that.<br><br>Â“We were comfortable after that and we showed good concentration to keep the ball and rarely give it away.<br><br>"There was great composure in our play and I think our midfield was excellent. Michael Carrick and Paul Scholes controlled the match and gave us composure along with Ryan GiggsÂ’ experience. Darren Fletcher also had an excellent game.Â”<br>____________________________________________<br><br>its still the early days of EPL, but do you think Man Utd is strong enough for the title race?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yes. but once injuries and suspensions hit key players, then we'll be in deep trouble.<br><br>the depth of the squad is not at all heartening for all of manchester united.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>rossi is youth, pace while Ole is master at positioning, and timing.<br><br>while rossi is wet behind the ears, I believe SAF is looking at Ole to provide that odd goal.<br><br>like when the ball is crossed in, chances are if it falls to Ole, it would be a goal.<br>so it would be good if you have such an experienced goal poacher in the vicinity.<br><br>however, I don't forseen rossi being a saha (pace), RVN (class), Ole (positioning) or even Rooney (power). at least not yet.<br></div>
