              <p><span class="italic">Glazer family - under the spotlight.</span></p>
              <p>Manchester United and Liverpool may always be divided on the pitch - but according to worried anti-Glazer Red Devils fans the north-west giants are welded together off it.</p>
              <p>After watching their great rivals get plunged into turmoil by financial strife encountered under American owners, United appear to be in a worryingly similar position themselves.</p>
              <p>While sources close to the Malcolm Glazer family continue to insist there is no cause for alarm, the mere mention of United's Carrington training complex, or the iconic Old Trafford having to be sold off and leased back, as highlighted in the documents championing the launch of a £500million bond issue, has been enough to set alarm bells ringing.</p>
              <p>The perceived ring leaders of an anti-Glazer demonstration inside Old Trafford were ruthlessly ejected by stewards towards the end of a 3-0 win over Burnley.</p>
              <p>Massive security gates across the tunnel area, erected following the mass protests against the Glazer family in 2005 as their controversial takeover reached completion, were also closed to prevent any irate supporters getting near to the directors' entrance in a growing sign of wariness, even though none of the Glazer family were present.</p>
              <p>It is the sign preparations for a winter of discontent amid the United faithful are under way, in much the same manner as Liverpool have experienced.</p>
              <p>"All these years we wanted to get that 18th title to move level with Liverpool," said Mark Longden, chairman of the Independent Manchester United Supporters' Association.</p>
              <p>"Now I wonder what the chances are of either of us getting to 19 in my lifetime, given the level of debt that is saddled around the club.</p>
              <p>"Manchester United and Liverpool are the two most successful clubs this country has ever had.</p>
              <p>"But they are both being driven to oblivion - and the football authorities and the government have allowed it to happen."</p>
              <p>And, while the Glazer family at Old Trafford and Tom Hicks and George Gillett at Anfield bear the brunt of the ire among supporters, Longden feels England's biggest clubs, and some of those underneath, have been let down by the authorities.</p>
              <p>"When he was Sports Minister, Richard Carbon had the Glazers in his office," said Longden.</p>
              <p>"He gave them tea and biscuits and said he was happy with their assurances. They weren't going to put the ticket prices up. They weren't going to put the club in financial jeopardy.</p>
              <p>"What is he saying now? The people who have the power could have done something - and they didn't."</p>
              <p>Those words will strike a chord, not just at Anfield, but also at Portsmouth and West Ham, the other obvious troubled cases in a league former Birmingham owner David Sullivan fears will see someone eventually go to the wall.</p>
              <p>The more militant members of United's massive fan-base, the ones who filtered into O'Briens pub in Stretford on Saturday lunchtime to make their opinions known, have always been aware of that.</p>
              <p>But the rank and file are getting their hackles raised as well, judging by the "We want the Glazers out" chant that emerged from the Stretford End.</p>
              <p>"A lot of people have been in the wait-and-see camp," said Longden.</p>
              <p>"On the pitch, United have done well. Three titles on the trot and two Champions Leagues. Sir Alex Ferguson deserves a huge amount of credit for that.</p>
              <p>"But the figures are now there in black and white.</p>
              <p>"Those people have waited and now they can see. And they are desperate for a solution."</p>

              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Carlos Tevez was determined to prove a point to Gary Neville, according to his Manchester City team-mate and fellow Argentinian Pablo Zabaleta.</span><span><span id="intelliTXT"> </span></span></p>
              <p>Long-serving Manchester United defender Neville had suggested manager Sir Alex Ferguson was right to move the striker on in the summer.</p>
              <p>Tevez took exception to the remarks and responded with both goals in the 2-1 Carling Cup semi-final first leg victory at Eastlands.</p>
              <p>After he had drilled home the penalty that pulled his side level Tevez spotted Neville warming up on the touchline.</p>
              <p>He indicated the full-back should keep his mouth shut.</p>
              <p>The response was one fingered, which just drew more 'shut it' taunts from Tevez, who has now scored 17 goals this season.</p>
              <p>The gesture could also land Neville in hot water with the FA.</p>
              <p>Zabaleta said: "One Manchester United player talked about Carlos before the game so he showed he is top class, a top player.</p>
              <p>"He is amazing, everyone knows Carlos is a great player. Everyone loves him. This was a special game for him, one he has been dreaming about.</p>
              <p>"I am aware of his qualities and think he can give a repeat performance against United next week."</p>
              <p>Zabaleta wants more of the same from the team as a whole next Wednesday to realise their dream of a Wembley appearance.</p>
              <p>Roberto Mancini's side had to dig in after going a goal behind with the evergreen Ryan Giggs opening the scoring from close range.</p>
              <p>Tevez turned the game on its head - his second came after good work from Zabaleta and Vincent Kompany.</p>
              <p>But City had to withstand a late onslaught with goalkeeper Shay Given making a string of superb saves from Wayne Rooney to maintain their slight advantage.</p>
              <p>Zabaleta said: "Our reaction was fantastic after we lost the goal. It was a good performance from the team, we played well and showed strong mentality.</p>
              <p>"It is a great result for us and an important one for the next leg. It was unbelievable near the end. United kept coming and had many chances but we never stopped working.</p>
              <p>"We want to please our supporters and get to the final. There was a lot of satisfaction after the game but we have to show this commitment again next week. You can see we have great players and a strong character."</p>

              <p><strong>United's Under-18s staged an astonishing comeback to beat Stoke City 3-2 at Carrington, with two goals in the last nine minutes securing a satisfying victory.<br><br></strong>The Reds were behind in the 13th minute and then slipped to a 2-0 deficit just after the break. But a superb turnaround in the quality of performance led to Nicky Ajose, John Cofie and Etzaz Hussain providing the goals for a spirited fightback.<br><br>Paul McGuinness was able to select Reece Brown, Zeki Fryers and Etzaz Hussain after lengthy spells on the sidelines. But the U18s coach clearly had one eye on Thursday's FA Youth Cup fifth round tie with Blackburn Rovers as he named key men Will Keane and Paul Pogba on the bench.<br><br>United started well but a collison between goalkeeper Sam Johnstone and defender Scott Wootton, which left the Reds stopper understandably shaken, seemed to knock the home side out of their stride. While there were no visible side effects to Johnstone's performance after a nasty fall, he was unable to keep out Andy Nichols' looping header on 13 minutes.<br><br>It was a scrappy half with the rhythm and attacking potency of United's recent display in the 5-1 FA Youth Cup win over Burnley sadly lacking. But the introduction of influential midfielder Pogba at half-time made a huge difference.<br><br>However, again despite a promising start, Stoke struck once more to dampen United spirits. A dangerous cross came in from the right and Brown headed into his own net.<br><br>It wasn't until after the hour mark that United's courageous</p>
              <p>comeback began. The breakthrough arrived when Ajose was fouled in the box, dusting himself down before coolly converting the kick.<br><br>United went close on several occasions but, heading into the last ten minutes, the young Reds were still desperately seeking an equaliser. Thankfully it arrived on 81 minutes. The impressive Ryan Tunnicliffe had a shot parried and England youth international Cofie tapped home from close range.<br><br>A draw looked like a good result under the circumstances, but United weren't finished there. Excellent wing play from Ajose created space inside the six-yard box for Norwegian midfielder Hussain to poke the ball into the net.<br><br>United's players were rightly ecstatic at the victory, and it is a huge confidence boost ahead of Thursday's Youth Cup tie with Rovers at Ewood Park.<br><br><em><strong>United</strong>: Johnstone; Brown, Fyrers (Massacci 73), Wootton, McGinty; Ajose, Tunnicliffe, Petrucci (Pogba 46), Cole, Hussain; Cofie.<br>Sub not used: W.Keane, Giverin</em></p>
