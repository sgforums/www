Smith has been unable to break into the first team after recovering from a broken leg and ankle.<br><br>The former England man, who turned down a loan move to Cardiff last month, faces a crucial Christmas period. With so many games over the next fortnight, he will learn if boss Fergie sees him as part of his plans.<br><br>If he does not figure, ex-Leeds star Smith, 26, may decide the writing is on the wall and that he should look to a future away from Old Trafford.<br><br>FergusonÂ’s capture of Henrik Larsson, who is eligible to play for United from January 1, is likely to push Smith further down the pecking order<br><br>But with United still in the Champions League, Fergie will be reluctant to reduce his squad. So it will take a good deal of persuasion from Moyes to force his hand.<br></div>

"We put him on a speed programme, which had an immediate effect and we have seen a tremendous improvement in him over the last month. "He is certainly not far away now.<br><br>"I wanted to take him down to West Ham but he didn't want to go. He just wanted to stay and train on his own. He deserves great credit for that because it is not easy.<br><br>"He doesn't want to travel again tomorrow either, so he will be training again."<br><br>Earlier this season, the 26-year-old rejected the offer of a loan spell at Cardiff, preferring instead to remain at United and work on his fitness there. At the time, Ferguson stated his belief the move would have been good for Smith. However, now the Scot accepts his Â£6million forward made the correct decision. "He did the right thing," he said.<br><br>"He could have gone and played games but not been 100% to play in them, whether it is the Championship or the Premier League. "Instead we worked out a programme to improve his speed that he has really taken to."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Sir Alex: Smith going nowhere</strong><br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson has issued a Â“hands-offÂ” warning to Everton after media speculation linked the Toffees with a Â£6million January move for Alan Smith.<br><br>The United boss said he would reject any interest from the Merseysiders and again praised Smith for the recent commitment heÂ’s shown to regaining full fitness.<br><br>Â“HeÂ’s doing great,Â” acknowledged Sir Alex. Â“I wanted to take him to West Ham last weekend but he didnÂ’t want to go. Instead, he wanted to stay in Manchester and train on his own. HeÂ’s doing the same thing on Saturday when we travel to Villa. I applaud that commitment because training on your own is never easy.Â”<br><br>Smith, who suffered a double leg fracture against Liverpool in February, turned down a loan spell with Cardiff last month in order to remain at Old Trafford and fight for a first team place; a decision Sir Alex has given his full backing.<br><br>Â“He could have gone to Cardiff and played games, but he wouldnÂ’t have been 100 per cent during matches," insisted the Reds' manager. "I think he did the right thing [by staying at United].Â”<br><br>Sir Alex also quashed rumours suggesting UnitedÂ’s owners had imposed a spending limit on the teamÂ’s transfer dealings during the January window.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s absolute nonsense, but it is the silly season,Â” joked the Scot. Â“ThereÂ’s no set figure from the Glazer family [for transfers]. They operate in the same way that United have always operated.<br><br>"If weÂ’re after a player, we will present the case to David Gill and the Glazers in the same way I used to do with Martin Edwards and the PLC board. ItÂ’s exactly the same.Â”<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think alot depends whether Alan Smith can come out of this 'fitness' regime fully fit.  the advantage that Smith have over Sokljaer is that he can play aggressive midfielder (something like the mould of Keane) whereas Solks, while he can play midfield is not that aggressive.  Don't forget, Smith is younger than Solks.<br><br>I think SAf would want him in the squad in case he cannot sign Heagraves in Jan.  Then he can at least play him in midfield with Scholes, replacing Carrick or sometimes he can push Smith to play behind the strikers.<br><br>Smith has proved that he can score goals - when he single handly popped in goals during the difficult times where Man U has only him to depend on as striker.  On that merit alone, he deserves to stay abit longer to 'prove' himself after the injury.<br><br>Besides, I think in terms of getting goals / tackling, he is better than Fletcher, I feel.  At least his aggression is there.</div>
