            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Two ex-United players spoke out to the media about the impending arrival of Carlos Tevez. For David May and Dwight Yorke, to see Tevez in a United shirt would bring nothing but good news.</strong><br><br>With Carlos Tevez on the verge of signing for Manchester United on loan from West Ham United, two ex-players have offered their opinion on the dimunitive Argentine.<br><br>Dwight Yorke, who scored 47 league goals in 95 appearances for the Old Trafford side, seemed excited by the prospect. He said to The Sun newspaper, "Tevez will love it at Old Trafford. He is a typical United player, full of flair and goals."<br><br>He rejected the idea that Latin American players cannot adjust to the hectic pace and strength of the Premiership, saying, "I was at United when they signed Veron and there is no doubt he was an exceptional player. It just did not work out for him.<br><br>"The difference with Tevez is we have already seen what he can do in this league and in a very difficult situation. Now imagine what he can do playing with better players at United."<br><br>David May, who managed 86 league showings and a scattering of European appearances in nine years in the red jersey, was even more enthusiastic.<br><br>May said to the Daily Star, "What a mouth-watering thoughtÂ… Carlos Tevez playing alongside Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs, Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo.<br><br>"I believe he has everything a player needs to become a cult figure at Old Trafford, just like Cantona. Eric was the type of player who could change a game in a flash with one touch of sheer brilliance. He was also the kind of guy who, when the chips were down, would invariably rise to the occasion and produce. It seems to me that Tevez has that ability, too."</div>
