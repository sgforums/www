              <p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Gary Neville is determined to battle for his place at Manchester United despite increased competition for first-team football. </strong></p>
              <p>The England international has struggled with injuries over the past two seasons and has seen his opportunities limited.</p>
              <p>Wes
              Brown, John O'Shea and Rafael Da Silva are all options for Sir Alex
              Ferguson at right-back, with O'Shea getting the nod in the UEFA
              Champions League final.</p>
              <p>Neville has even been linked with a shock
              move away from Old Trafford, with Middlesbrough considering a bid for
              his services, but the veteran is keen to stay with the Premier League
              champions.</p>
              <p>The defender admits he has had to change his game in
              recent years and accepts he may not be able to offer the same attacking
              threat as some of his team-mates.</p>

              </span></p><h4>Important role</h4>
              <p>He told the <em>People</em>:
              "I played a good number of games last season and I hope that continues
              next season because playing for this club is as special to me now as it
              was when I first pulled on the shirt as a schoolboy.</p>
              <p>"Full-backs
              have an important role, particularly at United, in terms of the way we
              attack and the way in which there's a transition from defence through
              our full-backs to attack.</p>
              <p>"We have always set up play and been part of the extra-man situation and we always play with width.</p>
              <p>"The
              way you see guys like Patrice Evra and Rafael Da Silva attacking, they
              are more like wingers who can defend - they aren't just full-backs any
              more.</p>
              <p>"The way in which the modern full-back like Rafael, his
              brother Fabio and Patrice play is fantastic to watch. Before I got
              injured a couple of years ago you'd say I was running forward nearly
              all the time during the game.</p>
              <p>"Don't get me wrong - I don't do
              that in the same eye-catching way as they do, but you understand the
              changes and development in the game and the way I've had to adapt."</p>
