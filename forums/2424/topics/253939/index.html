            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">Roon 'n Ron to be Utd subs</span><br><br>WEST HAMÂ’S survival bid is set for a major boost with Manchester United likely to rest Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo. The Hammers need a point at Old Trafford to be sure of staying in the Premiership at the expense of Sheffield United or Wigan.</strong><br><br>Manchester United boss Alex Ferguson hinted yesterday that he will start with his 23-goal joint top scorers on the bench. Fergie said: Â“Wayne and Cristiano will be involved Â— if not playing then on the bench. Â“I will play a strong side. One or two will not play but, in the main, it will be a strong team.Â”<br><br>It is understandable that Ferguson will want to protect his two main stars ahead of next SaturdayÂ’s FA Cup final showdown with Chelsea. He is likely to start with Alan Smith and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer up front as he did against the Blues on Wednesday instead.<br><br>Not that Fergie wants to end the title-winning season on a losing note. He has vowed to be fair to the Blades and Latics and to make sure the Red DevilsÂ’ party goes with a swing. Ferguson said: Â“You saw what happened at Celtic last week when they were all preparing for a party and they lost at home 3-1.<br><br>Â“A few years ago when we were lifting the title I think we drew our final home game 0-0 with Coventry. Â“It becomes a damp squib when you want to make it a party. So I will be playing a strong team to win the game.Â”<br><br>Ferguson says it will be a tough afternoon as he is friends with all three managers involved in the last-day dogfight. He said: Â“ItÂ’s difficult when you are playing a team at the bottom, fighting for survival. Â“I understand the emotions of everyone involved. We will represent ourselves in the proper way to be fair to everyone.Â”<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>RIO CAN'T HELP LITTLE BRUV<br><br>RIO FERDINAND will be forgiven for suffering mixed emotions tomor row before he is presented with his second Premiership winner's medal for Manchester United. While Sir Alex Ferguson has demanded United end their season on a high with a win, victory could ultimately send down Ferdinand's former club West Ham, as well as his younger brother Anton.</strong><br><br>It is a scenario that has tortured the world's most expensive defender in the buildup to tomorrow's encounter, but Rio knows he and his United team-mates must be professional about the task ahead. Fergie has warned his players of their duty to West Ham's relegation rivals, Wigan and Sheffield United, and to go allout for victory against the Hammers to preserve their own integrity, as well as that of the Premiership.<br><br>But Ferdinand, who enjoys a close relationship with Anton and retains a deep affection for West Ham, the club at which he began his career, will have conflicting loyalties. Take last season's FA Cup Final, between West Ham and Liverpool, in which Anton missed the crucial last spot-kick in the penalty shoot-out to deny Hammers victory in the epic encounter. Rio, who was in the crowd at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium, said: "I was bleedin' gutted, wasn't I?'<br><br>"I was being pulled in both directions. As a football fan it was unbelievable to go through all those emotions, to see all those ups and downs in one game. "For my brother and myself and West Ham it was disappointing in the end, but I told Anton he could walk away with his head held high because it was such a great final."<br><br>If West Ham lose tomorrow, Wigan win and the Hammers end up being relegated, expect Rio to be the first to place a consoling arm around his younger brother. The pair exchange text messages after every game they play, detailing their respective fortunes, and have been hugely supportive of each other in the past when both their careers have suffered highprofile setbacks.<br><br>There is a deep-rooted mutual respect between the brothers from Peckham, who took over the family living room when they were growing up and used a soft ball to score past each other in between the furniture. The pair played against each other for the first time in a competitive match in November 2005, when United came out on top, beating West Ham 2-1 at Upton Park.<br><br>Since then, the brothers have played against each other on two further occasions, United winning 1-0 at Old Trafford last season. But Anton and West Ham exacted revenge with a 1-0 win last December.<br></div>
