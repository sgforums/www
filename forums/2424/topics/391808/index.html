              <p><span class="italic">Darren Fletcher - admitted to 'doubts'.</span></p>
              <p>Darren Fletcher has revealed Sir Alex Ferguson sought him out for a chat in 2008 that ended any thoughts of the Scotland skipper quitting Manchester United.</p>
              <p>Although Fletcher never got as far as demanding to leave Old Trafford, having been left out of the starting line-up for the Champions League final triumph over Chelsea and been only a peripheral figure in the last few weeks of another title-winning season, the 26-year-old was harbouring some doubts.</p>
              <p>With just a year remaining on his contract and plenty of clubs, including Birmingham, who manager Alex McLeish knew Fletcher well from their international days, expressing an interest, the midfielder knew he would not be short of offers if he decided to head through the United exit door.</p>
              <p>But Ferguson was determined to ensure that did not happen.</p>
              <p>And how right that observation proved to be given Fletcher is now firmly established as one of the most effective midfielders in the Premier League.</p>
              <p>"I was still having doubts because I was in a fairly strong position with only a year left to run on my contract," Fletcher recalled in an interview for the official Carling Cup final programme.</p>
              <p>"If there was a time to leave it would have been a good opportunity.</p>
              <p>"But the manager came to me. The contract talk was put to one side and our discussion was mainly about playing time.</p>
              <p>"He said there had been offers but he didn't want me to go.</p>
              <p>"I listened to what he had to say and just decided I did have a future at the club. Fortunately it turned out that way."</p>
              <p>It was the fear of leaving a club he had been with since school without showing his true abilities that eventually proved decisive for the Dalkeith-born star.</p>
              <p>"Deep down I just wanted to show what I was capable of," he said.</p>
              <p>"It was never a case of going on to the pitch worried but maybe it wasn't coming across on the pitch.</p>
              <p>"I would have hated to leave having not shown people what I could do.</p>
              <p>"That would have been a genuine disappointment, something I would have looked back on and regretted.</p>
              <p>"That is what drove me on and what I want to keep maintaining now because I want to be here for the rest of my career and leave some sort of mark on the club."</p>

              <p>I admitted i always felt sick when Fletcher's name was on the teamsheet a couple of seasons ago. He started off as a right midfielder and i remember watching his debut for United. He was slow, lacked skill and composure, showed nothing to prove his worth.</p>
              <p>However, years later, under the guidance of Fergie, Fletcher has improved to be one of the vital members of United starting 11. A tough-battling tenacious defensive midfielder, he shackled every opponent, stopping every attack with his well-timed tackles and interceptions. Wenger even thought of him as "anti-football". <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Kudos to him for sticking to his dream. I hope Nani and Anderson can learn a thing or two from this man.</p>

              <p>And let's not forget that unlike Roy Keane, he just goes about about doing his job without flaring up/letting the emotions getting the better of him.</p>
              <p>His form is going to be a critical factor in deciding whether SAF have his wish of Liverpool off their f*cking perch.</p>
