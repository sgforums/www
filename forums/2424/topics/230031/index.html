United take a break from Barclays Premiership duty - they lie six points ahead of Chelsea at the top of the table - when they entertain Aston Villa in the FA Cup on Sunday.<br><br>Carrick said: "I have made quite a contribution in terms of games played and am happy with that. It has gone pretty well. "We are in a good place in the table after the festive programme and that is encouraging. "From a personal point of view, there is always more to come and I need to improve. I am working hard to do that. "While there is competition for places at United, there is no rivalry in any way.<br><br>"We all get on well and the manager tends to change things around. That's fine, it keeps you on your toes and at your best. Even in training you have to be on top of your game. "That's a good thing because when you come into a match you are always sharp and raring to go."<br><br>United took 10 points from a possible 12 over Christmas to keep Chelsea at arms length. Now they face a different challenge in the cup and one Carrick aims to make strides in. He said: "When you are playing well and winning, you look forward to playing matches. "It does not matter whether it is a cup tie or a league game - you just want to express yourself.<br><br>"We have to be challenging for things at this club. "The FA Cup is a massive trophy - and United have a tremendous record over the years. "I have played in quarter-finals but that's as close as it has been and something I want to put right."<br><br>Carrick has been impressed with striker Henrik Larsson, who is expected to make his debut in the third-round match after arriving on loan from Helsingborg. The former Barcelona and Celtic star will return to Sweden in March to prepare for their league season.<br><br>Carrick said: "Henrik has looked good in training. He looks sharp and has settled in well. "Hopefully he will get a few goals in his time with United. I am sure he will be successful here."<br><br>Former West Brom goalkeeper Tomasz Kuszczak will make his fourth appearance of the season as Dutch international Edwin Van der Sar is rested.<br><br></div>
