              <div class="newsStory">
              <p><strong>Manchester United is delighted to 
              announce it has reached agreement with Aalesunds FK to sign Danish 
              international goalkeeper Anders Lindegaard on a 3½ year deal for an 
              undisclosed fee.<br><br></strong>Personal terms have been agreed with 
              the player, who passed a medical in Manchester. Anders will train with 
              United during December, but will be ineligible to play until the 
              transfer window opens in January 2011.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson said: 
              “Anders is one of the brightest young keepers in the game.  The 
              challenge at Manchester United is always to look to the future and in 
              Anders, we have signed a goalkeeper of great presence and even more 
              promise.  Having the time to train with him before he is registered will
               be an important period for him – almost like a pre season to get him 
              integrated with the other players.”</p>
              <p>Anders Lindegaard said: 
              “Joining Manchester United is a dream come true for me.  The Club is 
              such an institution in Denmark, it’s an honour to come here.  I’m 
              looking forward to playing and training alongside some of the great 
              players in football today.  I can’t wait to be part of this team and to 
              make my contribution to keeping the team at the top of the game.”</p>

              <p>"We've completed that deal," said Sir Alex. "All the negotiations are over and he'll join us in January."</p>
              <p>The boss added that the move for Lindegaard is very much about forward planning, for the scenario when United's number one Edwin van der Sar, now 40, hangs up his gloves at the end of an illustrious career.</p>
              <p>"We've got to prepare for the day when Edwin finally bows out," said the boss. "I think that's the main reason [we've signed Lindegaard now], to protect us for the future."</p>
