So just how long is this "the season is long" gonna work? United didn't buck up after the first match, neither have they on the 2nd and they finally lost their 3rd match.<br>No point blaming others or citing luck as the reason.<br>They just simply didn't perform to win.<br><br>Cheers.<br>CK</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well i certainly dun expect man utd to win every match. that will never happen.<br><br>and yes they din perform. no excuses.<br><br>what i was saying was that over the course of the season, man utd will buck up and be near the top. i doubt they will be fighting a relegation battle. its not meant to be an excuse for anything....<br><br>and why are u so critical. afterall there were many flops in the team after 1999. im kind of used to it already. the players u mentioned are new and u cant expect them to gel immediately. furthermore they are young and not used to the EPL. ronaldo din perform till last season anyway. b4 that he was flashy but ineffective.</div>

If United cant even beat mid table team, what are the chances that they will win back-to-back title? Normally you'd expect Title contenders to slip up against another title contender, and not to a mid table team or even team that is fighting relegation.<br><br>United usually underperformed against top team. Arsenal did a double over them last season, O'Shea scored at the very last min against Liverpool and United can only manage a draw against Chelsea.<br><br>Not that i'm being pessimistic but everyone can tell that this is not Champion's form.<br><br>CK</div></blockquote>I feel that mid-table teams usually play cautiously against the top teams, let alone the defending Champions. They can afford to play "9-0-1" or "9-1-0" formations and are happy with just one point. But title contenders are out for 3 points. Unless they can play 22 players a team, which they can't, so their resources will be spilt similar ways as Utd's. That's when we can really pit  each team's creativity, skills and pace against one another.<br><br>Unless ALL teams are only out for 1 point, then everyone can play the way Reading or Man City did, and Utd can say bye bye to their trophy.</div>
