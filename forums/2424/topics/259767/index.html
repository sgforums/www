            <div class='col-md body'><strong>CRISTIANO RONALDO has revealed how the death of his father forced him to grow up and ultimately proved the making of him as a person and a player.</strong><br><br>Ronaldo's father Dinis died two years ago aged 51 and the Manchester United winger has found it difficult to talk about the tragedy.<br><br>But in a rare insight into his personal life, the double Player of the Year revealed the effect his father's death had on him and admitted it has helped him cope with other adversities he has faced as a player.<br><br>"It was a very difficult moment," said Ronaldo. "It's not normal to lose your father at 20 years of age and you learn a great many things about yourself at such times.<br><br>"One has to be strong, and I have certainly changed a lot in the past two years. I certainly don't have any fear when I go out to play now.<br><br>"Family is the most important support I have. I think if you don't have a good relationship with your family, then everything becomes more difficult.<br><br>"My father was No.1 in my life. He is always in my heart. I have a picture of him in my house which I put up in a high position, so I know he is always watching over me. I remember all the good things about him. He helped me a lot.<br><br>"I give grace to God for giving me a great family - my mother, my sisters, my brother, my cousins, even my brother-in-law.<br><br>"They have all been very important people in my life." Ronaldo's dad suffered with a chronic liver condition due to heavy drinking and the Portuguese star invested time and money in order to find the best treatment.<br><br>But it was while on international duty in September 2005 that Ronaldo received the news from Portugal coach Luis Felipe Scolari that his father had passed away.<br><br>Ronaldo has overcome the trauma of losing his father and the ongoing hostility of opposition fans in England to become one of the most sought - after players in Europe with a Â£45million price tag.<br><br>And the United star, who signed a new Â£110,000-aweek deal last season, admitted the problems he has endured over the past few years had been vital to his development.<br><br>"Already in my career, I've passed some very bad situations," said Ronaldo. "But that happens to everybody.<br><br>"It's so important for a player to have his head in the right place. If you don't have your head in the right place, it becomes difficult."</div>
