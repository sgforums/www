              <p><strong>Cristiano Ronaldo has again stressed he is committed to Manchester United and says he feels ‘at home’ at Old Trafford. </strong></p>
              <p>Ronaldo was widely expected to move to Real Madrid in the summer,
              but eventually stayed at United after Sir Alex Ferguson refused to
              allow him to leave the club.</p>
              <p>There had been further speculation in December that the Portugal
              star had already reached an agreement to move to the Bernabeu, but
              Ronaldo insists those stories are unfounded.</p>
              <p>“What people are saying now is not true,” he told MUTV.</p>
              <p>“Who says that is a liar because I am happy at the club. I want to stay here. I feel at home here. I feel very happy here.”</p>
              <p>He added: “The boss is always important for me, not just last season but every season.</p>
              <p>“I am at this club because of him. He saw me in a few games before I
              played against Manchester United – people think I came here just
              because I played (well) against United, but it’s not true.</p>
              <p>“He’s always helped me and I said to him, ‘I want to be part of this
              club with you. I want to win trophies with you.’ He’s very important in
              my career, Sir Alex Ferguson.”</p>
              <p>There had been fears that Ronaldo could face anger from his own fans
              when he returned to action after the events of the summer, but he says
              the positive reception he received simply confirmed his feeling that he
              is at the right club.</p>
              <p>“I think the people don’t forget quickly what you do for the club,” he said.</p>
              <p>“When I arrived at the stadium, to play (my first game of this
              season) against Villarreal, I felt a little bit of pressure, but the
              fans were very good and this is why I feel the Manchester United
              supporters are amazing.</p>
              <p>“I love the fans because they have been brilliant with me, not just
              this season but every season. Like I said before, I feel at home in
              Manchester.”</p>
