              <p><strong>Club captain Gary Neville has
              revealed that he is already contemplating a life in coaching - but
              admits that it pales in comparison to actually playing.</strong></p>
              <p>The
              33-year-old lined up in the Reds' pre-season opener at Aberdeen on
              Saturday and, although he is relishing being back in action after his
              lengthy injury layoff, a future on the other side of the touchline is
              already in the back of his mind.</p>
              <p>"I have done my coaching badges
              in the summer - along with Ryan Giggs and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer,"
              Neville told the Daily Star. "But although the two weeks were good fun
              and hard work, it doesn't replace actually playing.</p>
              <p>"What it did
              do was make me think about the fact I hadn't played for more than 12
              months and that I've got to make the most of the next season and play
              for as long as I possibly can."</p>
              <p>The Reds' skipper has a year
              remaining on his contract and, regardless of what the future holds, he
              is intent on making the most of the coming season in order to prolong
              his playing career at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>"I'm into the last year of my contract, so I've got to do my best and try to maintain my existence</p>
              <div id="news05LeftStory">
              <p>at United because this is the only club I want to play football for," he said.</p>
              <p><strong>"It's
              difficult as regards the future because at the age of 33 or 34 you have
              to start thinking about what you are going to do once you stop.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>"At
              that age you feel like you are about to fall off a cliff because
              there's nothing you can do to replicate the last 15 years. You have to
              try to find something. Hopefully I can keep that at bay for two years."</strong></p>

              <p>I still like to see him playing cause he gives the mental toughness to the team.</p>
