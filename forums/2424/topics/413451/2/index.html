              <h1>Wayne Rooney asks to leave Manchester United: Sir Alex Ferguson's full statement</h1>
              <h2>Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson used two interviews today to reveal that Wayne Rooney has abandoned contract negotiations. Here's his full statement.</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/10/19/article-0-0BAD77D3000005DC-537_634x402.jpg" alt="revelations: Fergie confirmed that Rooney has been resisting signing a new deal since the summer" width="634" height="402"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Revelations: Fergie confirmed that Rooney has been resisting signing a new deal since the summer</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="firstPar">
              <p><strong>Ferguson on ... Rooney's desire to leave </strong><br>“The player is adamant, he wants to leave. We have to deal with the next part of that as best we can. I can do no more than what we’ve said and done at the moment. We had a discussion and I said the only thing I want from you Wayne is to honour and respect the club’s position and its traditions and behave as a proper professional. We cannot quite understand why he would want to leave.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p>"No one can deny this club is one of the most successful in British football. We had won 40 major trophies, countless cup finals, a fantastic history, great stadium, great training arrangements. The platform for anyone to take up a challenge is here, without a doubt. We don't understand it. I can't answer any questions about why he is doing it. We can speculate. We can have opinions. It won't matter a dicky-bird, simply because the player is adamant he wants to leave. I can do no more than I have said at the moment because we still, to my mind, have the door open."</p>
              <div class="body">
              <p><strong>Rooney's injury, and his selection for England</strong><br>"Yes, he was injured. We sent him for a scan and while he was able to train, he was still carrying traces of his injury. Why he was saying he wasn’t injured, you can only guess yourself. It’s disappointing. When it came to the Sunderland game, I felt I would leave him out and give him a complete break so he could be fit for England.</p>
              <p>"I thought if he went and played for England, at Wembley, we would get his form back<strong>.</strong> That was my intention, that was my idea, to galvanise him. Take a break from the games, get the training done, get his fitness back. Get rid of the traces of the ankle injury away and play for England. So why he’s come out and said that, I’ve no idea.</p>
              <p>"His entry into the mixed zone at Wembley has created that next stage that we have had to deal with, <em>i.e.</em> that he wasn't injured. I was disappointed because we know he was carrying an injury. We sent him for a scan, which showed a minor defect with an ankle injury, nothing serious, but he needed treatment, which he has had. There is no argument with that."</p>
              <p><strong>His relationship with Rooney</strong><br>"We’ve never had any argument, not a bit. I think you have to understand the mechanics of these situations when people want to leave the club. It’s an easy one to say he’s fallen out with the manager, a very easy one to say. I think there are traces of that too."</p>
              <p><strong>Rooney's contract negotiations</strong><br>"David Gill [United's chairman] in the early part of the summer, had opened talks with his agent. And that was to be continued after the World Cup. I was in the office on August 14 when David told me he’d had a call from his agent saying that Wayne wasn’t going to sign his contract. So then David came across to see me. He said he couldn’t believe it and neither could I. I was dumbfounded, I couldn’t understand it at all because only months before he’d said he was at the biggest club in the world and he wanted to stay for life. We just don’t know what’s changed the boy’s mind. David was shocked, I was shocked.</p>
              <p>"I had a meeting with the boy and he reiterated what his agent had said. He wanted to go. I said to him, ‘Just remember one thing: respect this club.’ I don’t want any nonsense from you, respect your club. What we’re seeing now in the media is disappointing because we’ve done everything we can for Wayne Rooney, since the minute he’s come to the club. We’ve always been there as a harbour for him.</p>
              <p>"Any time he’s been in trouble, the advice we’ve given him – I’ve even been prepared to give him financial advice, many times. But you do that for your players, not just Wayne Rooney. That’s Manchester United. This is a club which bases all its history and its tradition on the loyalty and trust between managers and players and the club. That goes back to the days of Sir Matt. That’s what it’s founded on. Wayne’s been a beneficiary of this help, just as Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes and all the players have been. That’s what we’re there for.</p>
              <p>"There’s been no falling out. That’s why we need to clarify the situation now for our fans. Because what we saw on Saturday was unacceptable. When we were at 2-2 and the fans were chanting for Wayne Rooney, it put pressure on the players and it didn’t do any good for the team. So we’ve got to clarify the situation and try to do it right. There’s no [specific] offer on the table for Wayne [at the moment] because they’re not<strong> </strong>prepared to listen to an offer. But there’s always an offer there for Manchester United to negotiate with a player.</p>
              <p><strong>His feelings towards Rooney now</strong><br>"Yes, I’m disappointed, very disappointed, I can’t believe it. When you manage Manchester United, there is always something you have to deal with. We’ve had to deal with these situations over the years. There is a disappointment a lot of the time when you have to deal with modern-day players. It’s not as easy as it was many, many years ago when you were negotiating a contract because then the player had to depend and trust on the manager he worked for. And as a manager, you had more contact with the parents then as well.</p>
              <p>"Yesterday I said to Edwin who made that mistake on Saturday, ‘Well, how are you feeling?’ He said the first phone call he’d received was from his father. I said, ‘Well listen to him, he’s the one you should listen to.’ But that’s gone now. We’re dealing with agents who live in the pockets of players. We live in a different world now and we have to deal with it in a different way. It’s a pity but it’s there and we have to deal with it."</p>
              <p><strong>His message to Manchester United fans</strong><br>"The message is that they have to trust Manchester United. If you look at the history of our club over the last 50 years, at the amount of trophies we’ve won, the honour we’ve received, the recognition we’ve got, the respect we’ve got from around the world, the admiration we’ve had from everywhere.</p>
              <p>"We’ve produced more players than any other club in the country for England. It’s a fantastic history and we should always remember that. You have setbacks, we have some blips at times. Last year for instance, we could have created history by winning the league for the fourth time in a row. It had never been done. We lost it by a point.</p>
              <p>"That doesn’t tell us this team is falling apart or anything like that. What it always represents is the next step forward. How do we challenge? That’s Manchester United. You can’t continually win everything every year. But when you have the little blips, we have the structure, we have the management staff to deal with that in order to get us back into line again. We have to deal with Saturday’s disappointment and we have the wherewithal to deal with that."</p>
              <p><strong>The future</strong><br>"[David Gill] was prepared to offer him a contract that would be difficult to match elsewhere. David’s prepared to offer the best terms possible for any player in the country. We realise and recognise the quality of the player, that’s why negotiations were started early summer, two years before his contract was up, to extend that contract. And also extend at the behest of the player itself.</p>
              <p>"He said he wanted to stay for life. We were honouring that request from Wayne to stay at the club, at the club he loved. He said the best thing he’d ever done was to sign for Manchester United. So David was prepared, with the discussions with our owners, to offer Wayne the best contract that anyone could have in the country.</p>
              <p>"We have to keep the door open for him, simply because he is such a good player. We have done nothing but help him since he came to the club. That is another mystery. I don't know how many times we have helped him in terms of his private life and other matters. He is not the only one who gets that privilege because Manchester United is that type of club. We do that for all players, it doesn't matter who it is. It is part of your job here. You look after your players. That creates a tremendous loyalty. It has always been a good foundation of our club."</p>

              <h1 class="storyTitle" style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px; font-size: 2.8em;">Mancini: Rooney won't be joining Manchester City</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>In a press conference on Wednesday, Mancini said: "Rooney is a very 
              good player but I think he will stay at United. I think [that] because 
              he is a good player, an important player for United, but it is not our 
              problem. I can only say he is a strong player like Torres, like Messi, 
              like Carlos Tevez, like Balotelli. The other things are not important at
               the moment."</p>
              <p>In the face of sustained media questioning regarding
               City's intentions over Rooney, Mancini reiterated that he was not 
              prepared to discuss the issue and denied that there has been dialogue 
              between club and player.</p>
              <p>When asked if City had been in contact with the United star, Mancini replied: "No, never. I have never seen him, never.</p>
              <p>"For
               me he is a United player and it is not correct to speak about this 
              situation. I have respect for him, for Ferguson, for United. I want to 
              speak only on my players and City. It is not my problem - I am City 
              manager, I have a lot of problems with my players! It is important for 
              me to focus on tomorrow's game.</p>
              <p>"The owners have a big ambition 
              for the future, for now, but in this moment we must think about 
              tomorrow, the next game against Arsenal. We must think about this and 
              not the other things."</p>

              <p>well, Rooney has openly put the ball back in MUFC's court or Glacier's court.</p>
              <p>he has challenged the future and not gotten an answer.</p>
              <p>MUFC has sold their two top players, Ronaldo/Tevez, and gotten developing and not accomplished players. And now similar to Torres, he has enough.</p>
              <p>What can be done? Liverpool got a new owner who may promise new things but I think it is a case of "change soup, no change medicine".</p>
              <p>for mufc, if and only if the owners/gill/saf can prove they can capture or sign an accomplished stars in Jan market, (maybe this time, Glaciers have to pawn their houses), Rooney may stay.</p>
              <p>Else, MU is going to lose one of the most passionate/committed and iconic player.. and it is the growing trend.. so who's next? nani? vidic? evra?? and then the demise or nuclear winter..</p>
              <p>Out with the YANKS!!!!</p>

              <p><em>A reverse ferret: a phrase used predominantly within the British media to describe a sudden volte-face in an organisation's editorial line on a certain issue. </em></p>
              <p>Wayne Rooney has caused the very same in this office and many others besides. Now we are left to seek the reasons and motives behind a change of direction that few had seen coming.</p>
              <p>The Rooney name is likely to be proclaimed from the rafters of Old Trafford once again, though there may still be caution in the back of those throats. That mob-rule evening visitation of Chateau Rooney may just have done its job after all, though Sir Alex Ferguson's handling of the affair will be most highly praised. That switch of private to public, and a leaving of the door open, seems to have done the trick and Manchester City do not have their man after all. They are said to be hugely disappointed while United fans will delight in another City near-miss on a trophy - a trophy signing, that is.</p>
              <p>The future may yet be City's but for now, United retain footballing primacy in Manchester - although that may change by the end of this season, as United are in need of on-field improvement, not least from their centre-forward. It will be expected that the ending of the saga must lead to a Rooney revival, once he has recovered from the ankle injury said to have been caused by a Paul Scholes training-ground 'reducer'.</p>
              <p>Rooney's statement said as much. "It's up to me through my performances to win them over again," he said of the fans, some of whom have already let him know their feelings in no uncertain terms. He was also correct in saying that he was "sure the fans over the last week have felt let down by what they've read and seen". Self-effacement is fine, and is a step in the right direction, but Rooney may have to outperform his career-best showings of 2009-10 to be readily accepted as a Red once more.</p>
              <p>Of keen interest to the more circumspect United devotee will be Rooney's proclamation that he was "signing a new deal in the absolute belief that the management, coaching staff, board and owners are totally committed to making sure United maintains its proud winning history".</p>
              <p>So too Rooney's suggestion that he had even spoken to the club's owners, the Glazer family. As previous practice would suggest, their role in the ending of the saga is likely to remain secretive but Rooney's change of opinion of the club's ambitions may yet be telling. Are United set to go on a spree and finally spend that £80 million Ronaldo cash? Financial figures released recently would suggest otherwise, as the club posted an eye-watering loss a fortnight ago. Or has Rooney's silence on such matters been bought off with a nice fat contract? Such questions will remain without direct answers but United's dealings or otherwise in January will be instructive.</p>
              <p>And then there is the Ferguson factor. Even in that incendiary Wednesday statement, there was careful attention paid to praising the boss, with Rooney describing Ferguson as a 'genius' - a description repeated in Friday's declaration of peace and love.</p>
              <p>Among the assurances that Rooney will have sought will be the continuing involvement of his manager. Previously, Ferguson has always kept the timing of his retirement secret, after the disappointing season that ensued when May 2002 was set as his retirement date, but perhaps Rooney now knows precisely when he will be without his mentor. However, even if that is so, the rest of us will have to remain guessing when that fated day will finally arrive.</p>
              <p>For now, the two are back in harness and are all smiles. The picture released by the club of the two kissing and making up sees Ferguson with the wide grin that has greeted many a trophy, while Rooney's face was more demure, his shy smile lacking certainty. He has some more making up to do, and he has reportedly already offered apologies to team-mates and his manager.</p>
              <p>"Grown men move on," as Ferguson has said in the past. It is now time for Rooney to prove that he was worthy of the fuss.</p>
