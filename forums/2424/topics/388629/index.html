              <p class="article">The midfielder endured a torrid six months with the Portuguese club and, following a string of poor performances, it was claimed he repeatedly failed to turn up for training.</p>
              <p class="article">Braga have sent Possebon, 20, back to Old Trafford but boss Alex Ferguson is open to more loan offers for him.</p>
              <p class="article">The Brazilian is highly-regarded at United but Fergie wants to send him out again so he can gain first-team experience.</p>
              <p class="article">Newcastle were close to signing Possebon before he joined Braga in July and Toon boss Chris Hughton is still keen.</p>
