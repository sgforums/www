            <div class='col-md body'>Manchester United midfielder Kieran Richardson wants a guard of honour at Chelsea should they already have the title wrapped up by next week's meeting.<br><br>Richardson, 22, said: "I remember when our team lined up for Chelsea two seasons ago after they had won the title.<br><br><strong>"It would be nice to go there having won the league and get the same gesture back."</strong><br><br>That would also make up for the feeling of hurt from 12 months ago.<br><br>United went to the Bridge that day, were hammered 3-0 and had their own title hopes extinguished as Mourinho's side claimed a second successive Premiership.<br><br>Richardson said: "Last season when we went there we didn't play our best.<br><br>"After the game everyone was really upset about our performance and the way Chelsea were able to win.<br><br><strong>"That was one of my worst experiences, being in that changing room after the game. We don't want that feeling this time - we want it to be a good feeling. We want to go there now and get one up on them."</strong><br><br>To claim the title this weekend United are going to have to win the Manchester derby at Eastlands today and hope Chelsea fail to win at Arsenal tomorrow.<br><br><strong>Richardson said: "At the start of the season the manager told us we would need to get 90 points to win the title because the standard has got so high. He looks like being spot-on.</strong><br><br>"But the Manchester City game will be tough. It was always going to be a huge game for us anyway. It's always one of the hardest fixtures of the season for us to go there.<br><br>"Now there is so much involved in that game in terms of the title. City are obviously going to be more up for it than normal because they know they can put a dent in our ambitions.<br><br>"So we're just going to have to stick together and play our own game."</div>
