              <p><img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2008/10/21/Berbatov460.jpg" alt="Dimitar Berbatov" width="460" height="276"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Dimitar Berbatov said his best form is yet to come after two goals against Celtic took his season's tally to five since moving to Manchester United from Tottenham Hotspur. Berbatov's brace and a third from Wayne Rooney were enough to see off the Scottish challenge at Old Trafford.</strong></p>
              <p>Carlos Tevez was named among the United substitutes and Berbatov stressed the competition for places could only benefit his game. "I will improve, that's why I am here, that's why I came here, to the biggest club," said the Bulgarian. "Everything is working well.</p>
              <p>"When you are here, you have no time to hide in a game, you always have to give 100% and that is what I am doing. In the past there were moments when I didn't give 100% but here I cannot hide and I have to work hard to keep my place."</p>
              <p>On the dubious nature of his goals Berbatov added: "It's not my decision to make, I am trying to score, it's for the referee and he said no offside."</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson also brushed aside the controversy. "It is good to get a break for a change," said the United manager. "You accept these breaks. On Saturday we had a perfectly good goal chalked off which would have put us 1-0 ahead in the first half. Things like that can make a helluva difference."</p>
              <p>Ferguson was delighted not only with Berbatov, his record £30.75m signing, but also Rooney, who has scored nine goals in his past seven games. "Berbatov produced some fantastic pieces of football. The players now understand what kind of and how good a player he is. Five goals already is a terrific contribution.</p>
              <p>"Wayne scores in spurts, hopefully this one continues for quite a while. He has natural energy. Sometimes he uses that wrongly, he expends it all over the pitch but that is just part of his enjoyment. He likes to play and be involved in the game all of the time."</p>
              <p>Ferguson said he expected Cristiano Ronaldo to be fit for Saturday's meeting with Everton after the Portugal international injured his kneecap late last night. "Ronaldo demanded to play against Celtic, he had read in the papers that I said he might be tired; he came to see me to tell me he wasn't tired."</p>
              <p>Berbatov was withdrawn after his second goal as a precaution with a minor hip complaint. Rio Ferdinand, who missed Celtic's visit after picking up a groin injury in training on Monday, could cause the manager more concern.</p>
              <p>Ferguson's opposite number, Gordon Strachan, was perhaps overly magnanimous and attempting to protect his own players when claiming that United had produced "one of the best performances I have come across in Europe". Strachan added that he was merely glad his team were not embarrassed. "I am just happy it was not a rout," he said. "Roma [conceded] seven here, for example."</p>
              <p>Strachan was reluctant to criticise the officials, adding his voice to those hailing Rooney. "The two goals were offside but I won't sit here and scream about that," said the former Southampton manager. "I am a football man and I know when I have been well beaten. Two or three of our players showed they can play at English Premier League level, it was a wake-up call for the others.</p>
              <p>"I think Rooney is unplayable just now. We tried everything; what we saw was a world-class player backed up by another couple of world-class players and other international-class players."</p>
