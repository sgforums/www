He bagged 17 last season and already has two this time round.<br><br>UnitedÂ’s French striker Louis Saha is expected to return to action in the next fortnight.<br><br>But he is a fragile figure who could easily break down again, while Wayne Rooney is out for two months with a broken foot.<br><br>If Fergie could ensure Saha stays fit, the manager may give the cheque-book a rest but he cannot guarantee it.<br><br>United would face competition from rivals Manchester City should they move for Anelka, 28.<br><br>The hotshot has been offered to both clubs by his representatives Â— but Bolton want Â£12m.<br><br>City initially rejected the chance to buy their former hitman.<br><br>But Sven Goran Eriksson has done a U-turn after new Â£6m striker Valeri Bojinov was ruled out for four months with a knee injury.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>NICK NIC<br>EXCLUSIVE Fergie &amp; Sven fight it out for Â£12M Anelka<br>By David Mcdonnell 29/08/2007<br><br>Manchester United and Manchester City are locked in a fierce battle to sign Bolton striker Nicolas Anelka before Friday's transfer deadline.<br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson wants Â£12million Anelka to solve his striker crisis at United, while City manager Sven Goran Eriksson is keen to bring the Frenchman back to his former club to inject some quality into his front line. With Wayne Rooney and Louis Saha injured and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer having announced his retirement, Carlos Tevez is the only fit recognised striker United boss Fergie currently has at his disposal.<br><br>Fergie had hoped to sign Tottenham striker Dimitar Berbatov, but Spurs have refused to sell their Â£25mrated star and the United boss has been forced to turn his attention to the brooding Anelka.<br><br>Although United are hopeful Rooney will have recovered from a broken foot in three to four weeks, there are concerns over the long-term fitness of Saha, with Fergie knowing he needs more cover up front.<br>Advertisement<br><br>Limit And with Tevez set to make a 21,000-mile roundtrip to Australia to play for Argentina just days before United's lunchtime trip to Everton on September 15, Fergie's striking options have been stretched to the limit.<br><br>Solskjaer knew his glittering career was over last week when his persistent knee problem flared up again and left him with no option but to retire after 11 glorious years at Old Trafford.<br><br>He said: "My knees have told my head 'you have to stop'. My knees will be important for me just to function in everyday life and for my quality of life.<br><br>"I will start to educate myself as a coach now and start my next career in football on the other side of the white line. That's what I want to do.<br><br>"It was an easy decision. I was training last week and the knee blew up a bit again so I've reached the end of the line."<br><br><a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/2007/08/29/nick-nic-89520-19701892/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/2007/08/29/nick-nic-89520-19701892/</a></div>
