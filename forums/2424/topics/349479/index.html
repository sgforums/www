              <p class="small bold"><em>JONNY A JAB HAND... Evans keeps a close eye on Ibrahimovic</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">JONNY EVANS has revealed how he needed TWO pain-killing injections to help Manchester United keep their European dreams alive. </h2>
              <p class="article">Evans had to crash through the pain barrier in the San Siro on Tuesday night because of an ankle injury. He had jabs before the game and at half-time as United earned a goalless draw with Inter Milan in the last 16 of the Champions League. </p>
              <p class="article">Alex Ferguson admitted before the match he would be panicking if he could not get Evans out on the pitch. And the young defender ignored his ankle problem, with a bit of help from the doctor, to answer the call. </p>
              <p class="article">Evans, 21, said: “I am just trying to scrape through each game. Tuesday was important as there weren’t many other options so I was forced to play. “It was fine except maybe the last 10 minutes of each half. “Maybe the pain-killing stuff was wearing off. I had another shot at half-time to help me through. </p>
              <p class="article">“I picked up the injury at the back end of last season and maybe I have done a bit of damage there. “It keeps hurting and coming back so I’m going to have to get it sorted at some point in the future. </p>
              <p class="article">“It’s like a bone bruise on the inside of my ankle. It’s a case of hoping I don’t get a bang on it or catch it wrong. “But it’s not nice to keep struggling on with the injury. I hope I can get to the summer and have a month off.” </p>
              <p class="article">Evans has been a revelation this season filling in for Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic when injury and suspensions have taken their toll. The Northern Ireland international believes his experience on loan at Sunderland fighting a relegation battle last season has stood him in good stead for playing for United.</p>
              <p class="article">Now Evans is hoping another jab can get him on the pitch at Wembley on Sunday in the Carling Cup final against Tottenham. He said: “Hopefully the manager will allow me to have a few more injections! It’s not nice to think about missing the final. </p>
              <p class="article">“The manager has tried to tell me if I miss it, it’s no big thing, but... ” Evans is a no-nonsense defender who has proved an equal to some of the best attackers in the game — the latest Inter’s Zlatan Ibrahimovic.</p>
              <p class="article">He added: “Defending is all about keeping the game simple and doing the basics right. You have to keep your concentration and communicate well with the guy beside you. “And, of course, you can always help yourself just by being alert.” </p>
              <p class="article">Evans is about to sign an improved contract from £10,000 a week to £40,000 for the next five years. All this after he was considering a permanent move to Sunderland until boss Ferguson talked him round. </p>
              <p class="article">Fergie revealed: “I said to him, ‘Think about three or four years ahead — where would you want to be? In the Manchester United first team or the Sunderland first team?’ </p>
              <p class="article">“I told him his potential was so good he’d eventually take over from Rio.”</p>
