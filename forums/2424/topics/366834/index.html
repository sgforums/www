              <p>It appears there was at least one avid reader of Michael Owen's self-gratifying sales brochure, and it just happened to be the country's most shrewd manager.</p>
              <p>Many derided the preposterous hyperbole proffered by Owen's current management company, Wasserman Media Group, in their attempt to snare him a new club, while the only flickers of interest seemed to come from other experts at trumpet blowing; Hull manager Phil Brown and Stoke's Tony Pulis.</p>
              <p>But Sir Alex Ferguson was clearly leafing through the 'dodgy' dossier with more than a smirk on his face. His move for Owen is typical Fergie - controversial and confronting.</p>
              <p>Owen's inconsistent form, persistent injuries and Anfield past will have Manchester United fans choking on their cornflakes this morning. But deep down they know the Lord of Old Trafford is very rarely wrong.</p>
              <p>Owen's lamentable spell at Newcastle culminated in their relegation to the Championship. The Toon only needed a point at Aston Villa in their last game to beat the drop, but Owen didn't even make the starting line up.</p>
              <p>He was briefly seen in the game's latter stages, ambling around in the late May sunshine displaying the sort of purpose usually reserved for a pre-season friendly against non-league opposition.</p>
              <p>The fact he now finds himself on the brink of a move to the current Premier League champions will bemuse and frustrate all those black-and-whites who can still bring themselves to care.</p>
              <p>His four-year Newcastle contract ended this week, and after picking up exorbitant wages for an average of 19 games a season one fans' website declared Owen puts the "con in icon".</p>
              <p>Perhaps his best spell at St James' Park came under Kevin Keegan at the end of the 2007-08 season.</p>
              <p>Playing just behind Mark Viduka and Obafemi Martins, Owen scored nine goals in 14 games as the Magpies pulled clear of relegation.</p>
              <p>In this most catastrophic of seasons on Tyneside, Owen was a passenger. His last goal came in January, despite featuring in 12 more games before the end of the campaign.</p>
              <p>But Ferguson clearly still thinks there is life in the 29-year-old, and is confident he can reinstall the belief and desire Owen repeatedly failed to display in the North East.</p>
              <p>Owen's malaise means United's boss can drive a hard bargain. He'll be signed for modest wages, the incentives loaded in return for plenty of games and goals.</p>
              <p>And the manager knows in his side Owen will at least be provided with eminently better service than at Newcastle, one fact the brochure was quick to underline. After all, there's a world of difference between ammunition from Duff, Nolan and Guthrie, and Giggs, Carrick and Rooney.</p>
              <p>Should Owen pass his medical, and stay fit, it will be fascinating to see how much face time he gets, and where he gets it.</p>
              <p>Surely he's been identified as a starter against the weaker sides from home and abroad. One can envisage him playing away at Burnley in the Premier League, not against AC Milan in the Champions League quarter-final at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Owen will look at the likes of Scholes and Giggs, as proof that life under Ferguson can be long. His pace may have long gone, but if his instinct remains he could be snaffling chances from inside the area for five years to come.</p>
              <p>And if he doesn't, what has Fergie lost? A bit of cash, perhaps a shred of pride, but certainly no sleep. He's no stranger to a bit of earache too.</p>
              <p>For two men who like a flutter on the horses, both are aware this is a high stakes gamble. Ask the man in street and he'll tell you the odds of it succeeding are long.</p>
