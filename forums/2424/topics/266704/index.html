            <div class='col-md body'><strong>West Ham striker Carlos Tevez insists he won't go back on his promise to Sir Alex Ferguson that he will join Manchester United.</strong><br><br>The Argentine hitman's representatives will try to finalise his hugely-complicated move to Old Trafford within the next week after the deal reached an impasse on Friday night.<br><br>The player's agent, Kia Joorabchian, had hoped to announce that a deal was in place already but has been thwarted by the Premier League's insistence that the transfer is conducted through West Ham.<br><br>The Hammers threw the proposed move into turmoil by insisting there is no agreement in place for him to join the champions.<br><br>But 23-year-old Tevez has given his word to Ferguson that he will join.<br><br>He told The People: "Through my backers, I have given my word to Mr Ferguson. They have told him I will be at Manchester United next season and once I make a promise I don't go back on it.<br><br>"There isn't a player who would turn down this opportunity and negotiations are too far advanced to go back now."<br><br>Tevez knows West Ham fans won't share his enthusiasm for the move, but says he hopes keeping them in the Premier League will temper their anger.<br><br>He added: "I hope the fans understand. I had two very good offers from foreign clubs in January but I refused because I had unfinished business.<br><br>"It would have been easy to move on, but I couldn't leave the club and the fans in that predicament.<br><br>"It will be an emotional and special day whenever I return to play them."<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

It was exactly the same deal.<br><br>"The Premier League scrutinised that transfer but did not insist on West Ham receiving any of the money from that deal."<br><br>The Premier League, however, maintain the two situations are different because the third-party agreement in Mascherano's West Ham contract was ended when he moved on to Liverpool.<br><br>But in the case of Tevez, West Ham opted to keep the player and unilaterally terminate the third-party clause in his contract following an independent disciplinary commission hearing, allowing the Argentina striker to play a key role in the Hammers' successful fight against relegation.<br><br>A Premier League statement said: "Our position remains the same. Any deal for the transfer of Carlos Tevez has to be struck directly with West Ham United and we support West Ham United in asserting their rights over their player."<br><br>West Ham responded to the Premier League's stance last night by insisting that Tevez is under contract at Upton Park for three and would not be leaving without the club's permission.<br><br>Given the decision West Ham took in April to terminate the third-party agreement, they had no option but to make such an announcement.<br><br>But that leaves Tevez's proposed transfer in turmoil. The player's representatives are furious while United are frustrated the deal has been delayed through no fault of their own.<br><br>"It is nonsense for West Ham to state they own the player," added the source.<br><br>"If I lend you my car and you rip up the log book, that does not mean you then own the car."<br><br>It is understood from sources close to the club that West Ham did not pay any loan fee at all last summer when they signed Tevez and Mascherano. The Hammers were only responsible for the players' wages.<br><br>At the time the pair moved to West Ham, their representative Kia Joorabchian was investigating the possibility of buying the club.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I see a sore loser in SU - they should accept relegation gracefully.  Afterall, they had only themselves to blame for their league position.  Wanting to remain in Premier League at expense of your opponents docking points is not a true litmus of your ability at all.<br><br>Tevez's issue is complicated alright but I really hope this will go through because with the battlion of lawyers that Man U have, they should have no problems arranging something above water.  I mean once they set sight on Tevez, they are bound to get their man - moreover, there seems no "competition" from other clubs.</div>
