              <p>The FA have chosen to come down hard on Wayne Rooney for his use of 
              the 'F-word' towards a cameraman during Manchester United's 4-2 win at 
              West Ham United.</p>

              <p>Rooney's celebration of his hat-trick included a set-to with a <em>Sky</em> cameraman and led to a wealth of headlines throughout the weekend. The 
              player issued an apology on Saturday afternoon but it seems that the 
              Football Association's push for better discipline will include Rooney's 
              charge.</p>
              <p>An FA statement read: "The FA has charged Manchester 
              United's Wayne Rooney for the use of offensive, insulting and / or 
              abusive language. This charge relates to an incident during his side's 
              fixture with West Ham United at the Boleyn Ground on Saturday 2 April 
              2011."</p>
              <p>Rooney has until 18.00 BST on April 5 to respond to the 
              charge. If he pleads or is found guilty then he will face a two-match 
              ban, which may include the weekend clash with Fulham and next Saturday's
               FA Cup semi-final with Manchester City.</p>
              <p>The England forward's 
              formal apology for his outburst, which he claimed came "in the heat of 
              the moment" insisted that his words were "not aimed at anyone in 
              particular".</p>

              <p>Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney has admitted a charge of using offensive, insulting and/or abusive

              <p>Rooney swore at a <em>Sky Sports</em> camera during Manchester United's 4-2 victory at West Ham on Saturday 
              after he had completed his hat-trick from the penalty spot.</p>
              <p>His 
              appeal against the automatic two-match ban suspension will be heard on 
              Wednesday, before Manchester United play Chelsea in the quarter-finals 
              of the Champions League.</p>
              <p>A statement on the FA's website read: 
              "Manchester United player Wayne Rooney has today admitted a charge for 
              the use of offensive, insulting and/or abusive language.</p>
              <p>"However,
               Rooney has submitted a claim that the automatic penalty of two games is
               clearly excessive. A commission will hear the submission on Wednesday."</p>
              <p>If
               Rooney's claim fails he runs the risk of having a suspension that 
              currently includes Saturday's Premier League encounter with Fulham and 
              the following week's FA Cup semi-final with Manchester City at Wembley 
              extended.</p>
              <p>At his press conference ahead of the Chelsea clash, 
              Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson made it clear he did not want 
              to discuss the matter.</p>
              <p>"I have nothing to say. I am not going to discuss it at all,'' he said. "We have submitted our case.''</p>

              <h1 class="h2">PFA questions Rooney charge</h1>
              <p>Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) chief executive Gordon 
              Taylor has questioned the Football Association's decision to charge 
              Wayne Rooney for swearing into a TV camera after his hat-trick against
              West Ham.</p>
              <div class="sp-inlinePhoto">
              <p class="photoDesc"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><strong><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/902689/two-match-ban-for-west-ham-manager-avram-grant?cc=5739"></a></strong></p>
              <p>Rooney
               was charged with using abusive language for the 'F-word' that was 
              caught on camera as he celebrated his hat-trick against West Ham and has
               until 1800 BST on Tuesday to indicate whether he will accept the charge
               - which would carry a two-match ban - or appeal against it.</p>
              <p>But, as he could miss out on the FA Cup tie with Manchester City, he has been given the backing of the PFA.</p>
              <p>''Whilst
               the use of foul and abusive language is not condoned, there
              is an acceptance by all parties within the game that 'industrial 
              language' is
              commonly used,'' Taylor said in a statement on the PFA website. ''It 
              becomes an issue when directed towards match officials. However, when 
              used in a spontaneous way in celebration or frustration then it is not 
              normally expected to merit a sanction.</p>
              <p>''If sanctions are to be imposed in such circumstances then this has to be done
              in a balanced and consistent manner, and participants made aware of this
              fundamental change in approach.''</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, deputy chief executive Bobby Barnes has told <em>ESPNsoccernet</em> that Rooney needs to be understood, not persecuted.</p>
              <p>"I am not Wayne Rooney's apologist,'' Barnes told <em>ESPNsoccernet</em>.
               "I am not condoning what he did, and of course what he did is far from 
              ideal as there are a lot of kids up and down the country watching and 
              players have responsibilities.</p>
              <p>"But you have to bear in mind what a
               horrible year this boy has had. It is almost a year to the day that he 
              was injured in Munich and it has been an awful time for him, he has 
              struggled on the field and had a lot of issues off the field.</p>
              <p>"Having gone through all of that ... this was a release of all the pressure.''</p>
              <p>Barnes
               maintained that a player like Rooney, who is constantly in the 
              spotlight, has to be given more leeway instead of being punished and 
              that a two-match ban is "disproportionate''.</p>
              <p>"It is often 
              misunderstood the sort of pressure a player like Wayne Rooney is 
              under,'' he said. ''It is always talked about the money these type of 
              players earn, but it is not about the money, it is about not having the 
              success, not living up to the extraordinary high expectations, it is 
              almost a fear of failure.</p>
              <p>"That is why it was such a release of 
              pressure, enormous pressures on this young man's shoulders over a whole 
              year. Obviously it was not an ideal way to react, but while I would 
              never condone it, I can understand it, and a two-match ban is totally 
              disproportionate.</p>
              <p>"It is unprecedented that the FA has taken 
              action after a player has said something into a TV camera. This is 
              totally different to what Didier Drogba did in the Champions League. He 
              followed the referee, and was sorry for his actions afterwards.</p>
              <p>"Wayne
               has not been disrespectful to any official or opponent, and I feel 
              there has been a lot of discussion about what might happen next season. 
              But the game needs to set parameters so everyone knows where they stand:
               for example, if you take your shirt off, you know you will be booked.</p>
              <p>"There
               is no precedent for this, and Rooney needs to be treated differently.  I
               would suggest a severe reprimand and suspended sentence, but surely not
               a two-game ban when he was clearly not intending to cause offense and 
              apologised immediately afterwards.</p>
              <p>"No one is saying what he did was right, I am not, but let's give Wayne Rooney a little bit of understanding.''</p>

              <p>Rooney
                   was handed the suspension by the FA after swearing into a television 
                  camera following the penalty kick that completed his hat-trick against 
                  West Ham which completed a turnaround from a two-goal deficit.</p>
              <p>The striker will miss Saturday's Premier League game against Fulham as well as the FA Cup semi-final against City next weekend.</p>
              <p>Rooney
                   said through his spokesman, Ian Monk: "I am gutted to miss two matches,
                   one of which is an FA Cup semi-final at Wembley.  I am not the first 
                  player to have sworn on TV and I won't be the last.</p>
              <p>"Unlike 
                  others who have been caught swearing on camera, I apologised 
                  immediately. And yet I am the only person banned for swearing. That 
                  doesn't seem right."</p>
              <p>United decided against contesting the charge 
                  itself, with Rooney having already publicly apologised for his 
                  behaviour, but they challenged the length of the suspension.</p>
              <p>A 
                  statement issued by the FA read: "A Regulatory Commission has suspended 
                  Manchester United's Wayne Rooney for two matches. Rooney had admitted a 
                  charge for the use of offensive, insulting and / or abusive language, 
                  but claimed that the automatic penalty of two games was clearly 
                  excessive. 
                   
                  "The Commission did not accept the claim and Rooney will begin the 
                  standard two match suspension with immediate effect. The charge relates 
                  to an incident during his side's fixture with West Ham United at the 
                  Boleyn Ground on Saturday 2 April 2011."</p>
              <p>United responded on their
                   official website: "Manchester United is clearly very disappointed with 
                  the Regulatory Commission's decision. The Club put forward a very strong
                   case to have the punishment reduced, which was unsuccessful.</p>
              <p>"Wayne
                   Rooney apologised immediately after the match and the Club now wishes 
                  to move to on to what hopefully will be a very exciting conclusion to 
                  the season."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>FA had done a "wonderful" job on this.. they had create a own rule even though this rule that swearing words at the camera with no pointing to anyone is not inside =).. even PFA accept with rooney apology and a fine at rooney can clear the case.. with or without rooney, Man Utd will prove FA wrong by winning a derby match =)</p>

              <p class="art-txt-first">Wayne Rooney is "gutted" to miss the FA Cup semi-final after the FA upheld a ban that the Manchester United striker says "doesn't seem right".</p>
              <p>The Football Association confirmed on Thursday morning that the forward must serve a two-match suspension, meaning Rooney will sit out Saturday's Premier League encounter with Fulham at Old Trafford, plus the eagerly-anticipated FA Cup semi-final with Manchester City at Wembley on April 16.</p>
              <p>And the 25-year-old, who scored the only goal in United's Champions League quarter-final triumph over Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night, is clearly not happen.</p>
              <p>In a statement issued through his spokesman Ian Monk, Rooney said: "I am gutted to miss two matches, one of which is an FA Cup semi-final at Wembley.</p>
              <p>"I am not the first player to have sworn on TV and I won't be the last.</p>
              <p>"Unlike others who have been caught swearing on camera, I apologised immediately. And yet I am the only person banned for swearing. That doesn't seem right.</p>
              <p>"Whatever, I have to accept that what's happened has happened and move on from here. That is what I intend to do."</p>
              <p>Rooney has been joined in his disappointment by United, whose manager Sir Alex Ferguson only needed to look back to the last Manchester derby in February, which the striker settled with a sensational overhead kick, for the impact he will be missing at Wembley.</p>
              <p>"Manchester United is clearly very disappointed with the decision," said a statement issued by the Old Trafford outfit.</p>
              <p>"The club put forward a very strong case to have the punishment reduced, which was unsuccessful.</p>
              <p>"Wayne apologised immediately after the match and the club now wishes to move to on to what hopefully will be a very exciting conclusion to the season."</p>

              <p><strong>Wayne Rooney’s swearing ban has sparked a revolt among Premier League referees.</strong></p>
              <p>In a bizarre new twist, they claim match official Lee Mason was put under pressure to write a report that would enable the FA to charge the Manchester United striker.</p>
              <p>Mason’s admission he would have sent off the England star for swearing at a TV camera after scoring against West Ham had he been aware of the incident, was the spark for Rooney to be charged.</p>
              <p>The two-match banwhich followed was upheld yesterday and Rooney says he is “gutted” to be missing the Premier League game with Fulham and FA Cup semi-final against Manchester City.</p>
              
              <div class="news_mpu_article"></div>
              <p>There is anger among Mason’s refereeing colleagues who insist he was ‘used’ by the FA who wanted Rooney to be charged – but wanted the referee to review his decision and come up with the conclusion that led to a ban.</p>
              <p>A source close to the row said: “Lee should not have been put on the spot like this. If the FA wanted to ban Rooney they should have done it themselves.</p>
              <p>“There is no way one of the senior refs would have sent him off for that or said they would when they reviewed it. Lee was put in a terrible position.</p>
              <p>“This has caused real anger. There has not been a reaction like it before. We all feel for him and think he should have been protected – not hung out to dry.”</p>
              <p>Senior refs felt that the FA should have simply charged Rooney rather than put the onus on the match official and have complained to their chief Mike Riley that he should have offered more protection to Mason.</p>
