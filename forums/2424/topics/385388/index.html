              <p><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=21931"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Patrice Evra</span></a> will help roll out the Old Trafford welcome mat for <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=8880"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">David Beckham</span></a> - and then try to boot the former Manchester United star out of the Champions League.</p>
              <p>Beckham's return to United with AC Milan will dominate minds for the next two months. It will be the former England captain's first return visit to the club he served with such distinction before leaving in 2003 after <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=30"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></a> tired of his love of the limelight.</p>
              <p>Although the pair have since patched up their differences, and shook hands in public ahead of United's meeting with Inter Milan at the San Siro 12 months ago, the competitive edge of both men will ensure a highly-charged last-16 tie.</p>
              <p>Evra did not join United until two and a half years after Beckham had left to join Real Madrid, but is well aware of Beckham's status and will reserve the warmest of welcomes for a man he will probably end up marking in the first leg at the San Siro on February 16, with the return leg at Old Trafford three weeks later. However, that is where the kindness will end.</p>
              <p>"I am very happy for David Beckham,'' said the France full back. "He did a lot of great things for Manchester United and I want to say to him ''welcome home'.</p>
              <p>"I have met him. He is a gentleman. He is a good person and a good professional. This is why Milan wanted him to go back there. I like that type of player. He is still one of the best right-footed players in the world. But I hope he plays badly and I intend to make sure he doesn't do very well.''</p>
              <p>The match could also be the first time Ronaldinho has played against United since he rejected them when Ferguson had tied up a deal for the Brazilian to become Beckham's replacement.</p>
              <p>And it will have not escaped any United fan's attention that the seven-time European Cup winners have beaten them in all four two-legged ties between the sides, including three semi-finals.</p>
              <p>The last one, a 3-0 drubbing in 2007, remains the last time United have lost a European away game, and cost them a final meeting with Liverpool. Yet Evra believes that defeat spurred the Red Devils on to reach the last two finals.</p>
              <p>"That was a frustrating year,'' he said. "We didn't play well in the first leg, even though we won 3-2. I was suspended for the second game and watched it on TV. It was horrible to lose like that but after that game we had a lot more experience.</p>
              <p>"The year afterwards we won the Champions League. The following year we reached the final. Now we are still using that experience and we have enough to win this game.''</p>
              <p>Beckham though will remain the central figure. All the famous incidents, from the goals and the glory to the infamous day of the flying boot at Old Trafford, will be raked over.</p>
              <p>"Who can say whether it will help or not the fact that all the focus will be on him,'' Evra added. "After all, when we played against Barcelona it was all Messi v Ronaldo. For us it is normal. The pressure is normal. I am more interested in playing against AC Milan than David Beckham.</p>
              <p>"What I do know is that our confidence is high. For us, the target every year is to reach the final, and from there to win it.''</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, AC Milan organisational manager Umberto Gandini is confident the Rossoneri can repeat their 2007 semi-final victory over United.</p>
              <p>He told <em>Eurosport</em>: "It's a difficult tie, we know that but we can be boosted by the result the last time we played them. That year we went on to win the competition.</p>
              <p>"They are still two great teams but they are very different to 2007. Now there is no Kaka, no (Cristiano) Ronaldo and no (Paolo) Maldini."</p>
              <p>On Beckham's return, he said: "It's a great occasion for David, who will be playing for us from January, to go back to Old Trafford to play against Manchester United for the first time."</p>
              <p>Milan coach Leonardo said: "I think it'll be a beautiful, extraordinary match. These are great matches to play, to experience in every sense. In this case there is Beckham's situation, which is a very beautiful thing for him and for us. Every clash has its ingredients that can contribute to making it more beautiful.</p>
              <p>"These meetings give extra colour to the great clashes, with (Karim) Benzema going back to (Olympique) Lyon, (Zlatan) Ibrahimovic meeting Inter again and Kaka meeting Milan again (in the group stage), (Jose) Mourinho against Chelsea again.</p>
              <p>"I think they're a team of great tradition with the same objectives that we have and we'll play on level terms. They're a great team, of course."</p>

              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Patrice Evra insists Manchester United must secure maximum points from their festive fixtures as they look to make up lost ground at the top.</span><span><span id="intelliTXT">Â </span></span></p>
              <p>Two defeats in three games has left United four points adrift of leaders Chelsea, who have hardly been in the best of form themselves.</p>
              <p>As Sir Alex Ferguson's men are not in action again until they visit Hull on December 27, the chances are things will get worse before they get better.</p>
              <p>But Evra is remaining optimistic.</p>
              <p>The Frenchman feels three points at the KC Stadium plus another victory against Wigan at Old Trafford on December 30 will put the Red Devils right back in the hunt ahead of a mini break, when cup football takes over.</p>
              <p>"It's a crucial time," he said.</p>
              <p>"We lost against Aston Villa and Fulham but the target is to win every game we can from now on.</p>
              <p>"We always do well in this period and now, more than ever, we need victories."</p>
              <p>It hardly needs to be stated where United's problems lie.</p>
              <p>Ferguson had eight senior defenders missing at Craven Cottage and was forced to deploy a back three that included rookie Ritchie De Laet.</p>
              <p>Although it does not completely explain why they were so bad against Bobby Zamora and company, it does provide a starting point.</p>
              <p>Yet, shoved into a position he has no experience in, Evra actually thinks Michael Carrick has done quite well.</p>
              <p>"He has quality," said Evra.</p>
              <p>"He doesn't have to play all season at the back but he can do it for some games."</p>
              <p>From past statements, Gary Neville's groin injury is expected to be the quickest to heal of United's various ailments.</p>
              <p>Whether that comes it time for Sunday is open to doubt, which means Evra will have to carry on talking to the men around him.</p>
              <p>Evra said: "I try to give experience at the back and make sure we all speak to each other.</p>
              <p>"It's not easy but we have a strong squad, and you have to be able to play anywhere to win the title."</p>
