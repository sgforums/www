            <div class='col-md body'>Giuseppe Rossi could spend the season on loan at Newcastle if the move is deemed beneficial to his development.<br><br>The 19-year-old has yet to train with his new Magpies team-mates as he is with the Italian Under21 team preparing to take on Austria in their European Championship qualifier.<br><br>Initially, the deal with Newcastle sees Rossi remain at St JamesÂ’ Park until 1 January, but the agreement will be reviewed nearer that date, with the possibility of extending it.<br><br>"I know I will definitely be a Newcastle player until January,Â” the Reds youngster said. Â“But we will look at it again before then and discuss whether I will stay for the whole season. It was decided that it would help me and Newcastle if I was to go there on loan and this was the best solution for me. I will have more opportunities to play with Newcastle.Â”<br><br>The former Parma youngster said there was no interest from Serie A clubs, when asked by Italian journalists. And, even if there had been, he felt staying in England was the right choice.<br><br>Â“No Italian clubs came in for me but I preferred to stay in England anyway because I am settled and I know the style of football. I like being in England.Â”<br><br>Rossi will be unavailable for Newcastle when Glenn Roeder's side visit Old Trafford on 1 October as Premier League rules state loaned players cannot play against their own club.<br><br><a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=360577" rel="nofollow">http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&amp;newsid=360577</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wayne Rooney sought the advice of former West Ham youngsters Michael Carrick and Joe Cole to ensure Giuseppe Rossi is in good hands under Newcastle boss Glenn Roeder.<br><br>Rooney rates his Reds team-mate highly, so much so he believes the tiny Italian to be the club's most clinical finisher. However, the 19-year-old needs regular Premiership football, so he will spend at least four months on loan at St James' Park.<br><br>Roeder helped develop a clutch of current Premiership stars when he worked with the Upton Park club's academy, and was given glowing tributes from his former charges.<br><br>"I have talked to the likes of Michael Carrick and Joe Cole about the way Glenn Roeder brought them through at West Ham and the feeling at Old Trafford is that Giuseppe is in good hands with Newcastle," said Rooney.<br><br>Rossi, who was on Italian Under-21 international duty this week, should make his Magpies debut against Fulham this weekend. And Rooney is convinced he will be a hit at St James' Park.<br><br>"Giuseppe is a great player and one to watch out for," he added. "His touch, feel of the ball and awareness are brilliant. He is perhaps the best finisher at United and will only get better."</div>
