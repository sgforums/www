              <h3>CARLOS TEVEZ is prepared to reduce his pay demands to ensure his move to Manchester United is completed in the summer. </h3>
              <p>It has been claimed United are reluctant to pay £30 million to Media Sport Investments, who hold the Argentinian striker's registration. But Tevez is so desperate for the deal to be done he has told his advisers to lower their asking price so he can sign a new five-year contract.</p>
              <h4>Loan</h4>
              <p>And he is prepared to accept wages of around £70,000 a week rather than push for the £120,000 paid to United's top earners Rio Ferdinand and Cristiano Ronaldo. </p>
              <p>Tevez's loan deal with United runs out in June and both Real Madrid and Manchester City have been tempting him with £100,000-plus a week offers. But Tevez said: "I cannot think of any team except United. I do not want to play with any other team. "The United fans love me and my family is very happy both in Manchester and in England.</p>
              <h4>Heart</h4>
              <p>"My thoughts are only about winning titles with United and I hope I will still be here next season. "I always follow my heart, and my heart is telling me it will be impossible for me to leave English football." </p>
              <p>Tevez has often had to settle for a place on the sidelines since the arrival of Dimitar Berbatov at Old Trafford. But with Berbatov injured and Wayne Rooney suspended, Tevez will be pressed into action against Aston Villa today - even though he only got back from World Cup duty in Bolivia late on Friday.</p>
              <h4>Late</h4>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson is confident Tevez will be fit for action - though he categorically refuses to discuss the striker's future. </p>
              <p>The United boss said: "Tevez is used to coming home late from long trips. He did it for us last season. He came back on the Friday and played on the Saturday and was outstanding." </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>Rooney will be available for Tuesday's Champions League clash with Porto. And England's man of the moment will be straining at the leash to return.</strong></p>
              <p>Rooney said: "I obviously want the team to do well, and it's a pleasure for me to watch United play, but I'd always prefer to be out on the pitch."</p>
              <h4>Exit</h4>
              <p>Ferguson will be on his guard against Porto, having suffered a stunning Champions League exit at the hands of the Portuguese champions five years ago when Jose Mourinho was in charge. And he has called on United Academy player Evandro Brandao to give him the lowdown on Porto. </p>
              <p>Portuguese winger Brandao, 17, is a Porto fan. And he has shown United's first-team squad the dangers of Givanildo Vieira de Souza, the muscular Brazilian known as The Hulk. </p>
              <p>Brandao said: "I showed them some videos of The Hulk and they were impressed. Nobody knew him but now they all say he's Porto's best player. </p>
              <p>"No one forgets what happened five years ago. I know for the United dressing-room this is a case of settling old scores."</p>
