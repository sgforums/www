              <h1>Hargreaves visits top US surgeon</h1>
              <p><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/45141000/jpg/_45141877_harg_getty2_226.jpg" border="0" alt="Owen Hargreaves" width="226" height="170"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="first"><strong>Owen Hargreaves is in America visiting Dr Richard Steadman in a bid to cure a knee problem that has dogged him during his Manchester United career.</strong></p>
              <p>Hargreaves has made just 37 appearances for United since his reported £18m move from Bayern Munich in July 2007. Injections have failed to rid the 27-year-old midfielder of pain and Sir Alex Ferguson wants to find a solution.</p>
              <p>"We have been trying to manage the situation but that has not given us an answer," said the United boss. "In the past 10 days we have sent him to a specialist in Sweden and one in London. There has been no real answer there so now he is in Colorado to see Dr Steadman.</p>
              <p>"We are trying to get to the root of it. We have been frustrated and patient but we really need to speed that up now. "That is why we have sent him to the best available people to try and get a general opinion about where we go from here."</p>
              <p>Dr Steadman can count Ruud van Nistelrooy and Michael Owen among his high-profile clients and now United hope he can cure Hargreaves's recurring tendinitis problem.</p>
              <p>The Canadian-born Englishman was able to play in last season's Champions League final triumph over Chelsea, but the problem resurfaced in the summer and he has featured just three times this season.</p>
              <p>Ferguson admitted it is frustrating for both the player and the club, but hopes his visit to see Dr Steadman will provide a solution to the long-standing injury, despite the American specialising in cruciate ligament injuries.</p>
              <p>"He started his career working with skiers," said Ferguson. "Because he has dealt with so many knee injuries, he has obviously acquired a great knowledge. "He is not associated with this type of injury but the boy has gone on for too long just hoping injections will do the trick."</p>
