              <p><strong>Ruud van Nistelrooy expects Cristiano Ronaldo to remain at Manchester United - and believes Real Madrid's preparations for the new season have been hampered by constant speculation surrounding the winger.</strong></p>
              </strong></div>
              <div>
              <p>Whether or not the winger will follow Van Nistelrooy's path from Manchester United to the Bernabeu has been the hottest topic of sporting debate in Britain and Spain this summer.</p>
              <p>Real coach Bernd Schuster yesterday admitted that the club have not given up hope of luring Ronaldo to the Bernabeu. But whatever happens to his most prized asset, Ferguson can seemingly rest assured that the protracted saga has had the effect of destabilising one of his club's biggest rivals for this season's Champions League crown.</p>
              <p>'It got a bit too far maybe, it is such an issue at the moment in Spain. It gets a bit over the top,' Van Nistelrooy told <em>Radio Five Live</em>.</p>
              <p>'A couple of our players, they made the comment that there was only talk about him and not about the current team and stars, and everybody's waiting for the next rumour without anything concrete.'</p>
              <p>Asked whether he expected Ronaldo to stay at Old Trafford for the forthcoming campaign, the Dutchman added: 'I think so, if you hear the statements from United. It doesn't really sound like they'll let him go.'</p>

              <p>Before on Saturday's opening game against Juventus, some sections of the Emirates Stadium faithful had let their frustrations be known, which manager Arsene Wenger later described as 'disappointed love'.</p>
              <p>However, the 6ft 3ins striker was all smiles again as he converted a penalty five minutes into the second half - and kissed the badge in celebration with the fans behind the goal.</p>

              <h1>Ruud: Nobody Bigger Than United</h1>
              <p>Ronaldo has been gunning for a mega-money move to the Santiago Bernabeu
              all summer, but Ferguson has remained steadfast in his refusal to let
              the 23-year-old leave Old Trafford.<br><br>The United boss has shown no
              such possessiveness with his superstars in the past, having ousted the
              likes of Paul Ince and David Beckham as soon as they got too big for
              their boots.<br><br>Van Nistelrooy was another to leave the Red Devils after falling out with Ferguson. <br><br>Many
              criticised the Scot's decision to sell the Dutch poacher, who scored
              150 goals in 201 games during his time in England. However, United have
              won two Premier League crowns and a European Cup since his departure,
              thoroughly vindicating the manager's stance.<br><br>Hence, the
              32-year-old understands that Ferguson will do whatever is best for the
              club - and if that means keeping Ronaldo, then that is what will
              happen, according to the <em>Oranje</em> star.<br><br>"In those
              meetings, if he wants to keep the player he’ll do everything he can to
              do so and he’ll probably succeed as well," Van Nistelrooy said on <em>Five Live’s Sportsweek</em>.<br><br>"What he is doing is in the interests of Manchester United. That’s what he always thinks of.<br><br>"Nobody is bigger than the club and it’s true. Will Ronaldo stay at United? I think so."</p>
