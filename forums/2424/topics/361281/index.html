              Sir Alex Ferguson fell out with his late father at the start of his career in professional football. They didnâ€™t speak for months after Alex Snr took umbrage at his teenage sonâ€™s headstrong impatience to make the grade with Queenâ€™s Park in Glasgow. 
              
              The rift was soon healed, of course, but now, at the other end of his remarkable 50-year career in the game, Ferguson wishes only for one last chance to impress a man whom he dubbed â€” with or without irony â€” â€˜Old Thunder Faceâ€™. 
              
              Asked this week about the opportunity to win his third Champions League final in Rome against Barcelona on Wednesday, Manchester Unitedâ€™s manager eschewed the opportunity to make comparisons between himself and Bob Paisley, the great Liverpool manager of the 1970s.
              
              Instead, Ferguson said only: â€˜I just wish my father was alive. He wouldâ€™ve loved to have seen me achieve that.â€™ 
              
              Such is Fergusonâ€™s regrettable mistrust of the modern media, it is rare that, at 67, he offers any great insight into what drives him. 
              
              Nevertheless, even Ferguson is not immune to the flushes of sentiment prompted by moments of supreme achievement. And briefly this week he allowed himself to look back and acknowledge the debt he owes to his late parents, Alex and Lizzie. 
              
              â€˜I think you have the personality you are born with but then that personality grows up,â€™ said Ferguson. â€˜You have your own personality. Itâ€™s difficult to say what you are getting, it is something you are born with. Itâ€™s in your genes. 
              
              â€˜My father was very quiet. My mother was the one with the real determination. My father was a hard-working man, who just read books. He was always reading.â€™ 
              
              In his autobiography, Ferguson thanked his father for passing on â€˜his intelligenceâ€™, as well as acknowledging the â€˜temper and stubbornnessâ€™ that came as part of the deal. 
              
              This intelligence, he conceded, has been allowed to develop over the course of his 23 years at Old Trafford. Only on the securing of the clubâ€™s first Premier League title in 1993, however, did Ferguson feel the confidence to really benefit from it. 
              
              â€˜Yes, I have changed,â€™ he acknowledged. â€˜Maturity brings a different type of person. How would I put it? 
              
              â€˜Well, Iâ€™m far more intelligent than when I first started. The best way to sum it up is that now I am in control. When I first came, I was never in control.
              
              â€˜You canâ€™t be in control when you are not winning. Itâ€™s only when you have success that you can get that control. That applies to every coach who goes into a football club. He will never have control until he is successful. If you donâ€™t have success, then for control you may as well go to Mars.
              
              â€˜I first got control when I won the Premier League for the first time. Iâ€™d achieved what I set out to achieve. 
              
              â€˜I felt also at the time it would open the door and that we would leap forward in every department of the club because that was the millstone round everyoneâ€™s neck. We hadnâ€™t won it in 26 years and it was a burden, absolutely no doubt. 
              
              â€˜The previous year weâ€™d lost it to Leeds, when we had to play four games in six days. That cost us when we should have won it. 
              
              â€˜But the funny thing about adversity is that some people thrive on it. This club thrives on it and we showed it that year.â€™ 
              
              Like many men of reasonable intellect, Ferguson has a long memory. He doesnâ€™t forget. One of the reasons â€” some imagined and some real â€” for his dislike of the media is the manner in which the majority, this correspondent included, wrote him off when his team finished bottom of their Champions League qualifying group in the miserable winter of 2005. 
              
              Ferguson has not forgotten, and why should he? 
              
              Asked again about comparisons with the greats such as Paisley, he said: â€˜Itâ€™s one of those things that I donâ€™t pay much attention to. 
              
              â€˜Whenever there is a bit of success it leads to more expectation, and then youâ€™re into that kick in the teeth, when you see another headline that reads: â€œFerguson is finishedâ€�.
              
              â€˜Next it will be that my shelf-life is gone, itâ€™s time to get the bathchair out for me at Torquay beach.
              
              â€˜Thatâ€™s why I donâ€™t pay too much attention to it because I know what the flipside is.
              
              â€˜If you have a couple of bad results, you see whatâ€™s happened to Arsene Wenger. I find that incredible. Itâ€™s unfortunate that weâ€™re in that culture where if youâ€™re not winning every game then, swoosh, you are gone.â€™ 
              
              In common with other great leaders, Ferguson remains fuelled by â€” among other things â€” a desire to please some people and prove others wrong. He continues to believe that the world is against him, that the dice are loaded. 
              
              If he wins another European Cup, though, he will surely cement his position as British footballâ€™s greatest post-war manager. Paisley won his first in the same Rome stadium, against Borussia Moenchengladbach in 1977, and the Eternal City would be the perfect place for Ferguson to lift his third.
              
              Were he alive, Paisley â€” himself an expert at regenerating his teams â€” would have been impressed. Ferguson, though, would have preferred the opportunity to seek approval from much closer to home.
