              <p>Michael Owen was on the mark again as Manchester United wrapped up the Malaysian leg of their Far East tour with another comfortable win.</p>
              <p>Owen got United's second against a Malaysia XI, just two minutes after Federico Macheda's 11th-minute opener, which proved to be the end of the scoring for United, despite their domination.</p>
              <p>Anderson and Nani both wasted decent opportunities near the end.</p>
              <p>And, despite the supposedly friendly nature of the contest, Wayne Rooney had plenty of fire in him as he reacted badly to a penalty area challenge when really he would have been better advised to let the matter rest.</p>
              <p>Given the humid conditions, it was hardly a surprise Sir Alex Ferguson fielded an entirely different starting line-up to the one he named for the first game between the teams on Saturday.</p>
              <p>On that occasion, Owen grabbed the late winner to save his side's blushes in a less-than-convincing 3-2 win.</p>
              <p>This time around, the former Liverpool striker scored the second, showing his usual predatory instincts after the home defence had made a woeful attempt at clearing a Zoran Tosic cross.</p>
              <p>While no-one could doubt the enthusiasm of the home supporters, around 30,000 turned out at just 48 hours notice for a game hastily arranged after the Jakarta terrorist attack last Friday ruled out a planned visit to Indonesia, the opposition was not of high quality.</p>
              <p>Better will be expected of FC Seoul on Friday, by which time United's fitness levels will have improved as a result of the training they have done in such intense heat.</p>
              <p>Owen is certainly enjoying himself, and came close to grabbing his second when he met a low Tosic cross with a near-post flick that cannoned off the inside of a post.</p>
              <p>Another forward with a desire to impress is Macheda, who made such a huge impression when he was introduced to senior ranks last term.</p>
              <p>Now handed the coveted fourth striking berth following the exits of Cristiano Ronaldo and Carlos Tevez, the 17-year-old needs to prove he has the consistency to be an effective Premier League operator at such a young age.</p>
              <p>There was plenty to be admired about the calm way he finished off a Ryan Giggs cross to open United's account just two minutes before Owen found the net.</p>
              <p>Darron Gibson was one of those to impress, showing why Ferguson has handed him a new contract.</p>
              <p>Wes Brown was the only man to complete a full 90 minutes, although the England star will probably be happy with that given the injury torment he went through last term, when a foot problem effectively wrecked his season.</p>
              <p>There was still no goal for Dimitar Berbatov though as the Bulgarian nodded a free header straight at Mohammed Farizal Marlias.</p>
              <p>And Anderson, who has never scored for United, missed another decent chance near the end.</p>

              <p><strong>Malaysia XI 0 United 2</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Michael Owen struck his second United goal in as many games as the Reds completed the double over the Malaysian XI with a comprehensive 2-0 victory.<br><br></strong>Owen blasted home from close range on 13 minutes after capitalising on a loose ball inside the area having played his part in the build-up. Two minutes earlier Federico Macheda had opening the scoring with calm finish following Darren Fletcher’s set-up.<br><br>In truth, the Reds could have had more – substitutes Rooney, Berbatov and Anderson all went close late on in the second half, but it was certainly another useful work-out for Sir Alex’s men.<br><br>Jonny Evans was the only survivor from Saturday’s starting line-up against the same opposition with Sir Alex opting to give everyone some minutes on the clock. Ben Foster, a second half substitute in the first match, kept his place in goal, while Gary Neville, Wes Brown, Jonny Evans and Fabio made up the back four. Darren Fletcher and Michael Carrick both returned from minor knocks to take up right side and central midfield positions respectively. Ryan Giggs partnered Carrick in the centre with Zoran Tosic out on the left flank. Matchwinner Michael Owen started his first match for the Reds alongside Federico Macheda up front.<br><br>There was a minute’s silence before kick-off in tribute to those who lost their lives in Friday’s bombings in Indonesia, the country, of course, where United should have been playing their second tour match.<br><br>Following Saturday’s impressive display, the home side were understandably full of confidence with goalscoring hero Yahyah getting the</p>
              <p>loudest cheers whenever he touched the ball. Another big favourite, Reds’ veteran Ryan Giggs, thrilled the partisan crowd with a host of tricks and flicks, alongside some exquisite close control, movement and vision, and it was he who orchestrated United’s first major venture forward on six minutes. A lovely one-two with Fletcher resulted in the Scot collecting possession on the right flank, but his lovely curling cross was just taken off the head of Macheda by Malaysia goalkeeper Marlias.<br><br>There was nothing Marlias could do to stop the young Italian from giving United the lead on 11 minutes. Fabio cut in from the left and whipped in a low right-foot cross towards Macheda whose speculative flick found the unmarked Fletcher on the right side of the area. The shot looked on, but he unselfishly chose to square the ball to Macheda who took a touch to set himself, before blasting home from close range.<br><br>Two minutes later United doubled their advantage. Owen found the lively Tosic on the left wing and although his low centre was initially missed by Macheda, it rebounded off Mazlizam and into the path of Owen, who had followed the ball into the area, and he made no mistake from three yards as he lashed past Marlias.<br><br>While the hosts struggled to conjure any real attacks, United continued to look dangerous going forward with Macheda and Owen linking up well. And the latter went close to grabbing his second of the match in the cheekiest of fashions on 33 minutes. Another low whipped cross from the left by Tosic was instinctively flicked goalwards by Owen who was hugely unlucky to see the ball bounce back off the far post and</p>
              <p>into Marlias’ grasp.<br><br>United made just one change at the break with Tomasz Kuszczak replacing Foster in goal. The Pole was almost thrust into action immediately when a low punt upfield nearly set Yahyah away, but Wes Brown stood strong to hold off the midfielder and clear the danger.<br><br>It wasn’t long before Kuszczak’s opposite number was called into action, but he once again showed great awareness and speed as he raced off his line to intercept a lovely through ball towards Owen from Giggs.<br><br>As expected, a string of substitutions ensued either side of the hour with Dimitar Berbatov, John O’Shea, Rio Ferdinand and Nani replacing Owen, Neville, Evans and Tosic respectively. A barrage of acclaim greeted the introduction of Wayne Rooney soon after and the striker went close to sending the decibel level through the roof two minute later when he collected a long ball over the top from Wes Brown. Unfortunately, he dragged his left-foot shot wide of Marlias’ goal.<br><br>Anderson, Paul Scholes and Darron Gibson were next to join proceedings with the fresh legs bringing a fresh impetus to United’s play, as well as a raft of decent chances. Just seconds after coming on, Gibson saw his low shot from the right edge of the area deflected out for a corner following Berbatov’s neat set-up. The Bulgarian should have done better with a free header from Nani’s right-wing cross soon after, while Nani was next to test the Malaysia stopper with a low drive.<br><br>Rooney fired into the side netting on 76 minutes after cutting in from the left, while Anderson, still searching for</p>
              <div class="newsStory">
              <p>his first United goal (both in a competitive and non-competitive sense), flashed a rising shot wide of Marlias’ right upright after being found well by O’Shea.<br><br>Despite United’s dominance, the Malaysians refused to give up hope and were unlucky not to get themselves on the scoresheet in the final minutes. After Brown had made a brilliant interception as Shakir bore down on goal, Kuszczak was relieved to see Muhymeen’s right wing cross evade the same player seconds later. A well struck shot from Talaha followed, but was expertedly palmed away by Kuszczak.<br><br>It was a lively ending to an entertaining 90 minutes as United held firm for the victory and clean sheet.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Team Line-ups</span><br>United</strong>: Foster (Kuszczak 46); Neville (O’Shea 62), Brown, J.Evans (Ferdinand 62), Fabio (Evra 58); Fletcher (Anderson 69), Carrick (Gibson 70), Giggs (Scholes 69), Tosic (Nani 62); Owen (Berbatov 62), Macheda (Rooney 67).</p>

              <h1>Ferguson: Malaysia Need To Learn From South Korea, Japan</h1>
              <h2>The veteran Scot has some words of advice for his south-east Asian hosts.</h2>
              <p>Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson has told Malaysia
              that it needs to follow the examples set by South Korea and Japan if it wants
              to improve its domestic leagues and national team.<br><br>The English champions have faced the south-east Asians twice in
              the past three days, winning 3-2 and then 2-0. 
              <br><br>Malaysia were the region’s top dogs in the 1970s but
              have since struggled to hold their own. They have slipped down the rankings and
              are currently listed as the 157th best team in the world by FIFA.
              <br><br>Speaking after the second of the two wins on Monday
              evening, the Scot advised his hosts to look to the big leagues in the east for
              continental inspiration.
              <br><br>“The Malaysians have the ability, but they should look at the leagues in Japan
              and South Korea to produce better quality players,” Ferguson told reporters in
              Kuala Lumpur.
              <br><br>“They had some chances to score in the second half, but they lack the killer
              instinct to finish it, and at this level, you need only that one chance to make
              the difference in the game.”<br><br>The
              English champions will get a chance to see just how good South Korea's
              league is when they face leaders FC Seoul on Friday evening in the
              penultimate match of their Asian <span class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;"><span style="color: #0464d1;"><span class="kLink" style="color: #0464d1 ! important; font-family: Verdana,Arial; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">tour</span></span></span>.<br><em><strong><br>Goal.com</strong></em></p>
