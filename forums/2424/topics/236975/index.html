            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.teamtalk.com//Images/96254.jpg"><br><br><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson has predicted Manchester United's title destiny will be determined by their six remaining away matches.</strong><br><br>Having maintained their six-point lead over Chelsea in unconvincing fashion with a 2-0 victory against a determined Charlton, United head back out on the road looking to take maximum advantage of their rivals' inactivity. With both sides' immediate thoughts occupied by FA Cup and Champions League commitments, it will be another fortnight before either is in league action again, when the Red Devils visit Fulham.<br><br>On that same weekend, Chelsea tackle Arsenal in the Carling Cup final. And, with United's March 3 encounter with Liverpool getting underway almost five hours before the Blues head to Portsmouth, Jose Mourinho's side could find themselves a massive 12 points adrift when they take the field at Fratton Park.<br><br>"It is an opportunity," acknowledged Ferguson. "In total, we have six more tough away matches to come and I don't think you can say any one match is harder than another. "There are the two big ones against Liverpool and Chelsea but Fulham, Portsmouth, Everton and Manchester City will all be hard. "Our destiny lies in those away matches."<br><br>Although Chelsea made the slightest of dents in United's massive lead in the goal difference column, reality suggests nine wins from 11 games will be enough to end a three-year title drought. Aware Chelsea's chances might start to get talked up in an effort to breathe even more competition into the championship race, Ferguson is calling for total focus on his own side's run-in.<br><br>Of particular delight to the Scot this weekend was the names on the scoresheet. Both Park and Fletcher replaced established members of United's first-choice line-up in Cristiano Ronaldo and Michael Carrick, who were absent through minor illness and injury respectively.<br><br>And, after a period when United conceded too many soft goals, including the gut-wrenching late double at Arsenal, a third successive clean sheet also gave Ferguson something to smile about. "We need to get back to getting six or seven clean sheets in a row because it can have a massive impact on our results in the league," said Ferguson.<br><br>"There is no question we are in a good position. "You can never take anything for granted but what encourages me, whether we are at home or away, is the form of our team. "They are enjoying their football and they are playing without any sign of nerves, which is great to see.<br><br>"We are very excited about the coming months. It is what we have worked for all season. "But we need to stay there in the melting pot right until the very end of the season and I think our squad is strong enough and good enough to last the distance."<br></div>
