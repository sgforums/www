            <div class='col-md body'>Patrice Evra has described Manchester United's annual meetings with Liverpool as the biggest club matches in the world.<br><br>There is little doubt the fierce rivalry between England's two most successful clubs generates a passion rarely matched elsewhere.<br><br>Amazingly, the Anfield outfit's present 16-season drought - during which time they have seen Sir Alex Ferguson's men win eight championships - has only fuelled the intensity of their individual meetings.<br><br>"Manchester United against Liverpool is the biggest club game in the world," said Evra.<br><br>"It is pretty big in France when PSG play Marseille but nothing like this.<br><br>"The atmosphere is really special. People come up to you in the street saying 'Come on Pat' because the result is so important.<br><br>"Everyone is desperate for us to win and the noise as the game kicks off is incredible."<br><br>Evra's only experience of facing Liverpool is a positive one given he was part of the United side which defeated Rafael Benitez's men in the Premiership last season thanks to Rio Ferdinand's injury-time header.<br><br>"This is our second really big game of the season and we have to do better than we did in the last one," said Evra of the Arsenal defeat.<br><br>"It is far too early to say we are going to win certain competitions. But at the moment things are looking very positive and we must continue that by beating Liverpool.<br><br>"They are a hard team to play against, with a lot of good, strong players. But we have to be ready for them and be mentally prepared because every game is a big one at this club."<br><br>Evra will hope to keep his place even though Gabriel Heinze is almost over the hamstring strain he sustained against Newcastle earlier this month.<br><br>Ryan Giggs should be available after being ruled out of Tuesday's Champions League win over Copenhagen with a virus.<br><br>Skipper Gary Neville is also expected to be involved after a recent calf injury, which could be good news as Ferdinand is a doubt after jarring his neck prior to the Copenhagen encounter.<br></div>
