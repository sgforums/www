              Paul Scholes is well aware there are a number of potential banana skins standing between Manchester United and another double this season.
              
              Sir Alex Ferguson's men need a maximum of seven points from their remaining four Premier League games to secure the domestic crown once again with a comprehensive 2-0 win at Middlesbrough on Saturday. 
              
              They did so without having to call upon Cristiano Ronaldo and Anderson at the Riverside Stadium, while Carlos Tevez and Nani were used only as substitutes and Edwin van der Sar, Michael Carrick and Darren Fletcher were given the day off ahead of Tuesday night's decisive European semi-final trip to Arsenal. 
              
              However, Scholes, who along with man-of-the-moment Ryan Giggs left Boro chasing shadows all afternoon, is refusing to rest on his laurels. 
              
              He said: "It's a great position to be in, but we have tough games to come. 
              
              "[Manchester] City beat us at Old Trafford last season, Arsenal are always difficult opponents and we also have two tough away games. 
              
              "Wigan is a difficult place to go - they are a tough attacking team - and Hull are fighting for their lives. 
              
              "We are not quite there yet. There is a long way to go." 
              
              Ferguson echoed those sentiments as he turned his attention to Tuesday's Champions League trip to the Emirates, and beyond. 
              
              The Scot said: "As I keep saying, we have to concentrate on what we have to do. We have to approach each game in the right way. 
              
              "There was no messing about today. It was a good professional performance." 
              
              That reflection was something of an understatement after a game in which United cruised to victory against a Boro side which, by the admission of manager Gareth Southgate, could effectively be relegated by defeat at Newcastle next Monday night. 
              
              Game as they were, the Teessiders were never able to get to grips with the visitors, who were able to play within themselves throughout. 
              
              From the moment Giggs, with his 148th goal for the club in his 801st appearance, fired them into a 25th-minute lead, there was no question as to where the points would end up. 
              
              The only surprise was that Park Ji-Sung's 51st-minute strike completed the scoring as United eased their way six points clear at the top of the table on Saturday evening to throw down the gauntlet to second-placed Liverpool. 
              
              Ferguson said: "Once we got in front, I wasn't confident but I felt we would be difficult to beat. 
              
              "We improved our game in the second-half. The second goal killed it and we could have scored more." 
              
              United left the Riverside with planning for their showdown in North London already well under way. 
              
              John O'Shea's lone strike at Old Trafford last Wednesday sends them into the game with the narrowest of leads, but one they are confident they can defend. 
              
              Scholes said: "We are in a decent position. They did not get an away goal. 
              
              "We are a team who always feels they can score goals. Hopefully we can do that on Tuesday and go through to the final." 
              
              Central defender Rio Ferdinand missed the trip to Boro with a rib injury, but is yet to be ruled out, while full-back Patrice Evra is expected to shake off a knock he picked up on Saturday. 
              
              In addition, the changes Ferguson was able to make in the north-east have left him with fresh legs and a series of options. 
              
              He said: "The midfield worked so hard against Arsenal on Wednesday, I wanted to rest them all. 
              
              "I put Anderson on the bench because he has not had as much football as Michael Carrick and Darren Fletcher. 
              
              "They have had a good rest and will be fresh for Tuesday - if I decide to play them all. 
              
              "We are in a good position. There is no question about that. We just have to go and enjoy it. We have to express ourselves the way we did today."

              <p>the key this season is the experience of Scholes/Giggs in the team, the good mix between youth and experience is working wonders.</p>
              <p>Just hope Anderson/Nani can benefit from their guidance, and "mature" faster.</p>
