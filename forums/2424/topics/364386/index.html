              <p><strong>Bayern Munich chairman
              Karl-Heinz Rummenigge has confirmed that Manchester United have joined
              Chelsea, Barcelona and Real Madrid in the race for Franck Ribery. </strong></p>
              <p>The 26-year-old France star has been strongly linked with a move
              away from Germany this summer and it is believed that Spain would be
              his most likely destination should be leave.</p>
              <p>However, although Bayern remain adamant that Ribery will stay,
              Rummenigge has now revealed that both United and Chelsea have made firm
              offers for the winger.</p>
              <p>“We are completely relaxed and very proud that we have one of the
              best three players in the world under contract and that he has
              triggered such a huge demand in the transfer market,” he told Bild.</p>
              <p>“Real have asked in person, through their president, Florentino
              Perez, and his adviser, Pedro Jimenez, whether we will talk to them
              about a deal.</p>
              <p>“We have rejected that request, because we have no intention of selling Ribery.”</p>
              <p>Asked if there was an offer from Madrid, he replied: “No, but there are clubs that have come to us with offers.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>“Chelsea’s bid has already been reported, and there’s also Manchester United and Barcelona. </strong></span></p>
              <p>“We are approaching it calmly, because we are the ones who have the power to make the decision.”</p>
              <p>He added: “I don’t want to talk about sums of money because it is not in our interest.</p>
              <p>“The amount is irrelevant.</p>
              <p>“There is always going to be the perception that Bayern Munich are
              trying to push the price up and that there is a certain value at which
              we’ll have to accept, but I’ll say it again: we want to keep Ribery.</p>
              <p>“We must do everything to make sure he stays in Munich and I am determined to do this.</p>
              <p>"A player has to respect his contract, in this case until 2011.”</p>
              <p>Rummenigge also said that he found the transfer fee for Cristiano
              Ronaldo’s move to Madrid to be ‘absurd’ and has backed Uefa president
              Michel Platini’s plans to control spending within the game.</p>
              <p>“What we are experiencing now leaves me concerned for the future,” he said.</p>
              <p>Rummenigge also reiterated that the club is interested in signing Chelsea defender Jose Bosingwa.</p>
