            <div class='col-md body'><strong>WE HAVE HISTORY ON OUR SIDE, SAYS GIGGS</strong><br><br>RYAN GIGGS reckons Manchester United will always be more loved by fans than Chelsea - because they do not just go out and buy "ready-made world-class players." The United legend has taken a swipe at Chelsea's transfer policy by pointing to Manchester United's core of homegrown players which he insists makes their team respected by fans around the world.<br><br>Giggs, 33, was brought through the ranks by Sir Alex Ferguson along with the likes of Gary Neville, Wes Brown, Paul Scholes, John O'Shea, and David Beckham, while Chelsea's leading regular homegrown star was John Terry before his back injury.<br><br>Giggs said: "If other clubs want to go out and buy ready-made world-class players, good luck to them, that's their business. "But for a club like ours, with so much history and where so much is put into the youth development system, it's really important the fans can see players they relate to who have grown up in the local area.<br><br>"Speaking from my own experience, at United it's in our history for local young players to come through. It's what the fans want - they like seeing young players coming from the local area and getting a chance to play in the first team."<br><br>Giggs wants to spend at least another three years at Old Trafford and says the target is to win the Premiership and Champions League to add to his eight Premiership winners' medals, four FA Cups, two Carling Cups and one Champions League.<br><br>He added: "It's something we will certainly try. Our aim is to win the Premiership and Champions League and we're confident if we keep our form up we'll have a great chance. "There are some real top teams left in there and it is a very tough competition to win. You need everything going for you. You need to play well and need that little bit of luck, but we have got the players to do it.<br><br>"Having Scholesy back, the addition of Michael Carrick, and also having Gabriel Heinze, Alan Smith and [Ole Gunnar] Solskjaer back is crucial. "All these players have strengthened our squad. Also, young players like [Darren] Fletcher, Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney have all grown up an extra year, so with all that coming together it's helped. "We needed to be more consistent and with the added experience and maturity we've started to find that."<br><br>Giggs admitted to uefa.com magazine that he has had his fall-outs with Fergie but has always survived. He said: "There is a mutual respect between us, but over the years we have fallen out from time to time. We are both fighting for the same cause - to win games for Manchester United - and if we do fall out it's soon forgotten about.<br><br>"We are both hungry for success so sometimes you lose your temper but we always get over it."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's hard to say now becos the new batch of Fergie's Fledgelings are not exactly of Top Class.<br><br>Fletcher, Richardson, Rossi, Evans, Pique hasn't really put their mark like the batch before them did. Wes Brown and O'Shea has been with the club for quite some time but they failed to hold on to a regular first team place.<br><br>Take a look at the Starting 11 now:<br><br>GK van der Sar (Bought from Fulham)<br>RB Neville (Class of '92)<br>CD Nemanja Vidic (Bought from Spartak Moscow)<br>CD Rio Ferdinand (Bought from Leeds)<br>LB Patrice Evra (Bought from Monaco)<br>RM Cristiano Ronaldo (Bought from Sporting Lisbon)<br>CM Paul Scholes (Class of '92)<br>CM Micheal Carrick (Bought from Tottenham)<br>LM Ryan Giggs (Long Long time ago.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> )<br>ST Louis Saha (Bought from Fulham)<br>ST Wayne Rooney (Bought from Everton)<br><br>Cheers.<br>C.K</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>True, MUFC were able to dominiate locally but not in European was due to the lack of competition. Now, with the increased competition, you can see the increased number of English Cup in the Quarter-Finals.<br><br>That's generally good for the whole EPL.<br><br>However, when Giggs mentioned those oneclub player, I do believe that FA seems to go in a different direction in that they only allowed youth players within a few KM to be recruited.<br><br>So with that, it will still go back to Inflated English Players transfer fees &amp; more foreign players coming into EPL.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by dragg:</div><div class="quote_body">even though a lot of soccer fans dislike chelsea and RA you cant deny that his money brought the EPL to another level.<br><br>it is now more difficult to win the EPL and other cups.  better players are now in the premiership.  poorer clubs have more money too.<br><br>of course they are also negative impacts.<br><br>but overall it is better for soccer fans.<br><br></div></blockquote>I don't deny Chelsea converted the EPL from a marathon to a sprint.<br><br>Yes, TV rights wise, bigger clubs have more money but they need to beef up their reserves to stay in touch. More money are going back to soccer, but all are looking at quick fix and not long term. No teams can afford to wait for results, for fear of dropping out of EPL, and losing big bucks.<br><br>No youngsters will come into EPL, unless they are gems like MicahRichards. But they are proving to be rare.  One valid example, since when you heard of a great English Keeper? They can't develop them anymore, most are FTs (foreign-talents).<br><br>As for difficulty to win EPL, frankly, you only need to beat Chelsea if you want to win the league. The rest will stay status quo, fighting from no2 to 6 for european spots.<br><br>Cause frankly, you can't beat Chelsea in the transfer market. You can't beat them in the wages they offer. And like what Jose said at start of season, they have replacements for every positions in the team. And Chelsea can afford to have a write-off of millions. Can you?<br><br>A-list (superb) players will only come to EPL if the overall standard improves, but it is not.  Only matches between the top 5 are attracting attentions, so what happened to the rest of the 28matches?<br><br>Most will shout that MUFC did it and now it is payback time for them given Chelsea dominance.  MUFC did it with home-grown players, and they never destroy the transfer market now as per Chelsea is doing.<br><br></div>
