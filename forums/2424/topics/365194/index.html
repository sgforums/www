              <h1>Sir Alex Ferguson set to bid £30m for French star Karim Benzema.</h1>

              <p><em>SIR Alex Ferguson is ready to rebuild his shattered strike force with a £30million bid for French star Karim Benzema.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The Manchester United boss returns from holiday this week and will try to patch up his depleted squad with his biggest summer transfer splurge ever. Fergie wants to do a Benzema deal quickly after losing Carlos Tevez at the weekend when the Argentine rejected a new five-year contract. He also has to do the impossible and replace World Player of the Year Cristiano Ronaldo.</strong></p>
              <p>Benzema is United’s prime target and despite publicly resisting a transfer, Lyon are already making moves to replace their 21-year-old striker.</p>
              <p>Lyon have made a £10m bid for Paris saint-Germain striker Guillaume Hoarau in readiness for a mega-money deal with United</p>
              <p>Hoarau has scored 17 goals in 32 league matches last season, earning a France call-up and is a natural replacement for Benzema.</p>
              <p>Barcelona, Real Madrid and Inter Milan have looked at Benzema but United, with the cash from the Ronaldo deal, head the queue and progress is expected this week.</p>
              <p>Lyon sporting director Bernard Lacombe has hinted that Benzema can go if a huge offer was made.</p>
              <p>He said: “Nobody knows what is going to happen. What should we do if Manchester, who have a lot of cash to spend, want to sign Benzema?” Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas also paved the way for a move. He said: “We didn’t think Michael Essien would leave at the time, but when Chelsea arrived with the cheque...”</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>United are hoping to land Ecuador international Valencia following the decision to accept a world-record £80million offer from Real Madrid for Cristiano Ronaldo.</strong></p>
              <p>Whelan plans to meet with United and Real, who are also keen on Valencia, in the coming days, while an unnamed third club have also shown an interest.</p>
              <p>Reports claim United are favourites to nab Valencia, although the reported £18million asking price is rumoured to be proving a sticking point.</p>
              <p>However Whelan is confident that, for the sums being discussed, the Premier League champions will be securing a bargain if they conclude a deal for Valencia.</p>
              <p>"I think Antonio is the best wide right player anywhere and that includes Franck Ribery," Whelan told The People. "If this lad goes to Man United he will be a sensation there.</p>
              <p>"Within a few months and over the course of a season the United supporters would come to worship this lad.</p>
              <p>"We see him week-in, week-out in games and in training and he's a world-class player. "He doesn't play the same way as Ronaldo. There is no show or flash, but he's a world-class player and he'll take some replacing. No-one tackles him or takes the ball off him because they can't get near him.</p>
              <p>"At the kind of money that's been talked about for Antonio he'd be an absolute steal. United appear to be getting £80m for Ronaldo and they would be paying out a fraction of that for Valencia, so it would be great business because this boy has got immense ability."</p>

              <p>I don't think so... I find him a much better winger than Aaron Lennon... And if he gets to play around better players, I believe he will do even better...</p>
              <p>At Wigan, he was rated the best of the 3, Palacios and Heskey... $17, $18m is ok, as he is still very young but have enough premier league experienced already...</p>

              <p>I guess they are just waiting for confirmation that CR has signed for RM. Think they are just afraid of them going ahead and signing a replacement then have CR decide that RM's terms are not good enuff or RM pull out of deal.</p>
