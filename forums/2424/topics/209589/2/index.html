            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Boss hails matchwinner Ole</strong><br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson paid tribute to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's attacking prowess after the Norwegian fired the winner in United's 3-2 win over Celtic.<br><br>The 33-year-old striker, a first half substitute for the injured Ryan Giggs, struck just two minutes after the break, blasting home after Louis Saha's initial shot had been parried.<br><br>It was Solskjaer's first goal at Old Trafford for almost three years - his last home strike coming in the 5-0 Champions League win over Panathinaikos in September 2003.<br><br>"It was a typical Solskjaer goal," declared Sir Alex after the game. "He knew exactly where the ball was going to land before anyone else and was the first to react.<br><br>"It was a pure goalscorer's goal and it showed that he's still got a lot to offer this team."<br><br>Earlier, Celtic had taken a shock lead through Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink after poor defending by Rio Ferdinand.<br><br>"If your concentration isn't good at the back it can cause you problems," said the United boss. "And of course that's what happened tonight. Celtic's first goal was a lapse in concentration and it gave them a great boost.<br><br>"Thankfully, we got ourselves back into the game and went in front. But I was unhappy about their second goal and I think it was slack defending from us. To give away a free-kick at that point, right on half-time was disappointing."<br><br>Thanks to Solskjaer's winning effort and an earlier brace from the lively Saha, United held out for the win much to their manager's delight.<br><br>"Our attacking play at times was very good and we really should have scored a few more goals," added Sir Alex. "The fact that we didn't kept the game on a knife-edge and at 3-2 anything can happen because it only takes a second to lose a goal.<br><br>"I think we made it difficult for ourselves at times but Celtic deserve great credit. Many teams come to Old Trafford and sure things up at the back and hope they steal something near the end. Celtic, however, had a go all night which is typical of the history of their club.<br><br>"I said to the players before the game that if you're going to be successful in Europe you have to show your quality. I think we did that tonight which really pleased me."<br><br><a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA%2D9A47%2D47BC%2DB069%2D3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=362929" rel="nofollow">http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA%2D9A47%2D47BC%2DB069%2D3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=362929</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Saha: I should have scored six</strong><br><br>Louis Saha scored two goals to help United beat Celtic on Wednesday, but the French striker says he should have had two hat-tricks.<br><br>The Frenchman struck from the penalty spot after half an hour and then again nine minutes later after a defence-splitting pass from Paul Scholes.<br><br>The 28-year-old striker said: "I think I should have had at least two [hat-tricks]. There were so many oppotunities in the match."<br><br>Saha was unsurprised by how competitive Celtic were, having took the lead and then equalised just before half time.<br><br>"We knew it was going to be a hard game and it was, so that makes getting the three points all the more pleasing," he said.<br><br>"It was a great game to play in. It must have been good for the fans because of all the goals, but for us it was difficult because we had to work hard to get back into the game. The important thing was that we started the campaign with three points.<br><br><a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=362973" rel="nofollow">http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&amp;newsid=362973</a></div>

Rooney was off form after a 3 match lay off.<br><br>Things not looking so good now, Giggs has been a driving force in Man u's attack now without him... His decent back-up Park also out, even longer. Now who is going to play on the left wing for Man u? Left only Richardson...

Giggs out for 3 wks, Park 3 months. Rooney was off form after a 3 match lay off.<br><br>Things not looking so good now, Giggs has been a driving force in Man u's attack now without him... His decent back-up Park also out, even longer. Now who is going to play on the left wing for Man u? Left only Richardson... Maybe Patrice Evra can play left wing better than Richardson, you all think so?<br><br>Looks like we have to depend more on Richardson and Fletcher on the wings with Ronaldo playing one side and one of these guys playing the other...<br><br></div></blockquote>I don't think fletcher will be good on the wing..<br><br>maybe evra.. and heinze can be at the left-back position..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mikael Silvestre cannot understand why there was ever any doubt over Louis Saha's ability to score at the highest level.<br><br>Although few would argue Saha did not make a telling contribution in the final weeks of last season or has started the current campaign on top form, a number of eyebrows were raised when Sir Alex Ferguson - having already offloaded Ruud van Nistelrooy - opted not to bring in any striking cover before the transfer window shut last month.<br><br>With 38 goals in 47 European games for the Red Devils, Van Nistelrooy had established himself as one of the most lethal marksmen on the continent.<br><br>In contrast, prior to last night's encounter with Celtic, Saha had not scored a Champions League goal.<br><br>Yet, on a night when Van Nistelrooy was drawing a blank for new club Real Madrid, the Frenchman justified Ferguson's faith by netting the brace which allowed United to emerge victorious from the Battle of Britain clash with Celtic and get their latest tilt at European glory off to the perfect start.<br><br>"I do not understand why people have been questioning Louis' ability in front of goal," said Silvestre, like Saha a member of the French World Cup squad this summer.<br><br>"He has been scoring goals for ages. Look at his record.<br><br>"Since he replaced Ruud in the United team, Louis has done really well.<br><br>"Like all strikers, he thrives on confidence, which he gets through scoring goals. I am really happy for him because he is making the team happy."<br><br>Saha insists he is feeling no extra pressure with the added responsibility, and the 27-year-old appears to be thriving on it.<br><br>The former Fulham forward now has four goals from five games this season, maintain a scoring streak which saw him net 15 times in just 30 appearances last term.<br><br>However, Saha is honest enough to admit his first European goal owed much to Wayne Rooney.<br><br>The young England striker may not have been involved at all in the move which saw Celtic goalkeeper Artur Boruc make a grab for Ryan Giggs but he was willing to stand aside to let Saha take the penalty.<br><br>"I have to thank Wayne for that," said Saha.<br><br>"It was a good night to get goals and I suppose I might have had a hat-trick but we won the game, which is all that matters.<br><br>"I am enjoying myself at the moment. I don't feel any extra pressure. I just keep giving 100%, which is what I will continue to do whether I am in the team or not."<br><br>Having begun the season in such impressive form, United will look to maintain their winning streak against Arsenal on Sunday.<br><br>Another victory for the Old Trafford men will open up an incredible 13-point gap on the Gunners and, while Ryan Giggs and Park Ji-sung are definitely out with hamstring and ankle complaints respectively, Cristiano Ronaldo is expected to be available after missing the Celtic clash through suspension.<br><br>Ronaldo will probably take Giggs' place in Ferguson's starting line-up, although that is by no means certain given Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's matchwinning contribution after replacing the Welshman midway through the first half last night.<br><br>Solskjaer's Stretford End strike was his first European goal, and his first in any competition at Old Trafford, for almost three years.<br><br>The intervening period has represented a personal nightmare for the 33-year-old, who has struggled to overcome persistent knee problems which even his own team-mates felt would claim his career.<br><br>"I have to admit, I didn't believe he would come back," said Silvestre.<br><br>"We are all so happy for him because he is such a great lad. To score that goal after being out for so long will give him a lot of confidence."<br><br></div>
