            <div class='col-md body'>Celtic will be underdogs, without a doubt. But that didn't seem to bother anyone on European evenings.' Those are the words of Martin O'Neill, who led Celtic to a European final three years ago, and the man who replaced him as manager of the Scottish champions, Gordon Strachan, agrees.<br><br>Yes, Celtic will be underdogs when they travel to Old Trafford on Wednesday to take on Manchester United in what many are billing as the Battle of Britain, but, as O'Neill proved when he guided Celtic to a second-round win over Blackburn in 2002 and a quarter-final victory over Liverpool a year later, Scottish clubs need not fear their so-called stronger English cousins.<br><br>'The differences between the two leagues are obvious,' said O'Neill, who now manages Aston Villa. 'The Premiership is very, very strong and the SPL is not, but that doesn't mean one can't beat the other in a one-off game.'<br><br>It is a fact that has not escaped United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, who is aware of the dangers his team face in such a potentially explosive tie. 'What you've got to do with games like this is get rid of the Scotland-England rivalry because that only makes it harder,' he said. 'It's easy to get caught up in the emotion if you're not careful because games like this don't come around very often.<br><br>Ferguson is willing to admit that he made the mistake of underestimating a team with history behind them in the group stage last season, when United were not only eliminated by Benfica but consigned to finishing bottom, missing out on the consolation of a Uefa Cup place. 'Who would have thought that, looking at the table beforehand?' said Ferguson. 'We couldn't even get into the Uefa Cup and who would have believed that with the group of players we have?'<br><br>But Strachan has been buoyed by the signings of former Everton midfielder Thomas Gravesen from Real Madrid and PSV Eindhoven striker Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink, as well as the considerably less costly Wolves left-back Lee Naylor.<br><br>'It's players that make managers and players who get results. What it boils down to is that formations and tactics don't matter as much as how players perform. The one certainty about United is that they have pace everywhere and that is something we will have to address specifically. Otherwise, we will rely on our own strengths to get ourselves a result.'<br><br></div>

"You will see what we can do when we get on the park.<br><br>"What people think about the Scottish league we will prove them wrong for sure."<br><br>Gravesen admitted the win in the north of Scotland was important as they prepare to meet the Premiership leaders, who have started their season with a 100% record after four games.<br><br>"The performance showed to me what a strong team we are and how committed we are to getting the three points.<br><br>"We can now go to England with confidence and we will do our best down there but this was vital for us."<br><br>Aberdeen midfielder Barry Nicholson was dragged all over Pittodrie by the 30-year - but he did not mind.<br><br>The former Dunfermline man said: "I played against him at Pittodrie in a friendly against Everton a few years back.<br><br>"He is the best player I have every played against.

It was the lowest point of the 2005/06 campaign, but it is being used as a motivational tool for the players, desperate to prove it was a one-off.<br><br>Â“You always look forward to the Champions League,Â” he tells United Review ahead of the game. Â“But this season thereÂ’s a different attitude. The disappointment of last year means we want to show people weÂ’re good enough in Europe.<br><br>"We had so many injuries and suspensions last time, it was a nightmare. And we certainly didnÂ’t show what weÂ’re capable of at all, but weÂ’re determined to rectify that, starting against Celtic.Â”<br><br>The 22-year-old Scottish international is desperate to play in the match at Old Trafford on Wednesday, a game he believes will be like no other European tie.<br><br>Â“Both sets of fans will be right up for it,Â” he said. Â“It will almost be like a Premiership match, with both teams playing at a high tempo. I imagine it will be like a local Derby as well, which is unusual in the Champions League. But that makes you want to experience it even more. ItÂ’s a game IÂ’m really looking forward to.Â”<br><br><a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=362382" rel="nofollow">http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&amp;newsid=362382</a></div>

"Steve Bower and I were on our way back from commentating on the midweek match against Charlton, the day before the Champions League draw, and I said to him, 'There's no doubt, we're going to draw Celtic.'<br><br>"After the long years that both teams have been in Europe, somewhere along the way they were going to draw one another. I was at the Coronation Cup game in 1953 when the two teams met, Celtic beat Manchester United 2-1 that night. And let me tell you something, as a little kid in Glasgow I wasn't supporting Manchester United that night, but obviously it'll be different for this game.<br><br>"It's a great draw and another bonus is that United don't have to travel far for the return match. And I'm sure that somewhere along the line United will want to do Celtic a favour by beating Benfica twice and hope that Celtic can get through to the next round.<br><br>"They'll be looking at the group and feel confident they can qualify on their own efforts - if they manage to beat Copenhagen home and away and beat Benfica at Celtic Park, that will probably get them through. But you never know!"<br><br><a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=362461" rel="nofollow">http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&amp;newsid=362461</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Nakamura: We're not ready</strong><br><br>Celtic midfielder Shunsuke Nakamura has delivered a damning verdict on his side's Champions League hopes, insisting the Bhoys are not full prepared for their visit to Old Trafford.<br><br>The Japanese midfielder says Celtic are yet to reach their full potential so far this season and will be lucky to leave Manchester with a draw on Wednesday evening.<br><br>Â“We need to improve as a team before this game because weÂ’re not playing well enough for the Champions League,Â” Nakamura told the Scottish Sun.<br><br>Â“The manager has brought in two or three new players and unfortunately we still donÂ’t know each other well enough.<br><br>Â“So far this season, I donÂ’t think weÂ’ve been playing well as a team. Our last game against Aberdeen brought a win, but we didnÂ’t play well.<br><br>"For me, we played too many long balls to [Jan Vennegoor of] Hesselink and thatÂ’s not good enough for the Champions League.<br><br>"We canÂ’t go down to Manchester and attack, attack, attack," he added. "ItÂ’s hard to win there so for us it will be vital to defend in this game. Right now, I think a draw would be an important result for us.Â”<br><br><a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=362454" rel="nofollow">http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&amp;newsid=362454</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson expects Park Ji-sung, Edwin Van der Sar and Paul Scholes to be fit for the club's UEFA Champions League clash with Celtic.<br><br>The Scottish tactician revealed all three have slight concerns ahead of the tie, although they are winning their battles to be available at Old Trafford.<br><br>Ferguson stated Park collected a knock during United's 1-0 win over Tottenham on Saturday and that he was undergoing a scan as a precautionary measure.<br><br>Former England international midfielder Scholes sustained a dead leg during training on Sunday while Dutch goalkeeper Van der Sar is suffering from a stomach upset.<br><br>Ferguson is keeping his fingers crossed for the trio as he is hoping to field Scholes along with Wayne Rooney, who has missed the last three games through suspension.<br><br>"Ji-sung got a knock in the game on Saturday. He's away for a scan today (Tuesday), hopefully he'll be alright," said Ferguson.<br><br>"Paul got a knock in training on Sunday. He did a bit of running. It's just a dead leg. I'm confident he'll be fit for tomorrow.<br><br>"Edwin's got a stomach upset. He didn't train today. Hopefully they'll all be alright. We have no other problems.<br><br>"If Paul's right then he and Wayne Rooney will start. We've got to get Rooney and Scholes back playing.<br><br>"We have a massive game on Sunday (against Arsenal). So therefore it makes it easy for me to make changes for tomorrow, in that respect.<br><br>"I think if you look at our European campaign last year I think it was a poor one. The players won't let the fans down this year.<br><br>"It's our first game of the European cup. Our home record over the years in fairness has been fantastic. We want that to continue."<br></div>
