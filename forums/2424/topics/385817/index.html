              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Benfica have reportedly rejected a bid of £9million, plus out-of-favour winger Nani, from Manchester United for prized asset Angel Di Maria.</span><span><span id="intelliTXT"> </span></span></p>
              <p>The 21-year-old Argentine has been linked with a host of Europe's top clubs this season following some stand-out displays in Benfica's midfield.</p>
              <p>The bid from United was said to be in the region of €10million, with out-of-favour winger Nani also offered in exchange.</p>
              <p>However, Portuguese radio station TSF have revealed that Benfica president Luis Filipe Vieira has dismissed the bid with the club holding out for considerably more money.</p>
              <p>The midfielder is said to have a €40million release fee clause in his current contract, but many believe Benfica will do business once they receive a bid in the region of €30million.</p>
              <p>However, the Portuguese giants are reluctant to sell in January with the club aware that a successful World Cup with Argentina next summer could see Di Maria's valuation rocket.</p>

              <p>Yup, Rafael and Fabio were signed as youth and so is Macheda. But all were further groomed in United's Youth set up before they were thrown into the first team foray.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Rafael's professional football career began with Fluminense in Brazil, where he played at youth level.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"></sup>Rafael and his brother Fábio were brought to the attention of Manchester United by club scout Les Kershaw in the summer of 2005 while playing for Fluminense in a youth tournament in Hong Kong.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"></sup> Manchester United got in touch with Fluminense and asked permission for
              the twins to travel to Manchester to train with them in 2005. Shortly
              afterwards, a scout claiming to represent Arsenal
              visited the twins and asked them to come to England to train with
              Arsenal without the permission of Fluminense; however, they were
              dissuaded from this by their mother, who reminded them that they had
              been with Fluminense since they were 11, and that they should show the
              club some loyalty.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"></sup> The twins were also approached by Real Madrid while they were on international duty with Brazil.</p>
              </blockquote><blockquote>
              <p>Born in Rome, Macheda began his football career with local side Lazio.
              However, due to Italian football regulations preventing under-18s from
              signing professional contracts, he was not permanently tied to the
              club, and shortly after his 16th birthday, he was signed by Manchester
              United of England, where regulations permit the signing of players aged
              16 and up. <sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"></sup>Following his family's relocation to England, he officially joined the
              club as a trainee on 16 September 2007, and began a three-year
              scholarship in the club's Academy.</p>
