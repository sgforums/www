              <p> </p>
              <p>Jose Mourinho would jump at the chance of managing Manchester United
              should the Old Trafford hierarchy decide he is the man to replace Sir
              Alex Ferguson.</p>
              <table style="height: 8px;" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" width="10" align="right">
              <tbody>
              <tr>
              <td> </td>
              </tr>
              </tbody>
              </table>
              <p>At 67, Ferguson knows he cannot continue indefinitely, even though he is
              presently fit and healthy and has no intention of giving up a job he has held
              for almost 23 years.</p>
              <p>United chief executive David Gill knows finding a suitable alternative will be
              the single most difficult task he will face given the incredible success
              Ferguson has enjoyed with the Red Devils.</p>
              <p>Mourinho's name has been mentioned fairly frequently since his exit from
              Chelsea.</p>
              <p>The Portuguese coach certainly has the charisma required to take on one of
              football's biggest jobs and is unlikely to be overwhelmed by the task of
              replacing the most successful British manager of all time.</p>
              <p>And, while he insists he remains totally focused on trying to end Inter Milan's
              54-year European Cup drought, he admitted the lure of returning to England with
              the current Premier League champions would probably be irresistible.</p>
              <p>"I would consider going to Manchester United but United have to consider if
              they want me to succeed Sir Alex Ferguson,'' he told the <em>Daily Mirror</em>. "If they
              do, then of course.</p>
              <p>"I like England, where the fans are very passionate and make the game a
              beautiful occasion with such an incredible atmosphere.''</p>
              <p>It has not escaped Mourinho's notice that
              since his controversial exit two years ago, Chelsea are now onto their fourth
              manager and have failed to recapture the title, while he - having guided Chelsea
              to back-to-back championships - has now won Serie A with Inter.</p>
              <p>"I had many conversations before Chelsea and I decided on a divorce,'' he
              said. "It was difficult for me because we loved each other but the relationship
              went in one direction and it was best for everyone.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Since I left I became champion again but they have not been champions again.
              I keep on winning and they don't.'' </span></span></p>

              <p>he was upset that he was passed for the job of Barcelona, RM and AC Milan, 3 of the biggest clubs in world football. </p>
              <p>so the only biggest club left is Man Utd. everybody knows that fergie wont continue forever and he is 67 already, probably will retire in a few seasons from now. so he is like saying now he is interested in the utd job after fergie retire.</p>

              <p>he likes to create war w every other managers and then he can create something out of nothing by accusing the ref bias etc. remember the ref who was forced to quit the game few years ago lol. </p>
              <p>he like his team to play well defensively and like to play 2 defensive midfielders to protect the back 4. when his team is leading, he likes to kill the game off by parking the bus in front of the goalpost. his football philosophy is different from fergie and wenger. sure he can win you titles no doubt. </p>
              <p>these are the questions the owner and the board would need to discuss. you want trophies, and at the same time, playing sexy football, or win trophies while playing stale football?</p>

              <p>i think moyes will be perfect for Utd compared to jose. He has proven to be astute in signings and also a good man-management in bringing the best out of relatively, on paper, mid-table class footballers. Anyway, jose will shoot his mouth off and make Utd an even more hated club for ABUs, lol. Fair enough to say, Jose has a better Euro credential, but i believe moyes has the right ingredients to succeed at a club challenging for honour every yr and with bigger financial budget.</p>
              <p>Not to say i dont like jose to be Utd's next manager, but i preferred moyes.</p>
