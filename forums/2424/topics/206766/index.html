He is a great player and a tremendous personality to have in the team and he has worked very hard since I came to Sydney to be in shape to play.<br><br>"He has great respect amongst the players and coaching staff and he will be missed."<br><br>Yorke did not travel with his team-mates to Melbourne on Thursday and remained in Sydney in case he was needed for a medical or to sign relevant paperwork.<br><br>Sydney FC chairman Walter Bugno added: "Dwight Yorke has made an unbelievable contribution to Sydney FC and Australian football and we wish him nothing but luck in his new endeavours with Sunderland."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>He may be football's newest manager but Roy Keane was arguably the busiest yesterday. He signed no fewer than six players, the most high-profile being Dwight Yorke, who was also the first to complete his move in a Â£200,000 deal.<br><br>Once Yorke had been recruited, Keane not surprisingly put his energy into midfield positions. Wigan's Graham Kavanagh signed for Â£400,000 and United's Liam Miller on a free transfer on a three-year contract...<br><br>Then late last night Keane secured another Republic of Ireland player, the striker David Connolly, from Wigan in a deal believed to be worth Â£1.4m.<br><br>Kavanagh, 32, is precisely the sort of central midfield enforcer Sunderland have lacked since Gavin McCann's sale to Villa and will be welcomed by supporters.<br><br>Looking to acquire players he not only knows but has played alongside, Keane turned to another of his former clubs, Celtic, who allowed Ross Wallace and Stanislav Varga to travel south for talks. Both men signed last night.<br><br>Wallace, 21, is a Scotland Under-21 left-winger with pace and crossing precision. Varga is an imposing, 6ft 5in Slovakian central defender who left Slovan Bratislava in 2000 to sign for Peter Reid's Sunderland, where he experienced mixed fortunes before joining Celtic.<br><br>Varga, 33, is likely to line up alongside the former Newcastle left-back Robbie Elliott, 32. Elliott has been on a one-month contract at Sunderland but Keane, having liked what he has seen of him in training, yesterday extended that agreement until the end of January.<br><br></div>
