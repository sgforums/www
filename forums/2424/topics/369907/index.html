              <h1>Michael Owen and Dimitar Berbatov help Manchester United thrash Hangzhou</h1>
              <h2>Michael Owen displayed signs of a blossoming strike partnership with Dimitar Berbatov by taking his Manchester United goal tally to four in four games with a double in an 8-2 victory against Hangzhou.</h2>

              <div class="imageExtras"><em><span class="caption">Flying start: Michael Owen's </span>free transfer could be the bargain of the season.</em></div>
              <p> </p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson might need to revise the 15-goal target that he has set his revitalised summer signing, after Owen scored twice in a 8-2 victory against Hangzhou Greentown in the extravagantly named Yellow Dragon Cave Stadium.</strong></p>
              <p>The victory, which included a second-half hat-trick from Ryan Giggs and goals from Dimitar Berbatov, Zoran Tosic and Nani, ensured that United concluded their four-game Far East tour with a 100 per cent record. But the big plus for United and Ferguson in Asia has been Owen.</p>
              <p>Written off as damaged goods by many following relegation with Newcastle last season, the 29 year-old is now suggesting that his free transfer could be the bargain of the season. Not only has Owen found his goal touch, he has also shown signs of a potentially lethal partnership with Berbatov. If Owen scores the goals and brings the best out of Berbatov in a United shirt, memories of Cristiano Ronaldo might not haunt Ferguson’s team after all.</p>
              <p>Ferguson said: “This tour is not the acid test, but given Michael’s ability and understanding of play around the last third, I think he will be getting goals and things are looking good for us in that position.</p>
              <p>“His contribution in overall play is suited to us. He is very clever in the last third and knows when to run and when to hold runs. That, linked with the experience he gives in that position, will be good for us.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00853/01_owen_280x390_853757a.jpg" alt="CRACKER ... Michael Owen swivels to volley home a brilliant second goal " width="280" height="390"></p>
              <p><em>Owen's burgeoning partnership with Dimitar Berbatov has been the highlight of Manchester United's pre-season</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Owen’s injuries and his Liverpool past have led to some United followers questioning his right to the club’s No 7 shirt, but Ferguson is not troubled by such talk.</strong></p>
              <p>“I am not concerned with what supporters think,” he said. “The important thing is to give the shirt to someone who is confident to carry it and Michael is the natural one to get it.”</p>
              <p>Perhaps as a result of his glory days with England and Liverpool, Owen has been feted – with the exception of Ji-Sung Park in Seoul – as the most popular and recognisable United player throughout the Far East tour.</p>
              <p>The hard work begins now for Owen, however. United’s two-game trip to Munich for the Audi Cup later this week, where they play Boca Juniors on Wednesday before facing Bayern Munich or AC Milan on Thursday, will provide a much sterner test.</p>
              <p>Ferguson is likely to pair Owen with Wayne Rooney in Munich. The former England team-mates have not shared a minute on the pitch in the Far East, with one replacing the other in the four games on tour.</p>
              <p>Nemanja Vidic, £17 million summer signing Antonio Valencia and teenage forward Danny Welbeck will join the United squad when they arrive in Munich on Monday morning.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>MANCHESTER UNITED</strong> (4-4-2): Van der Sar (Foster h-t); Fabio, Ferdinand (Brown 59), Evans, Evra; Tosic, Fletcher (Giggs 59), Scholes (Anderson 59), Nani (Park 59); Berbatov (Gibson 70), Owen (Rooney h-t). Subs: O'Shea, Macheda, Carrick.</p>

              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Ryan Giggs is convinced Michael Owen can provide Manchester United with a cutting edge they have lacked since the exit of Ruud van Nistelrooy.</span><span><span id="intelliTXT"> </span></span>  </p>
              <p>A surprise new recruit by Sir Alex Ferguson, Owen has made an impressive start to life at Old Trafford, bagging four goals to finish top scorer on the four-match Far East tour.</p>
              <p>While far sterner tests await, starting against Boca Juniors in the Audi Cup tomorrow, Owen shows all the signs of being an astute piece of business for the Red Devils.</p>
              <p>And Ferguson has frequently bemoaned United's failure to take a large enough percentage of the opportunities they create, maybe Owen's arrival will trigger the improvement required by their demanding manager.</p>
              <p>"Michael is a predator, which is something we don't presently have," said Giggs.</p>
              <p>"We have had players like that over the years. Ruud is an obvious one. Andy Cole was another. They come alive in the box.</p>
              <p>"From what I have seen over the years, the thing about Michael is that if he misses a chance it doesn't bother him one little bit.</p>
              <p>"Some players go into their shell. It doesn't bother him at all.</p>
              <p>"He knows he is going to get another chance. Ruud had the same mentality. All top goalscorers have it.</p>
              <p>"They know they are going to get chances, so if they miss one, they just think 'So what?'."</p>
              <p>If Owen can stay fit and keep hitting the target, United will not be far away from landing a record fourth successive championship, and going one clear of Liverpool in the overall standings on 19.</p>
              <p>And, on a more personal level, Owen could easily be forging his way into Fabio Capello's England plans ahead of the World Cup in South Africa.</p>
              <p>Capello has consistently ignored Owen since the early games of his reign, claiming the sharp-shooter simply was not fit enough to be in contention for a place in his squad.</p>
              <p>However, while he admits England's fortunes are none of his business, Giggs does not think it would take Owen long to score the nine goals he needs to equal Sir Bobby Charlton's record milestone of 49.</p>
              <p>"He has it in him to do it," said the veteran Welshman.</p>
              <p>"It has been a difficult record to overhaul because obviously it has stood for so long.</p>
              <p>"But when you analyse Michael's career and look at the number of times he has played for England and the goals he has got, if he plays another 15 times he would probably do it."</p>
