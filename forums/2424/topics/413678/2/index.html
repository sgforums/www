              <p>ã€€</p>
              </span><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: large;"><strong><span lang="EN-GB">
              <p>JAVIER HERNANDEZ produced an outrageous headed goal to sink Stoke.</p>
              </span></strong></span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">
              <p>Manchester United's Mexican magician netted the opener by nodding in the ball using the <strong>BACK </strong>of his head.</p>
              <p>Hernandez turned his back on the Stoke goal as Nemanja Vidic knocked the ball across the six-yard box. But he left the Potters defence dumbfounded by predicting the flight of the ball and connecting perfectly to leave keeper Thomas Sorensen floundering.</p>
              <p>Stoke sub Tuncay brought the home side back into the game on 81 minutes with his own super strike.</p>
              <p>But just five minutes later, Hernandez - standing in for the crocked Wayne Rooney - grabbed his second of the afternoon to earn United their first win on the road in five attempts this season.</p>
              <p>Stoke, though, were fuming that Gary Neville escaped a sending off when he brought Matthew Etherington crashing to the ground.</p>
              <p>Neville had already been cautioned for a studs-up challenge on the winger when he caught the same player. But referee Andre Marriner sparked fury amongst the home support when he refused to take action.</p>
              <p>Both keepers were relative bystanders throughout but although chances were at a premium, the action was pulsating enough to keep the crowd entertained.</p>
              <p>United should have taken the lead inside the opening 10 minutes but failed to make the most of a three-on-two counter-attack.</p>
              <p>Van Der Sar gave United a scare when his rushed clearance fell for Rory Delap inside the centre circle but the Irishman's speculative effort curved well wide.</p>
              <p>Delap then sent in a trademark long throw that Robert Huth flicked on but no one was there at the far post to apply the final touch.</p>
              <p>But on 27 minutes, Hernandez served up his treat out of nowhere to put the visitors ahead.</p>
              <p>Neville and then Paul Scholes entered the book as the pace quickened before Hernandez charged down Sorensen's clearance, with the ball ballooning just over the bar.</p>
              <p>Neville then got away with his second challenge on Etherington before United ended the half strongly with Patrice Evra - operating at left midfield - heading over and Vidic seeing his shot rise too high.</p>
              <p>United boss Alex Ferguson wanted to replace Neville with Wes Brown at the break but the sub was not ready so Neville took his place ready for kick-off. But just as Marriner was about to restart, Brown appeared and Neville was made to trudge off on his 600th appearance, much to the enjoyment of the home fans.</p>
              <p>It was United's turn to feel hard done-by when Evra was sent sprawling in the box by Delap but again Marriner ignored the protests.</p>
              <p>On 72 minutes, Dimitar Berbatov broke down the left wing and found Hernandez with a pinpoint centre but the striker's solid volley whizzed past the far upright.</p>
              <p>Tuncay's entrance gave Stoke a touch more class up top and his wonder strike brought the scores level with nine minutes left. He cut in from the right wing before unleashing a wicked curler that left Van Der Sar beaten all ends up.</p>
              <p>The home fans were still in dreamland when Berbatov caused more mayhem, Evra acrobatically touched the ball across goal and Hernandez touched the ball home.</p>
              <p>Four minutes of added time gave Stoke hope of another equaliser but although Sorensen went up for a late corner, United stood firm, with Nani denied a third thanks to a brilliant save from the Danish keeper.</p>

              <p>i think the inital intent for Gary playing is to stablise the back with his experience. unfortunaely, for him, his only and major injury has robbed him of pace and timing which are essential in a wing defender, and hence his frequent fouls now.</p>

              <p>i think every forward has its plus/minus, for berba, he is quality but he lacks pace. for me, he is one who links the attack and holds on to ball to allow the others to join in. </p>
              <p>given his age, I think he is not going to stay long @ MUFC, and hopefully, he can pump in more goals before he eventually retires.</p>

              <p>lol you should watch more football. i think i've watched more
                      games,epl,primera,serie A,bundesliga than you eat rice, and i can
                      safely tell you berbatov is crap.</p>
              <p>Firstly he will NEVER EVER perform as a lone striker, secondly,
                      he needs assists, particularly a strike partner to assist him.
                      chicharito is a goal poacher, unlike rooney who can assist.</p>
              <p>don't expect berbatov to score anything, you should be happy he
                      doesn't lose the ball easily.</p>
              <p>i always lol at people who think berbatov is good just because
                      berbatov scored a hat-trick.</p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Watching more games doesnt make you an instant analyst.</p>
              <p>You must know that different league operate differently. You might be a gem in one league but a total flop in another. Think Forlan, Huntelaar, Kezman, Benzema, Luca Toni, Beckham, Mcmanaman, etc etc.</p>
              <p>But, on the other hand, I have doubts as to why Fergie paid so much for Berbatov rather than keeping Tevez.</p>
              <p>Berbatov is a targetman - a rather weak one. He does not have the physiqe to match up like other targetmen in the league Torres and Drogba. Which is why Fergie always play 2 wingers to support him, think Giggs, Nani, Valencia, Park, Obertan, Ronaldo, so that they can feed off the loose ball from Berbatov.</p>
              <p>He lacks in pace and power but made it all up with his technique. His first touch is always first class, did you see how he brings the ball down with just a deft flick?</p>
              <p>And for your information, a striker who scored without assistance is either A. a skillful and selfish bloke. B. at the top of his game. C. Maradona.</p>
              <p>You must be crazy to say that Torres can score on his own and Drogba too without their teammates' passes. Gerrard and Lampard must be playing for Tampines Rovers since Duric scored over 300 S-League Goals.</p>
              <p>Yes, a Hat-Trick does not make you and instant hit but if those are the winning goals, it certainly speaks volume about the player right? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Neville has lost his game and should leave the game if he wants to retain some dignity.</p>
              <p>Scholes' early season form deserted him and he's playing well under his usual standard.</p>
              <p>Fergie should have seen how his old guards falter this season and better make full use of the January transfer window to seal some good deals.</p>
              <p>Overall a pretty intense match with chances going for both sides.</p>
              <p>Neville should have been sent off.</p>
              <p>Evra had 2 penalty appeals turned down, 1 for Delap's push in the box and the other a Shawcross' hand ball.</p>
              <p>Tuncay scored a beauty and should perhaps be on the winning side.</p>
              <p>Finally the away draw curse is broken and hopefully it will kickstart United's season.</p>
