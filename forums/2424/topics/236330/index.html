Begiristain said: "It's true that we met but I don't want it to appear that Cristiano Ronaldo was the only subject we talked about. "Mendes is my friend and we speak often. This meeting had been arranged for a long time.<br><br>"Of course, it is logical that we are interested in Ronaldo but I must stress that we are a big club and we will work in the proper way." It is understood that Begiristain was given the go-ahead by Barcelona to pursue Ronaldo last week after a meeting at the Nou Camp concluded that the club could afford to put together one of the most expensive packages in football history.<br><br>Vice-president Ferran Soriano said: "We have looked at it and we are able to do this project." But United chief executive David Gill has already stressed that even a Â£45million bid would not be enough to buy a player contracted to the club until 2010 and Ronaldo is also keen to stay at Old Trafford and win the Premiership.<br><br>Ronaldo said: "I've got a contract with United. If they speak to anyone it's my agent, not me. I told my agent I'm happy here and want to continue. "It's a kind of football in Spaint hat attracts me, but at the moment I don't want to leave here. I've been here for a while and every year I try to get better and better.<br><br>"I've had to adapt to the culture, the football, the life and I think I've adapted well. "It's more or less what I expected to happen. I'm enjoying my career here. "We've got a good lead in the Premiership and the chances of winning the league this year are great.<br><br>"Chelsea are a great team, but we're on the right path. "We're playing good football, we've been the consistent team and if things continue that way we can win the championship. "My dream of winning the league is very much alive. "I want to win all the trophies. It could almost be the perfect year." Speaking in this month's issue of 4-4-2 magazine, Ronaldo speaks about life after football and will raise a few smiles with his assertion that he would like to become an actor after his playing career ends.<br><br>He added: "I could see myself as an actor further down the line - that could be interesting. "Playing the role of a comedian is more difficult, but I might be capable of doing anything. I have a wide range of tastes, but it is something to think about one day."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Most of us also forget about Ole Gunnar Solskjaer... He came to united at only 23 almost 11 yrs ago already and has played very well for united over the years without any complains even when he was not playing.<br><br>There were many clubs who came in for him over the years including Tottenham Hotspur in 1998, with an offer of Â£5.5 million but he was never interested to leave even tho he would have been first choice at other clubs.<br><br>He should be consider one of Fergie's best buy as at only 1 or 1.5m he has scored alot of important goals for united during the years they won the titles, the doubles and the Treble... And even till today, he is still scoring important goals like the one against Villa recently.<br><br>And it seems his future is still to be with united after he retires from playing...<br><br></div>
