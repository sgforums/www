He came to united at only 23 almost 11 yrs ago already and has played very well for united over the years without any complains even when he was not playing.<br><br>There were many clubs who came in for him over the years including Tottenham Hotspur in 1998, with an offer of Â£5.5 million but he was never interested to leave even tho he would have been first choice at other clubs.<br><br>He should be consider one of Fergie's best buy as at only 1 or 1.5m he has scored alot of important goals for united during the years they won the titles, the doubles and the Treble... And even till today, he is still scoring important goals like the one against Villa recently.<br><br>And it seems his future is still to be with united after he retires from playing...<br><br></div></blockquote>Different tinking bah...

And there is their other target Gareth Bale... Many clubs have come in for him strongly including gunners and spurs... Spurs even went as far as promissing him a first team place and even had a $10m offer on the table... Despite that, he is still keen to go to man u whose offer was only $8m. Off course in the end, it was down to Southampton's boss George Burley who wants him to stay for another season or at least till the end of this.<br><br>On ticket sales... They are probably the only club that have a 76,000 stadium and usually full on match days... Compare to Chelsea who have only a 42,000 stadium yet find it difficult to fill it on almost every match day.<br><br>Merchandising, well they were the highest-ranked of eight English clubs in the top 20, their annual revenue of Â£167.8million and excludes transfer fees, value added tax and other sales-related taxes, they are still making more profits than any other club. Their AIG deal is worth Â£18million a year so i think their endorsements are still pretty healthy not to include their Nike deal.

            <div class='col-md body'>Every Manager will have their fair share of flops signings...<br><br>Benitez for example have since he arrived in the summer of 2004... bought Josemi, Antonio Nunez, Mauricio Pellegrino, Fernando Morientes, Antonio Barragan and Jan Kromkamp. All have been bought and then sold again within just a yr or 2.<br><br>Then there is also jose... But his are bigger price flops campare to ah ben's : Tiago Mendes $10m, JaroÂšÃ­k $7m, Paulo Ferreira $ 13.2m, Asier del Horno $8m, SWP $21m, Mikel John Obi $16m, Salomon Kalou $8, Khalid Boulahrouz $8.5m, Perhaps we can also include Lassana Diarra $3m &amp; Shevchenko - $30.8m...<br><br>So who doesn't have flop signings?

Â“There might be an attraction abroad with the climate but what you get at Old Trafford is a packed house of 76,000 people every week. Â“You donÂ’t get that with the Spanish giants, only when itÂ’s a big game Â— we fill out every week.Â”<br><br>Fears grew about a deal being done with Barca this week when RonaldoÂ’s agent was snapped with the clubÂ’s director of football, Txiki Begiristain. But Ferguson said: Â“I think that was just the agent trying to make himself look good.Â”<br><br>Barca and Real are ready to bid whatever it takes to get Ronaldo, 22, and could even bust the world-record Â£47million Real paid for Zinedine Zidane six years ago. But United are offering Ronaldo a new five-year contract worth Â£26m to keep him at the club until 2012.<br><br></div>
