              <p><strong>Manchester United face an FA Cup semi-final against Manchester City as their bid for a treble continues. </strong></p>
              <p>United, who beat Arsenal 2-0 in their quarter-final on Saturday, were drawn against fierce rivals City or Reading before Roberto Mancini's men edged to a 1-0 victory over the last remaining Championship team in the competition.</p>
              <p>The other semi-final will be between Bolton and Stoke, who beat West Ham 2-1.</p>
              <p>United are still battling on three fronts as they sit top of the Barclays Premier League and welcome Marseille to Old Trafford on Tuesday for the second leg of their Champions League last-16 tie.</p>
              <p>City have not won the FA Cup since 1969 and boss Roberto Mancini is under pressure to deliver silverware, having spent heavily in the pursuit of success.</p>
              <p>Bolton's FA Cup drought stretches back even further, to 1958, while Stoke have never reached the final.</p>
              <p>Both semi-finals will take place at Wembley on the weekend of April 16-17.</p>

              <p>He is still smarting from Roo's amazing Premier League clincher last month and said: "We're looking to gain revenge for Wayne Rooney's overhead kick.</p>

              <p>"But we showed great resilience to get through and that's all that matters."</p>

              <p>And the Belgian star, 24, said: "I'll let you guess how much it means - and how much the next opponents mean to us.</p>
              <p>"We're happy to play them - there is no easy way to get to the final.</p>
              <p>"We're looking forward to it and there will be no complaints from us."</p>
              <p>United defender Rio Ferdinand, who missed the 2-0 win over Arsenal on Saturday through injury, tweeted: "Let's av iiit with 'em."</p>
              <p>Stoke play Bolton in the other semi-final - also at Wembley - after beating West Ham 2-1 yesterday with goals from Robert Huth and Danny Higginbotham.</p>
              <p>Former Sunderland defender Higginbotham said: "Stoke is a great club and it's come on leaps and bounds in the last few years."</p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Roberto Mancini</strong></span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> has revealed </strong></span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Carlos Tevez</strong></span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> could be out for up to four weeks after sustaining a hamstring injury during Monday's 3-0 defeat at Liverpool.</strong></span></p>
              <p>The news means Manchester City will be without their captain for Saturday's FA Cup semi-final against Manchester United.</p>
              <p>Mancini had initially said he expected Tevez to be out for a fortnight after he was substituted in the first half at Anfield, but it now appears likely the forward will struggle to return before City's penultimate Premier League game against Stoke on May 14.</p>
              <p>"Tevez is not available for Saturday," Mancini said. "I think he will recover in three or four weeks. It is a big problem but we can't take any risks. We have six games left and hopefully we can get Carlos back for the last two or three games."</p>
              <p>Mancini is now encouraging <span style="color: #000000;">Mario Balotelli</span><span style="color: #000000;"> and </span><span style="color: #000000;">Edin Dzeko</span><span style="color: #000000;"> to seize the opportunity.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Balotelli has shown signs of his quality since his summer move from Inter and has scored ten goals in all competitions, but he has also attracted criticism for his work-rate and off-field behaviour. Dzeko, meanwhile, has not yet scored a Premier League goal, although he has scored once in the FA Cup against Notts County and twice in the Europa League against Aris Salonika.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">"I still have to decide what to do [in the semi-final], but both players know this is an important chance for them," Mancini said. "Every player knows this is an important moment for the club. If we win, we can go to a final, so every player will give 100%."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">In defence, City will at least be boosted by the return of </span><span style="color: #000000;">Micah Richards</span><span style="color: #000000;">, who was</span> back in training on Wednesday after suffering a hamstring injury last month.</p>
              <p>"Micah Richards is available," Mancini said. "He trained two days ago and again yesterday. He will be okay."</p>

              <p><span>Ferguson otherwise has a clean bill of health for one of the most significant derby clashes in recent memory, with midfielder Anderson pushing for a start after coming through a midweek reserve-team outing.</span></p>
              <p><span>'He is much better now,' said Ferguson. 'We thought the Chelsea game would be too much for him because we knew what the pace was likely to be. </span></p>
              <p><span>'The semi should be a very exciting game. It is a derby match in London, which is unusual in itself. </span></p>

              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson is in a relaxed mood ahead of the FA Cup semi-final with City, putting total faith in his players.</strong></p>
              <p>The boss has a real selection headache as he ponders his line-up for the Wembley encounter but feels blessed to have so many top-class talents jostling for places.</p>
              <p>However, he is not stressing about the fact that any bid for trophies at this stage of the season is always on a knife-edge.</p>
              <p>"You can worry about a lot of things," said the boss. "I worry about my team I'm going to pick. I hope I pick the right team.</p>
              <p>"I've got a group of players who are confident going into games. Their attitude is great and I couldn't ask for a better situation than I've got at the moment.</p>
              <p>"The players are on form, the squad has got stronger with players back now and the bench reflected that on Tuesday night.</p>
              <p>"I would say I'm lucky I've got the bunch of players I've got. It doesn't matter which game I'm going in to, I would believe in these players.</p>
              <p>"The momentum is fantastic at this time of the season - to have it now is very good."</p>
              <p>City will be highly motivated for the latest instalment of the Manchester derby as they seek to end their painful 35-year trophy drought. Yet Sir Alex refuses to accept that City's increased financial clout makes the fixture any more intense.</p>
              <p>"City will always be our rivals because they're our local rivals," he stated. "No doubt about that.</p>
              <p>"It's a derby game and, in this city, it's always been a derby game - that's never changed.</p>
              <p>"Everybody wants to win the derby game."</p>
