              <p>paul scholes is the only man u player that can spray 60 yard balls with almost perfect accuracy u want him to retire ? just coz of 1 stupid red card u shit on the players like no tomorrow ?  its obvious that half the team were tired from the chelsea game and could'nt play well dont start shitting on them .</p>
              <p>no 1 except rooney could do long balls that well as paul scholes and u want him to retire? carrick and park could'nt even help  to support the midfield obviously cuz they are tired and knowing scholes he needs that midfield support to cover his mistakes . the tiredness just made the weakness clearer.</p>
              <p>pls just stop shitting on scholes like that like how many ppl were shitting on giggs when he was off form . they would bounce back for sure in the next game</p>

              <p>well, if you've been observing man u game after game, scholes is making a lot of such tackles these days, more than when he was younger. And to lift the boot so high up in a cup semi final was just not very wise. Didnt realise the extent of the damage till I saw zabaleta's badly bruised thigh.</p>
              <p>Sad to say, players didnt turn up today. Maybe only vidic. Even if valencia wasnt playing well, i thought it was weird to take him out for hernandez. All it takes is one cross for the latter to score, sometimes.</p>
              <p>I thought park was really poor. He couldnt hold the ball well in the final third to distribute the killer passes. Carrick...what more can I say.....sigh....he shd be a veteran by now but he made that amateurish error, exactly like those leisurely football games.</p>
              <p>I thought ferdinand was mature enough not to react to balotelli's petulance but what to do? It really hurt to lose to city. It means such a big deal to them just to beat united.</p>
              <p>Next time play big games, just shut up and do the job. Utd players were talking about how city lack the experience, not closely knitted enough bla bla bla...and look what a fine display they gave.</p>

              <p>Berbatov cannot be alone up front, because every cross and pass pisses/annoys him to hell, must have another striker up front with him to support.</p>
              <p>Scholes, getting older, no complaints, we all know what kind of player he is when you put him in this situation.</p>
              <p>The full force of the blame should just go to Carrick, again. Apart from his one-off amazing passes (i.e. Chelsea game, to Giggs then assisting Rooney goal) and really rare penetrating passes, he is seriously getting worse at his overall game, already his style is changed from getting forward, to staying back, holding the ball and passing short. But now pass short also can fuck up, if that also cannot then how. Every time he's on the field, and when he has the ball, and when a player gets close to him, I always panic because he loses it so easily, or makes a decision too late to pass allowing others to nick it. (As seen today, again.)</p>
              <p>How many times has he made a mistake, (All players do, but...) and almost always ends up costing United a goal. Others make a mistake, they go in and help defend etc. Everytime they lost the ball today, people walking back, standing around. Maybe it's because they're tired from previous games, but come on, at least show some drive or some form of, you know, determination to actually want to win this.</p>
              <p>Also dunno what the fuck they thinking when they keep backpeddling to the centrebacks and VDS, giving City the opportunity to press hard. Maybe it's a counterattacking tactic, but the balls forward have been depressing. I wish they actually played the way they did against Chelsea, forwards, more crosses in, rather than everytime they do actually get forward, they pass it back and then lose it in their half.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>TLDR</strong>: Sell Carrick. Sell Berbatov. (Apart from his 'amazing' season, and amazing footwork, he never seems to work well/settle, could prolly be just me, but it's fucking annoying and depressing to see someone so negative on the field, frustrated at almost every single pass that doesn't go his way.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Never have I been so frustrated at a loss. Want to lose at least lose knowing that they did everything they could, and actually fought with a fucking speck of determination, and eagerness to progress. How can you win against them almost every time and lose to them in a semi-final? Really shows which side is more determined. And this was a fucking semi-final, not another BPL game, or some stage of some cup they can't be bothered with. (*cough* Carling)</p>

              <p>Cannot blame one single player cos the whole team didn't play well enough... Of course their 2 high energy games against Chelsea took a lot out of them so this was kind of expected especially when they are not playing against an average side but one with lots of star quality players...</p>
              <p>If we watch the whole match again, we can see it's not only Carrick who made mistakes which they normally don't make kind... Park, Nani, Valencia all made them too but only were not punished... Even Vds made mistakes in this match and it resulted with Carrick's which led to the goal...</p>
              <p>In a way, I don't see it as a bad thing cos if they didn't get a wake up call sooner... It could happen in their league matches to come. Now the players are hurt and eager to make up for this which can only be good for their league challenge cos the league is still very much in the balance and Arsenal can still very well upset everything...</p>
              <p>A draw for the gunners today would be good... Let's hope Liverpool don't kelong again like they did last season... At least there is no Gerrard to 'give' a goal to the opponent this time... Remember how he pass back and gave Drogba that goal... Totally unprofessional...</p>
