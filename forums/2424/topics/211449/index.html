            <div class='col-md body'>Tomasz Kuszczak claims he is ready to rival Edwin van der Sar to be United's first-choice keeper.<br><br>The Polish goalkeeper deputised for the ailing Dutchman against Arsenal, and his performance was one of the major positives to come from the defeat.<br><br>Kuszczak told The Sun: "My idol was always Peter Schmeichel - and Edwin van der Sar. ItÂ’s unbelievable to be following them but slowly the emotion from having been transferred to Manchester United is falling away.<br><br>"Now I want to realise part two of my plan - to fight for a regular first- team place, because thatÂ’s why I came here after all.<br><br>"IÂ’m having a rivalry with Edwin van der Sar, a living legend, but that only motivates me further. If I was afraid of playing I wouldnÂ’t be at Manchester United.<br><br>"IÂ’m not afraid. IÂ’ll get games and I hope that when IÂ’m playing I do well.<br><br>"I got my chance quicker than I expected because IÂ’ve only been at the club a few weeks. But this step forward is fantastic for me and the adrenalin shock was massive."<br><br>Kuszczak's competitive debut was an eventful affair. Having conceded and saved a 12th-minute penalty, he enjoyed an impressive afternoon before Emmanuel Adebayor's late winner.<br><br>He said: "It was my second taste of playing at Old Trafford for Manchester United and I would have liked to have kept a clean sheet like in the 3-0 pre-season win against Seville.<br><br>"It didnÂ’t work out like that but I gave people a lot of emotion, especially my dad Mirek.<br><br>"He told me that the penalty raised his blood pressure but when the ref pointed to the spot it was a big shock for me too!"<br><br>Tomasz has settled well in Manchester after moving from West Brom, and he admits he has already been forced to raise his game in training.<br><br>He said: "IÂ’ve only been here a little while but I feel like IÂ’m at home. Everyone is nice and there are no stuck-up stars, you can talk to anyone.<br><br>"I know that IÂ’ve got a lot more work ahead of me and IÂ’ve got to improve certain parts of my game. ThatÂ’s the best way to have success.<br><br>"Playing with such phenomenal players, I think I can go really far here. You raise your game just by being around them to match them."<br><br><a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=364908" rel="nofollow">http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&amp;newsid=364908</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>He is a good keeper but a little nervous at times in the Arsenal match. He still need to settle in better. With VDS, the defenders were more confident... But it was arsenal after all... give him the benefit of a doubt for now cos he did do rather well in that match.</div>
