              <p>Wayne Rooney has reiterated his love for Manchester United by stating that he wants to spend the rest of his career with the club.</p>
              <p>Since arriving from Everton in 2004, Rooney has become a huge fans' favourite at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>He still has over three years left on his current deal, but wants to follow the examples of club stalwarts Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes and Gary Neville - who have all spent more than a decade playing for the Red Devils.</p>
              <p>"I've always said that as long as United want me I'm happy to stay at the club," Rooney told <em>Inside United</em> magazine. "I don't want to leave. I love United and I have no reason to
              think about moving. I'm sure I'll be here for a long time.</p>
              <p>"I hope I'm still at United when I'm the same age as guys like Ryan, Paul and Gary."</p>
              <p>Meawhile,
              Gary Neville has declared himself fit and ready to help Manchester
              United get back on the championship trail. Neville has missed 11
              matches with a groin injury but returned to action in a reserve-team
              game at Newcastle on Monday.</p>
              <p>The 34-year-old is now in contention
              to face Aston Villa in the Premier League on Sunday, with Porto to
              follow in a Champions League quarter-final at Old Trafford barely 48
              hours later.</p>
              <p>Neville is bound to be a bit rusty after so long
              out. But the 34-year-old is eager to help United get their campaign on
              track once more after successive defeats against Liverpool and Fulham
              prior to the international break.</p>
              <p>"I have got the opportunity to
              be fit now and hopefully be available for Sunday, Tuesday and the other
              games we have coming up with are so vital for us," he told MUTV. "We
              need every player fit but obviously I have got to concentrate on myself
              and make sure I am ready."</p>
              <p>United have seen a seven-point lead
              hacked down to one amid their mini slump and with Liverpool in action
              before the Red Devils this weekend, Rafael Benitez's side could be top
              - having played two games more - before out-of-form Villa head to Old
              Trafford.</p>
              <p>"It is a hugely important game for us," Neville said of
              the Villa clash. "We know what we need to do and we need the crowd
              behind us.</p>
              <p>"I don't think anyone will be underestimating the
              importance of the match. There are no more chances for us now. We need
              to start winning games and get back on a winning run."</p>
