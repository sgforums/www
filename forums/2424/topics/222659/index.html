            <div class='col-md body'>MANCHESTER UNITED defenders Wes Brown and Mikael Silvestre are considering their Old Trafford futures.<br><br>Brown, who has started just one league game in the last nine, has seen boss Alex Ferguson to voice his frustration. The England centre-back, 27, was not even on the bench against Chelsea on Sunday and his contract is up at the end of next season.<br><br>Frenchman Silvestre, 29, has not started a league game since the 1-0 defeat against Arsenal in September. He is third choice left-back behind Gabriel Heinze and Patrice Evra. Silvestre has now said he would be ready to leave Old Trafford to play in SpainÂ’s La Liga.<br><br>Asked if he would consider leaving United, Silvestre replied: Â“Sure, why not? Â“WhatÂ’s certain is that, for the moment, I am excluding any possibility of a return to France. Â“ItÂ’s not because I donÂ’t love my country but simply because I know the league too well.<br><br>"I would like to discover a new style of play. IÂ’ve done Italy in the colours of Inter, England in the jersey of the Red Devils. All thatÂ’s left for me is Spain.Â”<br><br>Brown has grown up at United progressing from the academy. He was once described by Ferguson as Â‘the most naturally gifted English defenderÂ’. But the player believes he is at an age where he should be a first-team regular.<br><br>There will be no shortage of takers for Brown, who would like to stay in the North West. That will alert the likes of Bolton with Brown available for around Â£4m, while Silvestre is valued at the same figure.<br><br>United take on Everton at Old Trafford tonight likely to field the same side which drew against Chelsea. According to UnitedÂ’s assistant manager Carlos Queiroz, there is still a sense of disappointment at Old Trafford that they did not win.<br><br>He said: Â“We are never pleased when we donÂ’t win. Chelsea had more possession in the second half but I think we created the best opportunities. Â“Now it is important to react against Everton with the right mentality and motivation, especially with so many other important games coming up.<br><br>Â“We need to be in a good position in January to attack the second stage of the Premiership campaign. Â“If we are in a strong position at the end of January then we should be able to move forward. I honestly believe we can win the title.Â”</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>brown is loyal to SAF, and while MUFC needs him, he won't leave.<br>Silvestre may leave as Evra and Heinze become more stable.<br><br>we are in the need of more people, not people leaving.<br><br>GVN needs a break, same as Scholes, Giggs, Rooney, Saha, Ronaldo.<br>And we need people to rotate in and out.<br><br>KRichardson, Fletcher and JoShea are just stop gaps.<br><br>Unless we get more quality, the best we can aim for are those short bursts such as Cups and not long term like League championships.<br><br>But seriously, if we manage to deny Chelsea for one season or two, I believe RA may leave, and I would love to see Peter "RAT"yon eat his words.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't want Brown to leave leh.. He is a damn good tackler.. Silvestre well he can go I guess if he don't want to remain a back up player.. He seems surplus to requirements.. LB can fit in O'Shea, Heinze, Evra and CB got Ferdinand, Vidic, Heinze, Brown, O'Shea.. Wahaha Silvestre ppor guy but thanks for remaining loyal to Man U all these years..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, Silvestre was supposed to sign for Liverpool but he came to United instead. Forlan too - he was supposed to sign for Middlesborough.<br><br>I would like to see Brown stay and sadly, Silvestre leave. Cos United has too many defend options. It's difficult to keep everyone happy. Remember, 2 of United Defence Prospect is out on loan at the moment - Pique and Bardsley.<br><br>With those 2 back, United will have virtually 2 players in each position so I guess one or two of the more "matured" ones will have to go.<br><br>Cheers.<br>C.K</div>
