              <h1 class="sIFR-ignore">Rafa: That was the battle, now for the war</h1>
              <div id="div_article_main_content">
              <p>Rafa Benitez was quick to dismiss the hullabaloo surrounding Liverpool’s mauling of Manchester United on Saturday.</p>
              <p>The 4-1 thrashing of the league leaders at Old Trafford means that
              there is once again life in the title race, even if Liverpool remain
              four points adrift having played a game more.</p>
              <p>Before the game Benitez had mad no bones about the fact his side had
              to win to maintain hopes of the club’s first ever Premier League
              trophy.</p>
              <p>It was a triumph made to look all the more impressive by the fact
              that it arrived just four days after the 4-0 win at home to Real Madrid
              but Benitez was predictably level-headed.</p>
              <p>“The best week is when you can win titles,” he said on the club’s
              official website. “To win games is part of the battle but you have to
              win the war which is the most important thing.</p>
              <p>"It depends on United at the end because they have to lose some
              games and we have to win almost every one, so we are in a better
              position.</p>
              <p>"We have more belief, more confidence and we have to get three points now in every game and then see what happens.</p>
              <p>"In football anything can happen. Clearly it will be difficult but we can win every game.</p>
              <p>"We always approach every game to win and we can beat anyone as we
              have shown this week. You can always win every game when you have good
              players, good supporters behind you and a very good staff.</p>
              <p>"We need to be consistent, focused and concentrate on each game and don't make mistakes."</p>
              <p>The Spaniard was equally humble when asked about the game itself,
              preferring to heap praise on everyone else associated with the club
              rather than take the acclaim for himself.</p>
              <p>"I am really happy for my team, the club and the supporters,"
              Benitez told reporters at his after match press conference. "It’s
              always very difficult when you play United, whether it be at home or
              away, so to score four goals here I have to be really pleased.</p>
              <p>"I'd also like to say thanks to my staff who have been working very
              hard. While I was answering questions at the press conference, all my
              staff were preparing the players for this game.</p>
              <p>"The most important thing was to see my team get three points and see how well the players played.</p>
              <p>"Manchester United have a fantastic team and a fantastic squad, and
              you saw their bench with the three players they brought on, but our
              game plan was clear. We tried to stop them playing and we closed the
              spaces and made it very difficult for them to create chances.</p>
              <p>"This week we have beaten two of the top sides in Europe in Real
              Madrid and Manchester United, and scored four goals in both games so
              that is fantastic and again, we have to be really pleased."</p>

              <p>firstly,Poo deserved the result.</p>
              <p>However, I think the rot started at the game vs Inter in the 1st
              leg, where MU did not manage to get a result. hence they had to produce
              one in OT, robbing the team of the veterans in the game vs Poo..</p>
              <p>Considering
              the importance of UCL, SAF gambled by putting his veterans in that game
              to secure a quarter finals, given the lead MU had in EPL.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Vidic has to shoulder blame for two goals. I felt if he had just boot
              the ball as he usually does, Torres won't have scored the equaliser.And his red card, robs the subs of the chance to settle and play. But a bigger puzzling factor remains -&gt;</p>
              <p>Looking at the stats, Gerrard and Torres played in 9 of Poo's 29games, and of the 9 they played, they thrashed.. So why is no one tracking Gerrard?</p>
              <p>Why is anderson in but not fletcher? Surely, we need protection from his surging runs.. which leads to the 2nd goal..Fletcher did not play in Inter game, and is well-rested.. And he will provide more steel than Anderson.</p>
              <p>I love this caption -&gt;"United is the champion of the world and europe, but we came and whopped the floor with them". and hope SAF nailed this on OT's dressing room.</p>
              <p>Bottomline, we lost the battle, let's focus on winning the war.</p>

              <p>Why can't you people just accept this simple fact, SAF's tactics
              failed. Manu came straight at us, we were playing defensive,
              looking for a draw.</p>
              <p>The gameplan was simple, let Manu attack, draw them in and
              counter-attack.</p>

              <p>MU lost to a better team, no doubt. but sadly, you are wrong again.</p>
              <p>At home, MU has to come out and attack.. Do you think MU will play like poo, always soaking pressure and pump the ball to Torres and Gerrard?</p>
              <p>Why do you think MU should stay back and defend like Poo be it in European games, Home and away? playing negative football..</p>
              <p>yes, MU lost to a better team of the day, but please put your head above water, and compare what MU is aiming vs what Poo is aiming for...</p>

              <p>rubbish.. why should MU let water?? the many years, I support MU, attack is their policy, and playing attacking positive football is their way..</p>
              <p>well, it may not get the results in European stage, but at least, most MU fans will stand by their brand of football.. same as Gunners fans will do..</p>

              <p>Tactically we were spot-on . Simple tactically move to deny any United's chances .</p>
              <p>We knew United will come at us , and we knew , which routes and movements they will adopt ...</p>
              <p>I don't agree we were defensive thru out the match , what will u do if u your opponent come at you ? Sit down and waiting to be slaughtered ? No right ? U defend , right ?</p>
              <p>But the diff is , we took our chances !</p>
              <p>We created the chances , we grap those chances available .... unlike United , United can't even break down our backline !</p>
              <p>We too had pressured United with our control in the midfield , United lost the plot in the middle .</p>
              <p>Our first goal is credit to Torres for putting pressure on Vidic , and Vidic had under-estimate Torres ....</p>
              <p>Our second was created cos we pressured United ....</p>
              <p>Vidic's red card was also due to our pressure .... And the dead-ball was just too good to ignore by AURELIO !</p>
              <p>Dossenna's goal is nothing ... doesn't matter too much , we've won !</p>
              <p>Same old story , we were the better team , and WON !!</p>
              <p>Nothing of a fluke .</p>

              <p>Obviously United's right side , occupied by Vidic and that French guy is the loopholes for United .</p>
              <p>Our first 3 goals were created all from that right side !!!</p>
              <p>Rafa's instructions : All movements and attacks inititate into Liverpool's right side , where the weaknesses were .</p>
