              </span></p><p><strong>The striker's future has
              become a hot topic, with United fans urging the club to keep the
              Argentinian following the end of his two-year loan spell this summer. </strong></p>
              <p>But a deal has so far not been agreed, with Tevez also unhappy at the amount of time he has spent on the bench this season.</p>
              <p>The 25-year-old told Argentinian TV station TYC: "I know that I am not going to continue at Manchester United.</p>
              <p>"I feel that they have lacked respect towards me. It's not about
              whether they pay £5million more or £5million less, but I feel I have
              been badly treated.</p>
              <p>"There are ways in which the club is managed that I don't
              understand. When you don't agree with the manager in how the club is
              run... I don't have faith in a lot of things that happen here.</p>
              <p>"I've been here for two years and the directors have never come to speak to me. Not once have I had a meeting with them.</p>
              <p>"Therefore, it's best that I leave the club so as not to clash
              with (manager) Alex Ferguson and the directors. Neither do I understand
              why I don't play in the team.</p>
              <p>"I've asked (adviser) Kia (Joorabchian) not to speak to me
              about offers during the next 10 days. I want to concentrate only on the
              final matches that we have to play.</p>
              <p>"Afterwards, I've got a month to take a decision and choose where to go."</p>
              <p>Tevez was tearful as he waved to the fans after yesterday's 0-0
              draw with Arsenal, which sealed a third successive Premier League
              triumph.</p>
              <p>"It's emotional," he said. "I like Manchester and I like the fans. But maybe it is goodbye. It is very difficult."</p>

              <p><strong>Hundreds of Manchester United fans reportedly staged a protest outside Old Trafford yesterday in a bid to keep striker Carlos Tevez at the club.</strong></p>

              that handed them the title, United were then presented with the Premier

              the mood later turned sour as fans protested outside the directors’

              for Tevez to stay.<br><br>Earlier in the day the Argentine appeared to have bid farewell to the Old Trafford faithful.<br><br>Despite starting the game, Tevez was substituted in the second half, which prompted loud boos from around the ground.<br><br>The striker responded by waving back and later admitted on <span class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;"><span style="color: #0464d1;"><span class="kLink" style="color: #0464d1 ! important; font-family: Verdana,Arial; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">television</span></span></span> that he had possibly been saying his goodbyes.<br><br>Whilst manager Ferguson also reiterated after the game that the club would like to keep Tevez, his future still remains unclear.<br><br>Yet the fans have certainly made their feelings clear, with the <em>News of the World</em> claiming their protests continued for hours after the game.<br><br>Whether

              <h1>Tevez future to be sorted in June</h1>
              <p class="first"><strong>Manchester United chief executive David Gill has
              told the BBC he expects the future of forward Carlos Tevez to be
              resolved by early June.</strong></p>
              <p class="first"><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/45785000/jpg/_45785746_007333002-1.jpg" alt="" width="226" height="282"></p>
              <p><strong>Tevez was quoted as suggesting he
              would leave the club and appeared to wave goodbye to fans as team-mates
              lifted the Premier League trophy on Saturday. </strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"The actual situation will be cleared up in early June," said Gill. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"Carlos has done very well. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">We'd like him to stay but the actual economic situation needs to be clarified." </span></span></p>
              <p></p>
              <p>He also confirmed the two parties were discussing a fee in the region of £25m for Tevez's signature.</p>
              <p>Gill
              told BBC Radio 5 Live's Sportsweek programme he had met with Tevez'
              adviser Kia Joorabchian, who owns the Argentine's economic rights, in
              midweek, but said both parties had agreed "not to continue negotiations
              through the press".</p>
              <p>He added: "It is an unusual situation. When
              we did our deal to acquire Carlos two years ago, his economic rights
              were owned by a company controlled by Kia Joorabchian. That's a feature
              of a lot of South American players.</p>
              <p>"We have to deal with Kia Joorabchian - we paid a loan fee for two
              years, then there is a fixed fee we have to pay his company if we wish
              to take up our option to acquire Carlos, at which point we would own
              him 100% in football terms, and any other club would deal with us.</p>
              <p>"Whatever
              happens to him in the summer, that situation will be clarified. If he
              goes to another club in the Premier League, then that club would own
              him outright."</p>
              <p>Manager Sir Alex Ferguson believes a compromise is needed because
              the current economic situation has changed drastically since Tevez was
              signed on loan two years ago with a view to a permanent deal.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ferguson told the Sunday Times: "</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The demands originally put to us were unrealistic. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"Like other clubs, we have to be aware of the consequences of the credit crunch. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"It's no time to be careless about money. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"As far as Tevez is concerned, everybody would be best served by a willingness to compromise." </span></span></p>
              <p>However Tevez appeared to be confirming his exit from Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>He was quoted as telling Argentine television: "I know I am not going to continue at Manchester United.</p>
              <p>"I
              feel that they have lacked respect towards me. It's not about whether
              they pay £5m more or £5m less, but I feel I have been badly treated."</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Gill
              admitted he had not seen those comments, but said: "If Carlos said
              that, I think it's borne out of frustration. If I speak to him at the
              dressing room or training ground he's always personable and friendly. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">"He
              and his advisers have to understand these are big decisions to be taken
              with large amounts of money, and the timeline isn't as quick as some
              people would want it to be." </span></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson</strong></span><strong> believes that a settlement over </strong><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Carlos Tevez</strong></span><strong>'s future with </strong><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span><strong> can be reached if the player's representatives are willing to compromise on their "unrealistic" demands. However Tevez told the Argentinian station TYC last night that he had not been shown respect, that he does not like the way the club is run and that he is likely leave this summer.</strong></p>
              <p>Ferguson added that he believes Cristiano Ronaldo will stay at the club and that <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/barcelona"><span style="color: #005689;">Barcelona</span></a> will present a more difficult challenge than <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/chelsea"><span style="color: #005689;">Chelsea</span></a> in Wednesday week's <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/championsleague"><span style="color: #005689;">Champions League</span></a> final.</p>
              <p>"The demands originally put to us [to make Tevez's loan permanent] were unrealistic. Like other clubs, we have to be aware of the consequences of the credit crunch," Ferguson told the Sunday Times. "It's no time to be careless about money. As far as Tevez is concerned, everybody would be best served by a willingness to compromise."</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2009/may/17/manchester-united-lack-respect-says-carlos-tevez"><span style="color: #005689;">Tevez told TYC</span></a>: "I know that I am not going to continue at Manchester United. I feel that they have lacked respect towards me. It's not about whether they pay £5m more or £5m less, but I feel I have been badly treated.</p>
              <p>"There are ways in which the club is managed that I don't understand. When you don't agree with the manager in how the club is run ... I don't have faith in a lot of things that happen here."</p>
              <p>Ferguson's other major staff concern this summer will be Ronaldo, who has consistently been linked with a move to <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/realmadrid"><span style="color: #005689;">Real Madrid</span></a>, but the United manager claimed his club are "in the driving seat".</p>
              <p>He said: "The indications I'm getting from the dressing room are that the other players don't feel he is behaving as if he's discontented. Obviously you can't stop people pressing him with offers, but we have handled that the best way we can. His contract with us runs until 2012 and we are in the driving seat."</p>
              <p>United meet Barcelona in Rome on 27 May, when they will attempt to become the first side to retain the European Cup since Milan in 1990. Ferguson believes the Spanish side will present more of a danger than Chelsea, who were seconds away from victory in the semi-final.</p>
              <p>"Chelsea would have presented the more straightforward challenge, one we've learned how to deal with over the past year or two," he said.

              <p>I agree with Zocoss, Rooney did his best in attacking n defending along in most of his games now.</p>
              <p>But Tevez is also another effective guy in ManU...... Ronaldo sucks, too expensive n performance not as good as Rooney n Tevez. Just sell one to buy another three lor. </p>

              <p><strong>United's unsettled Carlos Tevez failed to show up at the club's Player of the Year dinner on Sunday after his daughter fell ill. Tevez is currently involved in a war of words with United after the club failed to come up with the £25million needed to make his two-year loan deal permanent at Old Trafford.</strong></p>
              <p>And the 24-year-old was the only senior member of the squad who was not in attendance as defender Nemanja Vidic was revealed as the winner of the annual players' and fans' Player of the Year awards the day after United clinched the Barclays Premier League title.</p>
              <div class="floatRHS">
              <p class="imageCaption">There were suggestions Tevez had stayed away in order to make a point to the club and nobody at Old Trafford could give a reason for his no-show.</p>
              </div>
              <p>But the Tevez camp were quick to explain that the Argentine had intended to attend but chose to stay with his daughter, Florencia, who was running a fever.</p>

              <p>It is believed several members of Arsenal's squad had been upset on hearing that Evra had described them as 'babies' after United knocked them out of the Champions League.</p>
              <p>Evra said: 'They did not understand my humour. 'I like teasing. Maybe they are jealous because we are champions and have reached the Champions League final.'</p>

              <p class="article">Argentinian striker Tevez is sick at his lack of first-team starts and wants 
              to go to a club that will give him more football.</p>
              <p class="article">He failed to turn up for United’s Player of the Year dinner at Old Trafford on 
              Sunday night — despite orders from boss Alex Ferguson that everyone had to 
              go.</p>
              <p class="article">Tevez claims he stayed home to look after his daughter Florencia, 4, who had a 
              high temperature.</p>
              <p class="article">Neither players nor officials were aware of this — and most saw it as another 
              sign the player is on his way.</p>
              <p class="article">He has made up his mind to go, believing he is not fully appreciated at United 
              and is behind Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney and Dimitar Berbatov in the 
              pecking order.</p>
              <p class="article">United were still planning to negotiate a fee for the player to make his loan 
              move permanent.</p>
              <p class="article">But they are unwilling to pay his agent and co- owner Kia Joorabchian the 
              £26million asking price and will only go to £18m.</p>
              <p class="article">Tevez and Joorabchian feel they have been messed about and strung along by 
              United.</p>
              <p class="article">They thought they had a deal that the £6million loan fee for the last two 
              seasons would be followed by a further £26million.</p>
              <p class="article">Now free agent Tevez is set to join United’s fiercest rivals Liverpool — and 
              there will be nothing Ferguson can do about it.</p>
              <p class="article">The player waved an emotional goodbye to the fans after their last home game 
              against Arsenal on Saturday which clinched the Premier League title.</p>

              <p><br>You are absolutely correct. The real and more felt across the world credit crunch started in Sep 08...</p>
              <p>Anyway, Tevez isn't a creative player unlike Berbatov... For myself only, from the start... Personally, I prefer Berbatov to Tevez. Not that Tevez isn't good, he is hardworking that I give it to him... But he doesn't created as much at the beginning and mid part of the season, he didn't seem as good as he is on a roll towards the last few matches...</p>
              <p>Another thing I feel is when he starts games, he is not as effective whereas he comes on as a sub player... he is much much better... His aggression has an advantage as a sub but not much if from the start where all the opponent players are still fresh...</p>
              <p>I believe Berbatov can score more goals next season... The thing is, he is more interested on creating than shooting right now... Next season when he is more settled in, we could see him run the match and take more chances at goal...</p>
              <p>The Tevez goal against City... Some credit him for scoring which I have nothing against, But I credit Berbatov for making it even possible of a chance... Fletcher just hit the ball high up clearing it from the back, and hoping for the best... Berbatov made something out of nothing by plucking it out of the sky with his back to it then lay it nicely for Tevez...</p>
              <p>At the start of the season, many felt United won't win the title this season... many felt Chelsea will win... Only some felt if United manage to secure the Berbatov deal, will United stand a chance of retaining their title... And it proved to be correct afterall...</p>

              seem like Tevez is leaving. if he join liverpool or chelsea or arsenal, so be it as Man Utd doesnt own him, so he is free to sign for any other clubs as he see fit.
              
              if fergie dun sign any striker to replace Tevez, he may rely on wellbeck and macheda next season. Ronaldo to double as striker if need be, with Rooney and Berbatov as the main strikers.

              <p>seem like Tevez is leaving. if he join liverpool or chelsea or

              for any other clubs as he see fit.</p>

              <p>well, I don't think either welbeck or macheda can fit the bill leh. They are still so raw. macheda was tested by starting in the first 11, but his impact was miminal.</p>
              <p>Campbell is on loan right?</p>

              <h1>Tevez still unsure of United future</h1>
              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Carlos Tevez has admitted he
              still has no idea whether next week's Champions League final will be
              his last game for Manchester United.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Tevez's future has been the
              subject of intense debate, with United chief executive David Gill
              confirming last weekend that he expects some kind of closure on the
              Argentina star's two-year loan deal in June.</p>
              <p>However, not only is Tevez unsure about whether he will remain
              at Old Trafford, he has not been given any indication by Sir Alex
              Ferguson whether he will be involved against Barcelona in Rome next
              week.</p>
              <p>"Maybe it will be my last game and maybe it won't," he said. "I don't know.</p>
              <p>"I am not sure whether I will start next week. It is a decision for the manager.</p>
              <p>"I will prepare well. That is all I can do. I would like to play
              but there are some very good players here, so I will just wait."</p>

              <p>Looking at macheda play, I do believe he has the potential to be a world-class forward within a few years, that is, if he does'nt go first........</p>
              <p>As for Welbeck and Campbell, not too sure</p>
