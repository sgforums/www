              <p><strong>Young United right-back Rafael was given his first international call-up to the Brazil squad this week, and his elevation to the Selecao marks a fully-warranted milestone in his burgeoning career.</strong><br><br>Brazil face USA in New Jersey next month, and Rafael is getting good practice on American soil against American opponents during United’s US tour before meeting up with his national team colleagues on 10 August. Two days later he could make his debut in the famous yellow jersey.<br><br>New Brazil coach Mano Menezes, who replaced Dunga after his side’s failed World Cup campaign, has named just four players from the squad that went to South Africa. In doing so, he is sending out a clear message: impress me. No Kaka. No Luis Fabiano. No Julio Cesar. The only players retained are Daniel Alves, Ramires, Thiago Silva and Robinho. In come 11 potential debutants, of which Rafael is one.<br><br>I interviewed Rafael last season after he'd just faced Ronaldinho against AC Milan at the San Siro. And we spoke about what a dream it would be for him to play for his country at the next World Cup in Brazil, on home soild in front of millions of adoring fans. Not that a path into the team hasn’t been swept clear by Menezes' latest selection. Maicon was one of Brazil’s few outstanding performers in South Africa in Rafael’s position, while Daniel Alves is an accomplished full-back. Rafael has his work cut out.<br><br>Since moving to United in 2008, Rafael has shown that he has bags of potential – he’s just six games shy of 50 United appearances and he only waved goodbye to his teens on 9 July. But speak to a handful of keen United observers and one or more will no doubt use the word ‘raw’ to describe his abilities.<br><br>He isn’t scared of throwing himself into tackles, putting his body on the line for the United cause – but in doing so he sometimes induces a collective gasp at Old Trafford. One slight misjudgement and he could enter the referee's book, or worse, be given his marching orders. On that note, people might point to his red card against Bayern Munich in the Champions League quarter-finals last season. “That red card killed us,” Sir Alex said at the time. But he added: “Rafael was having a marvellous game and it was a tragedy for him.”<br><br>You can castigate someone for inexperience. And from that performance at Old Trafford against Bayern, we should take his contribution to a rip-roaring first-half United display, not a single display of immaturity – even then he was unfortunate to be sent for an early bath.<br><br>His rough edges will become smoothed; his feisty sliding tackles will become well-timed interceptions; his mistakes will make him stronger.<br><br>Personally, I like Rafael’s raw aggression. He’s fearless. And that’s a characteristic you can’t instil in somebody. But you can hone it. Like Rooney. Like Keane (sometimes). It’s either there or it isn’t. In many ways, that’s what makes Rafael so suited to United, and particularly the type of player Sir Alex goes for; an undeniably strong personality, combining aggression (used positively) with technical ability.<br><br>There’s just one more point to raise. Now that Benitez has stopped weaving his magic at Anfield, are we safe to adopt Rafa – the name our Rafael is known by to his team-mates and the coaches? I’ll leave that one with you. It might be too soon. But call him what you like, our Rafa is here to stay for a long time. I’m confident that, unlike his namesake, this call up to Brazil shows that his career is only on the rise.</p>

              <p><strong>United full-back Rafael is eyeing a long international career after receiving his first Brazil call-up this week.<br><br></strong>New manager Mano Menezes, appointed as Dunga’s successor after Brazil’s disappointing World Cup campaign, named Rafael in a 23-man squad to face the USA on 10 August in New Jersey.<br><br>Speaking exclusively to <strong>ManUtd.com</strong>, Rafael said: "I'm so happy to have been called up to the national team and very proud. It's my first call and I hope there will be more to come in the future. The coach called me before he announced the squad and asked me how I felt and how my training was going. I was so happy when he told me I was going to be in the squad."<br><br>While Rafael is among a host of young stars to be handed a chance to shine, his continued presence in the team is by no means guaranteed, especially as competition for the right-back berth comes from one of Brazil’s best performers in South Africa.<br><br>“Maicon plays in my position and he is a great player who I can learn a lot from,” Rafael said. “I am so lucky to play for the best team in the world, Manchester United. Now to play for my country will be a dream come true.”</p>
