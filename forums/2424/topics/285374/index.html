            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Simmo staying focused</strong><br><br>Danny Simpson is refusing to get carried away, despite an impressive league debut against Wigan during which he set up United's fourth goal.<br><br>The 20-year-old entered the fray just before the half-hour after injuries to Nemanja Vidic and John O'Shea forced a reshuffle in the United defence.<br><br>Simpson looked completely at home in the right-back slot and capped his display with a fine centre for Wayne Rooney to head home eight minutes from time. It was a hugely proud day for Simpson, but he insists the real hard work is still to come.<br><br>"Just because there might be a bit of hype about you after a couple of games for the first team it doesnÂ’t mean youÂ’ve made it," he told ManUtd.com.<br><br>"YouÂ’ve almost got to work even harder when that happens to prove that you can stay in there.<br><br>"I was really pleased that I was able to set up Wayne for the fourth goal. All the lads came running over to me and it was just a really mad feeling, especially as all my family were at Old Trafford that day.<br><br>"To be playing with the likes of Ronaldo, Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs Â– players youÂ’ve grown up watching Â– was just amazing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"And having Rio [Ferdinand] next to me in the defence was brilliant. He never stopped talking to me and helped me so much with my positioning and marking."<br><br>Simpson knows he faces a tough task in trying to gain a regular run in the side, but believes this season's influx of new players has really benefited the team.<br><br>"The addition of the new players in the summer has meant there is a good group of young lads at the club now and it makes training really good fun and exciting," he said.<br><br>"ThereÂ’s good competition for places because everyone is working hard to get their chance. That can only help the team."<br></div>
