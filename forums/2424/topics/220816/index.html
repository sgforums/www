Both were tight - Giggs scored the winner in the 2-1 win at Watford but missed the 1-1 draw at Reading.<br><br>"When these teams come up, games like Saturday's are what they want. It's what they look forward to, one of the reasons why they try to get promoted,Â” said Ryan.<br><br>"ThereÂ’ll be a good atmosphere at Bramall Lane. It always is up there and Neil Warnock has done well bringing them into this league and if we donÂ’t approach the game correctly weÂ’ll get found out.Â”<br><br><a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=380082" rel="nofollow">http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&amp;newsid=380082</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Marking Ronaldo is a tall order</strong></span><br><br>DEREK GEARY has two important tasks on his to-do list today.<br><br>First, one of the smallest players in the Premiership must battle towering inferno Cristiano Ronaldo. And then the Sheffield United defender needs to get Paul ScholesÂ’ autograph for his dad.<br><br>Manchester United are coming to Bramall Lane and the smile has not left GearyÂ’s face all week. He admits: Â“If I play IÂ’ll be up against Ronaldo. Bloody hell it doesnÂ’t get any easier, does it?Â”<br><br>Last week it was Bolton maverick El-Hadji Diouf, a tricky customer certainly. But Ronaldo is currently occupying a different level in the footballing stratosphere.<br><br>And he is SEVEN inches taller than Irishman Geary Â— who insists that size does not necessarily matter. Â“People will look at me and target me but it makes me more determined. I do a lot of weights and my pace gets me out of trouble.<br><br>Â“But Ronaldo will be the ultimate test. I think IÂ’ve done all right this season and in the past I played against Arsenal in the cup and I did all right against Jose Reyes.<br><br>Â“IÂ’m comfortable in my ability to do well but Ronaldo is probably playing the best football of all the United players at the moment.Â”<br><br>Geary, a huge Liverpool supporter, would love to put a dent into UnitedÂ’s title charge today. But afterwards he will probably have to go cap in hand to Scholes and request a scribble.<br><br>Geary revealed: Â“My dad, Peter, is a Manchester United fan so he will be over. IÂ’m sure he will be cheering me on! But he is a big fan of Paul Scholes so he will probably be wanting me to get his autograph . . . I think IÂ’ll wait until after the game!Â”<br><br><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/Ron.jpg"><br><br></div>

The striker made it three goals in four days as he followed up his midweek England strike with a cool double to sink Sheffield United.<br><br>Former red Devils winger Keith Gillespie shocked the Premiership leaders with his first Blades goal on 13 minutes.

And the home side finally cracked with 15 minutes to go as the former Everton ace volleyed home.<br><br>Ferguson hailed Rooney's clinical finishing but he quickly turned to next Sunday's home clash against title rivals Chelsea. He said: "It promises to be a fantastic game, one that everybody is looking forward to and the whole world will be watching.<br><br>"But I saw the controversy coming from down there (Stamford Bridge) about the referee. "I hope the game is not decided by a refereeÂ’s decision because it could be a fantastic game. LetÂ’s hope thatÂ’s the case."<br><br>Fergie added: "They were two marvellous finishes from Rooney. "The first came from a run across the defender. He has caught him on the hop, off-guard, and it was a great strike. "The second was terrific. Taking that kind of finish, when you are under pressure and you need to win, it makes it more special."<br><br>Old Trafford chief Ferguson knew his side were going to face a battle against Neil Warnock's men. He said: "They proved it was going to be difficult but the important thing is we kept our patience, kept probing and we made some good chances.<br><br>"To be honest with you, I was hoping we would get a goal before half-time because if we had gone in 1-0 down then it would have been a long road back.<br><br>"It would have made it more difficult for us because they would have been more entrenched but the goal gave us that bit of patience to wait and wait.<br><br>"By doing that there was always the possibility that we would create the chance that mattered."<br></div>

Pacy as well. Somehow i feel that Fergie had enough of the academy players. I mean, look at the United lineup now. Only Scholes, Giggs &amp; Neville came through the ranks. The likes of Brown, O'Shea, Fletcher, Richardson, etc are just bit part players.<br><br>And i've read the news that Fergie is using Brown and O'Shea to trade for Hargreaves.<br><br>I guess the likes of class of 92 will not be produce any time soon.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>Cheers.<br>C.K</div>

The defence is still doubtful.. Especially when opponents crosses from normal play, corners, and free kicks. Man U played all out attack football but quite prone to counter attacks. Chelsea would counter like nobody's business so I doubt Man U would play an all out attack football against Chelsea. But they should play their possesion football. Giggs was kinda disappointing with a lot of incomplete passes. Hopefully he play his best against Chelsea. Just keep the possession football going.</div>
