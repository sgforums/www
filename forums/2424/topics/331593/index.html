              <p><strong>United's medical staff have confirmed that Rodrigo Possebon has
              not suffered a break after being stretchered off against Middlesbrough
              on Tuesday night.</strong><br><br>The Brazilian midfielder was in agony
              following a challenge from Middlesbrough captain Emanuel Pogatetz after
              an hour of the Reds' 3-1 Carling Cup third round win.<br><br>A club spokesperson told <strong>ManUtd.com </strong>on
              Wednesday morning: "We can confirm that Rodrigo did not suffer a break
              to his right leg. He was kept in hospital overnight for observation and
              to assess whether there was any ligament damage to his knee."<br><br>At
              the moment, however, everyone at the club is just pleased to hear that
              Possebon's injury is not as serious as it first appeared to be.<br><br>Sir
              Alex said after the match: "For the kid to make his first start and get
              an injury like that is pretty horrendous. I think everyone was numb for
              about ten minutes afterwards and it killed our momentum a little bit. I
              saw a few replays of it, but I don't want to see it again. It was just
              terrible."<br><br>Despite being initially disappointed by Pogatetz's
              reaction to his subsequent red card, but he praised Boro boss Gareth
              Southgate for his attitude after the game.<br><br>"I couldn't
              understand it [his reaction], he should have walked straight off," said
              the manager. "One of the guys on their bench was screaming that it was
              never a sending off and there was nothing wrong with Rodrigo.
              Middlesbrough have apologised though. Gareth Southgate was very good.
              He understood the gravity of it and was very apologetic."</p>

              <p><strong>Middlesbrough captain Emanuel Pogatetz has apologised for the tackle
              that left Manchester United midfielder Rodrigo Possebon requiring
              hospital treatment on Tuesday night.</strong></p>
              <p>Pogatetz was shown a red card in the Carling Cup tie at Old Trafford
              as he clattered into the Brazilian youngster with a high tackle that
              resulted in Possebon requiring lengthy treatment on the pitch and Sir
              Alex Ferguson expressing his anger after the final whistle.</p>
              <p>Tests have confirmed that Possebon did not suffer a broken leg but
              further tests are being carried out regarding possible ligament damage.</p>
              <p>Following the controversy generated by the incident, Pogatetz has
              admitted referee Andre Mariner was right to send him off and confirmed
              he will speak to the United youngster in order to offer his apologies.</p>
              <p>“Firstly, I have to say that I went for the tackle because I thought
              I could win the ball,” Pogatetz told the club’s official website.</p>
              <p>“I now accept, however, that I misjudged the challenge.</p>
              <p>“Immediately after the incident I did not think it was a red card
              offence because I did win the ball. But now that I have had the chance
              to see the tackle on TV, I know the ref was right to send me off.</p>
              <p>“I am going to speak to Rodrigo by telephone and I have apologised for hurting him.</p>
              <p>“I hope that he will make a quick recovery and that he will not be out for long.”</p>
