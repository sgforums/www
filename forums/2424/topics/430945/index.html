              <p><strong>CHRIS SMALLING is ready to swap the training ground for the classroom to finish the studies he abandoned in his rapid rise to stardom.</strong></p>
              <p>The Manchester United defender only joined the club a year ago but he is being tipped for big things for club and country after being catapulted from non-league to the Champions League in three seasons.</p>
              <p>Smalling signed from Fulham in January last year in a lightning £10million swoop by United – and he has not looked back.</p>
              <p>But the 21-year-old, who will go to the European Under-21 Championship in Denmark with England this summer, wants to take the business degree he had planned before he hit the big time.</p>
              <p>Smalling, who has been Rio Ferdinand’s regular centre-back partner when Nemanja Vidic has been out, said: “Three years ago I was playing for Maidstone United and I can’t say I had ever dreamed of playing in the types of games I’m involved in now with United.</p>
              <p>“We had to wash our own shorts and socks at Maidstone and I was driving a Renault Clio. I was studying for my A-Levels so I was at school and then I played on Saturdays.</p>
              <p>Lucky</p>
              <p>“More than anything, it was a case of concentrating on getting into university.</p>
              <p>“The opportunity then arose to turn professional and I took it – and since coming to United it’s just like a dream. I know how lucky I am.</p>
              <p>“I turned down a place at Leicester to study business management but I had about five other offers and was only five months away from starting my course.</p>
              <p>“After training at Fulham, Charlton and Middlesbrough I decided to join Fulham. My exams were in June 2008 and I started pre-season almost immediately – my last exam was after I’d started the training programme.</p>
              <p>“My education is something I could return to and an Open University course would fill my time in the afternoons.</p>
              <p>“It’s been an epic season and I expected to get a few games but the magnitude of some of them has surprised me because they’ve been very high-profile.</p>
              <p>“But the manager has shown faith in me and I want to reward him.”</p>
