              <p>Former Manchester United midfielder Nicky Butt could be set to come out of retirement after accepting an offer to train with Hong Kong side South China.</p>
              <p>Butt, who called time on a career that also included stints at Newcastle and Birmingham City in May, will arrive in the territory later this month and will feature in South China's league game against TSW Pegasus before deciding whether to remain with the club until the end of the season.</p>
              <p>"I wanted some time out of the game to concentrate on my next step either in or out of football. However I feel fit and when South China FC approached me to join them for a week's training and a game, the prospect excited me," said the 35-year-old former England international.</p>
              <p>"I could see from their team and commitment to the game that this was something I wanted to be a part of. I have been to China many times with Manchester United and England and the reception we received was always unbelievable.</p>
              <p>"The development and growth of Asian football since 2002 has been phenomenal and can be seen from the influence of Asian players in the Premiership. I am really looking forward to this new experience and the challenges it will bring."</p>
              <p>Chairman Steven Lo believes the acquisition of Butt could help South China capture next year's AFC Cup, the Asian version of the Europa League. South China reached the semi-finals in 2009 before losing to eventual winners Kuwait SC.</p>
              <p>"Everyone is excited by Nicky's arrival and the knowledge and experience he can bring to the team," he said.</p>
              <p>"We are always looking to attract talent to strengthen our squad and this demonstrates our commitment to that. Nicky's records internationally and domestically speak for themselves and I am sure he will receive a fantastic reception when he arrives at Hong Kong Stadium.</p>
              <p>"I myself am also excited to meet Nicky and discuss with him the about playing South China for the remainder of the season, including in the AFC Cup, which is always our goal to win."</p>

              <p><strong>Former Red Nicky Butt is in Hong Kong weighing up an offer to come out of retirement and sign a three-month contract with South China FC. We spoke to the Treble-winning midfielder as he prepared for a trial game on Tuesday...</strong></p>
              <p><strong>What have you been doing so far in Hong Kong?</strong><br>I flew out on Sunday, arrived on Monday and had a rest in the afternoon, then went training and met the rest of the team and manager. I went for a meal with [South China chairman] Steven Lo and his wife on Monday night to say hello and have a chat, and now I’m looking forward to the first game.</p>
              <p><strong>How was your first training session?</strong><br>It was good, and pretty tough for the day before a game! We had an hour-and-a-half session, it was sharp and the lads were all buzzing. Personally I felt OK – a bit rusty, but that’s what I expected in my first session.</p>
              <p><strong>What are your impressions of the city so far?</strong><br>It’s a vibrant place with skyscrapers everywhere and a real energy. The people are very warm and courteous everywhere you go, so it seems like it’ll be a great place for me to come and spend a bit of time. United are well supported out here so people know and remember me. A lot have come out to see me and speak to me at training and even outside the hotel, which is quite humbling.</p>
              <p><strong>Have you made up your mind about signing a contract?</strong><br>I still have to think about it. The contract talks will be done at the end of the week, so at the minute it’s just a case of working out whether it’s feasible for me to be here, and once I’ve made that decision, I can discuss the details. At the minute it’s all good and after the game we can start talking properly.</p>
              <div class="newsStory">
              <p><strong>What’s next for you after the game?</strong><br>I’ll have another meeting with Steven on Wednesday, and the contract talks will start in the afternoon. Then we have a training session on Thursday and I head home again in the early hours of Friday morning. It’s all go – every minute of the day there’s something going on – but I’m enjoying it and I’ll make a decision at the end of the week.</p>
