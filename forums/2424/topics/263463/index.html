Gareth Southgate, the Middlesbrough manager, now hopes the prospect of regular first-team football will convince Smith to leave the Premier League champions.</strong><br><br>Smith has indicated he wants to stay at Old Trafford but the forward is aware that he will play only a peripheral role in Sir Alex Ferguson's plans next season. Smith and his adviser, Alex Black, were dismayed when they approached the club at the end of the season to ask for a contract extension, as had been previously mooted, and they were informed that one would not be forthcoming.<br><br>Roy Keane, the Sunderland manager, is also monitoring Smith's availability, although Preston North End's David Nugent is his primary target. Newcastle are not thought to be interested. Southgate is aware that Smith may be reluctant to leave Old Trafford for the Riverside and the Middlesbrough manager is said to be planning to fly to Florida, where Smith is currently on holiday.<br><br>Harry Redknapp is also lining up a bid for Smith. With the future of Nwankwo Kanu unclear, Redknapp wants to add at least one striker to his Portsmouth squad but has been put off by the prices being quoted for Yakubu Ayegbeni, Freddy KanoutÃ© and Nugent. "Alan Smith is good value at the money they are talking about," said Redknapp.<br><br></div>

So, we'll have to wait and see."<br><br>Smith made a promising return to first-team action towards the end of last season after severe injury problems.<br><br>His form also saw him recalled to the England fold, but Smith is worried he may be restricted to a bit-part role with the champions next season.<br><br>Black revealed last week that Smith has been concerned about his future ever since United chose not to exercise a clause in his contract, which would have seen it extended by another year to 2010.<br><br>He told BBC Radio Five Live: "Obviously, you're going to have some question marks in your head as to where that leaves you.<br><br>"I think if you're definitely not wanted, you need to be told that."</div>
