              You're chasing what would be your 11th title with United. Would the next one feel just as good as the first? 
              To be honest, itâ€™s probably hard to match the first one, purely because I grew up as a United fan and I knew how long it had been since the club had won the title. I remember feeling absolutely every emotion under the sun on the day we won the league. After that, theyâ€™re all nice, although the last few have been particularly memorable. I want to savour every trophy now because I know each one could be the last. 
              
              Some of the young lads like Ben Foster, Darron Gibson and Danny Welbeck won their first trophy at Wembley in the Carling Cup finalâ€¦ will that experience help those youngsters if theyâ€™re called upon?
              Absolutely. We were playing against Tottenham, who are a top team, and it was a tough game. That will have prepared them for the big games that are still to come. And the experience of playing at Wembley will help them handle the pressure that comes with that. Youâ€™re under the spotlight as a youngster and you have to be able to handle the stuff that comes off the field as much as the pressure on the pitch.
              
              Your goal at West Ham was your 97th in the Premier League. You must have one eye on hitting 100 before you hang up your boots?
              Not really. That would be great, and I would like to score a few more goals, but the days of scoring 15 goals a season for me are gone. I just try to pitch in with important goals when the team needs them.
              
              Thereâ€™ve been one or two suggestions that you might be in for a Footballer of the Year award this season. How does that sit with you?
              It sits well! That would be nice, but there are a lot of players who have done well this season. At Liverpool, for example, there are people like [Steven] Gerrard and [Xabi] Alonso who have been terrific. And Frank Lampardâ€™s had another good season. Weâ€™ve also got a few players here at United who would be deserving winners of that award.
              
              The managerâ€™s gone even further â€“ heâ€™s suggested a knighthood!
              [Laughs] I think the manager must have a bet on somewhere and heâ€™s trying to influence the outcome! Maybe heâ€™s got money on me getting one before Iâ€™m 40 or something!
              
              Most 35-year-olds still have decades of their working lives ahead of them, but footballers of that age are firmly placed in the â€˜veteranâ€™ bracket. Is it frustrating to think some people regard you as â€˜oldâ€™? 
              Not really. Iâ€™ve been in the team since I was 17 and I think I first read about myself as a â€˜veteranâ€™ when I was about 28! Iâ€™m used to it now, though itâ€™s hard to understand it sometimes because I feel young and Iâ€™m surrounded by young players. Itâ€™s a bit weird to be the old man in the team, but I just donâ€™t see myself like that. I certainly donâ€™t feel 35â€¦ except the day after a hard game. Then I definitely feel old!
