            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://images.sportinglife.com/07/08/330/Fletcher_550619.jpg"><br><br>Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher believes the addition of Owen Hargreaves and Carlos Tevez can help the star-packed Old Trafford squad challenge on all four fronts this season.<br><br>The Red Devils flexed their muscles on Wednesday by sending one side to Belfast for a friendly with Glentoran and another team to East End Park to play in Scott Thomson's testimonial, both matches resulting in victory for the visitors.<br><br>Hargreaves made his second appearance in a red jersey since signing from Bayern Munich at East End Park although Tevez's protracted move from West Ham had not been finalised in time for him to travel.<br><br>But Fletcher, 23, believes United are now ready for a tilt at the Champions League, Barclays Premier League and the two domestic cup competitions.<br><br>He said: "We've added to the squad, it's top quality and we have the numbers to compete for everything this season.<br><br>"You can more or less play 11-a-side in training and it keeps everyone sharp.<br><br>"Everyone is competing for their place and you know that if you get a chance then you have to take it.<br><br>"The manager wants a selection headache. It's better that way than struggling without enough players.<br><br>"And if you want to contend for the four trophies then we will need a big squad because towards the end of the season you will pick up injuries and suspensions<br><br>"Hargreaves looked great against Dunfermline. Obviously he has not played as many games as he would have liked because he picked up a little injury but he looks fit now and he is impressing everyone.<br><br>"I'm sure once he gets used to the way we play, and the more games he plays, he will be a big hit.<br><br>"Tevez can bring directness and excitement. He is a player that I'm sure the fans at Old Trafford will love.<br><br>"Wayne Rooney and him are from a similar mould.<br><br>"You saw what he did for West Ham and he is going to be a great addition to the squad.<br><br>"He likes to make things happen when he has got the ball, he also has raw strength and he has the presence to handle the big stage.<br><br>"He's also impressed in training and I'm sure he will impress the fans as well."<br><br>The Scotland midfielder will play a pivotal role in the forthcoming Euro 2008 double-header against Lithuania at Hampden and France in Paris but the United star has his eyes firmly fixed fighting his way in to the Old Trafford starting eleven, starting with Sunday's Carling Premier League opener against Reading at home.<br><br>Fletcher said: "Scotland has a big double-header and these games are important but my focus is on the beginning of the league with Manchester United and I hope we get off to a good start.<br><br>"It is exciting. We want to retain our title.<br><br>"At a club like Manchester United that's what it is all about. Winning the Premiership last season was a great achievement but they want more and that's why it's great to be at a this club."<br></div>
