              <p>Carlos Tevez insists he cannot imagine playing for any team except Manchester United.</p>
              <p><img src="http://i39.tinypic.com/qod6jq.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>United’s agreement keeps the 24-year-old at Old Trafford until the
              end of the season, and it is believed it would cost in the region of
              £30 million to complete a permanent deal.</p>
              <p>His future remains unclear as a result but, although Tevez has been
              linked with a move to a number of top European clubs, he says he can
              only see himself at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>"My loan deal ends in June but I cannot think of any team except United," he told Sport magazine.</p>
              <p>"The United fans love me and my family is very happy, both in Manchester and in England.</p>
              <p>"My thoughts are only about winning titles with United, and if this happens then I hope I will still be here next season.</p>
              <p>"I do not want to play with any other team. I always follow my
              heart, and my heart is telling me it will be impossible for me to leave
              English football."</p>
              <p>Tevez also hailed Sir Alex Ferguson, saying his approach to management had made a huge impact on his career.</p>
              <p>"He is always the boss," he said.</p>
              <p>"There is never any doubt who is in charge, but he is also a gentleman.</p>
              <p>"From the moment I arrived, he has treated me with respect as a person.</p>
              <p>"His greatest quality is that, for him, there are no star players –
              everyone is equal, whether they cost many millions or are a young
              player who hasn't played many times for the team.</p>
              <p>"When I see him work he reminds me of Carlos Bianchi, who was my coach at Boca Juniors in Argentina.</p>
              <p>"Both have had a big influence on my career, and both know how to treat people."</p>
              <p>While Zinedine Zidane recently said Steven Gerrard may be the best
              player in the world, Tevez says Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi are
              the most talented players he has seen – and suggested he would love to
              see his Argentina team-mate at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>"Sometimes [Ronaldo's] performances are almost from a different planet," he said.</p>
              <p>"He is a truly special talent and the only other player who I think
              is on the same level as him today is my Argentinian team-mate Lionel
              Messi.</p>
              <p>"He is at Barcelona now, but I think they could play very well
              together – they are the only men in football who can win a game on
              their own.</p>
              <p>"They are complete because they are both superb dribblers who also
              have a very good eye for goal. I would love to have them both with me
              in the same team."</p>
