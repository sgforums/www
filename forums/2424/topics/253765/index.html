The United first team, fresh from a night out in London after their 0-0 draw with rivals Chelsea, joined up with other club staff for a fun day out and a flutter. Wayne Rooney, Rio Ferdinand, Paul Scholes and Gary Neville headed the United party as they mingled with racegoers and fans, happily posing for pictures and signing autographs.</strong><br><br>First team stars will receive the clubÂ’s 16th title on Sunday and United have invited the surviving members of the 1955-56 Championship winning team to mark the occasion. Bill Foulkes, John Doherty, Wilf McGuinness and Jack Crompton, coach of the first Busby Babes team to win the title, will bring the Premiership trophy on to the pitch.<br><br>The first three legs of United's summer tour of Asia are expected to go ahead as planned despite uncertainty over the concluding visit to Malaysia.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u189/zomanu/owen1.jpg"><br><br><span class="large"><strong>Can't wait to play with Roo</strong></span><br><br>MICHAEL OWEN turned his back on mounting problems at Newcastle with a day at the races Â— and walked straight into Alex Ferguson and his Manchester United side. Toon chairman Freddy Shepherd has demanded a show of loyalty from England striker Owen.<br><br>He has just returned from a year out through injury and went to Chester racecourse to get away from rumours he is seeking a Â£9million summer move. Owen Â— who yesterday won a call-up to the England B squad Â— relaxed by chatting on the phone to United star Wayne Rooney. They smiled and waved to each other despite being just yards apart. Watching were United boss Ferguson, who wants to sign Owen, and Sam Allardyce, who will soon be fighting to keep him at Toon.<br><br>Allardyce takes over as Newcastle boss next week and his first task will be to sit down with Owen and thrash out the future. Big Sam does not want Owen to leave but knows his hands will be tied if the player uses the Â£9m get-out clause in his contract. Furious Shepherd says Owen owes the Toon Army at least one more season having played only 13 games since his Â£16m arrival from Real Madrid nearly two years ago.<br><br><img src="http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u189/zomanu/unitedteam.jpg"><br><br>United were linked with a bid for Owen last month and Fergie has shown an interest in the past. But it is thought their priority this time is Samuel EtoÂ’o of Barcelona or SpursÂ’ Dimitar Berbatov. It is unlikely Jose Mourinho, Rafa Benitez or Arsene Wenger would step in to rescue him, leaving Owen an unpopular figure at St JamesÂ’ Park.<br><br>ShepherdÂ’s statement yesterday said: Â“The loyalty this club has shown him over the last two years when he had injury problems in his first season and has missed virtually all of this season, deserves something in return. Â“IÂ’m telling Michael he has two choices: He either comes out and tells our fans, who have taken him to their hearts, that he is happy here. Â“Or I tell him that not one of the big four Â— Manchester United, Chelsea, Arsenal or Liverpool Â— are interested in him. Because thatÂ’s the case.Â”<br><br>Shepherd will unveil Allardyce as his new boss next week. The pair are due to meet over the weekend to sort out a deal. Meanwhile, Manchester UnitedÂ’s winning streak continued as the team cleaned up at the races. Defender Rio Ferdinand, 28, began the day with a winning Â£1,000 punt on 6-4 ON shot Maraahel.<br><br>Boss Ferguson, Gabriel Heinze and Wes Brown also backed the horse. Owen is in EnglandÂ’s 20-strong squad for the B international against Albania at Burnley on May 25.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ferguson has told youngster Chris Eagles he will finally be a part of his first-team squad next season after loan spells at Watford, Sheffield Wednesday and Dutch club NEC Nijmegen. Eagles, UnitedÂ’s FA Youth Cup-winning captain of 2003, scored after coming on as a substitute at Everton and impressed in his first Premiership start against Chelsea in midweek. Ferguson said: Â“He has got the temperament to play for us and I wouldnÂ’t be afraid to play him at any time. HeÂ’s one of the lads who stays back and practises hard in the afternoons and you get your rewards for that.Â”<br><br>United are set to apply for extra title medals for Smith and Henrik Larsson, neither of whom made the required 10 appearances.<br><br></div>
