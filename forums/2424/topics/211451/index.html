            <div class='col-md body'>damm it.  its farking disappointing Man U tonite.  Wat the fark is Ferdinand doing taking his feet off the ball &amp; conceding the penalty ?<br><br>Man U is depending too much on one player tonite - Ronaldo. If not becos of his goal, Man U will suffer an embarassing defeat.  The draw is a weak result and even at 1-1, they lack ideas in attacking, always trying to make that "beautiful" pass - for fark ?  Play direct, brute and effective football, not passing around and getting intercepted.<br><br>Its really three points lost and if Man U cannot even beat a newly promoted team there for the taking, they have absolutely no right to challenge the premiership trophy, its disappointing, especially both Arsenal and Chelsea won tonight albeit against better opponents. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I felt that Man U performance quite disappointing. I think they were frustrated at Reading who were packing their own half w/ their players when Man u attack. If half the Man U crosses/lob passes were successful, we may have a different result. But in the end, Reading players were at the right place at the right time to stop some of the Man u attacks, this is what i feel......Penalty a bit 'give and take' lah, sometimes this happens. IMO 2 points dropped rather than 1 point gained for Man U</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This match result has to be Fergie's fault! He always rest his players before a CL match than drop points. Its time fergie wake up, how many times does he realise? Wtf was he thinking playing Richardson and Fletcher together in midfield? With these 2, don't expect to win the midfield. Trying to fit one in is bad enough but both together?<br><br>Fergie deserve to go cos seems like he don't learn anything after so many years.
