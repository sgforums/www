"But I have to give a big round of applause to my players for the way they went about the task."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Gaffer upbeat despite draw</strong><br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson felt United should have taken three points against Reading, but was far from downbeat over his side's performance at the Madejski Stadium.<br><br>Cristiano Ronaldo's second-half strike salvaged a draw for the Reds, who dominated the Royals in terms of possession and passed up several decent chances.<br><br>The Gaffer told PremPlus: "I think in terms of possession and shots at goal we were a bit unlucky, but you have to admire Reading.<br><br>"They played a survival game, they fought for every ball, worked their tails off and made it difficult for us but when you look at the amount of possession we had, particularly in the last third of the field, we should have done better.<br><br>"It can happen that way some times. When a team puts eight bodies in front of the penalty box it's not easy."<br><br>Despite taking one point from the last two games, Sir Alex is still satisfied with his side's start to the season.<br><br>"It's a worry when you drop any points," he admitted. "The name of the game is to win games, win points and be up there. But we've had a solid start to the season.<br><br>"Last Sunday was a disappointing performance but not today, I think it was a good performance today."<br><br>While Ronaldo was the oustanding player on show, Sir Alex was buoyed by the performances of Wayne Rooney, who showed sustained glimpses of his best form.<br><br>"I thought Wayne was much better today," he said. "He looked much sharper. Towards the last 15 minutes there were signs that maybe he was getting a bit tired.<br><br>"It's only games that's going to get him back to his best. That was his sixth game in six months, and that's not a lot for a young lad."<br><br>Special praise was also reserved for Nemanja Vidic and Gabriel Heinze, who both made their first starts of the season after returning from injury.<br><br>"Vidic was fantastic today and showed what a fantastic centre half he is," said Sir Alex. "Gaby did really well for about an hour but it took its toll because he's required to put in more energy than the centre-backs.<br><br>"We decided to take him off when we were chasing a goal because obviously there was going to be a lot of energy spent trying to get a goal back."<br><br><a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=365698" rel="nofollow">http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&amp;newsid=365698</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Carrick salutes battling Royals</strong><br><br>Michael Carrick praised Reading's battling defensive display after United were held to a 1-1 draw at the Madejski Stadium on Saturday.<br><br>A penalty from Kevin Doyle put the Royals ahead just after half-time, before Cristiano Ronaldo fired a sublime equaliser seventeen minutes from time. United continued to create chances after that but were unable to find a winner, much to Carrick's surprise.<br><br>"After we got ourselves back into the game I really fancied us to go on and win it," he told MUTV at the final whistle. "We wanted to come here and get a result after the Arsenal defeat last weekend, but it wasn't meant to be.<br><br>"Reading deserve a lot of credit because they defended very well and made it difficult for us, particularly around the edge of the box where they closed us down quickly.<br><br>"When you come to places like this and go behind it makes it extra hard," added Carrick. "But Cristiano came up with a little bit of magic and gave us a glimmer of hope. I really thought we'd get the winner after that but things just didn't drop for us."<br><br>Reading's goal came about after referee Peter Walton deemed Gary Neville had deliberately handled in the area.<br><br>"I'd have to see it again to be sure, but I think it did hit Gary's hand," admitted Carrick. "I'm not sure whether or not it was deliberate, but it's just one of those things.<br><br>"They tend to even themselves out over the course of the season and hopefully that will be the case for us. The goal gave them something to hold on to and their energy levels stayed pretty high the longer the game went on which made it more difficult for us.<br><br>"One point out of six is very disappointing, but I'm fully confident we'll get back to winning ways soon."<br><br>The Reds will put Premiership business to one side this week as they set about picking up three points from their Champions League visit to Benfica.<br><br>The Portuguese side dumped the Reds out of the competition at the group stages last season, and Carrick insists United will be determined to settle that score on Tuesday.<br><br>"It's a big occasion for us," insisted Carrick. "The boys suffered disappointment there last season and we'll be trying to make amends for that. We had a good start against Celtic and we want to keep that going."<br><br><a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=365699" rel="nofollow">http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&amp;newsid=365699</a></div>

And all his shots are off-target. Sell him to west-brom.<br><br>Fletcher, is one hard-working dude. he is running, pressing, but his lack of quality is showing.  Yes, Fergie is planning for him to learn and maybe do a miracle, but he is too short. Sell him.<br><br>I am quite impressed with Ronaldo. He is energetic, and pushing.
