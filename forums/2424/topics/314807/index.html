              <p><strong>Wes Brown will sign a new four-year contract at Manchester United in the next fortnight after his bitter stand-off with the club came to an end on Thursday night. The 28-year-old right-back — and in particular his agent Paul Martin — have been on the receiving end of some stinging words from United manager Sir Alex Ferguson this season after the player turned down an initial offer to stay.</strong></p>
              <p>But with just weeks left on his current deal — and other Premier League clubs waiting — it is understood that United chief executive David Gill has agreed in principle a £60,000-a-week deal, structured heavily on incentives and regular appearances.</p>
              <p>Manchester-born Brown is expected to sign after United's Champions League semi-final tie against Barcelona. He has made 41 starts this season but his on-field progress has come against a backdrop of acrimony as Ferguson tired of the player's prevarication.</p>
              <p>Ferguson said earlier this year: 'Players today live in their agents' pockets — which really depresses me. Wes has been with us since he was 12 but I don't think that matters these days.'</p>
              <p>United are also close to agreeing a new contract with Rio Ferdinand but Patrice Evra is now a priority. The France full back has a year left on his deal and is looking for a weekly deal of at least £60,000.</p>

              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>MANCHESTER UNITED will spend a staggering £90million in wages to keep four of their stars.</strong></p>
              <p class="article">The club are splashing the cash on mega salaries for Cristiano Ronaldo, Rio Ferdinand, Wes Brown and Michael Carrick as the quartet tie up lucrative new deals. Brown and Carrick have followed Ferdinand by agreeing contracts — which means in the last week United have committed themselves to £52m in wages.</p>
              <p class="article">And Portuguese genius Ronaldo, 23, is ready to seal a five-year, £150,000-a-week deal in the summer, taking the total figure to £90m. Carrick, 26, was only two years into a four-year deal. But United have tied down the midfielder until 2012 and his weekly pay is set to rise from £50,000 to £70,000 a week.</p>
              <p class="article">Defender Brown, 28, was poised to leave Old Trafford on a free with his contract up at the close of the campaign — but talks this week have ended a season-long wrangle. Brown was one of the lowest paid players on a basic £30,000 a week plus £10,000 for every game played. But he has clinched a four-year contract worth around £60,000 a week. England ace Ferdinand, 29, has agreed a new deal worth £120,000 a week over four years.</p>
