              <h1>Real Madrid will try to land United hero Ronaldo next summer</h1>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/04_01/083ronaldoDM_468x368.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Real Madrid have pinpointed the end of next season for a concerted effort to prise Cristiano Ronaldo away from Old Trafford. President Ramon Calderon has reluctantly conceded he has little chance of signing Manchester United's free-scoring winger this summer but is adamant a deal must be done in time for the 09-10 campaign. It promises to be a momentous season for the Spanish giants, as it starts with a presidential election and ends with the Bernabeu stadium staging the Champions League final.</strong></p>
              <p>Calderon is determined to emerge triumphant on both occasions and sees Ronaldo's arrival as essential for pulling off a notable double. The race to be president often hinges on candidates' transfer plans, and Calderon is convinced that unveiling Ronaldo as his prize capture would swing the vote his way. He is just as sure the 23-year old would make all the difference to his dream of Real lifting the European Cup in front of their own fans in 2010.</p>
              <p>Despite claims on a Madrid radio station that a 120million euro bid for Ronaldo was imminent, it is understood funds are currently in short supply at the Bernabeu and that Calderon is exploring ways of generating extra finance in readiness for a raid on Old Trafford in a year's time.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo's agent Jorge Mendes has made recent visits to United and attended the Champions League quarter-final win over Roma, amid continuing suggestions the most lucrative contract in world football is awaiting the flying midfielder's signature.</p>
              <p>Despite the rumours, and growing interest from Real, United remained unperturbed about their prize asset's future yesterday and insisted there were no plans to replace a contract that runs until 2012. Even so, it is understood there will be talks over increasing Ronaldo's weekly wage from around £65,000 to over £90,000 before he heads for this summer's European Championships.</p>
              <p>Though United point to Ronaldo still being in the first year of his current agreement, they are prepared to acknowledge his huge contribution to this season's quest for a Champions League and Premier League double and will elevate his earnings to a similar level to Rio Ferdinand's.</p>
              <p>It will not stop Calderon pressing ahead, though, with an ambitious scheme to secure Ronaldo as the ticket to another term in office.</p>

              <h1>Assistant Queiroz warns Madrid off Ronaldo</h1>
              <p></p>
              <p><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/44564000/jpg/_44564473_ronaldo_getty.jpg" alt=""></p>

              <p></p>
              <p><strong>Manchester United assistant manager Carlos Queiroz has warned his former club Real Madrid that even £96million would not be enough to prise away Cristiano Ronaldo.</strong></p>
              <p>Madrid have long been admirers of the Portugal international, with Spanish media regularly linking the club with a big-money swoop for the 23-year-old winger.</p>
              <p>However, Queiroz, who spent a year in charge at the Bernabeu before returning to his former position as Sir Alex Ferguson's right-hand man at United in 2004, insists even a world-record transfer fee would not tempt the reigning Barclays Premier League champions into selling their biggest star.</p>
              <p>'We would not sell him for 120million euros,' Queiroz was reported as saying in Spanish newspaper Marca.</p>
              <p>'You can offer all the money in the world, but there is no amount that can buy him.'</p>

              <h1>Real poser for Ronaldo as Spanish giants Madrid line up a move this summer</h1>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/04_03/86goalDM1304_468x286.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Real Madrid will bring forward their plans to sign Cristiano Ronaldo this summer after claiming Manchester United's prolific winger can succeed Zinedine Zidane as the new darling of the Bernabeu. It was thought Real president Ramon Calderon would wait until next year's club elections before attempting to pull off the ultimate vote winner and guarantee a second term in power.</strong></p>
              <p>But his sporting director, Predrag Mijatovic, indicated the Spanish giants will try to prise Ronaldo away at the end of this season in a move that would rival the audacious £47million capture of Zidane from Juventus seven years ago. United assistant manager Carlos Queiroz claims even an offer twice that size would not persuade them to sell the Portugal winger.</p>
              <p>However, that is unlikely to deter Madrid, who have not won the Champions League since 2002. Mijatovic said: "Real Madrid are one of the most prestigious teams in the world of football and therefore have to sign the best players. Cristiano Ronaldo is emblematic. We want him as the new face of Real Madrid."</p>
              <p>Publicly, United insist no talks are planned with Ronaldo over a new deal as he is only 12 months into a five-year contract. It is unthinkable they would not offer the 23-year-old some kind of reward for another outstanding season that has already brought him 38 goals, but nothing will happen before the Champions League Final on May 21. If, by then, Ronaldo has helped United to win it, the clamour in Madrid for Calderon to make his move would be irresistible. Another Barclays Premier League title and a European Cup might also convince the player to seek a new challenge.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson and Queiroz — a father figure to Ronaldo — are well aware he is easily bored. They are constantly looking for ways to keep him stimulated, even considering switching to a 4-5-1 formation and using him as the spearhead to give him a fresh challenge. Ferguson's tactic with his winning teams has always been to challenge the players to repeat their success, but it might not be that easy with Ronaldo.</p>
              <p>After all, what do you give the player who has everything? Money should not be a major problem, even if his £80,000-aweek salary is dwarfed by the £130,000 being offered to Rio Ferdinand. Contrary to reports, the England defender's six-year deal has not been signed but should go through in weeks. But it could be lifestyle and ambition — he yearns to win the World Player of the Year award — rather than money that persuades Ronaldo to emulate David Beckham and Ruud van Nistelrooy in going to the Bernabeu.</p>
              <p>Although Ronaldo is content at home in the Cheshire countryside, Madrid is a better fit than Manchester for the boy from the sunshine island of Madeira. United recognise that and are happy to let him make regular trips to see his new girlfriend, Spanish model Nereida Gallardo, in Mallorca and his family in Portugal.</p>

              <h1>Real chief Mijatovic: Signing Ronaldo is impossible</h1>
              <p>Real Madrid sporting director Predrag Mijatovic has conceded it would
              be 'impossible' to sign Manchester United winger Cristiano Ronaldo this
              summer.</p>
              <p>Mijatovic was quoted as saying on Tuesday that the Spanish giants were
              looking at Ronaldo to become the new 'face' of the club, in a similar
              way to former France playmaker Zinedine Zidane during his time at
              Madrid.</p>
              <p>Mijatovic has made no secret of his admiration for the 23-year-old
              Portugal international, but admits there is no chance of taking him to
              the Bernabeu any time soon.</p>
              <p>'Right now it is impossible to sign Cristiano Ronaldo. Who would not
              like to have him in their team? But we need to be realistic because his
              would be a very difficult signing,' said Mijatovic, who also denied he
              had met with United assistant manager Carlos Queiroz.</p>
              <p>'There has been talk about lots of things that have nothing to do with
              reality. They have also said I have been seen with Carlos Queiroz and
              it is not true,' the former Madrid striker added in Marca.</p>

              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>CRISTIANO RONALDO has rubbished rumours he will join Real Madrid in the summer and said: “I’m sick of having to tell people I’m happy at United.” The brilliant Portuguese star, 23, knows the Spanish champions want to smash the world transfer record by signing him for £90million — but he is not interested.</strong></p>
              <p class="article">Ronaldo insists his decision to stay loyal to Manchester United and Alex Ferguson is nothing to do with the promise of a new £150,000-a-week salary, as exclusively revealed in Sport last Saturday. He said: “I just don’t care what the whole world seems to want to say about me or speculate about my future. “I’ve said it a thousand times and, by now, people should realise . . . I’m totally happy at United.</p>
              <p class="article">“I’m in the form of my life and I’m having the season of my career so far. So it makes me mad sometimes to read some of the things which are supposed to be related to my future. “I get angry but I’m trying to accept it’s a waste of energy to be furious because it is not worth it. “It’s not by chance I’ve ended up at United. I always showed that I had the basic talent and commitment to become a professional player.</p>
              <p class="article">Beating George Best was special</p>
              <p class="article">“Then my development here has been aided by the support and the correct environment for my talent to develop. There is an attitude of hard work here that I need and like. “This season is massively demanding on all fronts, personally, for United and for Portugal. “So what I’m trying to do is set everything else aside and be ready to give my utmost in every match from now until the end of United’s season and then into the European Championships with Portugal.</p>
              <p class="article">“If I’m performing at the best level of my life, then it’s not by fluke. Far from it — I’ve worked damn hard to try and achieve exactly that. “I’m pushing myself mentally and physically. I’m working constantly to better myself — it’s for those reasons alone, and not by luck, that the results are coming and the goals are flowing.”</p>
              <p class="article">The No 7 feels deep pride at breaking George Best’s historic scoring record of most goals for a United winger with 37 strikes this term. But he does not want to be remembered for that alone. His playboy image bears no relationship to the reality of the young man who is almost always last off the training pitch at Carrington and who practises and practises to make all his tricks, flicks and free-kicks look so simple.</p>
              <p class="article">But they are not. He added: “People are talking about the free-kicks that I’ve scored this season but there is absolutely no secret to scoring them. “It is nothing more than work and repetition over and again. "I’m scoring them so that gives me more confidence to keep on trying and practising but the only explanation for the fact that they go in is dedication and hard work.</p>
              <p class="article">“Of course I’m honoured and proud that I’ve managed to beat George Best’s record this season — something like that is deeply special as a moment in your career. “But the most important thing that happened that night was that we beat Bolton.</p>
              <p class="article">“Only the fans can say what they think about comparisons between me and George Best and whether I’m a good successor to his wonderful legacy. “In general, I think the fans only want the best for the club and, rather than compare us, the important thing is that my performances are helping United succeed and that makes all of us happy.”</p>
              <p class="article">As the title moves to within touching distance for United, Ronaldo is preparing to stage a grandstand finish to the season with victory in the Champions League and European Championships with Portugal. He said: “There’s enormous motivation for all of us that the Champions League semi-final first leg is in the Camp Nou against Barcelona — it won’t be easy. “But we have massive confidence in ourselves to come through it.</p>
              <p class="article">“Then I’m sure I’m still going to be in condition to help Portugal this summer. “My training has always been focused on remaining at my best until the Championships are finished because, in my opinion, we’ve got a Portugal squad which is capable of becoming champions of Europe.”</p>

              <h1>Real chief Mijatovic: Signing Ronaldo is impossible</h1>
              <p>Real Madrid sporting director Predrag Mijatovic has conceded it would be 'impossible' to sign Manchester United winger Cristiano Ronaldo this summer.</p>
              <p>Mijatovic was quoted as saying on Tuesday that the Spanish giants were looking at Ronaldo to become the new 'face' of the club, in a similar way to former France playmaker Zinedine Zidane during his time at Madrid.</p>
              <p>Mijatovic has made no secret of his admiration for the 23-year-old Portugal international, but admits there is no chance of taking him to the Bernabeu any time soon.</p>
              <p>'Right now it is impossible to sign Cristiano Ronaldo. Who would not like to have him in their team? But we need to be realistic because his would be a very difficult signing,' said Mijatovic, who also denied he had met with United assistant manager Carlos Queiroz.</p>
              <p>'There has been talk about lots of things that have nothing to do with reality. They have also said I have been seen with Carlos Queiroz and it is not true,' the former Madrid striker added in Marca.</p>
