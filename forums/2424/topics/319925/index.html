              <p>jealous that RealM got beckham and Ruud?? Well, for me, soccer is ever-evolving and moving.Once the manager decides, it is all go and no point looking behind.</p>
              <p>Ruud and Beckham may have been good for MU, but then we did not have them, and won both the EPL title and European title this season. Whose to argue with Fergie and what he brought to United?</p>
              <p>Key, Ruud had a major knee injury. Only Fergie believed in him, and bought him over to United where he catapult his career.. So my point, stop biting the hand who fed you.</p>

              <p><br> go suck eggs la fattie. how many champions league titles man u won
              compared to real madrid? and grow your cock hair can. fergie stand
              by ruud big deal? fergie is the mgr. if the mgr dont stand by the
              players, the media will comment on fergie and he will be in a
              bad light. all this is public relations. fergie must portray the
              "perfect" fatherly image. you think if ruud cannot perform on the
              big stage, fergie will care so much about him?</p>

              <p>Lastly, for goodness sake, stop being personal and using such language. It is just very degrading.</p>
              <p>If you want to use such language, can you do it elsewhere? </p>
              <p>After seeing where you going from, I won't even reply in future to you.</p>
              <p>Can the moderators stop such things, please?</p>
