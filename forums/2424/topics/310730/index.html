            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong>United’s January signing Manucho may be relatively unknown to most Reds fans, but he could be making an impact in the Premier League next season.<br><br></strong>Manucho, who scored on his debut for loan club Panathinaikos in their 2-0 win over Larisa at the weekend, was plucked from obscurity in Angola when a new scouting contact discovered his raw talent.<br><br>The task now to harness his potential, the first steps of which have been taken in sending him on loan to Greece, which should also aid his application for a work permit. <br>United’s assistant manager Carlos Queiroz, whose Portuguese contact unearthed Manucho, has high hopes of the qualities he will bring in the very near future.<br><br>“First of all he is a player that can score goals,” Queiroz told <em><strong>MUTV</strong></em>. “He’s not the sort of player you come across easily and to have the possibility to bring quality forwards to our club doesn’t happen very often.<br><br>“We are absolutely convinced he has enough qualities and potential to have a chance in the game, despite the fact that he is now 25.”<br><br>Manucho may be a late starter, but his excellent performances in the African Cup of Nations indicate a promising future.<br><br>“He showed during that competition that he is a special forward: a tall target man, a typical number nine in the box but also with enough skills to play the game and support the players behind. He’s also good with both feet and can score from inside the box or from distance.<br><br>Manucho's time with Panathinaikos will be telling – a chance to see how he copes in mainland Europe. <br><br>United's coaches will keenly monitor his progress, and with a goal on his debut for the Greek side, things are looking good.<br><br>“He just needs the opportunity to learn the game and get used to the pace of European football,” added Queiroz. <br><br>“We believe sending him on loan to Panathinaikos will help him to develop and if everything goes well we hope next season we will see him among our players.”</p></div>
