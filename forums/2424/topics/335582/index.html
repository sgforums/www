              <h2>Manchester United assistant Mike Phelan has revealed that Michael
              Carrick was on Manchester United's radar prior to his West Ham United
              days.</h2>
              <p>Wallsend is a town in north Tyneside that derives its name due to the
              location of Hadrien's Wall. Michael Carrick had left the area prior to
              making the cut as a Hammer when he was 17.<br><br>According to Sir Alex
              Ferguson's right hand man Mike Phelan, Michael Carrick was on
              Manchester United's radar as a teenager, before West Ham snapped him up
              in 1998.<br><br>Phelan admits the timing did not feel right, but two
              loan spells together with a transfer to Tottenham Hotspur and two good
              playmaking seasons later, the timing was right and the Red Devils
              eventually got their man in 2006.<br><br>Regarding the 27-year old's
              early talents, Phelan told the club's official website: "Michael was
              identified before he was at West Ham.<br><br>"But West Ham got in there quick. We saw him young and always admired his talent - the timing never fell right," he said.<br><br>"Around
              the time we signed him, we wondered whether to go for a defensive
              midfielder or one who could set the play rolling, and Michael fell into
              that category. We targeted him as a player who fitted into our grand
              scheme.<br><br>"He gives a feeling of well-being within the team," he added.<br><br>"Where
              other players might want to rush, he takes his time. He can take the
              sting out of the game, and also keep the pace of it up. It’s his
              control, attitude and way of thinking. <br><br>"He’s learned a lot
              through playing with good players, and being at a club that is
              constantly striving for more. He’s a winner, and he wants to be the
              best midfielder in the country."</p>
