He brought something fresh and new to our game and I enjoyed the competition with him. I wish him well but I just don't know what I am going to do with my wine now."<br><br>Having won five trophies in his three seasons in west London, Mourinho has been one of the most successful managers in Chelsea's entire history.<br><br>He was responsible for ending a 50-year wait for a league title and many players and fans are completely bemused at why a situation has been allowed to develop which led to this week's events.<br><br>Ferguson opted not to offer an opinion on that but he does know exactly how much Mourinho has done for Chelsea.<br><br>"He enjoyed unparalleled success there, without question," said Ferguson.<br><br>"It is a big test for whoever replaces him - and at the moment that is Avram Grant.<br><br>"I will miss the personal challenge but what it does to them doesn't matter to me. We have to be focused on ourselves and Sunday's game.<br><br>"We are still playing Chelsea. It is still the same players and that in itself is a challenge for us.<br><br>"If you look at the record between us over the last three or four years, there is nothing in it."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SAF is so candid when talking about jose.....He will never have such an ambiguous and sophisticated  guy to play mind games again.<br>Jose is an exuberant and his antics on and oof the pitch entertain us like no on ever did so.<br>I think the sacking of jose sets a precedent that will prevent talented but vocal and emotional managers to avoid the BPL.</div>
