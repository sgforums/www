            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong>Nemanja Vidic says Sunday’s hotly-contested Carling Cup final proves English football is more competitive than ever.<br><br></strong>The topsy-turvy nature of the Barclays Premier League this season has prompted pundits to question whether English teams have maintained the high standards set in recent years. But after Sunday’s narrow Carling Cup final victory, Vidic told <strong>ManUtd.com</strong> he’s convinced the league is in good shape.<br><br>“At the moment in England there are six teams who look very good and all those teams can take points off each other. That makes you realise how tough English football can be.”<br><br>The Serbian centre-back also dismissed suggestions that the Carling Cup was a trophy low on United’s list of priorities.<br><br>“Winning the Carling Cup is a big achievement,” he said. “In the past people have written it off but you saw the team we put out on Sunday – there’s no doubt we wanted to win.”<br><br>Vidic may have been smiling at the final whistle, but he had his head in his hands after just three minutes when he fouled Gabriel Agbonlahor to give away an early penalty. James Milner converted and United’s dreams of cup glory were hanging by a thread.<br><br>“We had a bad start – me more than most – but in the end we deserved the win because we created more chances. For their goal it was a lapse in concentration and bad positioning on my part. After that, though, I was focussed more and felt I did well.<br><br>“Villa had players with pace up front and they’re a physical team. But if you take away the early penalty I don’t think they created much. They looked dangerous once or twice when they got crosses in or from set pieces but overall we felt comfortable.”</p></div>

              <p><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Wayne Rooney" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/wayne-rooney"><span style="color: #005689;">Wayne Rooney</span></a> was supposed to play only the first half of the Fifa 2010 World Cup console game against the lucky competition winner at the exhibition centre in Earls Court. But the score was 0-0 and, with the contest being beamed simultaneously on the big screens to the two thousand people in attendance, Rooney's competitive streak took over. It always does.</p>
              <p>Perhaps he was cheered by his opponent's team, Spain, being down to 10 men in the mock World Cup final. Or maybe it was because, as <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on England" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/england"><span style="color: #005689;">England</span></a>, he was showing himself to be a pretty good console player. Most footballers are and Rooney, of course, does endorse the game.</p>
              <p>The <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester United" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united"><span style="color: #005689;">Manchester United</span></a> and England striker insisted that they play on, only it did not quite work out for him. Fernando Torres chipped Spain into the lead and, having seen his virtual self strike the outside of a post when clean through to equalise, Rooney watched Emile Heskey fluff a last-minute sitter.</p>
              <p>Spain were crowned as champions and Rooney threw his joy-pad up into the air in exasperation. He clearly wanted a rematch.</p>
              <p>It was great to see Rooney act like any other 24-year-old and, indeed, talk like one. At his ease during a Q&amp;A session with the presenter Mark Chapman, Rooney told the audience of his love for rock music – he has the name of a Stereophonics album tattooed on his arm – and how becoming a father last November has changed him. "The hardest thing is changing the nappies," he said, "and it gets worse as well." Chapman agreed: "It gets solid."</p>
              <p>Kai Rooney, his son, has been to a few United games but, apparently, he is an Evertonian. "I'm not sure he knows what's going on but he came to see me play in the most important game, against Everton," said the proud father. "They are the two teams I have played for and [it was] against the one that he supports."</p>
              <p>It was interesting to hear Rooney's answers to a couple of football questions. Favourite World Cup moment? "Michael Owen's goal against Argentina [in 1998], I watched it at my nan's house." Favourite all-time World Cup player? "Cristiano Ronaldo. I'm lucky enough to have played with him, although it would be great to knock out Portugal this time."</p>
              <p>Rooney, though, is no ordinary 24-year-old. In the form of his life, he enters a four-month period which could bestow greatness upon him. A shoo-in for the Footballer of the Year awards, with 30 goals in all competitions so far, he hopes to better Ronaldo's 42-goal haul for United from two seasons ago while leading the team to the Premier League title and the European Cup. And then there is the small matter of the World Cup.</p>
              <p>The trophy was at Earls Court, courtesy of Coca-Cola, and Rooney admitted that it was "weird" to be within touching distance of it. There was no touching, mind. Only heads of state and previous winners are entitled to do so and Fifa had three people on hand to ensure that the trophy's dignity was protected.</p>
              <p>"You try not to think about the World Cup," said Rooney, who will carry the nation's hopes in South Africa, "because you need to do your job with your club first. But it's a dream to play for your country at any tournament, let alone the World Cup. We'll travel with confidence because I thought we played really well in qualifying. We were just a bit gutted to lose to Ukraine because it would have been nice to go through unbeaten.</p>
              <p>"It's all set up for me. We're in a great position with United, and with England we are going well, too. Hopefully, we will have a great tournament and you never know, this trophy may be back here at the end of July."</p>
              <p>The European Cup would be some aperitif. "I think our [7-2 aggregate] win over Milan has sent out a great message," he said. "We have been in good form anyway but winning 4-0 at Old Trafford and the game in Milan, when we came back to win 3-2, has given us that extra belief that we can win the competition. Real Madrid have gone out, too, which has got rid of one hurdle.</p>
              <p>"Hopefully I can win trophies and get 42 goals as well. This is my best season yet."</p>
              <p>Rooney was happy to treat his Earls Court defeat as a mere blip.</p>
