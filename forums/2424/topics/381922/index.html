            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=22777"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ben Foster</span></span></a> is growing increasingly frustrated with his inability to secure regular football at Manchester United although the goalkeeper will not ask to leave Old Trafford in order to further his World Cup ambitions.</p>
              <p>Foster started England's friendly against Brazil in Doha on Saturday but he has not even been on the bench at club level in a number of recent games with <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=30"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></span></a> preferring <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=13943"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Tomasz Kuszczak</span></span></a> as back-up for established number one <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=8884"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Edwin van der Sar</span></span></a>.</p>
              <p>It is a difficult situation for Foster who started the season as number one at United with Van der Sar injured, before committing a number of errors, most notably in the 4-3 win over Manchester City on September 20.</p>
              <p>But he retains the faith of Fabio Capello at present having started England's last two games. With a place at the World Cup firmly within his sights, Foster is concerned at the lack of playing time he has been afforded by Ferguson.</p>
              <p>"It's a weird one," Foster said. "I am third choice for Manchester United at the moment yet I am playing for my country. It is very disheartening not even be on the bench at United.</p>
              <p>"Edwin is one of the best keepers in the world. I can't really go knocking on the manager's door and say he is not doing his job because he is.</p>
              <p>"I thought I started off well but then there was a period of two or three games where I made a few mistakes. But they were the only ones I made really and I was disappointed to find myself out of the team</p>
              <p>"It was a bit out of the blue [to start against Brazil] but I have done really well in training this week and thankfully, the boss [Fabio Capello] stuck with me. It is everything for a footballer to go to the World Cup but I can't go saying 'I want to leave' or anything like that. I have just got to see what happens."</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Old Trafford team-mate <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=21046"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Wayne Rooney</span></span></a> has spoken of his pride after skippering England against Brazil. The striker was handed the honour when <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=8931"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">John Terry</span></span></a> was ruled out due to injury.</p>
              <p>"I am really proud to have been captain," Rooney said. "I was delighted to get the job. It was a great thing for me to lead the England side out although I wanted the win. You dream when you are a kid of doing that and don't think it will ever happen - but it has - and my family will be full of pride as well.</p>
              <p>"Fabio (Capello) told me on Friday on the training pitch that if JT wasn't fit, I would be captain. I wanted JT to be fit but I am delighted when the manager praises me. He is a top-class manager who has won trophies and it is nice to hear."</p>

              <p>yes that lousy goalie from northern ireland. his mistake caused man utd defeat to ac milan in CL in 2005, I still remember that. the year before was howard, defeat to porto. if not for him, mourinho still has not won any CL.</p>

              <p>well, to be fair to him, no keeper can go thru without errors, but the key is how they bounce back.</p>
              <p>Foster did have his moments, and made some great saves. But sadly, given his position as a Keeper, anything else does led to goals/defeat, and that just got amplified more than his saves.Â </p>
              <p>And given he got a VDS standing over him, it just did not help him a bit.</p>

              <p>his kicking good meh? basically he cant handle the enormous pressure. how many a time have you seen he fluffed when coming out to collect or punch the ball in front of so many defenders.</p>
              <p>remember howard? even though he is not the same class as VDS, i rate howard higher than foster. howard is an above average goalie, while foster is pretty average, make worse by his inept kicking.</p>

              <p>oh the defence helped him a tremendous deal, lol joking. wes brown was
              funny he just gave it to their player, just as well foster brung him
              down as he still missed the penalty. Foster did ok some good saves and
              he has one hell of a kick on him if its on his left side.</p>

              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson has ruled out a January loan move for Manchester United goalkeeper Ben Foster.</p>
              <p>Although Edwin van der Sar remains sidelined by a knee injury, Foster appears to have slipped down the United pecking order as Tomasz Kuszczak has been in goal for four of the five games the Old Trafford side have played since the Dutchman has been out.</p>
              <p>It has led to talk that Foster might be offer the chance to spend the second half of the season away from United in order to preserve his England World Cup dream.</p>
              <p>However, the mere suggestion brought a brusque response from Ferguson.</p>
              <p>"Nothing is going to happen with Ben," said the United boss.</p>
              <p>"He is here and this is where he stays."</p>
              <p>Ferguson also confirmed he was still waiting for Van der Sar to decide whether he will extend his stellar career by another 12 months.</p>
              <p>At 39, the former Holland star knows he cannot continue forever. However, he will be given the chance to remain at Old Trafford if he wishes to stay.</p>
              <p>It has become normal for Van der Sar to inform Ferguson of his plans at this stage of the season.</p>
              <p>However, so far, the call has not come.</p>
              <p>"Edwin usually comes to us around this time and tells us what he wants to do," said Ferguson.</p>
              <p>"It generally comes in the form of a telephone call from his agent to (chief executive) David Gill, but we have not received it yet.</p>
              <p>"At the moment Edwin has an injury but it is not serious and he could be ready for next week."</p>
