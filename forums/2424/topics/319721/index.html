              <h2>In perhaps one of the most ironic twists in this dramatic transfer
              saga, former Manchester United and Real Madrid midfielder David Beckham
              has urged Cristiano Ronaldo to stay at United despite overtures from
              the Spanish capital...</h2>
              <p>Beckham, now of Major League Soccer outfit LA Galaxy, moved from
              Manchester United to Madrid in 2003 after something of a falling out
              between he and manager Sir Alex Ferguson.<br><br>Ronaldo was bought
              from Sporting Lisbon that same summer and given Beckham's number seven
              - formerly belonging to King Eric Cantona and a host of other United
              legends.<br><br>While Beckham could not emulate his United success with <em>los Merengues</em>,
              Ronaldo has, after a few years of bedding in, grown to be one of if not
              the best player in the world, sealing that status with a goal in
              United's Champions League win last month in Moscow, as part of a double
              with the club's second successive Premier League.<br><br>Beckham has
              urged Ronaldo to stay with the Red Devils insisting that, unlike
              himself, the Portuguese is still very much at the beginning of his
              United career, despite having been there for five years.<br><br>"I
              believe he's at the right club and a club he should stay at because as
              much as Real Madrid are a great team and one of the biggest clubs in
              the world, he's only just starting at Manchester United," explained
              Beckham.<br><br>"He's only been there a few years. He's got a lot of
              people around him who will protect him. As a fan of Manchester United I
              hope he stays there but who knows?<br><br>"It's none of my business.
              All I'm going to say to him is congratulations on an amazing season.
              I'm sure he'll be crowned world player of the year and he deserves it."</p>

              <p>When a player's heart is not with the club, there's no way he will commit 100% of his efforts. Fergie has said he would rather let Cristiano rot on the side stands than have a deal done with Real Madrid CF.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The old man's just being selfish and this is aggravating the player more to know his under the possesive nature of his coach rather than being let live on a free will as a human. What do you think Cristiano's thoughts are...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The boy from Portugal should just leave as it's crystal clear his after the money. If he really wanted to stay, the very first few instances where the speculation of transferring to Real Madrid CF was brought up, he would have down right rejected it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But alas, it was not to be, he kept delaying his decision, it's obvious he wants to leave. That was clear hints that his heart wants to go to Real Madrid CF. I won't be surprised there will be a better player in future than Cristiano Ronaldo. His not like the son of Jesus Christ.</p>
