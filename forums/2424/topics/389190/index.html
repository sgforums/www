              <p><strong>United’s many honours in the Nineties and Noughties are spurring on a new generation of players, according to young Reds defender Jonny Evans.</strong></p>
              <p>The 22 year-old and his peers are driven by a need to succeed - and a determination not to let the conveyor belt of trophies grind to a halt on their watch. But while the Northern Ireland international will enjoy being back on top of the league, and savour Wednesday's chance of reaching another Wembley final, he knows there’s still hard graft ahead.</p>
              <p>“A big thing at this club is the fear of not winning anything and not finishing at the top,” Evans told us.<br><br>“The players want to be winners. We always strive to be top at the end of the season.”</p>
              <p>Which is precisely where United were last May, when Evans collected his first championship medal after playing 17 games of a triumphant league campaign. It was effectively a great start to his life in the top flight but he knows it won’t define his career if - heaven forbid - it proves to be the only time he’s a title-winner.</p>
              <p>“There is something at the back of your mind that says you don't want to be part of a side that doesn't win anything (else),” Evans added.</p>
              <p>“I am a young player who has come into the team over the last couple of seasons. I don't want to be remembered by the fans as someone who was part of a team that loses. This club is used to winning. You don't want to be known as a failure.”</p>
              <div class="newsStory">
              <p>Although Evans was on the pitch when United also won the Carling Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup last season, he says the near misses – like losing the FA Cup semi-final and the Champions League final – can be just as motivating, if not moreso.</p>
              <p>“All the great players have said it is the defeats that drive you on rather than the victories. It is the ones that have got away,” Jonny said.</p>
              <p>“The things you win get put to the back of your mind until your career has finished. For now, you think more about the opportunities that slipped. You don't want to lose things.”<br><br>United's hopes of winning silverware this season have been raised by the return of Rio Ferdinand, who played alongside Evans on Saturday for the first time in three months.<br><br>"It is a timely boost to have Rio back," agreed Jonny. "He is a great player, with great stature in the game, and he has unbelievable experience.<br><br>"It is nice to have everyone back from injury; the competition for places will bring up our standard. That's natural."<br><br><em>Jonny Evans was talking to ManUtd.com, Key 103, PA and BBC Radio Manchester.</em></p>
