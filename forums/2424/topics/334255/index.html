              <p>Argentina international Tevez is currently on a two-year-long loan at
              Old Trafford, and Sir Alex Ferguson has the option of buying him at the
              end of that loan, next summer.<br><br>The only problem is that Tevez
              will cost Man Utd around £34m, and it has been reported that Ferguson
              is not willing to meet that price tag set by the player's owner Kia
              Joorabchian.<br><br>This could mean that Ferguson is ready to axe Tevez
              and find himself a striker that can score 20 plus goals a season. The
              rumoured, big-name candidates are David Villa, Karim Benzema and Klaas
              Jan Huntelaar.<br><br>David Villa has just signed a new contract at
              Valencia and is unlikely to move anytime soon, but Ferguson is
              reportedly keen on the 26-year-old Spanish star. The player claimed
              during the summer that he was a big fan of Arsenal and said he would be
              happy to play with them, and Liverpool apparently made an approach
              towards him in the summer, but Valencia repelled them and Villa decided
              to extend his stay at the Mestalla.<br><br>Klaas Jan Huntelaar is
              reportedly in negotiations to sign a new deal with his current club
              Ajax, and looks unlikely to leave, and Karim Benzema of Lyon has spoken
              of his desire to stay at Lyon and win a European title with the French
              champions.<br><br>This means that Man United's search for an out and
              out striker continues and Tevez could well be the one to suffer if they
              do find their man.</p>

              <h1>Fergie Reacts To Tevez Rumours</h1>
              <p>Speculation over the future of Argentine forward Carlos Tevez has been rife over the last week.<br><br>Reports
              have suggested that Real Madrid are waiting to pounce on the
              24-year-old should United get into a muddle over his permanent capture.<br><br>The Old Trafford club must pay €37 million to Tevez's management company MSI, or risk losing him.<br><br>Meanwhile,
              the player was pointing the finger at Red Devils boss Sir Alex
              Ferguson. He was quoted as saying that the Scot is failing to get the
              best out of him.<br><br>"I don't have to send any message to Carlos. He
              knows where he is and how well we have treated him," Ferguson was
              quoted as saying by Sky Sports News. <br><br>"He's been a smashing player for us and I wouldn't want to lose him. I'm quite confident he will be staying.<br><br>"There's
              no deadline. Originally, we were looking at the end of the season, but
              that's been brought forward and we have been having negotiations for
              some time.<br><br>"Hopefully, it will be resolved soon - we are ahead of things.<br><br>"I don't know if it's true Madrid want him," he added. "It could be, but I am not worried about that.<br><br>"I think we will be okay. I don't have any worries about him going."<br><em><strong><br></strong></em></p>

              <p>agree, and given this news, i think his days are numbered.</p>
              <p>And given how SAF would want to keep Rooney and Berba as his #1 pairing at the moment,  I don't think they would go the same route as tevez, buying an expensive striker and benching him.</p>
              <p>gone are the days of yorke, cole, sherrignam, and ole, who are willing to share playing time.</p>

              I think Fergie is keeping his options open.  For time being, he wants to see if Rooney and Berbatov can be a formidable partnership because thus far, I still haven't see the deadly duo forming.  
              
              If till this season ends, there is no spark, i think SAF will elect to sign Tevez.  Mind you, at EUR37m, he will Man U's most ex signing.  Tevez is not an all out striker but he is good, recall the vital goals he score to bring Man U the premier league crown.  Unfortunately for Tevez (fortunately for Man U) - this year, they are not short of options up front and relegated Tevez to the bench.  
              
              If SAF does sell Heagraves, maybe he can hold Tevez but if Rooney, Berba and Ronaldo form a potent trident in attack - then Tevez may be in doubt.

              <p>I think Berbatov has done very well for United and he looks to be getting better by each match playing with Rooney and the team... Berba is not just a goal scorer, he is also a very good assist player. He is not a selfish player and he also has good vision for putting players like Rooney and Ronaldo through on goal...</p>
              <p>I feel Rooney's sudden very good form is also down to having him around now...</p>
              <p>On Tevez, I feel the $32 or $34m is a bit too high and I think the United people are trying to get the fees reduce to around $25m... Not that Tevez is not a good player, I personally think he is better than Robinho but $34m is rather high...</p>

              <p>Perhaps selling Tevez off may be a good option, only if SAF brings in a strong centre forward type of player E.g Huntelaar.</p>

              <p>But then what if his owner cannot find a seller? In such situations, the only team who would be mad enough to buy him would be Man City. But I highly doubt that Tevez would agree to go over. </p>
              <p>What are the possibilities if Tevez refuses any other team? Would the owners agree to lower his price? Or would he just be playing for nobody? I dont think that Man U would agree to his high price, so perhaps the only way to go would be to lower his price. What u guys think?</p>

              <p>for those who think of benezema, I think his heart is not with United as he has indicated all along, he is pro La Liga..so that's hitting the wall.</p>
              <p>I am unsure whether the price Tevez should be bought is already agreed upon, or is it up for neg. So behind the scenes, there could be many things happening.</p>
              <p>However, at this point in time, with Rooney and Berba scoring, it is a bad time for tevez. -&gt; http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2008/oct/22/championsleague-manchesterunited.</p>
              <p>But as we know, strikers do suffer from dips and it may be then that Tevez can slot in and do his work. Just curious, how SAF balances the riches he has.</p>
