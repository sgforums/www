              </span></p><p><strong>By apparently misquoting Sir Alex
              Ferguson and claiming he had named Dimi Berbatov as his one and only
              transfer target this summer, The Sun may have inadvertently succeeded
              in aiding United's prolonged attempt to sign the £30m-rated striker.</strong></p>
              <p>Friday's edition of the newspaper quoted Ferguson declaring that
              "We have made Tottenham an offer on Berbatov and we have good
              expectations that this deal will go through. Berbatov has been
              impressive during a long time and would be a great addition to our
              attack. We are hoping to have a constructive conversation with
              Tottenham in the near future."</p>
              <p>Those remarks prompted a furious response from Tottenham, with
              chairman Daniel Levy branding Ferguson a "hypocrite" and making an
              official complaint against the Premiership champions along with
              Liverpool over their pursuit of Robbie Keane.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>But the saga took an unexpected twist on Saturday night when
              Ferguson categorically denied speaking to The Sun or naming Berbatov
              and warned Tottenham that they would be "embarrassed" if they sought
              action against him.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>"It is going to be very embarrassing for Tottenham because they
              have based their complaint on a story in The Sun. I don't know where
              they got these quotes from, but it certainly wasn't me," Ferguson said.
              "I haven't seen [Levy's statement] yet. I have just been given the gist
              of it by our press officer. But I'm sure our legal people will be
              looking at it."</p>
              <p>It's unclear whether Ferguson was threatening legal redress
              against Tottenham or The Sun or both, but it would appear that Levy has
              based his complaint on a story that, even on the day of its
              publication, was greeted with considerable scepticism, not least by the
              reporters who confronted the ManYoo boss as he prepared to fly out to
              South Africa for the next leg of their pre-season preparations. As The
              Sunday Telegraph notes, 'Ferguson did indeed confirm Manchester United
              had made a bid for one player and it is a fair guess that he was
              referring to Berbatov but at no time in his five-minute conversation at
              Manchester Airport did he mention the striker or Spurs by name.'</p>
              <p>While the row is bound to cause relations between United and
              Tottenham to deteriorate - and Ferguson spoke scathingly of Levy when
              he spoke at a televised press conference in Cape Town on Saturday night
              - it may yet play out to United's advantage.</p>
              <p>'Unless it can be proved that Ferguson made the comments in
              dispute, Levy could find himself defending a defamation case,' reports
              The Sunday Times. 'In all likelihood, the row has strengthened United's
              chances of signing Berbatov, who joined Spurs in May 2006 for £10.9m.
              Levy was determined to play hardball over the 27-year-old Bulgarian
              striker, for whom he is thought to be seeking £30m, but he may have to
              be more accommodating should he find himself trying to persuade
              Ferguson not to sue.'</p>
              <p>Tottenham, however, remain adamant that they were justified in
              making their complaint against both Manchester United and Liverpool. "</p>
              <p>A 'Tottenham source' told The Sunday Telegraph: "We have a huge
              amount of evidence. It's got to the point where two clubs feel they are
              untouchable in terms of ignoring competition rules.</p>
              <p>"These two managers have gone on the record publicly without
              the club giving permission and we now have two disenfranchised players
              who have had their heads turned. If Ferguson comes out fighting, it's
              because he has something to be worried about. We told Liverpool to go
              away and they went after Robbie Keane anyway."</p>
