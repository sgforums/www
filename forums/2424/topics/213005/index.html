            <div class='col-md body'>Giuseppe Rossi's loan to Newcastle was the right career move for the player, according to assistant manager Carlos Queiroz.<br><br>The young Italian striker joined the Magpies on a four-month loan at the end of August, but is yet to start a match and has made only three substitute appearances.<br><br>Carlos said: "Of course with loan players it is to give them more opportunities to play. And the more they play, the more theyÂ’re rewarded. If they donÂ’t play as much as we would expect itÂ’s not good.<br><br>"The probabilities of having opportunities here were less than with other clubs, which is why we created this opportunity for him. We have players like Alan, Ole, Wayne, Cristiano and Louis coming in with experience, so I think going to Newcastle was the right decision to create more opportunities to play.<br><br>"We cannot dictate this player plays so many games. But this level of football is not a gift. Nothing comes easy. We cannot create a false environment for talents. They need to learn what itÂ’s about to fight for a position in a team and to rebound from defeat.<br><br>The Portuguese coach admits Rossi needs to make the breakthrough into Glenn Roeder's side through his own exertions, not simply because he has come from United.<br><br>He said: "They should play because they deserve to play because the team needs them to play, not just because the player has a big name and comes from a certain club.<br><br>"Players need to be talented, mentally tough, ready to fight on a daily basis for a position. It is part of the progression and learning process of those players to be in those difficult environments.<br><br>"I always used to say that itÂ’s like somebody in the police. In the training facilities to shoot it is one thing, when you are in front of the bandits itÂ’s a different story.<br><br>"So the talents need to cross that line and leave a protecting environment. If they donÂ’t then theyÂ’ll never learn how difficult it is and how important it is to fight for a position in the team."<br><br><a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA%2D9A47%2D47BC%2DB069%2D3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=367329" rel="nofollow">http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA%2D9A47%2D47BC%2DB069%2D3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=367329</a></div>
