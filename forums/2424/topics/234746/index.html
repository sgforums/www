United failed to capitalise on Chelsea's defeat at Anfield last week as they were beaten by Arsenal's late turnaround, but they overcame Portsmouth's resistance in the cup at the weekend and will be confident of taking all three points against the rock-bottom Hornets, who have not won at Old Trafford since 1979 and remain seven points adrift of safety. The only previous Premier League meeting between these sides at Old Trafford was in October 1999, when Andy Cole's double helped United to a 4-1 win. Watford may have scored just four goals away from home all season, but they will be encouraged by the fact that United have recorded only one clean sheet in their last nine league games.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Rooney is back to his best, says Queiroz </strong></span><br><br>Carlos Queiroz has warned Watford to beware Wayne Rooney as Manchester United look to consolidate their lead at the top of the Premiership against the club lying bottom in the table at Old Trafford tonight.<br><br>After struggling for form over the opening half of the season, Rooney has recently sparked back into life, and goal-scoring form. The 21-year-old followed up his goal at Arsenal by scoring twice in the FA Cup win over Portsmouth at the weekend, the second a chip few would have dared try.<br><br>"When he does something like that, we immediately know we have a different forward in the next game," said Queiroz. "It didn't really surprise me - because when the opportunity arises in training, Wayne always tries to do special things like that."<br><br>When the concern over Rooney's form was at its height in December, Queiroz was among those to urge restraint, insisting a slight dip in standards was only natural considering how much the player had pushed himself to make England's squad for last summer's World Cup after breaking his foot in April. Added to that, the former Everton man missed three games at the start of this season after a pre-season dismissal against Porto.<br><br>However, having watched Rooney score his 11th goal of the season, Queiroz believes the youngster is almost back to his best. "Forwards are special in the sense that one goal can change the quality of their game from one moment to the next," he said.<br></div>
