              <div class="entry-content">
              <div class="entry-body">
              <p><strong>In seasons gone by the presence of Darren Fletcher’s name on the team sheet has often filled me with a curious mixture of disbelief and fury. Think Victor Meldrew at his angriest (I did actually mutter the infamous ‘I don’t believe it’ on more than one occasion).</strong></p>
              <p>It got to the point where, upon seeing the starting eleven, I would actually be annoyed if I saw Fletcher’s name instead of Scholes, Carrick &amp; Co. The game was in mortal danger of being ruined if the number 24 was taking up a precious midfield spot.</p>
              <p>This season, however, I have warmed ever so slightly to the Fletch as he has produced (for him) consistently good(ish) performances – praise indeed. He is clearly a talented player and his performances are always packed with enthusiasm and commitment, but, and this is a big but; </p>
              <p>Is he really good enough to warrant a place in starting eleven of the English and European Champions?</p>
              </div>
              <a id="more"></a>
              <div class="entry-more">
              <p>I know people will argue Fletcher has had to be selected because Anderson has been injured, Scholes is getting older and Owen Hargreaves suffering from Louis Saha ‘itis’. I sometimes wonder if United ever actually signed Hargreaves or whether I am confusing life with one of my football manager saved games again (it has happened before believe me).</p>
              <p>Anyway, back to Fletcher. His quality (or lack of) is a hot topic amongst many United fans I know. There are the Fletcher fans who claim his reliable, hard-working and selfless style is worthy of a United first team place. Then there are the group who despise his ‘boring’ 5 yard passes, lack of flair and uncanny knack of slowing down an attack.</p>
              <p>Admittedly he appears to have bulked up over the past 12 months and appears to be getting forward with more purpose. His determination and hard work alone ensure he is a valuable squad player but top class he is not. Fletcher lacks the touch of genius needed to dominate a game in the way Keane/Scholes could and Carrick can.</p>
              <p>A few years ago I remember hearing that Beckham was going to be sold and this new kid on the block was going to effortlessly fill the number 7 shirt on the right of midfield. The idea of Fletcher replacing Beckham seems as preposterous today as it did then – can you really see Fletcher selling all those shirts. Actually to be fair I suppose Beckham could pass the ball too.</p>
              <p>Anyway, Darren Fletcher; underrated by fans or overrated by Fergie?</p>

              <p>at this present moment, he is considered first team.</p>
              <p>cause the amount of work he does is incredible. both him and carrick are the most hardworking midfielders.. and despite he doesn't have the eye-catching qualities, he is the engine in that he protects the back four, and push the ball up to the flashy players like ronaldo &amp; etc to do their work. also, he does pop in to score the odd goals, think chelsea.</p>
              <p>I do admire players who innovate and improves, and he is one.</p>
              <p>We are all unsure how OwenH will develop, whether another injury will spell his retirement. Anderson is far from cementing his spots.</p>
              <p>Scholes, Giggs do require rests.. and I think SAF do rotates these two to have their experiences to come in, but come important games, the first two in the midfield will be fletcher and carrick..</p>
              <p>same as in defence, the first name will be vidic, the rock.</p>
