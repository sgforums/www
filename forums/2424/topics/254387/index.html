            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Boss calls for fitting final</strong><br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson claims United and Chelsea have a responsibility to serve up an entertaining FA Cup final this weekend.<br><br>The Premiership's top two teams will contest the first final to be held at the renovated Wembley, and the United Manager admits such an occasion deserves a fitting spectacle.<br><br>"We do want a good FA Cup final," he said. "We want to see a game that represents the English game the right way. We talk about the improvement in the English game and about three teams getting to the Champions League semi-finals.<br><br>"ItÂ’s probably the best league in Europe now, so itÂ’s an opportunity for both teams to give a display which shows theyÂ’re right two to play at the new Wembley. I think both of us will be thinking that way."<br><br>Although both sides go into the game in far from ideal form - United have one win in four games while Chelsea have drawn five straight - Sir Alex is confident of victory.<br><br>"If they play their best team and we play our best team, I wouldnÂ’t worry about that," he said. "I think weÂ’re going there with confidence with players that can handle that situation.<br><br>"WeÂ’ve got players who can win games and youÂ’re better having players who can win games than not. WeÂ’ve demonstrated that very strongly this season.<br><br>"Winning the FA Cup is a special event. WeÂ’ve lost at Wembley, when we lost 1-0 to Everton, so to me the only way you can enjoy Wembley is by winning.<br><br>"WeÂ’re going there with good confidence, weÂ’ve won the league and touch wood IÂ’ll get the players I need for next Saturday, then IÂ’ll start getting myself and the team ready for a really good game."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Saha misses showpiece<br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson has confirmed that he will be without Louis Saha for Saturday's FA Cup final clash with Chelsea, and says the Reds are now deciding whether to operate on the knee problem that has troubled him recently.</strong><br><br>The French striker, who has been limited to just four starts in 2007 due to hamstring and knee problems, made his most recent appearance as a substitute in the final 13 minutes of United's Champions League defeat in Milan.<br><br>It had been hoped he was over the injuries problems, but the 28-year-old suffered a relapse in training two weeks ago and now joins skipper Gary Neville on the sidelines ahead of Saturday's showpiece final at Wembley. Aside from those two injuries, Sir Alex has a full squad to pick from.<br><br>"There has been no progress," revealed the boss at his pre-cup final press briefing. "He had a scan on Monday and we know the problem now. It's matter of deciding what to do next; we're considering whether or not to operate. We'll make that decision in the next week."<br><br>The United manager refused to place any blame on the Frenchman, adding: "He's just unfortunate. It started off with a hamstring injury and then he gets a knee injury in training. It can happen, you come back from an injury and you're desperate to do well. You try and compensate sometimes and he has ended up with a knee injury.<br><br>"That happens with football, especially as Louis is a player built for speed. We can't apportion blame in any way. Over the years he has had hamstring problems, but he has contributed this season, getting us 13 goals.<br><br>"If you look at his record, he has had injuries. We were aware of that before we signed him. But he's such a fantastic striker that we took the chance, we took the risk. In many ways we're pleased because when he has played he's been a marvellous player for us. We just have to accept it's part of the game."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Vidic's Wembley delight<br><br>Nemanja Vidic admits he feared injury would prevent him from playing a part in SaturdayÂ’s FA Cup final against Chelsea at Wembley.<br></strong><br><br>The Serbian defender missed the whole of April after fracturing his collarbone as he jumped to meet a corner in the game with Blackburn on 31 March.<br><br>But his determination and desire to get himself fit for the final part of the campaign run-in has ensured he will be in the starting eleven for SaturdayÂ’s showpiece.<br><br>Â“After I got my injury I was a bit scared that I would miss the most important games of the season,Â” Vidic, who returned to action against AC Milan earlier this month, told ManUtd.com. Â“But I did my best to get myself fit as soon as possible after and IÂ’m happy to be back.<br><br>Â“Games like SaturdayÂ’s are the kind that you work so hard for in training every day Â– matches against big teams and big players on the biggest stage. IÂ’m excited to be playing at the new Wembley and itÂ’ll be great to be involved in a game that will go down in history. I just hope at the end of the ninety minutes we will have the trophy and the Double.Â”<br><br>Vidic and his defensive partner Rio Ferdinand will be the men entrusted in keeping Didier Drogba quiet on Saturday afternoon. The BluesÂ’ striker has been in scintillating form this season, netting 32 goals in the process. Vidic is relishing the task ahead of him, but is quick to point out ChelseaÂ’s overall quality.<br><br>Â“Drogba is a great player who has scored a lot of goals and itÂ’ll be tough to play against him, but they have great players throughout their team,Â” insists the 25-year-old. Â“A team isnÂ’t just about one player. It doesnÂ’t matter who plays because they have great quality. I just hope I can do my job well.Â”<br><br>After a tough settling-in period at Old Trafford the Serbian international has established himself as one of the finest defenders in English football this season. And his partnership with Rio Ferdinand has been hailed as the best in the country.<br><br>Â“WeÂ’ve had a good season but itÂ’s not just down to the two of us,Â” insists Vidic. Â“The rest of the defence has helped us, as have the whole team Â– we defend as a team and attack as a team.<br><br>Â“My first couple of months at United were tough and last summer I did worry that I might not make it here. I wouldnÂ’t say I was scared, but I lost a bit of confidence. When that happens you start to miss passes that youÂ’ve never missed before, things like that. ItÂ’s therefore important to be mentally strong at a big club like Manchester United.<br><br>Â“IÂ’m very happy with how the season has gone for me,Â” he continues. Â“I think IÂ’ve played some good games, but IÂ’m always looking at things I need to improve upon. I want to keep improving in every match. I hope I can continue to improve and play even better next season.Â”</div>
