            <div class='col-md body'>SAF keep using fatique as excuses but he should know most were not performing other than scholes, rooney and the 4 defenders, the rest were useless..carrick were outplay, ronaldo..where was he? when he needed to pass to rooney he tried too hard with step overs and argued with rooney when rooney tell him to pass. That was a tell tale sign that his head is getting big. And dont play him on the left..he's useless there unless he cuts in like the way he did against fullham but yesterday he was more like a passenger that try to show too much and not getting involved whenever he was needed.<br><br>We need a good midfield like keane/gattuso type to win the ball..carrick is not and only show his brilliance once in a blue moon. We need to play 2 attacker not rooney alone, he's not someone who can hold the ball well like RVN..he's the type that fit the hole in between the striker and midfield..like cantona, rooney excel whenever he's playing behind a striker but we can see he was hungry yesterday but sadly he wasn't sharp enough.<br><br>So all in all..it was a bad game because they play too cautiously and did not play their own game..I rather man united keep attacking and lose the last final to arsenal in penalty rather than sit back and pass inside their own half and lost to an ET goal that came out of nowhere.<br><br></div>

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho had warned Bennett in the build-up to the final to be on the lookout for diving by United. But it was a very different decision that caused the controversy when, during extra time, Ryan Giggs slid on Petr Cech and the ball appeared to cross the line.<br><br>Ronaldo said: "The ball was half a metre over the line. The referee saw it but he didn't give it. He had been under pressure all week from Chelsea, but that's football. It's over now - and we are the champions. That is the one we wanted."<br><br>Ferguson, meanwhile, insisted United should have had a penalty for an earlier foul by Chelsea defender Michael Essien in the same incident. "It was a penalty kick, although I don't think the linesman was in a position to see clearly if the ball was over the line," said the Scot. "But the referee should have seen the Essien foul on Giggs. The fact that it was over the line makes it worse for us, but I don't think the linesman could have seen it."<br><br>The United manager also claimed pre-match mind games from his Chelsea counterpart could have influenced referee Bennett. Ferguson said: "He [Mourinho] puts referees under pressure every big game. He talks about referees. There are 22 players out there and he's talking about the referee all week. "Maybe it worked for him today, actually. I was disappointed in the referee. An FA Cup Final. I expected better."<br><br></div>
