            <div class='col-md body'>Cole Dropped For Final - Reports<br>Fri 18 May, 05:09 PM<br><br>Ashley Cole has reportedly been dropped from the Chelsea team for Saturday's FA Cup final against Manchester United by boss Jose Mourinho.<br><br>The Evening Standard claims that the full-back has suffered the 'heartbreak' of being left out in favour of Wayne Bridge.<br><br>'The defender has done everything possible to be fit for the Wembley showpiece but Mourinho will not risk throwing him into a duel with Cristiano Ronaldo,' the newspaper reports.<br><br>'Cole has been struggling with an ankle injury and has put off an operation in order to be involved in the Final. An injection will be required for Cole to play any part in the game and he will have surgery after the Final but his failure to recover sufficiently to start will be a big blow.'<br><br>Bridge has been outstanding recently while Cole has struggled with his ankle injury.<br><br>But despite his second-string status, Bridge has never once hammered on Mourinho's door asking to quit.<br><br>Bridge said: "I want to play football and that is all about pressure every time you go out there.<br><br>"Ever since I've been here I have been playing with better players. It is totally different and I have enjoyed it - I just love it here.<br><br>"I have not knocked on his (Mourinho) door at all. I want to play every game, the same as everyone. It's all about working hard. I have tried to be the best I can and not let anyone down.<br><br>"I never wanted to leave here, I always loved it here. Even after Ashley came in I wanted to compete for my place.<br><br>"If I hadn't have played as many games it might be different, but I have played a lot."<br><br>Bridge cannot hide his enthusiasm at being among the first players to be involved in an FA Cup final at the new Wembley, but he refuses to get worked up over his chances of making the starting XI.<br><br>He added: "I am very excited to be going to Wembley. I feel like I have played well and it would be nice to be able to carry on.<br><br>"I want to play every game, everybody does. But it is down to the manager and whoever doesn't play will be disappointed.<br><br>"It's not a nervous time, I am happy to be here. I am happy to be going to the final but if I don't play from the start, I will play at some point.<br><br>"I don't know if Ashley is definitely going to have the operation. But I think I have done myself justice, I have done well and I have shown I can compete with him and hopefully I will keep doing that.<br><br>"I have played more games than I thought I was going to play. I could have been pushed aside but I have played a lot of games.<br><br>"I have just kept working hard, that's what everyone does here. When you play you have to make sure you have a good game and do well for the team and I think I have done that.

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh well... too bad. United had their chances but they didn't take it and also the referee couldn't see Giggs shot had pass the line... Cech used his body to block the view from the referee and linesman...<br><br>But Fergie should have started Ronaldo on the right instead of the left... He did that with AC Milan and they lost and he did it again tonight. Anyway, nvm lah... at least got Epl title can already lah... Still happy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Congrats to chelsea .</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I won't say its the best final nor the worst; since the start whistle, it was very obvious that both team were aiming for penalties. There were no fast-flowing Man Utd attack nor were there any deadly high/through-balls attack from Chelsea. I guess both were very conservative and storing their energy..<br><br>And that goal from Drogba was indeed stunning; kept his cool and composure and deserves the goal. I believe VDS should'nt have came out like that and should have held his line instead.<br><br>Anyway, well done for the Devils for nonetheless a successful season! I believe myself and the rest of the Devil's fans shall be very much loking forward to next season!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
