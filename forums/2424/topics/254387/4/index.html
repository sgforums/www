            <div class='col-md body'>Can see some people taking potshots just because it's against Man U. Otherwise, I think they'd post very differently. It's funny how they change their stance just because of the team they talk about.<br><br>About the match, overall it was always going to be a close call. I would more or less say it was 120 min of battling settled within a moment of brilliance. Drogba scored but credit to Lampard too for setting up the crucial final pass.<br><br>In a match like this, both sides had to take their chances and the game could have been settled earlier if both sides had done better in putting their chances away. Giggs had a chance, Lampard hit over from a shot he has easily put away in the past.<br><br>Scholes had an absolutely good game and one wonders if he might have been Man of the Match had Man U won. Cech was the busier of the two keepers but he more than stepped up to the task.<br><br>And I must say, Mourinho pulled off a masterstroke in subbing Kalou late into the game. His pace caused real problems to Man U late in the game. I have always had a poor opinion of Kalou where this season is concerned so it was nice to see him having some good contribution in such an important match.<br><br>As for the Giggs/Cech incident, quite obviously, the ball crossed the line. As far as I know, the ball crosses the line and if it wasn't a foul, then it's a goal. The ball did cross the line. However, was it a goal? Honestly, I don't know, because I  feel I do not know the game well enough to make a judgement on that. It shouldn't be considered a foul by Giggs on Cech because there wasn't even an intention there, not like the ref called for a foul either. But what to make of it that Cech was pushed over the line? Even if it was unintentional?<br><br>In the end, linesman and ref couldn't confirm it had crossed the line, foul or no foul. It would have been equally contraversial had the goal been given.<br><br>To me even before the match, anyone who won would have been deserving winners. Even after the match, I still feel it so. There had to be a winner for the evening, I'm just glad it wasn't settled on penalties.</div>

I'm quite sure it wasn't advantage. In a situation like that, ref would definitely stop play if it was a foul because it's so near the defending team. There was not much advantage to begin with and moreover, with so many players near the ball and the goal, there's every chance the ball could have gone into the net even with a ricochet or own goal by Chelsea. Not much of an advantage there.<br><br>With the goal so near, ref would definitely have given a free kick if it warranted one. Moreover, in what way was it a 'clear' foul by Giggs? There was no intent, and he might even have pulled out of it (his knees were bent). Neither was his leg sticking out or his studs showing, so how can it be a 'clear' foul?<br><br>It can be argued that there was contact, but contact alone is not enough for a foul, yet alone a 'clear' foul. I just find the point weak that it was a clear foul and advantage being played.</div>

Studs were not showing and not even a leg was sticking out. Giggs went into Cech more of because Cech positioned himself to stop the ball.<br><br>Giggs situation is different from one where ball comes in from a cross/corner where keeper catches the ball and there is a intentional push on the keeper into the goal.<br><br>And right now, ref/linesman call is that they did not see the ball go over the line. Foul or not foul, if the ball hadn't actually crossed the line, this discussion would not be in place. Point to note is that ref did not call for a foul and also did not see the ball cross the line.</div>
