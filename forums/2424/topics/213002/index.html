            <div class='col-md body'>Rio Ferdinand is refusing to give up on his dream of becoming Manchester United captain one day.<br><br>The England international stood in for Roy Keane on a number of occasions in the past and was touted as being the Irishman's long-term successor.<br><br>However, when Keane left the club in November of last year, manager Sir Alex Ferguson named a trio of potential skippers - but Ferdinand was not one of them.<br><br>Eventually Gary Neville was handed the armband on a permanent basis, but Ferdinand is not giving up on one day following his international team-mate.<br><br>He told the Manchester Evening News:"I would be lying if I said I wasn't gutted about not getting the captaincy."<br><br>"The manager had said in the past I could be the next captain after Keaney and the lads were asking what had happened between me and the gaffer, but nothing had happened.<br><br>"I figured it was because of what had gone on with the contract. But there weren't any explanations and I didn't expect the manager to speak to me. I didn't need to be spoken to about it or reasons given. I wasn't captain before Gary so there was no need for him to say anything to me and tell me why he'd done it.<br><br>"The manager has picked Gary Neville who I think is a great captain. There are no arguments from me on that score. He is a Manchester lad, United through and through and you couldn't ask for anyone better.<br><br>"However, I would definitely still love to be captain and carry the great traditions on. It remains an ambition."<br><br></div>
