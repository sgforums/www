            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice on his return to action as United cruised to a 4-1 win over Nationwide Conference side Oxford United at Kassam Stadium on Tuesday evening.</strong><br><br>The predicted rough ride for the Portuguese winger, in the wake of his unedifying episode with Wayne Rooney in the World Cup, was quick to materialise as the locals joined in a chorus of jeers as he got his first touch of the ball.<br><br>Ronaldo appeared totally unfazed by the derision aimed in his direction, although he can expect the vitriol to increase in volume when the serious stuff begins in twelve days' time.<br><br>Three other World Cup stars, Mikael Silvestre, Louis Saha (both France) and Gabriel Heinze (Argentina) were also in the side to acquire match fitness ahead of the new season.<br><br>This match was originally billed as a reserve team friendly and then appeared to have been added to the first teamÂ’s already lengthy list of pre-season appointments. Ultimately, it could probably be best filed under United XI, taking into account the make-up of the which finally trotted out to take on Jim SmithÂ’s lads.<br><br>The Kassam Stadium was almost full to its 12,000 capacity as the game kicked-off on a pleasant evening in Oxford. The local fans were in good voice and equally good heart ahead of the start of the Conference season at the weekend. They dropped down from League Two at the end of last season.<br><br>There was a measured expectancy from the Oxford supporters as the game sparked into life, but it was soon stifled as United exploded into early scoring action.<br><br>Seven minutes gone and United were 1-0 up thanks to Ole Gunnar SolskjaerÂ’s fifth goal of the pre-season campaign. Heinze crossed the ball from the left and chested it down to Solskjaer who, without hesitation, thumped it high into the net. It was a terrific goal for Ollie and a good moment for Ronaldo, but better was just around the corner.<br><br>Seven minutes after scoring the first goal, United went further ahead. This time Phil Bardsley sent over a cross from the right, Saha stopped it dead and Ronaldo lashed it past Oxford keeper Bill Turley with the minimum of effort.<br><br>The boo-boys were silenced, at least temporarily, as United took total control of the game. Barely two minutes later and United threatened to turn this pre-season game into a rout after Darren Fletcher had flashed the third goal past Turley.<br><br>The locals continued to barrack Ronaldo each time he got the ball, but that was pretty well the only time they were roused until the 27th minute when Rob Duffy reduced the arrears with a crisply headed goal past Ben Foster.<br><br>To their credit, Oxford fought back courageously during the latter stages of the first half and with a ounce of luck they could have claimed at least one further goal. Both Duffy and Eddie Hutchinson went close as the half neared its close.<br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson said before the game that all four of his returning World Cup stars would complete the 90 minutes and sure enough they all emerged from the tunnel ahead of the second half. That wasnÂ’t true, however, of John OÂ’Shea, who was withdrawn at the break and replaced by new kid on the block Jonny Evans.<br><br>Andrew Burgess shone for Oxford in the first half and he continued to catch the eye with a classy brand of wing play down the right. He tested Foster more than once as the home side looked to build on the improvement shown in the latter stages of the first 45.<br><br>United made an unexpected change in the 58th minute when Heinze left the field to be replaced by Danny Simpson. There was no obvious reason for his departure and he certainly didnÂ’t appear to be troubled in any way.<br><br>Ronaldo grabbed his second goal of the night with a clinical finish after David Jones had split the Oxford defence with some ultra-intelligent midfield play.<br><br>Two-goal Ronaldo came off in the 72nd minute with a smile as broad as the pitch he was leaving. Jeered by the locals, he was given a standing ovation by the United fans. And there was a nice gesture from Jim Smith as Ronaldo reached the touchline, the Oxford boss stepping forward to shake the hand of the Reds star.<br><br>Oxford United: Turley (Tardif 46); Anaclet, Day, Quinn, Gilchrist (Willmot 46), Johnson (Lamine 7<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">; Dempster, Hutchinson, Pattefer (Hargreaves 61); Duffy (Basham 61), Burgess (Odubade 7<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">.<br><br>Manchester United: Foster (Heaton 72); Bardsley, OÂ’Shea (Evans J. 46), Silvestre, Heinze (Simpson 5<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">; Ronaldo (Rossi72), Fletcher, Jones D., Richardson (Martin 5<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">; Solskjaer (Miller 72), Saha.<br><br>Footnote: Sir Alex Ferguson's first ever match in charge of Manchester United was away to Oxford at the old Manor Ground on Saturday 8 November 1986. He'd probably prefer to forget the result of the encounter Â– Oxford won 2-0. The United team included long-serving left-back Arthur Albiston, who was summarising Tuesday nightÂ’s game for MUTV.<br><br><a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=353288&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&amp;newsid=353288&amp;page=1</a><br><br></div>
