              <p>well done to Pool, they were the better team..</p>
              <p>Vidic is getting into a habit of getting red cards whenever facing Pool.</p>
              <p>Hmm, it seems both Vidic or Rio are having problems with Torres.. maybe a collectively effort but it seems, MU defence got tore apart.</p>
              <p>I think SAF did something right later, by putting Giggs in Central, and Nani as left Wing. More creativity/Pace that way.</p>
              <p>well, SAF, bet u regret calling someone unfit right?? Kanna Pawned.</p>

              <p>we were kind lacking in creativity.and the strength in central midfield is lacking.We were sorely missing the presence of fletcher who would run round the park with us.</p>
              <p>Carrick as usual is quite poor..haven really pick up his form yet.Valencia was anonymous most of the game.Couldn't beat defenders for god sake,nani could do better but needs more consistency.Giggs gd form seems to go out of steam for us.</p>
              <p>Its sometimes really frustrating to watch berbatov,this man could wow you with his touches for a few seconds and goes down easily and don't fight for the ball like a man...just goes down or let the opposition muscle the ball out of his way..frustrating.He don't fight for the ball..</p>
              <p>Rooney's quiet.For all due respect to oshea,he's no united quality...gd enough to cover up for odd matches here &amp; there but to cement the DR berth permanently?.no way.He's too slow..and poor positioning.Vidic n Rio still looks shaky till now...hope they can pick up and regain their confidence real soon..VDS was great..with the saves..but could do much with the 2goals</p>
              <p><br>We should re-org ourselves and start picking up agst blackburn next week..arsenal beat them 6-1,chelsea 5-0,i hope we can pick up a respectable result of our team's stature..</p>

              <p>my thoughts -&gt; well, credit to Pool la, they fought for every ball, even forcing Scholes to commit a backpass that luckily did not lead to a goal. And they had a gameplan, whenever MU counter attack, they would swarm our pacy guys to stop the attack which works brillantly.</p>
              <p>All passes from MU were contested, and they had to even rush some passes. Rooney was covered well by Carragher, and while Berba did try to do his magic, it seems he has not established a good r/s and had had a few mis-passes to no-one where normally, a Valencia/Oshea will be there to support. I think he manged to hold the ball, and basically, he tried.</p>
              <p>And Rio/Vidic just can't handle Torres. I feel, given he is the spearhead, collectively, MU should swarm him, but given his mobility, pace, it was a challenge. Evans may have done better, but a hard-nose defender, like Vidic just wasn't the right man to mark Torres, and sadly, he has 3 reds to proof this theory (indirectly).</p>
              <p>Well, the only sour-taste, was the ref.  I smiled when I see certain individuals not being booked despite repetitive fouling (gosh, do I sound like Wenger, haha). Maybe, that would have ease the pressure, but when they foul, foul, foul and foul, and the ref, just turns the other way, it is a bit hard. And I think the captain does have some priviledges. Just felt, maybe, it could have been a penalty, plus a red card.</p>
              <p>Well, we all learnt from SAF that you just can't bare your feelings about the ref, cause it will bite you back in a big way (A knight got pawned, the headlines, luv it?). So.. hopefully, MU does better overseas when things may be more neutral.. :)</p>

              <p>My thoughts on this match are, Basically, United did ok and rather well too cos least we forget, this was Anfield and Pool were really pump up for it... And the 2 owners were there with their families as well. But they are not going to be there every week...</p>
              <p>On the defence, I think we should not blame it totally as they did very well in my opinion... They are still the only defence not to concede in set plays. The problem in this match was mainly the weak midfield... It didn't do enough thats why the defence came under more pressure then usual... Rio and Vidic did very well in cutting out most of Pool's crosses into the box areas.</p>
              <p>It was the midfield that didn't win the 50 / 50 balls that gave pool the chance to create the goal... Like i have said even before the match started... Giggs, Scholes and Carrick together lack speed and toughness... On a night when Pool were really going for it, United should have had more steel in the midfield... It was a pity Fletcher was not available for this but at least have Anderson instead of Carrick cos I hardly notice Carrick in the first half at all... Was he even playing... lol</p>
              <p>Scholes was easily rob be Lucas early in the first half and only the poor quality shot from Kuyt didn't see Pool take an early lead... United could have had an equalizer towards the end when Valencia hit the bar... Had that gone in, Pool's players spirit would have deflated as well like a balloon...</p>
              <p>And again on the Carragher part, its clear the referee got it wrong. Cos if we watch where Owen was, had he gone through, he would be in the same position where he scored against City... So we have to wonder about the referee's judgement...</p>
              <p>But overall, I think its not a big deal to United cos this was still an away match... And if i am honest, i would still rather be in United's position than in Pool's.</p>
              <p>Rafa's problems could be how is he going to motivate the players when they come up against perceive weaker opponents? I think he didn't need to do much for this as the players could motivate themselves for it... But when the weaker ones comes along, I won't be too surprise if they drop points against Fulham or City next 2 weeks...</p>

              <p>But overall, I think its not a big deal to United cos this was
                  still an away match... And if i am honest, i would still rather be
                  in United's position than in Pool's.</p>
              <p>Rafa's problems could be how is he going to motivate the players
                  when they come up against perceive weaker opponents? I think he
                  didn't need to do much for this as the players could motivate
                  themselves for it... But when the weaker ones comes along, I
                  won't be too surprise if they drop points against Fulham or City
                  next 2 weeks...</p>

              <p>I echo most of what U said esp MF. It was exposed for speed. Fletcher would have make a better impact. cause I think primarily Scholes/Carrick's role was to deliver the ball forward. but they pressured them so well, they can't go anywhere..</p>
              <p>But then, the ref did encourage Pool's players to be more aggressive with MU. That has a big impact on MF too.</p>
              <p>Valenica's influence is slowly growing. Good signs..</p>
              <p>As for MU, let's hope that it stir them to do better.</p>

              <p>I was wondering why anderson was not playing in the second half?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>fergie should have played 4-5-1, with an extra midfield since it is at anfield, an away match. giggs still have uses, like taking free kicks and corner kicks and his accurate passing, but scholes? sadly he really looks his 35 years of age. time to not to play him often in the league or play him in cup and CL matches.</p>

              <p>oh... can I add a why?? why no fletcher huh?? I think MU "lost" a lot when he was not playing, and he has become quite a player for MU.</p>
              <p>Liverpool avoiding infringements in those sensitive areas?? Well, allow me to quote wenger "the ref is generous"..</p>
