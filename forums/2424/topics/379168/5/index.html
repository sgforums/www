              <p>2006-07 season and 2007-08 season they did fine, but the last 3 matches is just absolutely horrible.</p>

              <p>Lets be gracious here ok. Today, even the much maligned Lucas and the ever dependent Masch dominated Scholes and Carrick in midfield. We did not cause serious trouble for the defence of Man U but seriously what was Ferdinand doing, they were practically inviting Yossi to make that pass to Torres and if Torres had gone down, that would be a penalty and a red for Rio surely but as one of the greatest strikers, he stayed on his feet and made a shot that is almost impossible to stop.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And must commend Carragher for his performance today. Although, he was the last man, Owen was going away from goal, so thats the ref's interpretation so its only a yellow card.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>I totally agree with you, and precisely what I meant from the start... There was no fight at all in the midfield... I am not surprise Scholes, Carrick and Giggs were over run in there... When I first saw the line up, I already said its finished... (You can see it at the top of page 3) lol... Pool are not a rubbish side at home, they are a very fast team and if you don't have fast players especially midfielders to combat them, then its finished. Exactly what I expected...</p>
              <p>Against arsenal also the same, I have to say had it not been for Fletcher playing in that match, United would have also lost to the gunners...</p>
              <p>And to be honest, it wasn't as though Owen was heading for the corner flag, i think it was more like the top edge of the box... But still the rules say last man so I have to take it as that...</p>
              <p>And what is with Vidic and Mascherano, these 2 fellers always gets sent off when they meet... lol. The better team on the day won indeed...</p>

              <p>Liverpool is very unpredictable nowadays, especially when the odds are stacked against them, they do damn well, like today.</p>
              <p>Indeed, the battle was won in midfield, pool players closed down every ball whereas man utd didnt looked like they wanted to win the ball back, they needed anderson or fletcher badly. I would say lucas and mash did well. Benayoun was exceptional for me he was the motm. It also seemed that rio and vidic seem uncomfortable handling torres, its like their nemesis. Vidic's red card was damn similar to the one last season where he was the last man and he brought down gerrard i think.</p>

              <p>alright, my thoughts for today's match</p>
              <p>lucas did so so, not bad as compared to previous performances.</p>
              <p>yossi had a really good time on the right side, im really impressed.</p>
              <p>torres had problems in the early game with vidic and rio, both seem to want torres out of the game. i was abit worried though, that fernando cant take it.</p>
              <p>dirt kuyt as usual, nothing special nothing so bad.</p>
              <p>fabio aurelio was alright, i was very surprised at rafael's decision to play him in the center then abit left.</p>
              <p>jamie improved from previous bad performances</p>
              <p>agger stayed as he is, had a few couple of decent tackles</p>
              <p>glen was okay on the right, did enough to stop evra and giggs at certain point of the game.</p>
              <p>i was so worried when i saw 5 mins added.</p>

              <p><strong>In the build-up to the </strong><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/premierleague/liverpool/6425843/Liverpool-2-Manchester-United-0-match-report.html"><span style="color: #234b7b;"><strong>Liverpool v Manchester United </strong></span></a><strong>clash at Anfield, all the focus had been on the problems of the hosts. No squad depth, two-man team, cold and unimaginative manager – so the charge sheet read. The problems of their opponents went completely under the radar, primarily because they lay top of the Premier League.</strong></p>
              <p>Manchester United’s problems this season have occasionally risen towards the surface (the form of Rio Ferdinand), but have never truly broken through, mainly due to the wonderful form of Wayne Rooney and the majestic Ryan Giggs.</p>
              <p>But United still appear to be struggling to adapt to the Cristiano Ronaldo-shaped hole in their midfield. They have looked superb in patches this season (away at Tottenham and in the second half at Wigan), but they have failed to consistently hit the heights they were capable of in seasons past.</p>
              <p>United were outplayed by Arsenal at Old Trafford in August, yet somehow prevailed 2-1, were given a major scare by Manchester City, needed a 94th-minute own goal by Anton Ferdinand to rescue a draw against Sunderland and were left desperately clinging on at home to Bolton a week ago. Without Darren Fletcher at Anfield, the midfield was overrun and outfought. How they need a fully fit Owen Hargreaves.</p>
              <p>Michael Carrick has so far been underwhelming this term, and he was again ineffectual at Anfield, and while Paul Scholes has played well, he is not a long-term solution in central midfield. Both failed to deal with the pressing game that Liverpool employed against them on Sunday, Rafael Benitez ensuring Lucas Leiva and and Javier Mascherano were always upon them, giving them no time to breathe.</p>
              <p>Anderson remains frustratingly inconsistent, Antonio Valencia is slowly improving but is no Ronaldo and Nani is just, well, Nani. Only Giggs and, when fit, Fletcher have consistently shone in the United midfield and that must be a concern for Sir Alex Ferguson.</p>
              <p>Ferdinand’s form has already been under the spotlight this year, and he should have done better for Fernando Torres’ opener at Anfield. And with John O’Shea unconvincing at right back and Dimitar Berbatov an underwhelming enigma up front, there are yet more problem areas for Ferguson to address.</p>
              <p>But those problem areas will be addressed. Ferguson will not allow a defeat at Anfield to precipitate the onset of a crisis. United may not quite look the force of the past two seasons, but they remain the Premier League champions and it will still take a Herculean effort for anyone to dethrone them.</p>
