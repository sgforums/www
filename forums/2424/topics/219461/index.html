            <div class='col-md body'>Manchester United have dismissed claims that American Freddy Adu will have a trial at the club.<br>Reports had suggested the 17-year-old striker, who plays Major League Soccer for DC United, would visit Old Trafford for two weeks in November.<br><br>A United statement said: "Freddy Adu will not be attending a trial with Manchester United as has been reported on both sides of the Atlantic."<br><br>Adu is contracted to MLS and not the club and has one more season to serve.<br><br>The Washington Post reported that Adu would link up with United for a two-week trial, starting on 18 November.<br><br>The United statement continued: "The reports contradict statements released last season in which United expressly pointed out that a Adu was not a player they are currently interested in.<br><br>"Despite the recent bout of speculation, United's stance has not changed and Adu will not be attending a trial."<br><br>DC United's domestic season ended at the weekend after losing a play-off to New England Revolution.<br><br>After the game Adu said there had been "some serious talks" that could lead to him playing elsewhere next year and his comments heightened speculation over his future.<br><br>"I'd like to be back but my ultimate goal is to go overseas and if it comes sooner rather than later, I'll take it," he added.<br><br>Adu has played three seasons for DC United, having joined them at the age of 14.<br><br>Although there is only one year remaining on his contract with MLS, there is an option for two more for the Ghana-born player, who has been hailed as the great hope of American soccer.<br><br>Any potential move to Europe will be permissible under international transfer rules when he turns 18 in June 2007.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Manchester United have confirmed to Sky Sports News that American teenager Freddy Adu will link up with the club for a two-week trial.<br><br>The Washington Post reported on Wednesday that the DC United ace was to spend two weeks with the Premiership giants later this month.<br><br>United earlier moved to reject the report but have now made a U-turn on their previous stance.<br><br>The 17-year-old is expected to train with the Premiership giants towards the end of the month to allow him to get a taste of English football.<br><br>If he impresses manager Sir Alex Ferguson, The Red Devils could step up their bid to land the Ghana-born striker in January.<br><br>Adu turns 18 next June and would therefore be eligible to move to Europe ahead of next season, but United may look to wrap up a deal as soon as possible.<br><br>However, they are likely to face stiff competition from across Europe with clubs such as Chelsea and Real Madrid also linked with the teenage sensation.<br><br>But United appear to have stolen a march on their rivals by luring him to Old Trafford for a short trial.<br><br>Adu still has a year remaining on his contract with DC United but is known to be a fan of The Premiership and could look to quit Major League Soccer for England next year.</div>
