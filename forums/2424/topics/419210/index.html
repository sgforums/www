              <p><strong>Manchester United striker Federico Macheda is set snub offers from the Barclays Premier League to join Sampdoria.</strong></p>
              <p>West Bromwich Albion were the latest top-flight side to make a move for the Italian youngster but he is now braced for a move back to his homeland.</p>
              <p>Macheda is likely to join Sampdoria until the end of the season after experiencing limited opportunities at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>His agent Giovanni Bia told Sky Italia: 'Sampdoria? We are nearly there. We are awaiting only the formality of exchanging faxes.</p>
              <p>'It's a six-month loan, then we'll see with if he can stay another year. It's a 99 per cent chance he'll have to return to United.'</p>

              <p><strong>Sampdoria are in need of a new forward with Antonio Cassano joining AC Milan, while Macheda - who left Lazio for United in 2007 - is looking to play more regularly.</strong></p>
              <p>Club president Riccardo Garrone said: 'Macheda has easily filled the void left by Cassano, he will definitely do well.</p>
              <p>'In these five months we will try to treat him well. With him here, the enthusiasm has increased tenfold.'</p>
              <p>Macheda, 19, was an instant hit at United when he scored an injury-time winner on his debut against Aston Villa in April 2009.</p>
              <p>The news Macheda is set for Serie A will dash any hopes West Brom had of securing his services. Baggies boss Roberto Di Matteo admitted: 'Macheda is someone we looked at right at the start of last season. He's a striker, we are after a striker and we have to look at whether Manchester United will let him join us.'</p>

              <p><br>Rossi was just an average player lah back then and still is present day unfortunately... Even if he had stayed till today, he still wouldn't be in the first team.</p>
              <p>And i belief the different outlook we have for him today could be because United sold him early... Maybe had he stayed and played more and missed often, we will be cursing him rather than missing his presence... lol.</p>
              <p>Another way to look at it is, they made a good sum over him... So that's good enough for me...</p>

              <p>Rossi is doing well at Villarreal leh, having already scored 14 times this season despite making only 25 appearances and he has since been selected regularly to represent Italy by the new coach so i wouldn't say he was an average player, he's above average. Maybe his build is not suitable for the premier league.</p>
              <p>Like I've mentioned in other thread before, Fergie will have a (healthy) headache next season thinking how to contemplate with 7 strikers: Rooney, Berbatov. Chicharito, Macheda (if he's not sold), Owen (if he is offered a new contract), Welback (back from loan at Sunderland) &amp; Mame Biram Diouf (back on loan at Blackburn). So I wouldn't be surprised at all if Macheda is leaving on a permanent.</p>
              <p>Pique was loan to Zaragoza and made an impression and immediately a host of Spanish clubs swarm around United like vultures waiting to snap him up and eventually he went on to Barca. Rossi did well at Parma while on loan and he too, was sold off to Villarreal the next season. I guess my theory of Macheda is backed by the pattern of "foreign young players returning to their homeland and do well will be sold the next season"</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>A top player he clearly isn't still... He may get better in future or not we never know but at current level, he is still a long way from the Rooney, the Berbatov or perhaps even the <span lang="EN-GB">Hernandez level... </span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">If we are to think back carefully, he was sold at a time when Ronaldo, Tevez and Ronney were still playing the strikers position... So were United suppose to give him first team spot just to keep him at the club? I don't think so... Cos despite the education he has been getting these past few years (presuming he has improved playing first choice in Spain) he still isn't a top top striker that would command a $25 to $35 million transfer fee like... Benzema or Aguero kind...</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">Getting into the Italy squad isn't something to be wow about nowadays... Perhaps 8 to 10 yrs ago it might have mean something but today, the squad is at its lowest point and they are trying to re-build... In the last WC finals, people were saying there was not even one striker in the Italian squad that would worry the opponents... And in a group together with Paraguay, Slovakia, New Zealand... </span><span lang="EN-GB">Italy ended in 4th place behind even New Zealand can you even belief it ! ... That said enough i think...</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">On Pique, if we are being honest... will you consider replacing Rio or Vidic even today with him? let alone 2, 3 years ago?  The guy came from Barce's youth team and when they came calling for him with a chance of playing for Barcelona, naturally he would want to go back...  How many players wouldn't want to play for them at this 'golden period'? Anyway, I don't think he is as good as Rio or Vidic in the air which is a big part in English football.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">
              </span></p><p>On Macheda, well... It's very much like the Rossi situation isn't it... If the guy is patient and willing to wait for his time... Maybe he will get his chance in future. But if he wants to play now and clearly they can't give him that right now... Then they will have to let him go too... Cos we have all seen how he perform when he starts... Not very effective... So should United keep him at the expense of the squad performance?</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>And like you have said Fergie will have a (healthy) headache next season but I think Owen will leave, Diouf might get sold or loan again... Macheda might come back or continue his loan for another season... And Welbeck will come back? Or maybe Owen will stay cos his salary is so low can keep him just to make Pool unhappy... lol. Anyway, the guy can still score lah...</p>
              <p>So when we think of why they had to be sold or let go... It's just part of the game. But these young players help the club earn good profits. Macheda today is still behind <span lang="EN-GB">Hernandez just like Rossi was to Van Nisterlrooy and Saha... If he cannot wait, then he have to go. But I always believed if you are good enough, you will make the first team... and Rossi wasn't... </span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">Anyway, if he indeed gets better, Fergie still have first option to buy him back. But Fergie haven't made any move to bring him back... </span></p>
