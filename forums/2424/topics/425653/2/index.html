              <p>haha this for you liverpool fans :) So many arsenal and chelsea fans must have been gloating. I wonder what they're feeling now. Wooh!! Shiok man this feeling of comeback.</p>
              <p>Then again, i'd like to ask what gibson has done the whole game. Superb....most of the players. Fabio and rafael are going to terrorise the flanks of the EPL the next decade.</p>

              <p>United took full advantage in the second half, with Rooney pulling a goal back before levelling with his 100th league goal for his club.</p>

              <p>United manager Sir Alex Ferguson watched the match unfold from the stands as he is serving a touchline ban for criticising referee Martin Atkinson.</p>
              <div class="body">
              <p>After 10 minutes another decision went against his team when the hosts took the lead through Noble's first penalty, after a move that started on the edge of West Ham's penalty area.</p>
              <p>Thomas Hitzlsperger's long pass out of defence released Carlton Cole, whose attempt to lob the ball over Patrice Evra resulted in the France international handling.</p>
              <p>Noble kept his nerve and sent Tomasz Kuszczak the wrong way to establish a lead, then doubled the advantage in the 25th minute with another spot-kick.</p>
              <p>Mason's decision for the second penalty may have angered Ferguson, as Vidic was certain his challenge on Cole came outside the area.</p>
              <p>The Serbia international even pointed to the precise area he had made the tackle as Cole danced in from the left, but Mason had already made his decision.</p>
              <p>Noble went for power with his second penalty, and in the opposite corner, with his finish angling into the roof of the net.</p>
              <p>United were inevitably going to see more of the ball as they chased the game, but their first sight of goal led to an athletic save from Robert Green.</p>
              <p>West Ham manager Avram Grant could not understand why Green did not play for England against Ghana in Tuesday's friendly at Wembley following his recent good form.</p>
              <p>He produced a fine stop to deny Park Ji-Sung when the midfielder was left unmarked and unleashed a powerful volley.</p>
              <p>United also felt they should have had a penalty when Rooney's poor control saw the ball flick up and strike Upson on the arm.</p>
              <p>Vidic, though, was thankful for Mason's leniency when he was only given a yellow card when he prevented Ba from racing through on goal. Hitzlsperger flashed the resulting free-kick just wide.</p>
              <p>Hernandez was brought on at the half-time interval, with Ryan Giggs moved to left-back as United looked to get back into the game.</p>
              <p>Rooney pulled a goal back with a spectacular curling free-kick 25 yards from goal after Noble had fouled Michael Carrick in the 65th minute, giving United momentum heading into the final phase of the game.</p>
              <p>Rooney then levelled the match when he collected Antonio Valencia's pass, raced past Manuel Da Costa and fired his finish beyond Green.</p>
              <p>Dimitar Berbatov, on as a substitute, forced two saves from Green but it was Rooney who grabbed the lead for them, tucking away his penalty after Upson handled Fabio da Silva's cross.</p>
              <p>Giggs crossed for Hernandez to tap in with six minutes remaining to add gloss to the scoreline.</p>

              <p>My take is West Ham lacked the mentality to win / stay in the Premiership. Sure, they do get odd results sometimes but letting go of a 2 goal lead at home?</p>
              <p>Kudos to United, they never gave up fighting but I'm sure critics will point to the referee failure to send Vidic off for 2-3 cynical fouls.</p>
              <p>Are we finally seeing the Rooney of last season? The Hat-Trick he scored was from a freekick, an open play and a penalty, all rounded goals I would say, the only one missing is a header. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> I think Nani should let Rooney take free kicks from now on. Nani can only blast over the bar while Rooney needs just 1 attempt to score the goal. Perfect execution, should make Becks proud.</p>
              <p>It's a really really good day for all United supporters: The 2 title challengers Arsenal and Chelsea both dropped points with draws, Man City is not playing until today (hope they drop points after seeing how Arsenal and Chelsea falter) and Liverpool lost.</p>
              <p>Glory Glory Man United. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>

              <p>Oh, and I've yet to mention this: Is this really Chicharito's first venture in Europe top league / first season at United?</p>
              <p>Cos from the way he plays, he seems to have been around for quite some time. His predatory instincts are really second to none at the moment, always at the right place at the right time. He reminds me more of Owen of the past than Solskjaer mainly because Solskjaer is not known for pace and Chicharito is much faster.</p>
              <p>I do believe Chicharito's stock has risen to at least 3 folds from the 7-8m paid for him. A very sound investment indeed. Will we get to see more of these young stars at United? Rodwell? De Gea? Henderson? Oxlaide-Chamberlain?</p>

              <p>The difference Ferguson makes can't be more telling...  Sure we can get the top strikers and the top midfielders or top defenders but the man pulling all the strings isn't a creative midfielder or a striker but the old guy in the stands...

              <p>I'm sure the United fighting spirit will stay with the team since the core still remains. The new manager will have a tough time replacing Fergie simply because of the immense pressure for continuation of success, of which I can only think of one man capable enough of doing so - Jose Mourinho.</p>

              <p><br>Personally, I am not even sure Mourinho can deliver cos even though he has been successful, there are 'holes' that could be found during his successful years...</p>
              <p>Just take Chelsea for instance, he was in charge during a time when serious competition was lacking... A young Arsenal and United sides were in the process of re-building while his Chelsea was being bank-roll by a willing to spent Roman... In other words, it was easy. Chelsea had the title settled by Feb/Mar. But 2 yrs later when United have finally re-build, a come of age Rooney and Ronaldo, Mourinho couldn't deliver anymore...</p>
              <p>Then he time at Inter... Honestly, if not for the Champions League, winning the Serie A was like a walk in the park for him...</p>
              <p>He is facing competition now in Spain by only one side and yet he don't seem to be having any magic to turn it around...</p>
              <p>So don't expect too much for Jose...</p>
              <p>I think the fighting spirit we are seeing there currently is mainly because of Fergie...  The fear in instil in them makes them fight harder... Take away the man and that may go too before too long...</p>
