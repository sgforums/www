              <p>Ince was just another United player to be honest... Owen is like a Liverpool legend leh... I can't wait to see him in a United shirt...</p>
              <p>Another thing is, he may have had some injuries these last 2 yrs but he is still a quality striker... so if he can pass the stringent medical test, i don't see any problem with it as this deal is after all, free.</p>
              <p>We have to remember Giggs was probably more injury prone than him a few year ago but he has since been doing very well even now at 35 with proper rest and guidance from Fergie and the medical staff at United. I belief Owen if he joins, will be used selectively and not in every match... He will be given enough time to play and recover... Playing in a top 4 side may see his confidence return and next season being a WC year, Owen will want to prove that he still has the hunger for the top level...</p>
              <p>To me, for all of Rooney's aggression and power play, his finishing isn't the best yet... There is room for improvements there... Owen is just what United need, an experienced finisher... Not too flashy of a player but a staight forward 'fox in the box' shooter... And for all we know, Fergie is bringing him in as a 4th striker...</p>
              <p>And I believed United and all the rest wanting to play in the CL, need to have at least 8 players with UK passport or more than 3 yrs at the club since their age of 17 out of the 25 registered... Not sure totally on this yet tho... But United do have enough with or without Owen lah...</p>

              <p>owen is quite lucky to have joined Man Utd, not the other way round. after newcastle and his injuries, which top clubs besides Man Utd dared to gamble on him. his former club liverpool didnt even bother to sign him for free.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">MICHAEL OWEN has sealed his sensational move to Manchester United.</h2>
              <p class="article">The out-of-sorts England striker has signed a two-year deal with the Premier 
              League champions after completing a series of stringent medical tests this 
              evening.</p>
              <p class="article">Owen has agreed a deal worth £50,000 a week - half of what he earned with 
              previous club Newcastle.</p>
              <p class="article">But it is understood he will be given huge bonuses depending on appearances 
              and the number of goals he scores.</p>
              <p class="article">Owen's Toon contract expired on July 1 with only Stoke and Hull expressing an 
              interest in the 29-year-old.</p>
              <p class="article">But Old Trafford chief Alex Ferguson has made his move, convinced he can 
              revive the former Liverpool star's fortunes.</p>
              <p class="article">Fergie said: "Michael is a world-class forward with a proven goalscoring 
              record at the highest level and that has never been in question.</p>
              <p class="article">"Coming to Manchester United with the expectations that we have is 
              something that Michael will relish."</p>
              <p class="article">Owen revealed he did not hesitate to join the club once Ferguson came calling.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: "I had just begun to talk to other clubs when, out of the blue, 
              Sir Alex phoned me on Wednesday afternoon and invited me to have breakfast 
              with him the next morning - during which he told me that he wanted to sign 
              me. I agreed without a moment's thought.</p>
              <p class="article">"This is a fantastic opportunity for me and I intend to seize it with 
              both hands.</p>
              <p class="article">"I am now looking forward to being a Manchester United player and I am 
              fortunate that I already know so many of the players here.</p>
              <p class="article">"I missed pre-season last year and am pleased that I will be starting at 
              Carrington from day one.</p>
              <p class="article">"I want to thank Sir Alex for the faith he has shown in me and I give him 
              my assurance that I will repay him with my goals and performances."</p>
              <p class="article">Owen's shock switch caps a remarkable turnaround for the ex-Real Madrid 
              hitman.</p>
              <p class="article">Having been relegated with Newcastle just six weeks ago, he faced an uncertain 
              future with none of Europe's big guns showing an interest in him.</p>
              <p class="article">England boss Fabio Capello has continually snubbed him at international level. 
              But, with the World Cup finals less than 12 months away, he could now force 
              his way back into the reckoning if he succeeds at United.</p>
              <p class="article">The Old Trafford new-boy will battle it out for a starting berth with Wayne 
              Rooney and Dimitar Berbatov.</p>

              <h1>Manchester United complete sensational Michael Owen signing on two-year deal</h1>

              <p>Michael Owen has completed a free transfer to <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Manchester United</span></a>. The Barclays Premier League champions confirmed the 29-year-old had signed a two-year deal after completing a medical at a south Manchester hospital this afternoon.</p>
              <p>The injury-prone England international, whose contract with Newcastle United expired earlier this week, is understood to have agreed a pay-as-you-play deal at Old Trafford.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p>United boss Sir Alex Ferguson said: 'Michael is a world class forward with a proven goalscoring record at the highest level and that has never been in question.</p>
              <p>'Coming to Manchester United with the expectations that we have is something that Michael will relish.'</p>
              <p>Michael Owen, who until United's enquiry had been linked to <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/hull-city.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Hull City</span></a>, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/stoke-city.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Stoke City</span></a>, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/aston-villa.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Aston Villa </span></a>and <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/everton.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Everton</span></a>, said:  "I had just begun to talk to other clubs when out of the blue Sir Alex phoned me on Wednesday afternoon, invited me to have breakfast with him next morning during which he told me that he wanted to sign me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/07/03/article-1197350-006AA2A800000258-633_468x301.jpg" alt="Michael Owen" width="468" height="301"></em></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Red hot: Michael Owen scores against Chelsea for Liverpool six years ago</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>'I agreed without a moment's thought. This is a fantastic opportunity for me and I intend to seize it with both hands. 'I am now looking forward to being a Manchester United player and I am fortunate that I already know so many of the players here.</strong></p>
              <p>'I missed pre-season last year and am pleased that I will be starting at Carrington from day one.  'I want to thank Sir Alex for the faith he has shown in me and I give him my assurance that I will repay him with my goals and performances."  </p>
              <p>He added to MUTV: 'It feels great. When I got the call from the manager to come round and meet him it was a shock, but I'm obviously really happy. 'I've had a poor spell up at Newcastle but prior to that my career was very good, and I'm sure a top club like this can re-ignite my career.'</p>
              <p>Owen added that his fitness problems of recent seasons should not be a concern for United's fans. 'I'd like to think that everyone was quite surprised with my medical," he said.</p>
              <p>'I passed my medical and I've obviously passed them before, and my fitness is high. A lot is made out of it but I certainly don't feel like I'm injury prone.'</p>
              <p>It is believed Owen could be offered as little as £20,000 a week as a basic salary but with massive performance-related bonuses which could take him close to the £110,000 a week he was on at Newcastle United.</p>
              <p>Details emerged after talks and preliminary fitness checks yesterday. The former <a><span style="color: #003580;">Liverpool </span></a>player was pictured driving to United's Carrington training ground this morning before later completing his medical in hospital.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Emerging with a smile reminiscent of a child entering a chocolate factory, it was clear then that he would soon be United's second major signing of the summer, helping to provide firepower following the departures of Cristiano Ronaldo and Carlos Tevez.</strong></p>
              <p>The prospect of signing a former Anfield favourite was not greeted with unanimous enthusiasm from Stretford Enders, particularly when the player in question is perceived by many to be washed up - including, it seems, the England manager Fabio Capello.</p>
              <p>But Ferguson believes the former Real Madrid poacher is a gamble worth taking if he can stay injury-free and return to the kind of goalscoring form that made him European Footballer of the Year in 2001.</p>

              <p>Campbell sold. But macheda and welbeck i think only 1 of them will go on loan. Man Utd need extra strikers even when none injured cuz got matches like 3-4 days 2 matches.</p>
