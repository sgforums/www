              <div class="ds-firstpara"><strong>Manchester United are
              confident they will tie up a permanent deal for Carlos Tevez despite
              warnings they risk losing the on-loan Argentine striker if a solution
              is not reached before the New Year.</strong></div>
              <div class="ds-firstpara"><br></div>
              <p>Last summer, United investigated the possibility of landing Tevez from West Ham. <br><br>The
              complicated third party ownership issue transformed the business into a
              saga with the Hammers demanding a fee as they argued they owned his
              registration.<br><br>The mess was finally sorted with his part-owners
              Media Sports Investment - which was run at the time by Tevez's agent
              Kia Joorabchian - agreeing to pay West Ham £2m to release him.<br><br>It
              allowed United to move in with a two-year loan deal struck with
              Joorabchian that is reported to have cost the Reds £10m. Both United
              and Tevez want the Old Trafford move to be permanent and that could
              cost the club a further £10m.<br><br>But the Premier League tightened
              its rules on third party ownership at its AGM last month. No Premier
              League club can now sign up a player who is owned, partly or wholly, by
              a third party.<br><br> United have been looking into an answer but
              according to reports Tevez is getting impatient that the Reds have not
              come to the table with a deal and that if nothing is done by the end of
              2008 he will have to begin looking for alternatives.<br><br> Tevez said
              on the eve of the Champions League final he hoped his transfer
              situation would be solved. "I would certainly love to extend my
              contract," the 24-year-old said ahead of the Moscow showpiece with
              Chelsea.<br><br>"I would go and sign right now if the opportunity was there." <br> Last November Sir Alex Ferguson was sure United would be able to end Tevez's loan situation at Old Trafford. <br><br>"There is no question about his long-term future here. <br><br>Our chief executive David Gill has spoken to his agent and told him we are very happy with him," Ferguson said at the time. <br><br>"The fee is in place. I won't tell you what it is but it is still cheap. I want to make this happen." <br><br>Tevez scored 19 goals for United in his debut campaign.</p>
