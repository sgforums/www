              <p>Manchester United booked a place in the Carling Cup final on Tuesday night with a <a href="/report?id=259086&amp;cc=4716"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">4-3 aggregate win over Derby County</span></span></a>, but a raft of fresh injuries meant victory came at a steep price for Sir Alex Ferguson.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="sp-inlinePhoto"><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/PH2/nani275e.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="275" height="200"> </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>United could be without <a href="/players/profile?id=25409"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Rafael</span></span></a> for at least a month after he sustained a torn hamstring, Brazilian midfielder <a href="/players/profile?id=88360"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Anderson</span></span></a> left the pitch on a stretcher after suffering an ankle injury and <a href="/players/profile?id=67716"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Nani</span></span></a>, <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=8862"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Gary Neville</span></span></a> and <a href="/players/profile?id=83176&amp;cc=4716"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Jonny Evans</span></span></a> all picked up knocks.</p>
              <p>With an FA Cup fourth round tie coming on Saturday against Tottenham Hotspur, Sir Alex Ferguson, already without <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=7825"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Rio Ferdinand</span></span></a>, <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=8866"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Wes Brown</span></span></a>, <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=21046"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Wayne Rooney</span></span></a> and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=21931"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Patrice Evra</span></span></a>, admitted the situation was not ideal.</p>
              <p>''There are probably six or seven of them who have picked up injuries,'' confirmed the United manager. ''It has been a bad night in that respect''.</p>
              <p>''We finished with 10 men but it was effectively nine because Jonny was in great discomfort. We will just have to see what happens now.''</p>
              <p><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=8871"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Darren Fletcher</span></span></a> is almost certain to be called on as a makeshift right-back, while Fabio might be handed his senior debut against Spurs if Neville does not make it.</p>
              <p>It took the gloss off victory in an entertaining contest, as Nani, <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=7624"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">John O'Shea</span></span></a> and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=72490"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Carlos Tevez</span></span></a> scored before half-time and, although Giles Barnes found the net twice for Derby, <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=22774"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Cristiano Ronaldo</span></span></a> split them with a penalty of his own - ending a barren run in domestic combat that stretched back to November 15 - to ensure the Red Devils made it through.</p>
              <p>Derby boss Nigel Clough was not too downhearted either given his team's performance had been a vast improvement on their shoddy effort against QPR at the weekend.</p>
              <p>''The first goal knocked the stuffing out of us; 30 yards in the top corner you can't do much about those,'' he said. ''Defending the second and third goals was disappointing but it was a vast improvement on Saturday - even the first half.</p>
              <p>''It would be very easy to give up the ghost but we showed a bit of character, which after Saturday was what we were looking for.''</p>
              <p>After the game Ferguson vowed to stick with his youngsters for the Carling Cup final at the beginning of March.</p>
              <p><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=71653"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Darron Gibson</span></span></a>, John O'Shea and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=115271"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Danny Welbeck</span></span></a> have been among the unsung heroes who have been regular performers in the competition this term.</p>
              <p>And they can all bank on retaining their spots as United compete in their 14th domestic final of Ferguson's reign.</p>
              <p>''They will all play in the final,'' said Ferguson. ''They deserve to. It is always a great occasion at Wembley but the only way you can really enjoy it is by winning.''</p>

              <h1>Manchester United Suffer Injury Pile-Up</h1>
              <p>The injuries are piling up at Manchester United as Rio Ferdinand;
              Anderson; Nani; Rafael; Wayne Rooney; Wes Brown; Ji Sung Park; and
              Patrice Evra, are all sidelined for the Tottenham Hotspur FA Cup game,
              with many unlikely to make a comeback before the month's end.<br><br>Brazilian
              midfielder Anderson was taken off the field of play during Tuesday's
              Carling Cup clash with Derby County, with initial fears of a break. Any
              trepidation was allayed though when further tests revealed ligament
              damage that will only keep the 20-year old for up to three weeks.<br><br>"We
              sent Anderson for a scan and there’s no break," Sir Alex Ferguson confirmed during a scheduled pre-match press conference. <br><br>"But there was some ligament damage. We
              think he’ll be out for three weeks."<br><br>He continued: "Rio Ferdinand,
              Anderson, Nani, Rafael, Patrice Evra, Wayne Rooney, Wes Brown, Jonny
              Evans and Ji-sung Park [hamstring injury] are all out for the Tottenham game.<br><br>"Nani suffered a groin injury and he’ll be out for a week. Jonny Evans [ankle] will be out for three weeks."<br><br>Regarding whom he will bring in to cover the injuries, Sir Alex said:<br><br>"We still have Dimitar
              Berbatov, Carlos Tevez and Cristiano Ronaldo fit. But we will have to
              call on some young players," he added.<br><br>"The injuries are mainly
              to the defenders - I've got a whole back four out for Saturday. I could
              play Darren Fletcher at right back, with Gary Neville, Nemanja Vidic
              and John O’Shea, which would give me an experienced back four. But I’ve
              called in Richard  Eckersley and Fabio, who could be involved.<br><br>"Rio and Wes could be back for the Everton game, if the match is on Monday," Ferguson added.</p>

              <h1 class="storyTitle" style="margin-top: 0px; font-size: 2.8em; margin-bottom: 0px;">Fergie won't buy despite Man Utd injury crisis</h1>
              <p class="storyTitle" style="margin-top: 0px; font-size: 2.8em; margin-bottom: 0px;"> </p>
              <p class="storyTitle" style="margin-top: 0px; font-size: 2.8em; margin-bottom: 0px;"><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/DJ/20080301/evansheader_PaulEllis.jpg" border="0" alt="Jonny Evans" width="275" height="200"></p>
              <p class="storyTitle" style="margin-top: 0px; font-size: 2.8em; margin-bottom: 0px;"> </p>
              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson has confirmed that Manchester United duo </strong><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=88360&amp;cc=4716"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Anderson</strong></span></span></a><strong> and </strong><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=83176&amp;cc=4716"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Jonny Evans</strong></span></span></a><strong> will be out of action for three weeks after sustaining ankle injuries but ruled out any further activity in the transfer market.</strong></p>
              <p>Midfielder Anderson and defender Evans were both injured during the Carling Cup semi-final, second leg victory against Derby County on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Anderson was carried off on a stretcher after the final whistle while Evans limped through the latter stages of United's 4-2 win at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Their injuries further compounded the injury crisis for the United manager who will be without an entire back four on Saturday when his side tackle Tottenham Hotspur in the FA Cup at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>If <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=8862"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Gary Neville</span></span></a> and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=8853"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ryan Giggs</span></span></a> fail to recover from minor knocks, the Red Devils will be missing a dozen regular members of their first-team squad.</p>
              <p>Most are short-term injuries, with <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=8866"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Wes Brown</span></span></a> and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=7825"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Rio Ferdinand</span></span></a> among those tipped to be fit in time to face Everton on February 2.</p>
              <p>And Ferguson has already dismissed the idea of bringing in reinforcements, even on loan, to ease United through their troubles. ''No, I won't be doing that,'' confirmed the Scot.</p>
              <p>Instead, he will rely on youngsters such as Richard Eckersley and Fabio, twin brother of right-back Rafael, one of the men injured, plus central defender <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=108328"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">James Chester</span></span></a> to plug any gaps, with <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=8871"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Darren Fletcher</span></span></a> tipped to fill the right-back berth.</p>
              <p>''I do have options,'' said Ferguson. ''Hopefully Neville will be OK, then I can play Fletcher at right-back, so with <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=24529"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Nemanja Vidic</span></span></a> and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=7624"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">John O'Shea</span></span></a> we would have an experienced back four.</p>
              <p>''Alternatively, if we thought Eckersley or Fabio could be one of the full-backs Fletcher can play in midfield.''</p>

              <h1>Ferguson: Manchester United's Injury Crisis Is Lifting</h1>
              <p>Manchester United's injury crisis is lifting and key players are set
              to make their returns to the side very soon, according to Red Devils
              manager Alex Ferguson, which is probably not the best news for United's
              Premier League rivals.</p>
              <p>After Rio Ferdinand, Ji-Sun Park and Wes Brown made returns from
              injury against West Bromwich Albion at The Hawthorns on Tuesday, 
              Patrice Evra and Nani are also nearing comebacks, according to the
              United manager.</p>
              <p>"Things are looking up and players are starting to come back," said Ferguson in today's <em>Manchester Evening News</em>.</p>
              <p>"Patrice [Evra] may have a chance for Saturday against Everton. If
              the game had still been on Monday I'd say he'll definitely play. But
              he's still got a chance of making it.</p>
              <p>"Nani should also be fit for Saturday as well. The ones still
              unavailable are Jonny Evans, Rafael and Fabio [the Da Silva twins], and
              Anderson."</p>
              <p>Despite their lengthy injury list, the Red Devils still managed to
              destroy West Brom 5-0 on Tuesday night, although they were
              unquestionably helped in this by the red card that referee Rob Styles
              showed Albion defender Paul Robinson in the first-half of the game.</p>
              <p>That red card was today rescinded by the Football Association.</p>
              <p>Although things are improving on the injury front for United, Wayne
              Rooney is still not ready for a return to action, and won't be rushed,
              his manager confirmed.</p>
              <p>"Wayne has never had a hamstring injury before and there's no way we will bring him back early," Ferguson added.</p>
              <p>"He's doing terrific work in the gym and, in terms of his rehabilitation, is on the mend."</p>
