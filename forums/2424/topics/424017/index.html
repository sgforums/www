              <p><strong>While Tuesday's defeat at Chelsea is still a fresh wound for Michael Carrick and his colleagues, the midfielder says it will heal in time for Sunday's clash with Liverpool.</strong></p>
              <p>The Reds' title charge was hindered by a controversial defeat at Stamford Bridge, but Carrick insists the league leaders will be focused on returning to winning ways at Anfield</p>
              <p>"At the moment we feel pretty down, but we can move on quickly. We have to," the midfielder told <strong>MUTV</strong>. "We're used to doing that and we're normally good at that, so hopefully we can bounce back again.</p>
              <p>"We have to get rid of this game, forget about it and move on. It's obviously a huge game on Sunday and we'll be ready for that. We have to be. That's the nature of the beast. We move on and we take a lot of positives from tonight and look to put things right that didn't go well. We'll be ready."</p>
              <p>United took charge for the majority of the first half against the reigning Premier League champions and forged ahead through Wayne Rooney's low drive, but David Luiz levelled matters before Frank Lampard's late penalty as Chelsea hit back after the break.</p>
              <p>"It is disappointing, especially after the first half and the way we played," said Carrick. "We were in control. Second half we weren't as quick and decisive in our passing as we were in the first half, but we still felt quite comfortable and I still thought we might score again."</p>
              <p>"Some decisions didn't go our way and we're on the end of a defeat, which is very hard to take. That type of decision plays a huge part in the game. Big decisions you've got to get right, especially in a game of this importance, so we're disappointed. What can I say apart from that? It's hard to take."</p>
