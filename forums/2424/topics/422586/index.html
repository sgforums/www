              <p>Manchester United's owners, the Glazer family, are on the verge of selling the club to Qatar Holdings in a £1.6 billion deal, according to the <em>Daily Express</em>.</p>
              <p>The newspaper reports that United's American owners are "only haggling over details" as they close in on a deal worth more than double the £790 million they paid for the club in 2005.</p>
              <p>United are preparing to take on cash-rich neighbours Manchester City on Saturday, who are themselves owned by a wealthy Middle Eastern backer in Abu Dhabi's Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, but it is believed the Manchester derby could be the last at Old Trafford under the Glazer regime.</p>
              <p>The unpopular Americans have been at United for less than six years, and in that time have faced mass protests against their stewardship, with fans concerned that the debt-laden structure of their ownership puts the long-term future of the club at risk.</p>
              <p>The <em>Daily Express</em> claims that the Glazers had been holding out for an offer of closer to £2 billion, but have accepted the £1.6 billion bid, up from an initial £1.5 billion, with a "well-placed" source quoted as saying: "The deal is pretty much done and they are only haggling over details".</p>
              <p>Despite the claims that Qatar Holdings, the investment branch of the Qatari royal family led by the Gulf state's Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, is nearing a takeover deal, United have continued to deny that the Glazers have been entertaining any bids.</p>
              <p>And on Thursday, United's director of communications Phil Townsend maintained that no offer has been made. "There has been no approach to buy Manchester United and no approach would be welcome", he told the <em>Daily Express.</em></p>
              <p>Qatar Holdings already boasts a portfolio of assets in England that includes London's American Embassy and upmarket department store Harrods, which it purchased from Fulham owner Mohamed Al Fayed last year.</p>

              <p><strong>Manchester United's owners have made it clear to Qatar Holdings that a starting bid for the club would have to be worth at least £1.8billion, which is said to have put off the Qatari Royal Family. </strong></p>
              <p>Though the Glazers have officially denied that they want to sell the club, intermediaries between the two parties have indicated where the bidding should start.</p>
              <p>At present the Qataris deem that too high to justify but, with the nation hosting the 2022 World Cup and the Qatar Foundation charity, also linked to the Qatari Royal Family, now sponsoring Barcelona, another bid is expected.</p>
              <p>United have denied that there was a £1.6billion bid last week and sources close to the Glazers say they do not wish to sell now.</p>
              <p>However, Qatar Holdings, backed by the oil rich state, is one the few companies in the world that could feasibly meet a price that would interest the Glazers.</p>

              <p>The royal family of Qatar is preparing to test the resolve of Manchester United owners the Glazers with a fresh £1.5 billion bid for the club, according to reports.</p>
              <p>The Al Thani family had a £1 billion offer rejected earlier this month but, according to the <em>Daily Mail</em>, the Qataris are on the verge of making an improved bid.</p>
              <p>The newspaper goes on to claim that the renewed offer is partly motivated by rivalry with the Abu Dhabi royal family, who have invested millions of pounds to transform United's arch-rivals Manchester City.</p>
              <p>United strenuously deny that they have received any bid from Qatar Holdings, which identifies ways to invest the country's oil billions. But a source close to the Al Thani family indicated the offer could be made privately, or through another investment company.</p>
              <p>While Qatar's preference is a lone bid, they are also considering going into partnership with the Red Knights, a group of wealthy United fans who want to wrestle control of the club from the Glazers and have the backing of the fans.</p>

              <div id="article-body-blocks">
              <p>Only the al-Thani family in <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Qatar" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/qatar"><span style="color: #005689;">Qatar</span></a>, the Glazers and their closest advisers really know whether there is any truth to the persistent rumours of the sale of <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester United" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united"><span style="color: #005689;">Manchester United</span></a>. What is clear is that the ownership of the club will change when the Glazers believe they can sell for the maximum profit.</p>
              <p>In December last year, the United director Michael Edelson said what everyone in the financial world knows, that "it is inevitable that at some time they [the Glazers] will sell". Such is the nature of leveraged buyouts; the buyer makes money by putting in place a relatively small amount of equity (in the Glazers' case no more than £272m of the £831m total price paid) in the hope that the value of the asset will rise, leaving them a handsome profit. While the Glazer takeover has cost Manchester United over £300m in interest payments, losses on derivatives contracts and banking fees, the family have taken only £23m in "consultancy fees" and loans in the past five and half years. To make serious money from United, the family from Florida needs to sell at a profit. But that may be hard to achieve.</p>
              <p>At £1bn, the low end of the range of putative sale prices quoted in the media in recent weeks, the Glazers would make only a small profit on their original purchase. From that £1bn must first be deducted around £390m of net debt on the club's balance sheet. Then there is the mysterious case of the "payment in kind" or PIK loans, which the Glazers repaid in November at a cost of £249.1m. The repayment came either from the family's own resources or, more likely, from refinancing old loans with new.</p>
              <p>Either way, that money needs to be taken into account too and together with the net debt would reduce the value to the family from a £1bn bid to circa £360m. Because the pound has fallen 13% against the dollar since the takeover in 2005, that £360m is now worth $583m today, compared to the $504m it cost them to put in their original £272m of equity. A $79m (£49m) profit is not to be dismissed, but is not compelling. So to make "real" money, the Glazers need a price nearer the £1.5bn mentioned in recent reports.</p>
              <p>The problem with a figure of this magnitude is that it values the club far above the level that most financial analysis would suggest is rational. Football clubs are unique assets, making them hard to value, but we do have some benchmarks.</p>
              <p>Although the value of Arsenal shares has been puffed up by the battle for control between Alisher Usmanov and Stan Kroenke, the share price gives Arsenal a valuation of only around 11.5-times last year's "Ebitda" (cash profits excluding player sales).</p>
              <p>Using multiples of Ebitda is as good a way as any of comparing clubs' valuations as they indicate trading profitability without the x-factor of transfer income. By this measure John W Henry's Fenway Sports Group's £300m deal to buy Liverpool last year valued the club at 8.6-times Ebitda.</p>
              <p>Last year Manchester United made Ebitda of £100m, and therefore the Arsenal and Liverpool benchmarks would suggest a value for United of between £900m and £1.2bn.</p>
              <p>The Glazers would no doubt claim that United's unique money-making ability means the club warrants a higher valuation but not everything is rosy at Old Trafford. Player wages continue to increase at a frightening place; Wayne Rooney's new contract alone will reportedly cost an extra £4.5m per year, just under 5% of profits.</p>
              <p>The squad is reliant on ageing players who will need to be replaced and despite prices being frozen this season, the club failed to sell all its season tickets for the first time in decades.</p>
              <p>The growth in domestic TV money has slowed to a trickle (the latest three-year domestic deal is worth only 4.5% more than the previous one). And then there is the question of how to replace Sir Alex Ferguson when he finally decides to retire. How the Glazer family weigh up these challenges facing their most valuable asset will determine the timing of their eventual sale. In the meantime, a British media keen to talk up the club's value will hardly be unwelcome in Florida.</p>
