              <p><strong><span>Manchester United</span> <span>have decided they want</span> <span>David de Gea to replace</span> <span>Edwin van der Sar as their </span><span>first choice goalkeeper. </span></strong>
              </p><p><span>The move for a 20-year-old will be seen as a</span> <span>huge gamble, but United scouts and coaching</span> <span>staff are convinced the Atletico Madrid star</span> <span>can handle the responsibility.</span></p>
              <p><span>Sir Alex Ferguson has watched De Gea</span> <span>extensively over the past year and hopes a</span> <span>£</span><span>15million deal can be finalised quickly, and</span> <span>goalkeeping coach Eric Steele is laying the</span> <span>groundwork for his arrival by taking Spanish</span> <span>lessons.</span></p>
              <p><span>Van der Sar, 40, reiterated his</span> <span>intention to quit at the end of this season after</span> <span>starring in the FA Cup win over Arsenal on</span> <span>Saturday, but United hope the multi-lingual</span> <span>Dutchman will take up a coaching role and</span> <span>help smooth the transition for his successor</span> <span>and new No 2 Anders Lindegaard.</span></p>
              <p><span>United have studied various candidates to</span> <span>replace Van der Sar, with Schalke's Manuel</span> <span>Neuer, Julio Cesar of Inter Milan and Ajax</span> <span>keeper Maarten Stekelenburg all coming</span> <span>under consideration. However, De Gea has</span> <span>similar - if not better - qualities plus age on</span> <span>his side. At 6ft 3½in he is very much part of </span><span>Spain coach Vicente del Bosque's plans,</span> <span>despite the presence of Iker Casillas and</span> <span>Liverpool's Pepe Reina.</span><span><br></span></p>

              <p><strong><span>Ferguson is looking at making additions to</span> <span>his squad this summer and is determined to</span> <span>invest in youth to ensure the club benefit from</span> <span>his legacy long after he retires.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span>The United boss regrets not signing Van der</span> <span>Sar straight after Peter Schmeichel left Old</span> <span>Trafford in 1999. His old rival Arsene Wenger</span> <span>warned that United will be weaker</span> <span>without the Dutchman, regardless</span> <span>of who they sign, after seeing him</span> <span>produce a string of outstanding saves</span> <span>in Arsenal's 2-0 defeat.</span></p>
              <p><span>Wenger said: 'Van der Sar is one of</span> <span>the best in the world. If United have</span> <span>him in goal at 40 years of age, no matter</span> <span>who they buy next season they will</span> <span>feel the difference because not only</span> <span>does he have exceptional experience,</span> <span>he has exceptional talent.'</span></p>
              <p><span>Van der Sar could finish his career</span><span> </span><span>with two trips to Wembley in the FA</span><span> </span><span>Cup and another in the Champions</span><span> </span><span>League. United can advance in Europe</span><span> </span><span>tomorrow with victory at home to</span><span> </span><span>Marseille after a goalless first leg.</span></p>

              <p><strong><span>Despite a rather unconventional</span> <span>attempt by Wayne Rooney to persuade</span> <span>him to reconsider, the Dutchman</span> <span>is adamant this season will be his</span> <span>last. </span></strong></p>
              <p><span>'I was just speaking to him in the</span> <span>shower,' said Rooney, who headed</span> <span>United's second after Fabio da Silva</span> <span>had scored in the first half.</span></p>

              <p><strong><span>Although Van der Sar can look back</span> <span>on a glittering career, the FA Cup is a</span> <span>notable omission from his cv. </span></strong></p>
              <p><span>He said:</span> <span>'Of course an FA Cup winner's medal</span> <span>means a lot, despite what I have won.</span> <span>I've played one final and lost a semifinal.</span> <span>It has got away all the time, so</span> <span>hopefully this can be the one.</span></p>

              <p><span>Even after defeats by Chelsea and</span> <span>Liverpool, Ferguson refused to jeopardise</span> <span>his Champions League chances</span> <span>by risking Ryan Giggs or Paul Scholes</span> <span>from the start.

              <p><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester United" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united"><span style="color: #005689;">Manchester United</span></a> are looking at two goalkeepers in the Bundesliga as possible replacements for Edwin van der Sar.</p>
              <p>The club's goalkeeping coach, Eric Steele, was on a scouting missing in Germany on Sunday to watch <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Bayer Leverkusen" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/bayerleverkusen"><span style="color: #005689;">Bayer Leverkusen</span></a>'s match with <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Schalke" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/schalke"><span style="color: #005689;">Schalke</span></a> to see Manuel Neuer, who has long been touted as a prospective United goalkeeper.</p>
              <p>The 24-four-year-old Neuer caught the eye during last summer's World Cup when he was catapulted into Joachim Löw's starting line-up due to René Adler's rib injury and the death of Robert Enke.</p>
              <p>Neuer is on Sir Alex Ferguson's radar and it appears Adler could join a list that also includes the Holland No1. Maarten Stekelenburg.</p>
              <p>Last year Adler, 26, spoke of his ambition to join United and his consistent performances this season should keep him in United's mind.</p>
              <p>Ferguson has not commented about United's goalkeeping intentions but, with Tomasz Kuszczak likely to leave in the summer and Van der Sar calling time on his career, at least one reinforcement seems certain and Steele's scouting mission provides a further clue that United intend to aim high.</p>

              <p>And with United scouring Europe for a replacement for retiring <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/8884/Edwin-van-der-Sar"><span style="color: #225fb2;">Edwin van der Sar</span></a>, Adler's name has been among those linked with a move to Old Trafford, with the likes of <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/84774/Manuel-Neuer"><span style="color: #225fb2;">Manuel Neuer</span></a>, <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/108482/David-De-Gea"><span style="color: #225fb2;">David De Gea</span></a> and Maarten Stekelenburg also reportedly on their radar.</p>
              <p>United's goalkeeping coach Eric Steele was sent on a scouting mission to Germany last weekend, where he saw Adler keep a clean sheet in Leverkusen's 2-0 victory over Neuer's Schalke.</p>
              <p>Leverkusen remain hopeful of retaining Adler's services and discussions about a contract extension are well under way, with general manager Rudi Voller staying calm over speculation linking Adler with a move away from the club.</p>
              <p>"It's a usual circumstance in football to have players being watched by other clubs," Voller said. "We have the desire to sign a new deal with Rene Adler, this is a fact."</p>
              <p>But Leverkusen executive Wolfgang Holzhauser says he is concerned that negotiations would be difficult should United swoop for the Germany international.</p>
              <p>"There have been talks between the club and Rene Adler already, however we are still far off an agreement at this point in time," Holzhauser told <em>Bild</em>.</p>
              <p>"If a club the size of Manchester United comes up, I feel signing a new deal with Rene Adler would not become easier."</p>

              <p><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/2011/0302/manuelneuerschalke20110302_275x155.jpg" alt="" width="275" height="155"></p>
              <p>Schalke goalkeeper Manuel Neuer has ruled out a move abroad, but he has yet to fully commit his future to the Gelsenkirchen-based club amid rumoured interest from Bayern Munich.</p>
              <p>Neuer, the German No. 1, still has over a year left to run on his contract with the Royal Blues, who are keen to tie him down to a new deal to warn off the likes of Bayern.</p>
              <p>However, Neuer is not yet fully convinced about his future in Gelsenkirchen given Schalke's failure to compete in the Bundesliga this season. But he is adamant he wants to stay in Germany - even with reported interest from the likes of Manchester United.</p>
              <p>''I definitely want to win the Bundesliga once in my career,'' he said. ''I can go abroad twice a year, once for a summer holiday and once for a winter holiday, but whether I need to go abroad to play football - some players say you do, but I see things differently.''</p>
              <p>Neuer has the chance of winning some silverware this year with Schalke already in the final of the DFB-Pokal and into the last eight of the Champions League. Bayern, on the other hand, are almost certainly going to end the season empty-handed and the potential for success is one of the criteria Neuer will be considering when the time comes to make up his mind about his future.</p>
              <p>''The priorities are always success and how happy you are, and you have got to think of yourself,'' he added in <em>kicker</em> magazine. ''I have won the League Cup twice and I hope to add the DFB-Pokal in May.''</p>
              <p>When Bayern hosted Schalke at the Allianz Arena a few weeks ago, many of the home fans held up banners making it clear that Neuer would not be welcome at their club. That has not put the 24-year-old off, though.</p>
              <p>''I got a lot of correspondence afterwards, also from Bayern fans, who apologised for what happened,'' he said. ''It was a strange situation and it would have been better had such a thing not happened.</p>
              <p>''(The Bayern management) acted professionally and made it clear to me that it was just a minority protesting against me. It was uncomfortable for the Bayern management too.''</p>
