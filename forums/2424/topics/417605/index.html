              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson has dismissed the notion of United maintaining an unbeaten record throughout the Premier League season ahead of Monday night’s table topping clash with Arsenal.</strong></p>
              <p>With no defeats in 15 matches, the Reds league form has drawn comparisons with that of the 2003/04 Arsenal side, which achieved the rare feat of winning the title without losing a single game.</p>
              <p>However, the United manager believes the unpredictability of this year’s Premier League has put paid to any hopes of sustaining an unbeaten record.</p>
              <p>The boss told <em>Magic 1152</em>: “It won't happen again. The time Arsenal did it they had 12 draws. It was a great achievement but in this present league you cannot think for a minute you will go through undefeated.</p>
              <p>“It is an amazing league this year. We keep looking at the points we have dropped and I am sure Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham will all be saying the same. It is a self analysis that doesn't get you anywhere. This is a funny league; we have definitely seen a tightening up of it.</p>
              <p>“It is like the Championship where you can win two games and be back in a play-off position and then lose two and be back down to fourth or fifth bottom. The Premier League is looking that way. Sunderland were down near the drop positions, then they won a few games and got a bit of consistency. Now they are challenging for a European place. That seems to be the way this league is.”</p>
              <p>United’s clash with the Gunners precedes a trip to face Chelsea at Stamford Bridge next Sunday, in a fixture double-header that provides an opportunity to open up a substantial lead in the title race and gain the upper hand going into the New Year, though, Sir Alex is keen to stress titles are won in May, not December.</p>
              <p>“I don't think we need to gauge how good we are," he added. "Our position in the last few years has told us that we are one of the best teams in the country. Arsenal also come into that category. The last few years ourselves and Chelsea have been fighting it our for league titles. Before that it was ourselves and Arsenal for many years. <br> <br>“It is a massive game [against Arsenal] between two fantastic football teams with great history. You can't help but think it is going to be a fantastic game. I don't think whatever happens on Monday will tell you one team is better than the other at this moment in time though. What tells you something is the end of the season when you find out who has won the league. Hopefully it is us.”</p>
