And the time felt right, too, as his brand of management looks increasingly out-moded as the savvy Messrs Mourinho, Wenger and Benitez sparked a rage of all things scientific and foreign.<br><br>Failed forays into abject flops like Juan 'Useless' Veron, Liam Miller, Massimo Taibi, Kleberson, Eric Djemba-Djemba and Mark Bosnic lent weight to the argument that the Scotsman had lost it.<br><br>His 'my way or the highway' approach may seem dated in an era of player power. He has rowed and bombed out Paul Ince, Andrei Kanchelskis, Paul McGrath, Norman Whiteside, Gordon Strachan, Dwight Yorke and Jaap Stam in the past.<br><br>But in recent seasons, he has even ripped what was perceived as the heart and soul of the club by giving Roy Keane, David Beckham and Ruud van Nistelrooy the boot.<br><br>Nothing, not even the dissenting opinions of his key players, would sway him from his great quest to build that elusive third great team.<br><br>The first pieces were already in place as the remnants of Fergie's Fledglings, the elite trio of Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs and Gary Neville, who are deemed still worthy enough to parade their wares in the Theatre of Dreams.<br><br>Next came the solving of the longstanding goalkeeping problem, a puzzle that neither Taibi, Bosnic, Fabien Barthez could crack but eventually solved by Edwin van der Sar.<br><br>Though his current crop of youngsters are still a tad inferior to the famous Fledglings, there is also no doubt that Kieran Richardson, John O'Shea, Wes Brown and Darren Fletcher have been useful squad members all chipping in their share to the title assault.<br><br>Then, the spine took shape with the arrivals of Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic plus a sprinkling of shrewd buys such as Patrice Evra, Gabriel Heinze and Park Ji Sung gave Ferguson the belief that he does have a squad that can compete with Chelsea's mountain of cash.<br><br>Most of all, none made more impact than Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo, a pair of 22-year-olds who are propelling the club's relentless march with oodles of sublime football.<br><br>At last, after how his second great era fizzled out after the 2003 title win, Ferguson's has finally assembled a team that is physically and mentally strong enough to loosen Mourinho's grip on the championship.<br><br>Through the years, the DNA has remained unchanged. For the Steve Bruce-Gary Pallister defensive axis, there is the outstanding Ferdinand-Vidic wall of today.<br><br>For the midfield industry of Bryan Robson and Roy Keane, there is the quality work put in by Scholes.<br>DEMOLITION<br><br>And for all the Eric Cantona moments of pure genius, Ronaldo and Rooney are there to provide them circa 2007.<br><br>The Portugese's single-handed demolition of Bolton rendered him totally unplayable as he provided three brilliant assists before walking out to a standing ovation in the 70th minute.<br><br>Rooney deserved the plaudits as well, breaking at speed with his side-kick in the 17th minute before notching the goal of the day with a clever dink over the advancing body of Jussi Jaaskelainen.<br><br>That, is the gospel of football, according to Sir Alex.<br><br>How he has bounced back from adversity and returned to the top of the pile. And how Bolton will return home after being given a right education.<br><br>And here endeth the lesson.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>LATE in the match, with his side cruising to a 4-1 win, Sir Alex Ferguson showed how passionate he is about his job.<br><br>Despite the certainty of picking up all three points against Bolton, and with Manchester United playing champagne football, Ferguson never relented in cracking his whip to motivate his troops to greater effort in sealing the title.<br><br>Before Gary Speed's dubious 87th-minute penalty, the Red Devils enjoyed a plus-51 goal difference. But with that consolation spot-kick, it was reduced to plus-50.<br><br>You could see how much that one goal meant to the manager.<br><br>He was absolutely furious when he should have been sitting back and enjoying the glorious football.<br><br>Instead, he terrorised the fourth official and the young-looking assistant referee, who looked absolutely petrified of the Hairdryer!<br><br>That really sums up Man U's attitude now. After their last title win in 2003, the team has finally adopted Ferguson's hunger, thirst and addiction to winning.<br><br>And the boss will be proud, too, as his men have truly reflected his qualities over this season.<br>HARD WORK<br><br>Fergie believes in hard work, aggression and a will to win. Even though he has previously built two great sides - from the Double-winning team of 1994 to the Treble side of 1999 - he has never changed in his values.<br><br>Their plus-50 goal difference really says it all. That statistic is testament to their fantastic consistency over the year and, in my opinion, they truly deserve to be crowned champions.<br><br>Even when they were 4-0 up, Fergie's mentality was that he assumed Chelsea would win their remaining games.<br><br>He wanted to rule out any possibility of the race going down to the wire or, even worse, for it to be settled on goal difference.<br><br>That's why every game, every goal and every little matter is important to him. He is taking absolutely no chances at all. He has the lead and he has no intention of letting it go.<br><br>That is really something for Jose Mourinho to learn.<br><br>The Special One has spent the season at loggerheads with the Chelsea top management.<br><br>Frank Lampard and John Terry will not pledge their futures with the club. Worse still, the manager himself has been bad-mouthing Roman Abramovich in the media.<br><br>Ferguson showed that, with hunger and desire, you could build a winning team with far less resources than the Blues.<br><br>As a football team, Man U simply couldn't be stopped yesterday. They were a class above Bolton and Cristiano Ronaldo was from a different planet.<br><br>They are a team oozing confidence. And, what's more, they are playing with a smile on their faces. They are truly enjoying their football at the moment.<br><br>Not only are the star players like Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney in hot form, the squad players like John O'Shea, Wes Brown and Park Ji Sung have all taken turns to rise to the occasion.<br><br>Bolton were really chasing shadows. They lost their usual resilience in the face of some fantastic football.<br><br>Even if they miss Henrik Larsson and have mounting injury problems - the latest being Gary Neville - the Red Devils have carried on with their jobs. Unlike Chelsea, who are now in a state of civil war.<br><br>This has to be United's year. While Fergie has been poor in the transfer market in recent years, he got two signings absolutely spot-on with the purchases of Ronaldo and Nemanja Vidic.<br><br>Add to that the cunning loan deal he got with Larsson, he really taught Mourinho a thing or two about management.<br><br>The title is really there for Man U to lose.<br><br><a href="http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/sports/story/0,4136,125184,00.html?" rel="nofollow">http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/sports/story/0,4136,125184,00.html?</a></div>
