I don't think they will be getting anymore midfielders for the timebeing. SAF is more likely going to power up his backline and then of course, there's talk that SAF planned to get a more reliable striker too... I thought Rossi is coming back already so there's really little need for that...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

And I think in this formation, the use of Rooney is confusing to the opposition. Rooney is no out and out striker and cannot tahan solo. He runs... or rather rams at defences and in this formation deployment its basically 4-1-2-3-0.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Getting Reo-Coker is not necessary (IMO) at the moment.

            <div class='col-md body'>spurs has a good tradition of training youths - perhaps their location in London helps.  after carrick left, they have a good replacement in huddlestone - although he is a bit raw, but he has potential.<br><br>also, they have aaron lenon, jenas.  and as striker, they have berbatov and keane - who when he feels like, can weave magic.  also utility player - De foe who unfortunately, is under utilised.  by and large, spurs are strong team and they are willing to shell out for potential players and fast - they get Berbatov, keane, de foe, bale.<br><br>When it comes to negotiations - i suppose the pull of playing &amp; staying in London does play a part.  maybe thats what help to pull Bale, together with promise of first team start.</div>

Not X as he score tons of goals for them, but dun forget spurs have not been winning anything for the past few season. Yet they can spend 10+M juz on 1 player. mido Â£4.6m , Didier Zokora Â£8.6 million,  Steed Malbranque Â£2million  , rocha  about Â£3.3 million , Chimbonda Â£4.5 million and Benoit Assou-Ekotto (believed to be in the region of Â£3.5 million).   This r wad they spend last season... still not rich?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
