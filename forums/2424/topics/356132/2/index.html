              <p>i think it's something all footballer must practice starting from now... just like how tiger wood can hit the ball hard hard far far...... if CR can hit this kind of ball everyday... then it will be very hard to defend already...same like those long long throw in...</p>

              <p><br>Well, hope you can be... This was not a lob, to beat a keeper from such a distance with a direct shot... it needed to be something special...</p>
              <p>This was a shot way out, even much further than that Portsmouth goal... And since you have already mentioned, that was a free-kick. And as good as it was, (rightly so as it was voted goal of the epl season) he was able to take his time and set himself ready. The distant was also not that far... </p>
              <p>Here was a shot in open play, split second moment, defenders closing down on him and the angle... Normally very long range shots are easily stop by goalkeepers as they will have lots of time to react by the time it reach them... But with this one, the keeper couldn't even reach it despite the ball travelling the distance... Cos of the power it was hit with and the angle made it impossible for the keeper... Right at the top corner...</p>

                </p><p>Do you know how hard it is to strike so accurately during open play?
                  
                  </p><p> First of all you need vision. You have to keep one eye on the ball and one eye on the set up. Usually players can barely see 10- 20 m ahead of him. To be able to spot that he had a shooting option was incredible.
                  
                  </p><p> Next you need skill. 
                  
                  </p><p> Anyone can shoot a screamer when the ball is stationary. It is easier to give it power and accuracy. It is not easy to shoot a screamer when you are dribbling the ball. To shoot the ball while you are running and while the ball is rolling. Strikers in the penalty box will usually have to slow down prior to shooting so they can set their body up for a shot.
                  
                   </p><p>Notice the angle in which he shot the ball. It is not in the same line as his running path. He was running towards the right corner flag but he shot the ball at nearly 30 degrees off that path. To do that he had to be strong as he will not be able to capitalize on his momentum. Players like scholes and carrick shoot their long range by making use of their running momentum</p>
