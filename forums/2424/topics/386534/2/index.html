              <p>Personally I am not disappointed and quite ok with it actually... Cos if they can't win it this year, I think its better to go out now rather than 2, 3 rounds later like the last few years... Go until semi-final and final for what when in the end still lose.</p>
              <p>Going out early to me I feel could be a blessing in disguise. It may turn out to be a good thing cos this years premier league title is going to be very difficult to win... And along the way still got CL matches... So now at least when Chelsea and Arsenal have to play their next round, the United players can get a good rest for the Premier League title challenge... </p>
              <p>Lets hope Arsenal and Chelsea go all the way to the final... lol...</p>

              <p>"We have a semi-final on Wednesday night and a lot of these players today 
              won't be playing,'' Ferguson said. "You have to view that performance in its 
              right light.</p>
              <p>"I don't think any of them can say they had a good day. It took us ten 
              minutes to find him but only Valencia can say he had a good performance. You 
              have to get over these kind of results quickly. We have to make sure we are

              <p>bro... it is worrying la.</p>
              <p>Leeds is smart, they know MU's fullbacks will bomb forward, and they will try to place the ball long for their forwards to go again brown/Evans. In short, the MU defence is short of pace and has been exposed many times. if U look carefully, there were a few long range shots by Leeds, but Anderson or Gibson were nowhere to be found. They were overrun, covering too much space.</p>
              <p>The key, the two wings, Welbeck and Obertan are not covering back. Really disappointed by the two wings, they are stuck in between a winger/forward role and did not really contribute.</p>
              <p>Gone are the days when MU can try to mix some 2nd teamers with first teamers and hope they can pull off a victory. The teams coming to OT are well prepared and not going to be easy.</p>

              <p><br>You already said it yourself... They lack pace in last night's match... But last night's players isn't the regulars... Neville will make way for Rafael, Fabio for Evra, Brown for Vidic... and Evans just came back from a long injury... Last night he was named in the line-up was probably also a surprise cos he was only expected to come back next week. But he will get better within weeks... Nothing to worry here...</p>
              <p>In last night's midfield, there was too many inexperienced players as well... Welbeck, Obertan, Gibson... These players you won't normally see them playing together as a midfield unit... One or two will be used at time, but not all together and starting a match... Things like this happens, If you want to groom youngsters, its a phase you have to take... And the cup matches are the best place to give them a chance... What do you mean Gone are the days? Didn't they do the same last year and won the Carling cup? Got to the semi finals of the FA cup? No point in saying youngsters get their chances and the club youth policy is good when you can't accept a bad result...</p>
              <p>People praise Arsenal of having good youngsters... But they have gone 5 yrs without the title... But in the process they have develop players like... <span style="color: #000000;">Robin Van Persie,</span><span style="color: #000000;"> Rosicky, Eboue, </span><span style="color: #000000;">Fabregas, </span><span style="color: #000000;">Denilson, </span><span style="color: #000000;">Samir Nasri, </span><span style="color: #000000;">Clichy, </span><span style="color: #000000;">Abou Diaby, </span><span style="color: #000000;">Walcott, Alexandre Song... Some have become not so young anymore...</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">But there are even more younger ones coming out like... Kieran Gibbs, </span><span style="color: #000000;">Aaron Ramsey and </span><span style="color: #000000;">Jack Wilshere... They are not going to win each time they play... cos they are only developing... The fans have to realise this and not expect too much from these youngsters too early... Fabregas didn't became what he is today if during these last 5 yrs Arsenal didn't win and the fans ask for him to be drop... They kept faith with him and today he is a world class player...</span></p>

              <p>Kuzczcak is still very kan jiong when it comes to high balls, back pass and one-on-ones. I dont think it can ever be taught to him so Fergie, just sign a new keeper since VDS is retiring soon enough and Foster is rubbish.</p>
              <p>Neville is hopeless, i dont get why Fergie still stick to this lousy player. Lacks pace and height, he was trampled all over by Beckford.</p>
              <p>Brown and Evans are 2 kan jiong spiders as well, the moment a Leeds player rushes them, they make mistake. Especially Brown whom i feel is lucky to have stayed on the pitch. Evans needs to bulk up more. He's so easy to push around with and with the current crop of strikers all well-built and pacey, Evans is on the losing side.</p>
              <p>Fabio is the lousier of the Da Silva Brothers. Rafael surges forward but still manages to get back in time to defend but Fabio left his postion wide open in many occasion. He needs more training and match experience to solve this problem.</p>
              <p>Valencia is the only spark of the match for United. He never gives up and keeps running the whole match, owning the right flank unlike Welback the headless chicken.</p>
              <p>Anderson looks like he's dominating in the midfield areas but always lack the cutting pass, maybe Scholes can teach him a thing or two?</p>
              <p>Gibson is calm and compose when he is on the ball but wasted alot of good chances by slicing his shots wide. He needs to work on his passing technique though as i notice he's always passing to his teammates leg instead of crafting a killer through pass.</p>
              <p>Giggs is off form and so is Berbatov. Obertan cant get used to playing in England but he needs more time to adjust. What about Tosic? I think Fergie should play him.</p>
              <p>Playing Owen is like a gamble where the odds of him scoring is higher than the odds of him not scoring.</p>
              <p>Rooney is trying to hog the limelight too much such that at times he's too confident about his ability which more than often lets him down. I've lost count of the number of chances he has to kill the game but he either send a tame shot, a wild volley or simply lose possession of the ball so easily when he's not concentrating.</p>
              <p>Fergie needs a striker now to lift United of this mess.</p>
