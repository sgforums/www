              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson has confirmed Rafael da Silva should be fit to face Chelsea on Tuesday.</strong></p>
              <p>The Manchester United defender was stretchered off with a knee injury in the Reds’ Champions League first-leg victory at Stamford Bridge last Wednesday, immediately casting doubt on his involvement in the return leg at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>The young Brazilian did manage to limp unassisted onto the United team bus that evening, but the Reds still sent the 20-year-old for a precautionary scan the following day.</p>
              <p>At his press conference on Friday morning, Sir Alex revealed there had been “no bruising or ligament damage to his knee” and was confident the right-back would be fit to line up against Chelsea on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>There was a similar diagnosis after <a href="http://www.manutd.com/en/Fixtures-And-Results/Match-Reports/2011/Apr/Manchester-United-v-Fulham-match-report.aspx"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">the Reds’ 2-0 win against Fulham</span></span></a> on Saturday.</p>
              <p>“Rafael should be okay for Tuesday,” he revealed, while also acknowledging the return of a number of other players.</p>
              <p>“Wes Brown’s back, Antonio Valencia’s back… John O’Shea’s been out with a hamstring injury and he’s come through [the Fulham game] well. Players are coming back and that gives us a heck of a boost.”</p>
              <p>The boss reserved special mention for winger Antonio Valencia, who again shone in Saturday’s 2-0 win.</p>
              <p>“The man’s a marvellous footballer,” Sir Alex said. “I think we chose the right time to take him off today, to keep him fresh for Chelsea. He’ll have an important role on Tuesday.”</p>

              <p>The <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester United" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united"><span style="color: #005689;">Manchester United</span></a> manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, has a major injury doubt over the Brazilian full-back Rafael ahead of their <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Champions League" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/championsleague"><span style="color: #005689;">Champions League</span></a> quarter-final second leg against Chelsea at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>The 20-year-old suffered a knee injury in last week's 1-0 first-leg win at Stamford Bridge. He was carried off on a stretcher but scans have shown there was no ligament damage and, after Rafael missed Saturday's Premier League win over Fulham, Ferguson does expect him to be fit for Tuesday's decider.</p>
              <p>"Rafael did a bit of jogging this morning," Ferguson said. "Hopefully he will be able to be ready but I am not sure about it. There is a little doubt and it is not something I want to be risking in a major game. He really has to do something special tomorrow morning to change my mind about it."</p>
              <p>If Rafael is not fit, it appears his place will go to John O'Shea. Meanwhile, Ferguson must decide whether to recall Nani. The Portugal winger only made the bench last week but two assists against Fulham have put him in contention, with Javier Hernández most likely to make way.</p>
              <p><strong>Team (from):</strong> Van der Sar, Kuszczak, Rafael, O'Shea, Brown, Ferdinand, Smalling, Evans, Vidic, Evra, Fábio, Valencia, Gibson, Anderson, Scholes, Park, Carrick, Giggs, Nani, Rooney, Berbatov, Hernández, Owen.</p>

              <p class="intro entry-summary"><span style="color: #000000;">Chelsea</span> arrive at Old Trafford for their Champions League quarter-final second leg as underdogs as they look to overturn a one-goal deficit - but there are plenty of reasons why they can do it.</p>
              <p class="intro entry-summary"> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Away goals</strong></p>
              <p>United fans may have left Stamford Bridge last Wednesday celebrating the grabbing of a 'precious' away goal, but they would have been better off winning 2-1 in the first leg than 1-0.</p>
              <p>That result means that it is not possible for United to prevail on away goals in this tie. If Chelsea manage to score more than once, United will have to match them over the 90 minutes to win the tie.</p>
              <p>United have not won back-to-back games against Chelsea since the 2002-03 season, when <span style="color: #000000;">Diego Forlan</span> grabbed the winner in League Cup and Premier League clashes at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>One eye on Wembley</strong></p>
              <p>While United's players will all have Saturday's FA Cup semi-final against local rivals <span style="color: #000000;">Manchester City</span> on their minds, Chelsea have a trip to West Brom this weekend, a comparatively cosier fixture.</p>
              <p>For evidence of just how the derby at Wembley could affect United, look no further than the 3-0 drubbing City had handed to them last night at Anfield.</p>
              <p>That result also means that Chelsea remained third in the table, easing the domestic pressure on their players greatly.</p>
              <p><strong></strong> </p>
              <p><strong>A 'fair' referee?</strong></p>
              <p>Ferguson is currently in the middle of a five-match touchline ban for suggesting referee Martin Atkinson, the official in charge when Chelsea beat United 2-1 last month, was not ‘a fair referee’.</p>
              <p>If he believes such things as fair and unfair officials exist at the top level of the game, then he may not find Olegario Manuel Bartolo Benquerenca's record good reading.</p>
              <p>The Portuguese official has taken charge of two Champions League matches at Old Trafford, against CSKA Moscow and Rangers, and United have won neither. Conversely, Benquerenca has taken charge of two European games involving Chelsea, blowing the final whistle on two wins for the Blues.</p>
              <p>And, just to add an extra layer of faux-significance, the same referee took charge of <span style="color: #000000;">England</span><span style="color: #000000;">'s win over Wales last month, in which he awarded a penalty scored by </span><span style="color: #000000;">Frank Lampard</span><span style="color: #000000;">.  </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">AND he comes from </span><span style="color: #000000;">Portugal</span> - just like Jose Mourinho. Spooky, eh?</p>

              <p>as i watched last week's match, i also had an ominous feel about it. 1-0. That means if chelsea scores 1 at OT, then it's extra time. If chelsea draw on aggregate 2-2, they go thru. United can only afford limited options of 0-0 draw or win outright.</p>
              <p>I just think this all means that tonight will be a classic european night. On form utd vs a determined chelsea.</p>

              <p>Evra and Vidic were ball watching when Drogba strikes and Giggs, he is 38 years old and makes Bebe and Obertan look like some kids playing football under void deck. His 2 assists are vital in this win and hopefully it's a sign that United have hit top form at the right time.</p>

              <p>Didn't look like the match was a classic. Yes utd played some smooth passing football but there were times when chelsea had clear chances at goal but let down by poor finishing.

              <p> </p>
              <p><span><strong>Manchester United took another big step towards the Treble on Tuesday night as they reached the Champions League semi-finals for the fourth time in five years. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Javier Hernandez and Park Ji-sung gave United a 3-1 aggregate win after substitute Didier Drogba equalised on the night for 10-man Chelsea, who had Ramires sent off in the second half. </span></p>
              <p><span>Defeat means Carlo Ancelotti's side are likely to finish the season empty-handed and leaves the Italian with his job on the line. </span></p>
              <p><span>Ancelotti later admitted he may have blundered by starting with £50million striker Fernando Torres, who was substituted at half-time after failing to score for the 11th game. </span></p>
              <p><span>Ferguson, who was taking charge of his 100th European game at Old Trafford, paid tribute to Ryan Giggs who set up both of United’s goals, saying: ‘He’s incredible — a unique person and player. His contribution is big because of the goal he set up in the first game, and the part he played in the goals tonight. To play at 37 requires tremendous sacrifice.’</span></p>
              <p><span>Drogba, a half-time replacement for Torres, cancelled out Hernandez’s goal after 76 minutes but United were ahead again through Park 21 seconds later.</span></p>
              <p><span>

              <p><span><strong>Ferguson added: ‘That was the break we got in the game, to be honest. It was a stupid goal for us to lose and we had to respond quickly. Park’s record in big games is fantastic.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>‘We played very well against a very good team. Even with 10 men they had a go and credit to them, but I thought we were the better team on the night.’</span></p>
              <p><span>Questioned about winning the Treble as United prepare for Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final with Manchester City, Ferguson said: ‘I keep being asked about it but you need luck to do that. Saturday is a massive game.</span></p>
              <p><span>‘Momentum is a great thing and everybody is desperate to play in every game. They’re desperate to play against City on Saturday.’</span></p>

              <p><span>Ancelotti insisted he does not fear for his future following Chelsea’s latest European failure. He said: ‘I’m not concerned. I have to work. I have to try to do my best. It’s not my decision whether I stay or not here. I haven’t spoken with him (Roman Abramovich).’</span></p>
              <p><span>Asked if it was a mistake to start with Torres rather than Drogba, he added: ‘Maybe. Could be. But I thought a long time to take this decision. I preferred to start with Fernando for this kind of game, with these kind of tactics. Didier played very well in the second half.’</span></p>

If things weren't hard enough already for Chelsea, now they're two goals down on aggregate and also a man down for the rest of the match.

              Just a minute later, the perfect reposte by United when Park slots home after another delightful United move, to give the home side a two-goal cushion again. Giggs was the architect yet again with another inch-perfect pass. His ball from the right found Park completely unmarked on the left-hand side of the box, and the South Korean wasted no time in chesting the ball down before passing the ball past Cech and into the bottom right hand corner

              <p>I think Evra has been ball watching, committing rash acts like ball handling and mis-timing tackles. I wonder how long Fergie can stand his behaviour which kind of points to Old Trafford exit.</p>
              <p>Players like Lampard, Malouda and Benayoun should stop counting the chickens before they hatch. The more they boast, the more cui Chelsea plays.</p>
