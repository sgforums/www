              <h1>Manchester United To Offer Scotland Skipper Darren Fletcher Massive Pay Rise - Report</h1>
              <h2>Manchester United are set to offer Darren Fletcher a new pay deal that will see him raised into the same wage bracket as midfield colleagues Paul Scholes and Michael Carrick, according to a report from the News of the World.</h2>
              <p> </p>
              </div>
              
              <h3>DARREN FLETCHER will hold talks with Manchester United this summer over a new deal worth £80,000 a week.</h3>
              <p> United executives have made it clear that improvements to Fletcher's existing wages are a top priority. </p>
              <p>Fletcher is currently paid £3million a year basic at United, but manager Sir Alex Ferguson now recognises him as one of the most important players at the club. </p>
              <p>The United midfielder, outstanding in last week's victory over Liverpool, has two years left on his existing deal. But he will be catapulted into a new pay scheme at the end of the season. </p>
              <p>Fellow midfielder Michael Carrick is paid £80,000 a week, with the added incentive of a lucrative image rights contract on the side. </p>
              <p>Paul Scholes commands a similar salary. Now that Fletcher is considered their equal he will be paid a similar sum. </p>
              <p>With the obvious exception of Wayne Rooney, Scotland captain Fletcher has been United's most consistent player this season. </p>
              <p>Despite missing out on last season's Champions League final through suspension, he has emerged as a stronger player this year. </p>
              <p>He scored the best goal of his career with a volley from outside the area in a 3-0 victory against Everton in November. </p>
              <p>But it is his hard-working performances in the centre of midfield that have marked him out this season and are the reason United will tie him down to an improved deal. </p>
              <p>United expect negotiations with Fletcher to run smoothly.</p>

              <p>well, Scholes/Giggs are N those who run themselves to the ground type so they can last. Fletcher is doing a fanastic job but a lot of wear/tear may curtail his career beyond the 30+. IMHO.</p>

Why Arsenal had Vieira, then Flamini and now Song? Why Chelsea bought Makelele, Essien and push Obi Mikel? Why Mascherano and Lucas is playing for Liverpool? And last but not least, the roles of Carrick and Fletcher for United? These are just examples from EPL, here're some more:</p>
