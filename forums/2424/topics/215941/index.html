            <div class='col-md body'>Tomasz Kuszczak, UnitedÂ’s second-choice goalkeeper, tells United Review he has the patience to bide his time and learn from Edwin van der Sar.<br><br>And, as the imposing Pole proved against Arsenal, whenever Sir Alex should require his services, he will be ready, willing and able to rise to the challengeÂ…<br><br><strong>Have you enjoyed being involved in the Champions League squad and travelling with the team?</strong><br>ItÂ’s been brilliant. There is a great atmosphere in the squad. I played in the UEFA Cup when I was with Hertha Berlin in Germany, but itÂ’s nothing like the quality of the Champions League. This is a huge step up and IÂ’m learning all the time. I sit on the bench, watch and take everything in. In future, if I get the chance to play, it is good experience having been so close to the action.<br><br><strong>Are you hoping to qualify early so you get more opportunities?</strong><br>ItÂ’s the Champions League and, of course, IÂ’d love to be involved, but for me the team comes first. We all fight together, and if I donÂ’t play and we win IÂ’m still happy. For a young keeper being patient is an important quality. My chance will come, and if the manager says to me Â‘Tomasz, youÂ’re playingÂ’, I will be delighted and ready to perform as well as I can. The manager knows that. I will wait for my call and be patient.<br><br><strong>As the second goalkeeper, you need to be on permanent standbyÂ… how do you prepare for games?</strong><br>ItÂ’s hard, but I try to prepare as if I was playing in every game. I am always ready and focused. Even when the players were away on international duty I trained hard to make sure I am sharp. It happened against Arsenal. One minute you are second goalkeeper, the next you are first. You always have to be ready.<br><br><strong>What did you make of your performance?</strong><br>Your debut is always specialÂ… a debut for United is something else. I feel I played well and I donÂ’t think I let anyone down. I was pleased, but not delighted. We lost the gameÂ… that means IÂ’m not completely happy.<br><br><strong>How has Edwin van der Sar helped you?</strong><br>I try to take everything on board that I see in training and in the matches. We talk, we are friends Â– I think we are, youÂ’ll have to ask Edwin Â– but the most important thing is to watch. Sometimes goalkeepers have little to do, but you may need to be ready for one vital moment. EdwinÂ’s concentration is fantastic. HeÂ’s one of the best goalkeepers in the world. But that doesnÂ’t mean I am just in awe of him, I try to push Edwin and challenge for his place in the team, thatÂ’s important. I want to show I am a good goalkeeper, but I have great respect for Edwin.<br><br><strong>You said recently that Peter Schmeichel was one of your idols. Obviously he is a United legend, what made him so special?</strong><br>He could change games. Only great goalkeepers do that. I stated from the first day I arrived here that it has always been an ambition and a dream to play for Manchester United. Part of the reason was watching Peter Schmeichel. He made unbelievable saves, shots no other goalkeeper could get near. Some of his saves left people saying Â‘how did he do that?Â’. Every had respect for him, people still mention his name now. He was never scared to take a risk and saved his team many times. That is a great goalkeeper.<br><br></div>
