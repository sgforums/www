"He's always looked after all of our keepers. We're all really going to miss him and we're very sad to see him go. It's very sad because he's been a coach here for ten years.<br><br>"But obviously being a goalkeeping coach you have to be able to kick the ball and play a part in the routines the keepers go through and unfortunately that's going to be a problem for him.<br><br>"We're looking at ways in which we can help him in other ways. He'll be with us until the end of his contract in June and we'll help him with his rehabilitation. Hopefully he'll find some other interests."<br><br>Coton himself is hugely disappointed to be leaving, but says he has fond memories which will stay with him forever.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s unfortunate we reached this decision, but after speaking to the surgeon and the medical staff at Manchester United I have been advised to retire from coaching," he explained. "After two operations in four months which have been successful in terms of quality of life away from coaching, unfortunately, I will be unable to carry on coaching.<br><br>"I have had ten fantastic years and the experience and memories are what people dream about and I would like to thank everyone at Manchester United, especially the first team staff that I have been closely associated with over the last ten years. I can't go without saying what a pleasure it has been working for the best manager in the world, Sir Alex Ferguson, and I wish he and the team continued success.Â”<br><br>Sir Alex insists the Reds will wait until the summer before they make a new appointment and says it is unlikely to be current No.1 stopper Edwin van der Sar.<br><br>"I've spoken to both Tony and Edwin about who would be a good successor and both of them have made good points. It's not an easy appointment to make, but hopefully we'll get the right man," said the United boss.<br><br>"I don't think it will be Edwin. He wants to continue as a player and doesn't know what he wants to do after he's finished playing. That's fine and the right way to think about it because if he starts thinking about all that at the moment it could affect his performances and mental approach to it all.<br><br>"Come the summer we need to look at what we're going to do. Edwin has got one more year after that and, of course, his profile would be fantastic [for the job]. But that's something we'll look at in the summer."</div>
