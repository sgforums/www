              <p>Wayne Rooney put his disciplinary problems behind him to give <strong>Manchester United</strong> <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=315215&amp;cc=5739">a 1-0 victory</a> over <strong>Chelsea</strong> at Stamford Bridge.</p>

              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Rooney
               ensured his side will be in pole position when the Blues visit Old 
              Trafford next week for the second leg of their Champions League 
              quarter-final.</p>
              <p>The striker will discover on Thursday whether his 
              challenge to the two-match ban for swearing into a television camera was
               successful, but he ensured he would be in the headlines on Thursday 
              morning for all the right reasons.</p>
              <p>After a cagey start, Rooney 
              gifted United a valuable away goal after 24 minutes; Michael Carrick's 
              superb long-range pass finding Ryan Giggs on the left and the winger 
              pulled the ball back for Rooney to slot the ball home from six yards.</p>
              <p>Chelsea
               manager Carlo Ancelotti had kept faith with out-of-form striker 
              Fernando Torres, who partnered Didier Drogba up front, but the 
              Spaniard's wait for his first goal in a Chelsea shirt continued as 
              Rooney took the plaudits.</p>
              <p>Chelsea's best effort came shortly 
              before half-time when Torres failed to steer Drogba's cross goalwards, 
              but the ball bounced off the far post and Frank Lampard's weak shot on 
              the rebound was cleared off the line by Patrice Evra.</p>
              <p>The home 
              side were denied a penalty deep into added time, when Evra failed to get
               the ball as he brought down Ramires - and just moments later Torres was
               booked after tumbling under a challenge from Antonio Valencia as the 
              Blues desperately searched for an equaliser.</p>
              <p>In the night's other match, favourites <strong>Barcelona</strong> put one foot in the semi-finals after beating <strong>Shakhtar Donetsk</strong><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=315214&amp;cc=5739"> 5-1 at the Nou Camp</a>.</p>
              <p>Barcelona
               all but secured their spot in the Champions League semi-finals and a 
              probable showdown with arch rivals Real Madrid after building a huge 5-1
               first-leg lead over Shakhtar Donetsk.</p>
              <p>Following on from Madrid's
               4-0 thumping of Tottenham, Barca appear to have done all the hard work 
              in their home quarter-final tie after another memorable European night 
              at the Nou Camp.</p>
              <p>Andres Iniesta, Dani Alves, Gerard Pique, Seydou
               Keita and Xavi were on the mark for the Catalan giants, while 
              Shakhtar's sole reply came from Yaroslav Rakitskiy when they were 
              already 3-0 down.</p>

              <p>There were positives and negatives from the game. It was good seeing man u's attacking play and the defence looks much steadier away from home with rio and vidic. I havent seen that kind of splitting pass from carrick since god knows when lol.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, when under pressure, united were giving the ball away easily, esp the last 20 mins. There was a time when all the utd players were passing and stroking the ball around one touch football, the ball returned to VDS, he kicked it far up and it fell back to a chelsea player. What a waste! And after that VDS just kept kicking balls high up and it would end up with a chelsea player. Can't afford to do that if they meet barca in the final.</p>
              <p>The way i look at the semi finals, it'd be barca - real and schalke - chelsea/man u.</p>
              <p>It's a kind of karma if we look at ramires' denied penalty. They were supposed to have david luiz sent off the last time but he stayed on and held the chelsea defence solid.</p>

              <p>It was obviosuly part of Fergie's ploy to play negative..especially after they got the away goal knowing that chelsea will attack united at all costs.<br>United did nothing in the 2nd half other than defend and counter attack at times but with nothing spectacular..No shots or what sort.</p>
              <p>And something that i observe which was quite disturbing was the fact that the defence and central midfielders,once they had the ball they just hook up to hernandez hoping the boy,with his jump could conjure something out of nothing..do a knock down for rooney ,get a shot or what..The team had no intention to pass around ,keep possession and attack chelsea the normal way.We were playing negative..Probably ferguson knew that the central midfield would definitely lose out to chelsea without Scholes,anderson and fletcher..having giggs carrick ,in the tactical sense...they couldn't influence the midfield like what their counter-parts Lampard and Essien could...</p>
              <p>Well well...this season is so wierd..the team isn't playing well but keeps grinding out results....I just hope we will get some reinforcements in the central midfield area after the season end and next season we will see a better team</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>This morning was the first time I have ever seen drogba in a waning light. He comes off at the 65th min looking dejected, shaking his head with a wry smile and replaced by anelka. It used to be drogba and lampard saving the day when the going got tough......Both of them were always dangerous no matter how down chelsea was.</p></div>

              <p>agree with you, this is not the best MU may have played in a season collectively for a long time. Look @ the away results.. but the funny thing is the teams chasing MUFC are worst..</p>
