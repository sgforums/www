              <p><strong>Has anyone else noticed how United’s central midfielders have all started to play a bit like Paul Scholes?</strong></p>
              <p>Darron Gibson, for one, is clearly taking notes from the little master on the training ground: playing with his head up, dropping to receive the ball on the half-turn, the measured passes, the sweetly timed shots… they’re all there.</p>
              <p>It should be said, though, that Gibson has ample natural gifts of his own and, as much as anyone, he profited from a run in the Carling Cup last season, making five starts (including the final) and securing a piece of silverware in his debut term in the first team.</p>
              <p>Add goals against Southampton and Derby in the FA Cup, and it’s no wonder he was given league cameos against Stoke and Fulham as he raced up the midfield learning curve.</p>
              <p>Gibbo also made two Champions League appearances and his thumping winner on the final day at Hull was the highlight of his season.</p>
              <p>The young Irishman has been around the first-team squad for a while but this was his breakthrough season. Expect him to feature on Sir Alex's teamsheet increasingly over the next couple of years...</p>

              <p><strong>Republic of Ireland international</strong> <strong>Darron Gibson is an athletic midfielder who packs a powerful shot.<br><br></strong>'Gibbo' has been in and around the first team for several seasons but it was in the 2008/09 campaign that he made a real breakthrough.<br><br>He scored his first goal for the seniors in the FA Cup win at Southampton in January 2009 and also played every game of the Reds' triumphant Carling Cup campaign, in which his composure and passing ability drew comparisons with Michael Carrick.<br><br>Darron made his first-team debut the day after his 18th</p>

              <p>birthday, as a second-half substitute in the Carling Cup victory over Barnet in October 2005. <br><br>Gibson was a regular fixture in United's reserves that season (2005/06), making 19 appearances and scoring two goals in a campaign that yielded three trophies.<br><br>Darron's development was furthered in 2006/07 by a loan spell at Royal Antwerp. Although initially hampered by a knee injury, the midfielder made a big impact in Belgium, helping Antwerp almost to gain promotion.<br><br>Promotion to the top flight was also the target for Gibson's next loan period, this time in England with Wolves. The Irish midfielder joined Mick McCarthy's team in October 2007 and stayed for six months, making 24 appearances and scoring one goal, although Wolves just missed out on the play-offs.<br><br>Derry-born Gibson represented Northern Ireland at youth level but subsequently opted to play for the Republic of Ireland, making his international debut in August 2007, and is now a regular for his country.</p>

              <p>he can be a team player like O Shea. hope he can improve over the next few seasons, like fletcher.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>remmebered when fletcher first started playing for man utd in 2003-2004 season, a lot of people condemned him as cmi.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fletcher has improved a lot over the last 2 seasons. I am sure he will be included in the lineup if owen hargreaves remains injury prone.</p>
