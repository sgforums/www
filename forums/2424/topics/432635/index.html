The Premier League and the Champions League took priority, which they should do, before we announced anything.<br><br>"It was great news when the manager said he wanted to keep me. It was a big confidence boost because there are so many good players at Man Utd and it's an honour to think that I still have a part to play for the club."<em><br><br></em></span></div>

              <p>Well, we can say he don't need or want the money cos he is probably the 2nd richest after Beck and Beck has already left the premier League...</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, no matter how rich one is, some may still be looking or going for a better deal ($ wise)...</p>
              <p>Glad Owen isn't that sort and is putting his football ambition above money...</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>one thing for sure..michael owen is a quality striker...he just need to play regularly..and goals will come..im not expecting him play 90 minutes each game..just regular appearance as a subtitutes will do..and a starter here and there on certain games..and if rooney or hernandez injured, owen can start..i believe owen will come good next year..he was injured too long when he 1st join united,the same in his 2nd season..but now,hes fully fit</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>He is still very much a top level players, maybe stamina wise not the best but that is to be expected from players when they reach 30... Scholes can play till 35, Lampard will be 33 before the season even starts and Gerrard is only 6 months younger than him and these 2 are still expected to play big roles in their clubs... so I don't see why Owen can't go on for another year or even 2 especially coming from the bench or as a 3rd, 4th choice striker... His experienced is very useful and his finishing is still undoubted...</p></div>
