              <p><strong>Ben Foster has warned </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester United's</strong></span></a><strong> fans that the anti-Glazer movement is in danger of having a detrimental effect on the team.</strong></p>
              <p>The former England goalkeeper arrived at <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/birmingham-city.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Birmingham City</span></a> eager to open a new chapter in his career after making a £4million switch from Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>But he had a star message for the Green and Gold movement whose campaign to oust the club's American owners shows little signs of letting up.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">He said: 'There's maybe too much made of it by the supporters. They are obviously passionate about Manchester United, but sometimes they need to focus on supporting the club a bit more than getting carried away with the technicalities of who's in charge.</p>

              <p><strong>'Personally, I think the Glazers have always put money in to Manchester United to buy players when needed. Having said that, I don't think the manager needs to buy too many players there anyway. They have a lot of good youngsters coming through the ranks.</strong></p>
              <p>'However, it's a bit of a distraction when the fans are chanting at every game.'</p>
              <p>Foster slipped out of favour at Old Trafford after dropping, as he himself admitted, 'one or two clangers'.</p>
              <p>He has joined Birmingham feeling that he has a point to prove to United manager Sir Alex Ferguson and English football.</p>
              <p>He said: 'Personally, I thought I did OK but there were a couple of games where I dropped a few clangers and being at United, you can't afford to do that. Then, there was a point where I was playing for England then going back to be third choice keeper at United.</p>
              <p>'I need to get the loving feeling of playing first-team football back. It's nice when you know you're an important part of the team. I've lacked it in the last couple of years, playing the odd game here and there.'</p>
