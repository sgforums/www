              <p>Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson wants his star forward Wayne Rooney
              to be more consistent in front of goal this year, even though the
              23-year-old England international has come out firing this season with
              six goals in as many games.<br><br>Fergie would like to see Rooney put
              up numbers with the consistency that his former United team-mate Ruud
              van Nistelrooy did. The Dutchman scored 150 in 219 appearance during
              his five seasons at Old Trafford, averaging one goal in every 1.46
              games. Rooney's average currently stands at around a goal in every 2.36
              games.<br><br>“There is no difference between this season and last in terms of desire or 
              anything with Wayne; he is always wanting to score goals,” Ferguson said. 
              “You get this with players who are developing, but he just needs 
              consistency.</p>
              <p>“He goes in bunches of sixes and sevens and then goes quiet for a few weeks. 
              Ruud once went nine games in a row and scored just one goal in each game. If 
              we can get that kind of consistency from Wayne, it will make a difference to 
              him and us.</p>
              <p>"He has started well with his scoring, but we need a couple of 
              players to get us more than 20 goals. Our goal ratio last season was very 
              poor.”</p>
              <p>Ferguson
              is relying upon Dimitar Berbatov and Michael Owen to help United's No
              10 with the scoring burden as the Red Devils adjust to life without
              Cristiano Ronaldo. Owen was brought in to function as the third striker
              behind Rooney and Berbatov, but Ferguson insists the former Liverpool
              striker will see plenty of action.</p>
              <p>“Owen has not been involved and I explained that to him,” Ferguson said. “Owen 
              doesn’t come into the equation because we are trying to get a blend of 
              Berbatov and Rooney, but he will play plenty of games.  <strong><br></strong></p>
