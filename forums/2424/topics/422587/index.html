              <p>Manchester City assistant manager Brian Kidd has refuted reports that he has a strained relationship with Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson, who he worked alongside for nine years.</p>
              <p>Kidd and Ferguson enjoyed unprecedented success together at Old Trafford, guiding United to their first league title in 26 years in 1993 before winning two Doubles in three seasons in 1993-94 and 1995-96 and a further Premier League crown in 1997.</p>
              <p>But after Kidd left to pursue an ultimately unsuccessful managerial career with Blackburn - his Rovers side were condemned to relegation by United in 1999, four years after they had won the league - Ferguson gave a stinging assessment of his former colleague in his autobiography.</p>
              <p>The Scot described his former assistant as a "complex person, often quite insecure", and claimed that the board viewed him as a person "with a natural inclination to complain". Ferguson also accused Kidd of going behind his back to moan about training and questioned whether he could cut it as a manager.</p>
              <p>But despite being a victim of an apparent character assassination, Kidd insists there is no animosity between the two and he fully expects an invite to Ferguson's office after this Saturday's Manchester derby.</p>
              <p>"I've never even talked about it with him because I don't think there's ever been a cause to," Kidd told <em>The Guardian</em>. "And I will always appreciate what he's done for me. You can't buy those wonderful memories.</p>
              <p>"I'm relaxed about it all. As I say, I know how I feel; that's all I can say. Other people might feel differently.</p>
              <p>"[I have] no regrets. There's life before Old Trafford, there's life after it. You get on with it, don't you? It was my decision, no problem. I've been very, very lucky and blessed in my football career. No regrets at all.</p>
              <p>"With the gaffer [Ferguson], you always do [expect an invite to his office]. It happens less and less in football these days, but that's one club where you can always go and have a drink."</p>
