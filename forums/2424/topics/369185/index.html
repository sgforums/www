              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson is crossing his fingers Wes Brown is finally over his injury nightmare.</p>
              <p>Brown's medical history at Manchester United does not make pretty reading.</p>
              <p>Cruciate ligament operations on both knees and a broken ankle for a start, plus a multitude of muscular problems that restricted him to an average of 20 Premier League starts a year until the season before last.</p>
              <p>That memorable campaign allowed Brown to reclaim his England place and oust skipper Gary Neville as first-choice right-back in a season that ended in glory on both Premier League and Champions League fronts.</p>
              <p>However, any feeling that Brown's fitness curse had been cured was cruelly dashed last term when an autumn ankle operation was followed by a foot injury that kept him on the sidelines nearly all year.</p>
              <p>Although he returned to duty at Hull on the final day of the campaign, it was only Brown's 13th appearance in all competitions, a wretched return from one of the most congested seasons United have ever completed.</p>
              <p>In addition, having regained his England place under Fabio Capello, apparently as first-choice right-back, Brown has promptly lost it again, his absence offering Liverpool new boy Glen Johnson the chance to impress.</p>
              <p>Thankfully, Brown has managed to come through the early part of pre-season unscathed.</p>
              <p>He was the only Red Devil to complete the full 90 minutes against a Malaysian XI in Kuala Lumpur on Monday night and, with Neville also feeling his way back after long-term problems, Ferguson realises just how important it will be to have the 29-year-old available on a regular basis again.</p>
              <p>"If Wes stays fit, we are in business because he is a fantastic defender," said Ferguson.</p>
              <p>"Even against the Malaysian team, on a couple of occasions he has showed real experience in handling one-versus-one situations.</p>
              <p>"That is what he is really good at. His timing and reading of situations is fantastic. He is quick to get to the ball."</p>
              <p>However, Ferguson knows there has to be an element of doubt, purely because of what Brown has been through in the past.</p>
              <p>"If Wes stays fit, it is an absolute bonus for us," said Ferguson.</p>
              <p>"You have to hope he gets the kind of luck he deserves because, when you look at his injury record, it is not a good one."</p>
