              <p>Gianluigi Buffon could be heading for
              Manchester this summer in one of the biggest transfer deals of the
              close season, and Italian sources believe City are poised to outbid
              United for a man ranked by many as the world's number one goalkeeper.</p>

              </div>
              </div>
              <p>United
              beat City on Saturday to restore their chances of the Premier League
              title and consequently damage their blue rivals' hopes of qualifying
              for Champions League football, which would hugely enhance City's
              ability to attract the best players in the summer transfer market. But
              if money talks, City will clearly be shouting the loudest when it comes
              to making the right kind of offer to tempt Buffon.</p>
              <p>Italian
              reports suggest United will offer Nemanja Vidic plus cash for Buffon,
              while City have the ability to match Juventus' £30 million asking
              price. <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=30">Sir Alex Ferguson</a> is reluctant to lose Vidic, but there has been speculation all season
              that the centre half wants to quit for a warmer climate as his wife has
              failed to settle in England.</p>
              <p>The biggest stumbling block for
              Ferguson, though, is Buffon's wage demands of £4 million after tax, and
              with a new high rate of tax imposed in England, that would make Buffon
              by far the highest earner at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Juventus have suffered a wreck of a season and are looking to rebuild. Buffon, a prime asset who could be cashed in by the <em>Bianconeri</em>,
              said of a potential move from Juventus, who he joined from Parma in
              2001 for a then world-record £23 million fee: "The decision does not
              depend on where we finish in the table whether or not we qualify for
              the Champions League, although we must carry on in these circumstances
              and at the end of the season we'll see what happens."</p>
              <p>Buffon was one of a number of players who stayed with Juventus despite an enforced 2006 relegation following the <em>calciopoli</em> corruption scandal.</p>
              <p>And
              Soccernet's Italian sources revealed on Sunday: "Three weeks ago
              Roberto Bettega [Juve's vice director general] said that Gigi was
              untouchable, and that he will stay with Juve. However, three years ago
              Juve made a pact with their players, a gentleman's agreement, that if
              they stayed when they were relegated to the Serie B, they would be
              allowed to go after three years if the club failed to get back to their
              glory days.</p>
              <p>"But for Buffon to leave Juve, the price will have to
              be right. The fee is £30 million and the player requires £4 million
              after tax. As Barcelona and Real have good keepers, the only
              destination can be England, and while United need a new top goalkeeper
              to replace Edwin Van der Sar, City have the resources to buy Buffon."</p>
              <p>Blues boss <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=150">Roberto Mancini</a> has reportedly endorsed City's interest in Buffon, even though Shay
              Given was purchased from Newcastle for a significant fee in January
              2009. Bayern Munich have been linked with Buffon before as a
              replacement for Hans-Jorg Butt, himself a stopgap after the failure to
              adequately replace Oliver Kahn.</p>
              <p>Juventus already have their eye
              on a Buffon replacement in Cagliari goalkeeper Federico Marchetti while
              Villarrreal's Argentine keeper Diego Lopez is a target who just so
              happens to share an agent with <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=28">Rafael Benitez</a>,
              who is still understood to be considering an offer to take over at
              Juve, where he would be granted a large budget to buy several players
              including Lyon's Michel Bastos and PSV Eindhoven starlet Ibrahim
              Afellay.</p>

              <p>Both Arsenal and Man Utd will be bringing in new players this summer and high on their list of priorities is a goalkeeper with both clubs tracking the same keepers in Germany. According to the German press Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger are both keen on Bayer Leverkusen stopper Rene Adler.</p>
              <p>Adler has been linked with Arsenal now for a a couple of weeks now as have Bayern Munich and we can now add Man Utd to the German number one’s list of admirers. Edwin Van Der Sar the current Man Utd number one is fast approaching the end of his career while Manuel Almunia no longer carries Wengers confidence at The Emirates and so it is no surprise that Wenger and Fergie would end up looking at the same top class keepers.</p>
              <p>Rene Adler is back in training now following his rib injury and the German media are claiming that representatives of Man Utd and Arsenal are expected in Germany over the next week to open up discussions with Bayer Leverkusen who it appears have now resigned themselves to the fact that Adler will be leaving them at the end of the season.</p>
              <p>Bayern Munich are still in the frame, though Manual Neuer remains their favoured goalkeeping target and the chances are that it will be either Arsenal or Man Utd that end up luring Rene Adler to the English Premiership.</p>

              <p class="photoDesc">Ben Foster has been linked with a move to Birmingham</p>
              <p><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=22777"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ben Foster</span></span></a> has confirmed that he expects to leave Manchester United this summer as he attempts to revive his career.</p>
              <p><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=30"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></span></a> has confirmed he plans to allow one or two senior players to leave Old Trafford this summer, and Foster, 27, appears to be among the candidates.</p>
              <p>The goalkeeper had been expected to challenge <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=8884"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Edwin van der Sar</span></span></a> and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=13943"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Tomasz Kuszczak</span></span></a> for a place in the starting line-up but, following some disappointing early season form, he admits he now needs to find regular football elsewhere.</p>
              <p>"You never want to leave Manchester United," he told the <em>Manchester Evening News</em>. "If you leave this club you are only ever going to go down, but I want to be playing football.</p>
              <p>"I am not interested in just hanging around and I would go if the club wanted to sell me. If they are happy to accept a bid then you have to read between the lines and realise you are not really needed and move on. It would not be the end of the world for me."</p>
              <p>Many tipped Foster to establish himself as first-choice in the England squad ahead of this summer's World Cup, but he accepts there is little prospect of a call-up given his recent lack of match action.</p>
              <p>"I don't think there is any chance of South Africa now," he said. "If he were to pick me it would be very unfair on some of the other goalkeepers.</p>
              <p>"I have not played a first-team game for a good few months and some of the English lads out there like <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=30462"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Joe Hart</span></span></a> and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=5112"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Robert Green</span></span></a> have been doing fantastic."</p>
