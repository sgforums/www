              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson praised his side’s discipline and composure after the Reds secured a convincing 4-1 victory at Portsmouth to move within two points of Chelsea.</strong></p>
              <p>The United boss watched from the stands as a Wayne Rooney hat-trick and Ryan Giggs’ 100th Premier League goal ensured the Reds remain hot on the heels of Carlo Ancelotti's pace-setters.</p>
              <p>The Reds survived a rocky first period before storming to victory after the break, and Sir Alex was pleased with the way his team remained calm before deservedly taking all three points.</p>
              <p>“It’s a great result for us, 4-1 away from home, I was very pleased with that,” he told <strong>MUTV</strong>. “Some of the football was good, and in the second half we kept our discipline very well, we kept possession of the ball very well and we deserved it in the end.”</p>
              <p>The Reds' emphatic victory negated a potentially lively debate about the award of Portsmouth's penalty, given for a slight shirt tug by Nemanja Vidic and subsequently converted by Kevin-Prince Boateng. Nevertheless, Sir Alex was satisfied by the manner in which his side overcame that setback.</p>
              <div id="news05LeftStory">
              <p>“I think the linesman put the referee under terrible pressure, and he was fifty yards away," he said. "You see these things every week in the box. Players wrestle with one another, tug at each other’s jerseys but that’s never a penalty kick. This linesman has changed the course of normal decision making. It was disappointing for us to concede in that kind of situation.</p>
              <p>“Half time came at a good time for us. The important thing was to keep our discipline, keep our composure and play our football. An early goal was always important in the second half because they had to chase and things can open up for you, and that’s exactly what happened."</p>
              <p>Sir Alex also singled out Tomasz Kuszczak for special praise, after the Polish goalkeeper, starting in goal due to the absence of Edwin Van Der Sar, saved United a number of times in the first half.</p>
              <p>"In fairness to them, Portsmouth made some good chances," said the United manager. "Tomasz has made three fantastic saves today so we owe him a debt because his performance was top notch, we’re pleased with him."</p>
