              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Manchester United</span><span style="color: #000000;"> have had a bid of around €16m (£12.8m) for </span><span style="color: #000000;">Borussia Dortmund</span><span style="color: #000000;">'s</span> Shinji Kagawa rejected, according to a highly-placed source at the German club.</strong></p>
              <p>The offer for the 23-year-old midfielder was not accepted as Dortmund value Kagawa closer to €20m. But as he cost just €350,000 when the German champions bought him from the Japanese club Cerezo Osaka two years ago, it is thought that the deal may go through next week for around €17-18m.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson watched Kagawa a fortnight ago when he scored in Dortmund's 5-2 win over Bayern Munich in the German Cup final. He scored 13 goals in 31 league games as Dortmund won the Bundesliga from Bayern by eight points and would fit the profile currently adhered to by United of a young player who could improve and not cost a premium price.</p>

              <p><strong>Manchester United are closing in on the €15 million signing of Japan midfielder Shinji Kagawa, according to reports in Germany.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Kagawa, 23, has been linked with United for some time and it appears the deal may be close to coming to fruition, with Dortmund sporting director Michael Zorc stating "some details are still to be confirmed".</p>
              <p><em>Kicker</em> suggests that the two sides are close to agreeing an initial €15 million fee, potentially rising to €22 million with add-ons.</p>
              <p>Kagawa recently confirmed that he has met with Old Trafford boss Sir Alex Ferguson over a move and, amid talk of other suitors, it appears that United are leading the chase for the playmaker.</p>
              <p>Formerly of Cerezo Osaka, Kagawa moved to Dortmund in 2010 and helped inspire the Westfalenstadion side to Bundesliga titles in both seasons at the club, as well as the 2011-12 DFB Pokal trophy.</p>

              <p>Not really, a main player with the german champions costing only $13+m pounds isn't a lot in today's market. Also, he is the 2nd highest scoring midfielder in the Bundesliga, more than <span style="color: #000000;">Robben or Ribery so should mean something too.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">But i think because he is from Japan, just imagine the amount of shirts he will sell with his name on the United jersey... I think they will earn it all back in a short time. </span></p>

              <p><strong>Manchester United have confirmed they have "agreed terms" for the transfer of Shinji Kagawa from Borussia Dortmund.</strong> </p>
              <p class="published-date-text">Dortmund midfielder Kagawa, 23, will join United this summer for a fee reportedly in the region of £16 million, subject to a medical and work permit.</p>
              <p class="published-date-text">It was reported at the end of May that the Red Devils were closing in on the capture of the Japan international after he was scouted by Sir Alex Ferguson.</p>
              <p class="published-date-text">A statement on United's official website read: "Manchester United is delighted to announce that it has agreed terms with both Borussia Dortmund and Shinji Kagawa for his transfer to the Club.</p>
              <p class="published-date-text">"The deal is subject only to the player medical and obtaining a UK work permit. These conditions are anticipated to be completed by the end of June. Further details will be announced in due course."</p>
              <p class="published-date-text">United defender Rio Ferdinand added on his Twitter account: "Welcome to Shinji Kagawa for his transfer to Man Utd. heres to a succesful time here bro!"</p>
              <p class="published-date-text">Kagawa signed for Dortmund from Cerezo Osaka in 2010. He lifted the Bundesliga title in his first season at the club before helping them retain the trophy this season and also claim DFB-Pokal glory.</p>
              <p class="published-date-text">Speaking later on Tuesday, Kagawa told Kyodo News after training with his national team ahead of games against Jordan and Australia: "The transfer is not complete for the time being. I have yet to sign the contract.</p>
              <p class="published-date-text">"The team and I are fully concentrated on the next two games. It's better if we talk about (the transfer) after those matches. I want to focus on playing well over the next few weeks."</p>

              <h1>Kagawa only wanted United</h1>
              <p><em>As United supporters around the world await the completion of Shinji Kagawa’s transfer to Old Trafford, we catch up with Bundesliga expert Raphael Honigstein to shed light on the player set to become the Reds’ first Japanese signing…</em></p>
              <p><strong>How good a signing have United made?<br></strong>It’s a brilliant signing. A lot of clubs would have liked to make the move, but United benefited from one of the rare instances where a player had really made up his mind that he wanted to play for a specific club. Of course money is important, but for him it was almost more of a romantic notion of joining United, and the others had no chance. They tried to get very near United’s offer, but Kagawa had made up his mind that this was his dream and he wasn’t going to pass up the opportunity. All sorts of clubs were trying to sign him and I think it’s a real coup for United to get him.</p>
              <p><strong>Which other clubs were interested in him?<br></strong>Well, you never quite know just how far they got because the indications from the player and his agent were always very clear - that he was only going to move to United - so they didn’t get very far. I think Arsenal and Chelsea certainly looked at him, Real Madrid very late on in the game became aware of his potential, but United stole a march on everyone because the player wanted to go there. It’s easy to be cynical and sometimes players just sign for whoever offers the most money, but it’s fair to say this instance was different. He really wanted to go to United and wouldn’t listen to any other offers, as far as I’m aware.</p>
              <p><strong>What are his key attributes? <br></strong>Kagawa isn't an Arjen Robben or a Franck Ribery type who picks up the ball and everyone starts shaking with fear; the guy almost works in a stealthier way. He finds space and he touches it when it’s already too late.</p>
              <p>He’ll find space behind a full-back or he’ll play someone in with a first touch pass and you maybe don’t have time to worry about him because he’s already outsmarted you. That’s the kind of stuff he does. He doesn’t run at people. He’s not a real winger. For Japan he plays out wide, but always with a constant view to cut in, and for Dortmund his best role was as a fairly free second striker in a more forward attacking role. He found space a lot of times on the left, would pop up on the right and he’s really good at what he does.</p>
              <p><strong>Are there any areas of his game he particularly needs to work on? <br></strong>Not really. I don’t think the Premier League is necessarily more physical than the Bundesliga. There might be more running, but it’s hard to top what Dortmund have done in terms of sheer ground they cover. If there’s any player who will find the tempo easy to adapt to, it’s him. He’s never going to be a big threat in terms of heading ability, but that’s not going to change and you don’t need him to. That’s really it. He just needs to keep growing as a player and become even more consistent. The team he’s played in was near-perfect and he really found the perfect position for himself so it’s hard, on the back of that, to think of too many faults. You could say maybe he needs to bulk up ever so slightly if he’s going to be played consistently out wide, where he’s going to have to hold off full-backs.</p>
              <p><strong>How important was he in Dortmund’s recent successes?<br></strong>He was certainly very good in the first season, but then he got injured in January 2011 and he missed the great run they had towards the end of 2010/11 when they really pulled away. The real strong stuff came when he was injured, but he was still an integral part of winning the Bundesliga title. In 2011/12 though, he really was arguably their most influential performer after Robert Lewandowski.</p>
              <p>Mario Götze missed four months of the season and people hardly noticed because Kagawa was so good. He also made Lewandowski look really good because the understanding between the two is just phenomenal. Everybody should watch the second goal that they scored against Bayern in the cup final last month. It’s all one-touch and you could see they instinctively knew where each other was.</p>
              <p><strong>How impressive was his adaptation to life in Germany, on and off the field? <br></strong>Dortmund isn’t one of the more multicultural cities in Germany - I think there was one sushi restaurant which he went to - but that just shows how adaptable he is because it was still easy it was for him to settle on and off the pitch. I think it’ll be much easier for him in Manchester after two years in Dortmund, and that’s another reason why United were keen on him; there’s no question mark over him which you might get when buying a player straight from Asia. It was the same with Ji-sung Park; after playing in Holland he found it easy to make the move to England.</p>
              <p><strong>Which parts of his game suggest he can adapt to the Premier League?<br></strong>All parts. His attitude is just phenomenal on and off the pitch. He’s a guy everyone loves; nobody has a bad thing to say about him. He’s a little bit shy but a tremendous professional and a great team-mate. His attitude is top class. That, on top of his unique skills set, is tailor-made for the Premier League. His attributes are pace, directness, one-touch play, and it all lends itself to playing at the highest level. Plus he can only improve because he’s still very young and if you think where he’s come from in a very short space of time – the Japanese second division, to winning the Bundesliga back-to-back and now going to United - I think we’ve only seen a glimpse of what he can do. If he can continue on that career path then the guy will be one of the greats.</p>
              <p><strong>Where do you see him fitting in at United?<br></strong>He definitely gives you an option to play 4-2-3-1, the way that United played in 2007/08, which is arguably the best football they’ve played in recent years. He gives you that ability not just from his intelligence, but from his workrate because you know you can play him out wide and if need be, he can go 4-5-1 with the wide players coming back and he will do that no problem because he’s got such an amazing work ethic and his legs are brilliant. He gives you so many options and I’m sure he’s also a good impact player if you wanted to start him on the bench. He’ll definitely improve the team and the squad straight away. I think he’ll force his way in and Ferguson will find a way to accommodate him because he’s too good to be left out.</p>

              <p><span><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson has been handed some good news after it was confirmed new signing Shinji Kagawa would not be called up for Olympic duty by Japan.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>The Manchester United boss has already put his foot down over the London 2012 tournament, even though Great Britain will play their first match against Senegal, at Old Trafford on July 25.</span></p>
              <p><span>Ferguson has barred any over-age player, with the exception of Ryan Giggs, from being called up by GB boss Stuart Pearce, and persuaded Mexico to give Javier Hernandez a rest.</span></p>

              <div class="sport item"><span>Japanese FA technical director Hiromi Hara said: 'Kagawa is one of the leading members of the Japan national senior team and he is almost certainly going to join one of the biggest clubs in the world.</span></div>

              <p><strong>Talk about a flying visit - Shinji Kagawa is jetting into the UK today for just 11 hours to undergo his medical at Manchester United.</strong></p>
              <p>Kagawa left Tokyo late last night local time to begin his gruelling 13,700-mile round trip and is expected in Manchester today.</p>
              <p>The Japan midfielder won't even have time to visit Old Trafford before he jumps on his plane back to Tokyo.</p>
              <p>Kagawa said as he left Tokyo's Narita airport: "It's just a medical. I hope it will end with no problems."Kagawa's medical is the latest step in his £17million transfer to United from Borussia Dortmund and his last hurdle will be obtaining a work permit.</p>
              <p>United's initial application is expected to be rejected because he has not played in 75 per cent of Japan's games over the last three years, but granted on appeal.</p>
              <p>Kagawa has admitted there will be no hiding place for him at United.</p>
              <p>"I have no doubt it will truly be a big challenge for me and I realise that mistakes will not be tolerated," said Kagawa.</p>
              <p>"I have to work harder than ever. I have to take this step with that sort of resolve," the 23-year-old said.</p>
              <p>Kagawa, who was also tracked by Arsenal, Chelsea and AC Milan, met with Ferguson before signing and revealed the United boss had assured him he would play a key role next season.</p>
