              Cristiano Ronaldo has reaffirmed his intention to stay at Manchester United, and learn more from father figure Sir Alex Ferguson.
              
              Fresh speculation linked the winger to Real Madrid earlier this week, although the Spanish giants have "categorically denied" media reports they have a pre-contract agreement to sign United's Portuguese international star. 
              
              And the 24-year-old maintains he sees his future with the Premier League champions, who aim to retain their Champions League trophy on Wednesday when they take on Barcelona in the Champions League final in Rome. 
              
              Ronaldo explained: "Manchester United is my home. My heart is here. This is where I want to play. 
              
              "The boss (Ferguson) believes in this team and so do I. Ever since I joined United, he has been like a second father to me. 
              
              "This is my home now. I think even when I say my heart is here people are going to speak up and make things up. But this is where I want to play. 
              
              "We are part of an era that can go down in history for the way we are playing and for the trophies we are winning. 
              
              "The boss believes in this team and so do I. And this is where I want to be. Manchester United is now my house." 
              
              Ronaldo was keen to praise Ferguson for enabling him to blossom at Old Trafford. 
              
              He continued in the News of the World: "He is two different people and they have both helped me become who I am today. 
              
              "Firstly he is probably the most knowledgeable football coach in the world. I learn from him every day. 
              
              "No matter how good I become, I know he is a man who will always be able to teach me that little bit more. 
              
              "I don't get tired of learning from him because I know every bit of advice he gives me will make me a better player. 
              
              "The second person he is, is a father to me. Ever since I joined Manchester United, he has been like a second father to me. 
              
              "I don't just respect him, I have the affection for him a child has for his father. 
              
              "When he gives me advice that is non-football, I listen because it will make me a better person."
