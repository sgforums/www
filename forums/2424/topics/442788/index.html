              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">MANCHESTER UNITED have suffered an injury blow after Javier Hernandez was taken off on a stretcher during their 1-0 win at Aston Villa.</h2>
              <p>The Mexican striker appeared to catch his studs in the turf, before falling to the ground in serious pain.</p>
              <p>United medical staff attended Hernandez during a four minute interruption to the game at Villa Park, before placing his left leg in a splint.</p>
              <p>Speaking after the game, boss Alex Ferguson said: "I think he's torn ligaments in his ankle so he could be out for four weeks."</p>
              <p>Villa were also hit with an injury concerns of their own, with Shay Given and Jermaine Jenas both crocked.</p>
              <p>Boss Alex McLeish said: "I'm not sure but I think Shay had a little tweak in his hamstring. Hopefully it's a grade one (tear) and will heal really quickly.</p>
              <p>"As for Jermaine, we don't know, but we think he's had an injury to his Achilles but we will wait until the morning to see."</p>
              <p>Aside from the injury to Hernandez, Ferguson was satisfied with the result and especially the performance of goalscorer Phil Jones.</p>
              <p>He said: "We deserved a victory. We had great possession but at times we were a bit wasteful with chances in the second half.</p>
              <p>"Villa Park is a difficult place to go. Phil Jones is a natural centre-back but he's so versatile he can play in midfield. We've got options where Phil can play."</p>
              <p>Jones was pleased to net his first goal for the club after he scored an own goal against Benfica in the UEFA Champions League at Old Trafford last month.</p>
              <p>But the 19-year-old is in no rush to determine his role in the side after being praised for his versatility by his manager.</p>
              <p>He said: "I'm delighted. I've been getting some stick for not scoring and scoring in the back of my own net in the Champions League was not the best way to open my scoring campaign.</p>
              <p>"I'm still young and learning the game and I don't think it matters if I cement a regular spot in the side at the moment as long as I keep playing.</p>
              <p>"There's time in the future to cement my place in the side and I'm just happy to play for Manchester United."</p>
              <p>United goalkeeper Anders Lindegaard was pleased with the result after taking over from David de Gea.</p>
              <p>He said: "It's very important to keep a clean sheet.</p>
              <p>"Clean sheets are the goals for a goalkeeper and in 10 games no one will remember how many fantastic saves there's been — they'll remember the clean sheets.</p>
              <p>"For my sake I'd rather win 1-0 than 10-1 because I'm a goalkeeper and want my clean sheet.</p>
              <p>"I thought we played brilliantly defensively."</p>

              <p>I am not too worried of Hernandez injury layoff for a while when Wellbeck is still around and Macheda can be the super sup in the striker's dept, although he is not that match fit. maybe time to play Rooney as the lone striker position, where he scored 33 goals in the 2009/2010 season.</p>
              <p>I am more worried that united is unable to kill off games after scoring 1-0 after the city defeat. sure defensively they were more sound these days, but offensively they are unable to get the second goal just in case an opponent score late in the game.</p>

Whether they can maintain that form still remains to be seen. And even if they win the EPL title, no big deal. In the eyes of many, they are just like chelsea, a club suddenly at the top because of cold hard cash. Heck, even swansea can do it if they had a mega rich owner.</p></div>

              <p>I don't think Spurs is being 'looked down' on. Actually if you see the table, they are or could be above United so no comparision there. What I was saying is, if not for United's 1-0 wins, United could be worse off by 5, 6 or even 7 points. And those I mentioned are just in that point area. Spurs are of course currently not in that group... They are doing far better.</p>
