              Spurs join Tevez race
              Spurs are fighting Manchester City, Chelsea and Real Madrid to land Carlos Tevez. The Argentinian striker believes his time is up at Manchester United but wishes to stay in the Premier League. Sources close to Tevez have told SunSport that Spurs boss Harry Redknapp loves the player so much he will try to buy him from his owners for around Â£25million. Wheeler-dealer Redknapp is planning a major clearout at White Hart Lane in a bid to raise substantial funds for new players. He wants rid of Russian striker Roman Pavlyuchenko, England attacker Darren Bent and midfielder David Bentley - and will also consider offers for others. Redknapp can guarantee Tevez first-team football and is convinced the popular striker would be a major hit in North London.
              Shaun Custis, The Sun
              
              The Mirror and the Mail both report how Unitedâ€™s 2-0 derby win over Manchester City was marred by the joint â€œmutinyâ€� of Carlos Tevez and Cristiano Ronaldo. â€˜Strop stars spoil Unitedâ€™s derby day delightâ€™ was the Mail's headline.
              
              However, The Guardian reports that Sir Alex Ferguson was unfazed by the duo's behaviour. The United manager said he had â€œno problemâ€� with Ronaldoâ€™s reaction to being substituted and also insisted he has no issue with Tevez going public with his grievances: â€œNot at all, if he keeps scoring Iâ€™ve got no problem.â€�
