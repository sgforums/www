              <p class="body "><strong>Manchester United are ready to test Tottenham’s resolve to keep Luka Modric – with a £22million bid.</strong></p>
              <p class="body ">The Croatia midfielder has been on Sir Alex Ferguson's wish-list for some time.</p>
              <p class="body ">But although Tottenham value him at around £30m, United are unwilling to pay that much for the 26-year-old playmaker.</p>
              <p class="body ">United believe Spurs' failure to secure Champions League football next season has eased their task of landing Modric.</p>
              <p class="body ">The player tried to force through a move to Chelsea last summer but Spurs chairman Daniel Levy refused to let him leave.</p>
              <p class="body ">It seems Modric is now ready to submit another transfer request, with Tottenham unlikely to stand in his way for a second summer.</p>
              <p class="body ">However, Spurs will hold out for as much money as they can, and United are certain to have to increase their initial offer.  </p>
              <p class="body ">Ferguson has already signed Japan midfielder Shinji Kagawa from Borussia Dortmund and is keen to add Modric and Everton and England defender Leighton Baines.</p>
              <p class="body ">Ferguson wants Baines to replace left-back Patrice Evra, who has been first choice in the position for the past five seasons but looked ­vulnerable last season.</p>
              <p class="body "> </p>
              <p class="body "> </p>
              <p class="body "><img title="Nothing lasts for Evra: Baines could be Manchester United's left-back next season" src="http://i3.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article802172.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/Leighton+Baines-Everton+cropped.jpg" alt="" width="615" height="409"> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="body ">Nothing lasts for Evra: Baines could be Manchester United's left-back next season  </p>
              <p class="body "> </p>
              <p class="body "> </p>
              <p class="body "> </p>
              <p class="body "><strong>Everton, who are adamant that Baines is not for sale, value the 27-year-old at around £20m - a figure United are not prepared to pay.</strong></p>
              <p class="body ">Although there is always a higher premium on English players, United value Baines at no more than £15m, as his age means he's unlikely to have re-sale value.</p>
              <p class="body ">Baines, who arrived with the England squad in Krakow on Wednesday ahead of Monday’s Euro 2012 opener against France, said he was “flattered” to have been linked with United.</p>
              <p class="body ">A deal for him is unlikely to be done until England’s participation in the tournament concludes.</p>
              <p class="body "> </p>

              <p>Boss Alex Ferguson has offered Tottenham a £25million fee, rising to £30m based on appearances and success.</p>
              <p>Modric, 26, will be handed a four-year deal worth £26m.</p>
              <p>His wages of £125,000 a week will put him among the big earners at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Modric has kept up to date with talks while at Euro 2012 with Croatia and will seal the move on his return.</p>
              <p>Spurs held off interest from Chelsea to hold on to the midfielder last year.</p>
              <p>The Croatian said he had no intention of quitting Spurs having signed a six-year deal in May 2010.</p>
              <p>United boss Fergie signed Japanese star Shinji Kagawa this week and wants Newcastle’s Cheick Tiote and Everton left-back Leighton Baines — but refuses to match the £20m valuations on each.</p>

              <p class="body "><strong>Big-spending Paris Saint Germain have made a move for Tottenham playmaker Luka Modric.</strong></p>
              <p class="body ">The oil-backed French side could end up <span style="color: #000000;">wrecking Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson’s hopes of landing Croatia midfielder Modric</span> , as it is believed they are ready to offer £30million-plus.</p>
              <p class="body ">United have already had a £22m bid knocked back, and Ferguson is growing frustrated in his attempts to land Modric.</p>
              <p class="body ">PSG coach Carlo Ancelotti has identified Modric as one of his top targets this summer, and had scouts at Croatia’s Euro 2012 win over the Republic of Ireland on Sunday.</p>
              <p class="body ">Tottenham refused to sell Modric last summer when Chelsea targeted him and chairman Daniel Levy is unlikely to allow him to go without a fight this time.</p>

              <p class="body "> </p>
              <p class="body "><strong>It is also believed Modric would prefer a move to Old Trafford rather than PSG, but the French club have made things very complicated for Fergie as he attempts to land him.</strong></p>
              <p class="body ">Modric insists he is only focused on Euro 2012 and is refusing to elaborate on his future.</p>
              <p class="body ">He said: “I’m with the national team. I am a Spurs player and it’s not down to me to speak about it.”</p>
              <p class="body ">This latest development is a further concern for Spurs, who are also facing major uncertainty over manager Harry Redknapp this summer.</p>
              <p class="body ">Redknapp, who has one year left on his current £3m-a-year contract, has stated publicly that he wants a new deal but negotiations with Levy have reached breaking point.</p>
              <p>Tottenham will not give Redknapp a new contract this summer and are prepared to allow him to go into the final year of his deal.</p>
              <p class="body ">But those tactics may leave Redknapp’s future at the club in doubt, especially as a Middle Eastern consortium is ready to offer him a job in Qatar.</p>
