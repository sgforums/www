Larsson capped a fine display when he volleyed in on 55 minutes to score in his first FA Cup tie.<br><br>United almost doubled their lead when Ryan Giggs' free-kick hit the bar before substitute Milan Baros equalised when he slid a low shot in the corner.<br><br>Solskjaer had the final say when a tame shot embarrassed keeper Gabor Kiraly. It was tough on Villa, who battled bravely and soaked up intense United pressure.<br><br>After a lethargic opening, United began to up their tempo and the movement of Larsson and Wayne Rooney started to cause Villa problems. A sublime one-two led to Larsson flicking a return volley into Rooney's path but the England forward shot tamely at the keeper. However, that effort proved to be one of Rooney's best in a first half where his touch often deserted him in the box and his shots from distance were slashed high and wide.<br><br>Yet when Rooney did produce the kind of effort expected of him, swivelling and stabbing a shot at the near post after sparkling wing work from Cristiano Ronaldo, Kiraly made a smart save. And there was better to come from Kiraly, who superbly diverted a low shot from Larsson after the Swede had been played through by Michael Carrick.<br><br>Moments before, Larsson had been the provider when he unselfishly squared the ball to Rooney, who wasted the chance by hesitating and allowing Wilfred Bouma to make a challenge. It typified stubborn Villa defending, although United's profligate finishing contributed to the deadlock remaining intact.<br><br>While the visitors soaked up the pressure, they carried very little attacking threat of their own - a Gareth Barry free-kick that curled over the bar was their only shot of note in the opening half. That clearly had not been lost on manager Martin O'Neill, who waited only seven minutes after the break before replacing striker Juan Pablo Angel with Baros.<br><br>However, two minutes later Larsson - who used to play under O'Neill at Celtic made the breakthrough. After collecting Rooney's pass on the edge of the area, Larsson flipped up the ball with one touch and with his second, lashed a volley into the top corner. The goal should have led to United assuming full control and had Giggs' free-kick hit the bar and gone in rather than over, the contest would have been finished.<br><br>But somehow, Villa dragged themselves back in contention and for the first time in the match began to create chances. Gary Cahill almost levelled the score when he shaved the post with a header after connecting with Gavin McCann's corner. And shortly afterwards, Barry's precise pass found Isaiah Osbourne but his effort was well saved by Tomasz Kuszczak.<br><br>Villa may have felt they had wasted their best chance but then Cahill's shot was trapped by Baros, who coolly slid the ball into the bottom left corner.<br><br>However, the drama was not over as Solskjaer prevented the replay Villa arguably deserved when he shot from the right and the ball squirmed underneath the unfortunate Kiraly.<br><br>Att: 74,924<br><br></div>

The United boss said: "He could have scored two or three. With his movement and experience, he was terrific. The goal summed him up, no drawback.<br><br>"Henrik has scored goals throughout his career and some of them have been crucial. Eric Cantona was like that. "We created a lot of chances and some of our football was terrific."<br><br>Villa boss Martin O'Neill knows all about Larsson's ability, having had him in his side when he was manager at Celtic. And he was generous with his praise of the striker, despite being disappointed by the defeat. "Henrik is always capable of scoring a goal like that," stated O'Neill.<br><br>"People said he would only score goals in Scotland and I never thought for one minute he wouldn't score in any league he chose. He has gone on to show that." O'Neill thought his side were heading for a replay after his decision to replace Juan Pablo Angel with Milan Baros paid off when the Czech striker equalised.<br><br>"We played our best football when we went behind and Milan took the goal splendidly, added O'Neill. "He has come on and shown his ability - the Milan Baros we know. Hopefully that will give his confidence a big boost.<br><br>"I am very disappointed at the result but United are always capable of scoring." United's winner owed a lot to a goalkeeping error from on-loan stopper Gabor Kiraly, who played in place of the injured Thomas Sorensen.<br><br>However, O'Neill refused to blame Kiraly, saying: "I am grateful to Gabor coming down from Crystal Palace as we were down on numbers. "He was feeling pretty good at half-time, he had made a good save. He is pretty downcast but that is the way it goes."<br><br>Ferguson, meanwhile, paid tribute to substitute Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who hit the shot that wriggled under Kiraly to settle the tie. "That's his ninth of the season. We took off one good finisher and put another one on," he said. "I thought we were heading for a replay but we deserved the victory."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i hope SAF can extend Larsson's loan till end of season.  Lethal finishing and superb goal with silky skills too.  He showed how it should be done when the rest of the players, eg: Rooney are all banging on doors and not scoring.<br><br>the first goal by Larsson was superb, stopping the ball and then shooting all in one deft move...wow...<br><br>the second was down to pure goalkeeper error but kudos to Solksjaer....it only underlined why SAF valued him as an asset over RVN.  His finishing is still effective.<br><br>now I hope Man U improve on their finishing to be more lethal.  And boy, yesterday defense was caught napping again, how on earth did Baros get that pass ?</div>
