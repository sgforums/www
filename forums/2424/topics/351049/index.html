              <p><strong>Manchester United sensation Rafael da Silva expects Fabio to have a similar impact at Old Trafford before the season is out. </strong></p>
              <p>The 18-year-old right back's progress has been halted by a
              hairline fracture to his ankle but his twin has recovered from his
              injury problems to push for a place in the side.</p>
              <p>With Patrice Evra the automatic choice at left back, Fabio
              needs to be patient but his eye-catching debut against Tottenham in the
              FA Cup showed why he is just as highly regarded as his brother.</p>
              <p>"We are young," Rafael told uefa.com. "Fabio's chance will
              hopefully come and he will be able to show people how good he is. At
              the moment, we are here to learn and help the team.</p>
              <p>"One day at a time.</p>
              <p>"It has always been natural for us [to play on either flank] and
              there was really no intent on our part, especially when you think that,
              at one point in our careers, I was playing as a defensive midfielder
              and Fabio as a striker. But I totally understand that people are a bit
              puzzled.</p>
              <p>"Yeah [there is friendly rivalry between us], but we love
              playing together. He told me the other day that I should enjoy that
              strike against Arsenal [in United's last defeat back in November]
              because it was probably the only time in our lives that I had outscored
              him."</p>
              <p>The exciting youngster has been well pleased with his debut
              campaign in England, even allowing for the "terrible weather", and was
              asked to pick out his highlight.</p>
              <p>"I am tempted to say that goal against Arsenal, my first in the United shirt," he answered. </p>
              <p>"It was quite special. It was a sweet strike too, by the way.</p>
              <p>"But I was also pretty chuffed with my performance against
              Manchester City when Sir Alex told me that I had totally outplayed
              Robinho."</p>

              <p>lol wtf Rafy Faby. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="icon_surprised.gif"></p>
              <p>Faby looks better defensively imo.  He doesn't lunge into tackles like Rafy.</p>
