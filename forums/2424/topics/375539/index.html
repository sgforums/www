              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson
              has admitted he would relish another chance to face Barcelona in the
              UEFA Champions League final this season, admitting the manner of the
              defeat affected him so much he took DVDs of the game with him on
              holiday to analyse.</p>
              <p><img src="http://i30.tinypic.com/2dbtjph.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>The Manchester United boss witnessed his side succumb 2-0 to the
              Catalans in last season's showpiece in Rome and Ferguson revealed that
              some harsh lessons were learnt that night.</p>
              <p>''I would love the
              chance to redress the situation with Barcelona. Absolutely. I would
              love another final with them," he told the<em> Daily Star.</em> "You look at that defeat and you can look at reasons and excuses. But it's always better to look at the reasons.</p>
              <p>"We're
              now quite clear about where it went wrong and that's always helpful.
              There were valid reasons and so we were able to move on. I wouldn't go
              into the reasons for the defeat but I did take the DVDs with me on
              holiday and watched the game again.</p>
              <p>"We went through everything
              too, with my backroom staff. The whole build-up. Everything. Was it the
              right hotel, was the training right? So we are quite clear about where
              we are now with that defeat.</p>
              <p>"I quite like these games. It's not
              a problem. What went wrong against Barcelona can be put right.
              Certainly it will all be put right. I didn't kick myself over the
              summer. I have been long enough in the game to know that you can't win
              them all.</p>
              <p>"Sometimes you just have to accept that bad days come
              along and you move on from there. It was disappointing though. You
              don't like losing finals of European games. It was the first one I have
              lost so it was really disappointing for everyone."</p>
              <p>The Red Devils begin their European quest with a trip to Besiktas on Tuesday and Ferguson is expecting a lively atmosphere.</p>
              <p>"There's
              a lot to be admired in that, their fanaticism," he added. "You expect
              that. The stadium is full at 12 o'clock on the day. It's amazing how
              they make that noise but you just have to deal with it.</p>
              <p>"The
              Champions League is the priority. It's a great tournament, with all the
              best players and teams. So there's always the two challenges for us -
              the Premier League and the European Cup."</p>
