              <p><strong>HE’S a gifted footballer with talent, a sweet left foot who’s being
              chased by four top Premier League sides – and he’s only five years old.</strong></p>
              <p>But
              then hotly-tipped Charlie Savage does get tips – not to mention long,
              blonde locks – from his old man, former Wales star Robbie.</p>
              <p>Charlie
              is training with Manchester United but is also wanted by super-rich
              Manchester City, and Merseyside duo Liverpool and Everton.</p>
              <p>Yet his dad admits he wouldn’t mind if son Charlie ended up playing for WREXHAM.</p>
              <p>The
              talented left-footer was spotted playing for his local team by a scout
              from Manchester City and was offered a chance to train with them.</p>
              <p>A
              beaming Savage explained: “I went to watch him recently and a guy stood
              next to me and said ‘that blonde boy’s a great player’ and he was
              talking about Charlie. It turned out to be a scout from Manchester City.</p>
              <p>“They
              invited us to go and watch City against Arsenal and when we walked in
              one of the coaches asked me if this was the boy everyone is talking
              about.”</p>
              <p>Soon after, Robbie’s wife Sarah was approached by a
              scout from United while watching Charlie play and then a Liverpool
              scout got in touch.</p>
              <p>“Next thing my agent was calling me to say
              Everton had called to set up a trial with them,” said Robbie, who’s
              currently playing for Championship side Derby County.</p>
              <p>“He goes
              to United’s development centre every week now and he’s absolutely
              loving it. They won’t decide if they want to put him into the Academy
              until he’s seven or eight so we don’t want to build his hopes up too
              much.</p>
              <p>“Most boys his age just chase the ball around but he always seems to find himself a bit of space and time on the ball.”</p>
              <p>Savage,
              whose career started at Manchester United before playing for Crewe
              Alexandra, Leicester City, Birmingham City and Blackburn Rovers,
              insisted he never pushed his son into being a footballer.</p>
              <p>The
              39-times capped former Wales international said: “I watch games and see
              other parents screaming at their children but I’ve always just stayed
              in the background and let him get on with it.</p>
              <p>“My wife was the first one to take him along to football so it’s all down to her.”</p>
              <p>“We’ve
              got two goals in the back garden and he wants to play first to 20
              nearly every night – and he’s starting to beat me,” joked 34-year-old
              Savage.</p>
              <p>“Charlie is obsessed with football. My mum says he is
              worse than I was at his age. He knows every player in the Premiership
              and constantly watches Sky Sports, after doing his homework of course!”</p>
              <p>Savage
              said he is proud Charlie has got the chances for himself and not had
              any special treatment because his dad was a Premiership player.</p>
              <p>He
              added: “Obviously I would love to see him run out at Old Trafford but
              if he ended up at Wrexham I would be happy. I keep out of it because I
              don’t want to put any pressure on the lad, it’s entirely up to him.</p>
              <p>“To be honest I wouldn’t even mind if he wanted to be a builder or a doctor, as long as he is healthy and happy.”</p>
              <p>Dad Robbie said he will give his son plenty of advice about the ups – and downs – of being a footballer.</p>
              <p>The
              controversial character has never been far from the headlines during
              his career so knows how to deal with life away from the pitch.</p>
              <p>He
              declared: “I’ve seen it all in my career, getting released from a club
              like Manchester United and then working my way back into the
              Premiership.</p>
              <p>“I’ve won player of the year awards and been
              booed at every ground I’ve visited! But Charlie takes it all in his
              stride because being around football is so natural to him.</p>
              <p>“When I take him up to Blackburn, Roque [Santa Cruz] and Benni [McCarthy] absolutely love him and he has a good laugh with them.</p>
              <p>“The lifestyle of a footballer is superb so I would no reservations about him becoming one.”</p>
