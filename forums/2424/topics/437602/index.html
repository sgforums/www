              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>But after a couple of high-profile mistakes in his first few games for United, Ferguson spent much of Friday wondering whether to replace De Gea with Denmark keeper Anders Lindegaard at the Reebok Stadium.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Ferguson is concerned about the physical threat carried by Owen Coyle's Bolton side and thinks that De Gea may benefit from a day out of the spotlight ahead of United's game in Lisbon in the Champions League on Wednesday. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>However, leaving De Gea out now would represent a blow to the former Atletico Madrid man and Ferguson was wondering what effect it may have on his confidence. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Meanwhile, midfielder Tom Cleverley is expected to be rested on Saturday</span></p>

              <p>Owen Coyle's men had planned to target the slightly built Spanish keeper with an aerial assault led by Kevin Davies.</p>
              <p>But now Anders Lindegaard is lined up to make his Prem debut in United's goal.</p>
              <p>De Gea has looked uncertain in the air in the early games and has also let in some soft strikes.</p>
              <p>Boss Alex Ferguson still has full confidence his £17.8million signing from Atletico Madrid will be his long-term No 1.</p>
              <p>But SunSport understands the Scot is ready to go for the more powerfully built Danish international Lindegaard, 27, this afternoon.</p>
              <p>Ferguson is convinced De Gea is still learning and will grow into the English game.</p>
              <p>He said: "I think that, at 20, he's young for a goalkeeper but he's long-term for us. He will improve as he goes along. I have no issues with him at all."</p>

              <p><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson</strong></span><strong> is sufficiently concerned about the aerial threat of </strong><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Bolton Wanderers</strong></span><strong> to consider resting his young goalkeeper, David de Gea, when </strong><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span><strong> travel to the Reebok Stadium on Saturday.</strong></p>
              <p>Uppermost in Ferguson's mind is that Bolton may play a deliberately direct game to unsettle a 20-year-old who is still learning about the Premier League and has been guilty of conceding soft goals in three of his four matches for United.</p>
              <p>Ferguson is going to discuss the matter further with his coaching staff and will not make up his mind until the morning. However, his thinking goes in tandem with Anders Lindegaard's remarks to the Norwegian press this week that he would get his first start of the season "maybe faster than you think".</p>
              <p>Ferguson has already decided that De Gea, the £18.3m summer signing from Atlético Madrid, is the club's first-choice goalkeeper, sticking by the Spain Under-21 international after his mistakes in the Community Shield against Manchester City and, most notably, the league game at West Bromwich Albion.</p>
              <p>Lindegaard has demonstrated he is a capable deputy, one of the club's more impressive performers on the pre-season tour of the US. He is taller by a couple of inches and that is in Ferguson's thinking as he prepares to face a Bolton attack spearheaded by Kevin Davies, a player whose physical approach has long been a source of irritation to the United manager.</p>
              <p>Ferguson, nonetheless, spoke on Friday as if De Gea would start, going as far as to say <span style="color: #000000;">the referee, Andre Marriner, needed to give the Spaniard more protection</span> from the opposition players. "I don't think he got the protection he should at West Brom but he dealt with that part very well. He made a mistake with the goal but, other than that, on every occasion they put the ball on top of him he dealt with it. As I said about [Peter] Schmeichel, he had the same experience and saw it through and it won't do [De Gea] any harm."</p>
              <p>Davies has already spoken of giving the teenage defender Phil Jones "a going over" but Ferguson said he was unconcerned.</p>
              <p>"He [Davies] is a difficult customer, a physical forward, we know that. He uses his physique well but Phil Jones has shown he is quite capable of dealing with different aspects of opponents.</p>
              <p>"I'm sure he must have played against him last year and he probably played against the likes of [Didier] Drogba and [Peter] Crouch. It's not as if he's lacking experience of playing against players of that type. I'm sure he will be all right."</p>

Also in the Bolton squad are two loan signings, Chelsea's Gaël Kakuta and Dedryck Boyata from Manchester City. United, again without the injured Rafael da Silva and Nemanja Vidic, are expected to give Javier Hernández his first start of the season, in place of Danny Welbeck.</p>

              <p><strong><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Wayne Rooney left the Reebok Stadium clutching another match ball as Manchester United showed that the best way to deal with bullies is to stand up to them. </span></strong><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Bolton tried to rough up the champions in traditional fashion and one of their uglier challenges - by Kevin Davies - left young Tom Cleverley with a suspected broken foot, which could keep him out for three months. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>But the intimidating approach, while incensing United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, failed to upset his young players. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>By the time they had torn Bolton apart with a free-flowing masterclass, Owen Coyle's men were left kicking at shadows, thanks to a Rooney hat-trick - to follow the one he scored in the 8-2 demolition of Arsenal a fortnight ago - and two goals from Javier Hernandez. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>United have scored 18 in their opening four games of the season, a Premier League record and the best by any club in the top flight since Wolves in 1947. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Rooney has eight on his own, more than any other club bar Manchester City. He has now scored seven hat-tricks for United, the same as Sir Bobby Charlton. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>And he is only the fourth striker - following Les Ferdinand, Ian Wright and Didier Drogba - to score back-to-back hat-tricks in the Premier League era.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Best of all, he is reunited with Hernandez, whose start to the season had been delayed by concussion suffered on tour in the US. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Ferguson said: 'Their partnership was excellent, they were a constant threat and caused our opponents big problems.' </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Hernandez was just as glowing in his tribute to Rooney.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'Anyone can play with Wayne, he is world-class, he can do anything,' said the Mexican.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Arguably, though, even the two strikers were overshadowed by a peerless display from Phil Jones, usually a centre-half but yesterday shining as a marauding right-back, who set up Rooney's first two goals. </span></span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>It was the perfect riposte from United, who had to overcome questionable Bolton tactics. </span></strong><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Jones was winded by Paul Robinson in the opening minutes and skipper Davies put Cleverley out of action with a bad challenge from behind, then put his boot down on Patrice Evra's foot.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>By that stage, Ferguson was arguing with the fourth official about the lack of protection, but his players ultimately shut Bolton up by outplaying them.</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Rooney said: 'We always know Bolton is a difficult place to come. We got an early goal and kicked on. It could have been more. It was my first start with Chicharito and it's great that we both scored.' </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The pre-match talk had been of how United's 20-year-old goalkeeper, David de Gea, would cope with an aerial onslaught. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>But the real issue was how Bolton were repeatedly opened up by United, with England's goalscoring defender Gary Cahill and veteran goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen as powerless as anyone. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>United had seen neighbours City go top a couple of hours earlier with a 3-0 win over Wigan, meaning they had to win by three to stay ahead of Roberto Mancini's men. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Five minutes in, the fleet-footed Nani put in a low cross and while Jaaskelainen and Cahill hesitated, Hernandez hooked it in. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Bolton's response saw shots by Ivan Klasnic and Mark Davies blocked by Jonny Evans and Rooney. De Gea then palmed away a shot by Klasnic. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>But the harder Bolton tackled, the better United became. Mark Davies joined namesake Kevin in the book for flattening Nani, and with alarming gaps developing down Bolton's left, Jones surged forward and crossed for Rooney to score from a few yards. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Jones then instigated United's third, cutting in and releasing a shot which hit Jaaskelainen's boot and fell kindly for Rooney to tap in the rebound. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>United scored a fourth on the hour mark. Nani could have won a penalty as he was felled in the area but as the ball fell loose to Michael Carrick, his cross-shot was turned in from eight yards by Hernandez. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Former Liverpool striker David Ngog came on for his Bolton debut after 65 minutes but Rooney soon completed his hat-trick, taking a square pass from Nani and burying it first-time low past Jaaskelainen from 18 yards. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Bolton boss Owen Coyle said: 'There was never five goals between the teams. I thought the margin was hard. But United are ruthless.' He can say that again. </span></span></p>

              <p>No need match lah, Barca cannot do squat when they get pressed, but everyone's afraid of them so they sit back and absorb, and then Barca get full possession most of the time if you noticed. Then, they unlock the defence. Rooney is useless alone up front.<br><br>See how things go, Sneijder will be more likely to jump ship in January if they lose more games in Serie A and get knocked out of CL. Watching Goetze now against Arsenal, very talented. We will see January signings, even if we don't get far in CL this season.<br><br>Improving the squad as a whole, just saying we still need a defender and midfielder to cope with the season on all fronts, and to have a better chance against Barca. Our 'new look speed game' is already affecting some players, every week someone will kenna, short or long term, of course we will be screwed if every game someone goes out injured.</p>
              <p>To be honest, I only care for the BPL and maybe the FA/Carling cup this season, let the team mold together, the youngsters improve and get more signings during the Jan window, we may be good enough for the BPL, but I don't know about European teams, let alone Barca.</p>

              <p>The best chance for Man United to win the UCL is to meet Barcelona in the semi-final over 2 legs, away at Nou Camp, then at home at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>For me, the above way is United's best bet of winning the UCL cos if they meet Barcelona in the final again, in just a single match, United stand no chance at all.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Barca has one of the most inconsistent defences ever, and it shows when their opponents press hard. Using last CL final as an example, and all their big games, minus the El Clasico's, and just like Milan did last night, push and press and mess Barca up for like 10-15 mins, get that early goal and then park bus.<br><br>Which never works because the longer Barca have possession, it's only a matter of time til they convert. It's not like United isn't capable of pressing the full 90, but that CL game, after the opening 15 mins it was just painful to watch.</p></div>
