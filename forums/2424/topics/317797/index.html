              <p><strong>Louis Saha last night admitted that he fears his Manchester United career is over. As United prepare for a Champions League Final date with Chelsea next Wednesday, Saha knows that a place among the substitutes is the best he can hope for. And the injury-plagued France striker conceded that his time at Old Trafford could well be coming to an end.</strong></p>
              <p>Saha said: "The future isn't in my hands, but I'll try to make it happen for me. "I know this could be my last game, and I would understand if the manager went for another striker. It would be painful if he did because I love the club so much. "I can't speak about my future too much really now, though. It's about the club. The main thing is to win the Champions League and maybe that will change things."</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson paid Fulham £12million for Saha in 2004 and believed he would be the natural successor to Ruud van Nistelrooy. More recently he hoped the 29-year-old would offer him a different option from Carlos Tevez, Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney. But a succession of knee and hamstring injuries have sidelined Saha as United have won back-to-back Premier League titles and progressed to the Champions League Final.</p>
              <p>Now Ferguson is ready to sell after growing tired of the player's problems. As Saha prepares to leave Old Trafford, Tevez announced that he is ready to sign a permanent contract with United. He arrived on a two-year loan following the third-party ownership issues that dogged his time at West Ham, but now United officials are investigating the best way to formalise the deal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Team-mate Patrice Evra also remains confident he will agree a new deal, but Mikael Silvestre could be in line for a move to his boyhood club Bordeaux. Silvestre, 30, has made just five appearances this season due to injuries and Evra's impressive form, and says he would welcome the chance to join up with his old United team-mate Laurent Blanc.</p>
              <p>"Bordeaux are the club of my heart," said Silvestre. "I know Laurent well and I've spoken with him about joining since last year. "A deal is not out of the question, and we need to give it some serious thought."</p>
              <p>The FA took the first steps towards charging Avram Grant with improper conduct yesterday when they wrote to the Chelsea boss asking him to explain his remarks about Premier League refereeing. Grant called Steve Bennett's integrity into question after United won 2-0 at Wigan to clinch the title, and also accused Mike Dean of "changing the result" when Chelsea lost at Old Trafford earlier in the season.</p>
              <p>Roman Abramovich has bought 500 tickets for Chelsea's Russian fans to watch the final in Moscow on Wednesday night. With black market tickets costing up to 25 times the monthly salary of an average Russian worker, Abramovich has paid out around £50,000 to ensure they can see the match.</p>

              <p>But i must say he did do well for United last season... Without him for the first 6 months, United wouldn't have won the Premier League title last season... So give him some credit...</p>
