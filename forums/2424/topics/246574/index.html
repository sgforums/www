Skipper Neville, 32, has 18 months left on his existing deal. But Old Trafford chiefs are convinced the England right-back still has plenty left in the tank.</strong><br><br>SunSport understands he will be offered a new three-year agreement in line with his reported Â£70,000-a-week wages. Neville is missing from UnitedÂ’s line-up at present with ankle ligament damage and had to sit out last nightÂ’s Champions League quarter-final clash against Roma.<br><br>The defender has been at Old Trafford since he was 12 and has played 540 first-team games. He is now seen as a direct link between the dressing room and United boss Alex Ferguson.<br><br>NevilleÂ’s loyalty means he will stay on the playing staff until he is 35. And there are suggestions he could remain in a coaching capacity when he finally hangs up his boots. It is understood Fergie made a series of recommendations to the United board at the beginning of February and his main priority was retaining his old guard.<br><br>Ryan Giggs has already been offered a contract extension and both Paul Scholes and Ole Solskjaer are poised to follow suit. An insider said: Â“Gary has never made any secret of his love for the club. Â“His fitness levels are still very high and the manager sees him as pivotal to bringing along his current generation of players.Â”<br><br>Neville could boost his coffers even further with a lucrative testimonial in the next couple of years.<br><br></div>

He has done quite a good job over at Villa Park and i've mentioned many times before, O'Shea at best, is only a good benched utility man. Suitable for those 70 min substitution or sub for injury.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Or we can try Brown on the right and Vidic back at central postition when hs is fit.<br><br>Cheers.<br>CK</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yea, the team indeed misses Vidic, or it could just be a temporary unstettlement with 2 important players getting injured at the same time , Park &amp; Vidic. There is a void in the central defence whenever Heinze moves forward, and Brown/Rio does not seem to have enough pace to cover them during counter attacks, tis will be our weakest link and Roma is gonna exploit them when they come to O.T. The midfield seems lost in Portsmouth, but i'm not surprised since the midfield does seem lost when it should count most and we have to rely on the magic of Ronaldo/Rooney to save the day for us which unfortunately didn't happen during Portsmouth match. It also shows the inability to open space by our mifielders when Portsmouth tightened their defence with their 5 man defence.. something which we needed in Park.<br><br>However back to the topic, Gary still has a few more years to go and no one can doubt his loyalty and passion to the Red Devils, he fully deserve or at least deserved to be treated in this manner. at least he doesn't go out shouting at the press 'give me a farking raise or i'll leave' not like some blues suckers (and they say there are loyal to the club...)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>No one on the pitch deserves the armband more than Gary does and rightfully he will have it back when he returns. Although he might be getting old and slower, but he still make threatening runs along the flanks which compliments well with Ronaldo/Giggs/Park, because there seem to be an understanding between them like Evra. And no one can deny Gary makes decent crosses whenever he gets into the position better than wingers does.<br><br>Age is not an issue for his extension, its his leadership and future upcoming right backs would be good to learn more from him, especially Brown etc..<br><br>Lets not slack him and be ungrateful like Madrid did to their ex-captain, Gary has not done really anything wrong imo. and hes being a fan and playing for United even before most of us got old enough t ounderstand what football is <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Chhers everyone and have a good Monday~ <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
