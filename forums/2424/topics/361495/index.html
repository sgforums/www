              <p><strong>As he prepares for
              potentially his final game as a Manchester United player, Carlos Tevez
              has once again reiterated how ‘loved’ he feels at Old Trafford.</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.setanta.com/Global/Images/sport/football/2008-2009/premier_league/man-utd/tevez_carlos_dummies480.jpg" alt="" width="479" height="270"></p>
              <p><strong>Tevez’s future is still far from resolved as MSI and United look to thrash out a deal suitable for all parties.</strong></p>
              <p>Manchester City and Liverpool are thought to be waiting in the wings
              should Sir Alex Ferguson be unwilling to fork out that lofty price tag
              for a player who the majority of Old Trafford are desperate to see stay
              put.</p>
              <p>However, the impasse as yet shows no sign of being breached, leaving
              Tevez once again fending off questions about what will happen after
              Wednesday’s Champions League final against Barcelona.</p>
              <p>“To be honest, I don’t want to think about it,” he told Zoo
              magazine. “We have a great chance of winning our second Premier League
              and European Cup double in a row, and that’s what my focus is on.</p>
              <p>“I don’t want anything to distract me from my football, and my future will be sorted out in the summer.</p>
              <p>“The fans at this club have made me feel very welcome and loved, and
              I want them to know how much it means for me. Their support means
              everything to me, and we want to give them another European Cup this
              year.</p>
              <p>“I want to win the European Cup first for the club and the fans.
              Then we will talk about the future. I really like it here and want to
              be part of the success.</p>
              <p>“I think many people consider Man United and Barça the two top teams
              in Europe at the moment. With the players we both have, it’s true it
              could be a very beautiful final to watch.</p>
              <p>“It’s not good to be frightened, so they don’t frighten us. But we
              know how good they are and we know we need to show them lots of
              respect. But I don’t expect us to change the way we play football for
              anybody.”</p>

              <h1 class="ss-header hstyle2 main-headline">Gill issues Tevez warning</h1>
              <p><span class="main-content">
              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Manchester United
              chief executive David Gill has warned Carlos Tevez he will struggle to
              achieve the same level of success away from Old Trafford. </strong></p>
              <p class="ss-text-bold"><img src="http://img.skysports.com/09/05/218x298/CarlosTevezcelebrates_2291757.jpg" alt="" width="218" height="298"></p>
              <p><strong>The Argentina international striker's two-year loan
              stay with the Red Devils comes to an end this summer and Tevez has
              admitted he expects to leave the club after playing more of a bit-part
              role this season.</strong></p>
              <p>United are confident they already have an
              agreement in place with Tevez's third-party owners to secure his
              services on a permanent basis with a fee already negotiated.</p>
              <p>Gill
              is currently with the United squad in Rome ahead of Wednesday's UEFA
              Champions League final against Barcelona as Sir Alex Ferguson's side
              chase a fourth major trophy of the season.</p>
              <p>And the United supremo
              believes all players should be motivated by the desire to win
              silverware and feature in showpiece events such as the European
              showdown.</p>
              <h4>Medals</h4>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">He told <em>Sky Sports News</em>: "We have to understand what Carlos wants. It is difficult to leave Manchester United.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">"What
              we can hopefully achieve with this squad is hopefully there for
              everyone to see. It is these big events and these big occasions that
              players want to play in.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">"It is about medals, being here and
              being surrounded by this. Rarely do players at Manchester United think
              solely about the money, they think about competing in the biggest games
              at the end of the season.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">"What we try to do is make people feel part of the family and they understand it.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">"The
              game is littered with players who have left us, for whatever reason,
              who say after Manchester United it is downhill. Hopefully they get the
              right advice, they understand that and make the right decision."</span></strong></p>
              <h5>Unique</h5>
              <p>Gill
              remains confident that Tevez's future can be resolved in the coming
              weeks and has no problems dealing with the group who own the player's
              registration, rather than a club.</p>
              <p>He added: "It is unique, but I
              don't think that necessarily makes it more tricky. We're clear we've
              got an agreement with them, with the company, that if we want to
              acquire the option we have to pay a certain sum.</p>
              <p>"In that respect
              it is arguably easier because it is a fixed fee. It is not like they
              can negotiate for weeks. It is a fixed fee.</p>
              <p>"He's out of contract
              on the 30th of June and he will want to understand where he is playing
              next season well in advance of going on holiday and having a
              well-deserved break.</p>
              <p>"It is in everyone's interests to be resolved and I think it will be pretty quickly."</p>
              <h5>Ronaldo</h5>
              <p>Gill
              again moved to confirm that Cristiano Ronaldo would be staying at Old
              Trafford, with long-term suitors Real Madrid recently issuing a denial
              to suggestions that a deal for the Portuguese ace was already in place.</p>
              <p>He said: "It has not been discussed at all. You can see what Cristiano has said himself, it has been very positive.</p>
              <p>"We have had no contact whatsoever either through the player, his agent or any other club."</p>
