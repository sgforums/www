              <p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Darren Fletcher is hoping Paul Scholes will make a welcome return to the Manchester United first-team fold in the near future. </strong></p>
              <p>The former England international has been sidelined since undergoing a knee operation in September.</p>
              <p>The
              33-year-old is believed to be progressing well in his rehabilitation,
              though, and could make his return to action in a UEFA Champions League
              contest with Aalborg on 10th December.</p>
              <p>Fletcher accepts that a
              fit-again Scholes will threaten his place in Sir Alex Ferguson's side,
              but believes his talented team-mate is integral to the Red Devils'
              defence of their domestic and European crowns.</p>
              <p>"Paul is still the best midfielder in Europe - if not the world," said the Scotland international.</p>
              <p>"Nobody
              can control a game like he can. When he comes back from injury, he will
              be a huge asset for United and everyone at the club is looking forward
              to that."</p>
              <p><span class="main-content">
              </span></p><h4>Settled</h4>
              <p>Fletcher has established himself as a key man for United this term, putting the problems of his past firmly behind him.</p>
              <p>Limited opportunities at Old Trafford over the last few years had led to speculation linking him with a move elsewhere.</p>
              <p>However, having recently penned a new four-year contract with the club, Fletcher insists he is going nowhere.</p>
              <p>"Manchester United are a great club and I don't want to go anywhere else," he added.</p>
              <p>"I just go into every game and do my best in the hope it is enough to keep me in the team."</p>
              <h5>Adventurous</h5>
              <p>Fletcher
              believes his progression will be better aided under the watchful gaze
              of Ferguson, and credits the Scot for helping him to add goals to his
              attacking arsenal this season.</p>
              <p>"It's great to add goals to my game," said the combative midfielder.</p>
              <p>"I would love to sneak a few more as well but the most important thing is actually getting into the box and making the chances.</p>
              <p>"The manager has been very encouraging and I have a lot more confidence to try my luck.</p>
              <p>"In the past, I may have been a little too worried about holding my position and watching for counter-attacks.</p>
              <p>"But now I am more selfish and a bit more adventurous."</p>
