Villa are on the equal longest current winless run in the Premiership of six matches, as they prepare to face the League leaders in the pre-Christmas fixture. They will not want to hand too many presents to United, as defeat could see the Midlanders slipping out of the top half of the table, following an impressive opening to the campaign.<br><br>This is set to be a fascinating tactical duel between two of the most successful managers in British football, Martin O'Neill and Sir Alex Ferguson, and pits this season's Premiership specialists against the most prolific winners.

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Don't make me mark Ronaldo</strong></span><br><br>OLOF MELLBERG is desperate to mark Wayne Rooney tomorrow Â— because it will be a lot easier than tracking Cristiano Ronaldo. Aston VillaÂ’s Swedish international has played the majority of his 201 games for the club as a central defender.<br><br>But with no other cover for the injured Mark Delaney and Aaron Hughes, he has spent the last seven Premiership games filling in as an emergency right-back. Yet the prospect of being shown a clean pair of heels by Manchester UnitedÂ’s flying winger at Villa Park has left him sweating. And he has hinted to boss Martin OÂ’Neill that now might be a good time for normal service to be resumed.<br><br>Mellberg, 29, said: Â“ItÂ’s been all right playing at right-back but I obviously prefer playing in the centre because IÂ’m more comfortable there. Â“I used to play right-back for Sweden when I first broke into the international team. Â“But that was a long time ago and I hadnÂ’t played there for quite some time before this season.<br><br>Â“I guess IÂ’ll be marking either Ryan Giggs or Cristiano Ronaldo on Saturday. But IÂ’d rather it was Wayne Rooney because I played against him in the World Cup in Germany last summer.<br><br>Â“Giggs and Ronaldo are both world-class players. But thereÂ’s something extra special about Ronaldo. Â“HeÂ’s very quick and skilful with the ball at his feet and wins a lot of free-kicks.Â”<br><br>Despite UnitedÂ’s surprise defeat at West Ham last weekend, Mellberg is still tipping Alex FergusonÂ’s side to edge out Chelsea in the title race. The Old Trafford giantsÂ’ nine-point lead at the top of the Premiership has been cut to just two.<br><br>But Mellberg said: Â“I just think United have been very impressive this season and I fancy them to win the league. But this is a good game for us on Saturday because we need to get our home form going again Â— we can play this one with no pressure.Â”<br><br><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/Ron.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In a rare moment of seriousness from Ferguson in an otherwise light-hearted look forward to tomorrow's trip to Aston Villa, Fergie said, Although the disappointment of last weekend's defeat at West Ham remained fresh in his mind, the United boss seemed more determined to emphasise his club's hospitality at providing mince pies and wine for the assembled media than worrying about Chelsea reducing the gap at the Premiership summit to two points.<br><br>However, Ferguson remains calm under pressure, pointing out the championship is won over a nine-month season, not one weekend. "We are here for the long haul," he said. "We have youth on our side and we have strength on our side.<br><br>"Historically, we do okay in the second half of the season so we should be pleased to get to this point in the position we are. "You could be over-critical and say we threw three points away against West Ham but that doesn't get you anywhere. What is done is done.<br><br>"We have to make sure we get back on target. The next game is an obvious target. Ferguson refused to get embroiled in a personal debate over Mourinho's angry 'yellow-card gestures' at Everton and Newcastle over the past week, claiming he had not seen them.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Fergie wants United response</strong><br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson is confident Manchester United will bounce back from the defeat to West Ham when they face Aston Villa this Saturday. Chelsea cut the gap at the top to two points last weekend as United slipped to a surprise 1-0 loss at Upton Park, but Ferguson is keen not to dwell on the past.<br><br>He has challenged his side to respond to the setback, and predicts that the title race will go right down to the wire. "We have to accept in a championship race there is going to be a disappointment along the way," Ferguson told Sky Sports News.<br><br>"That's the making of your team to recover from these things. We've done it many times so tomorrow is a nice challenge for us. "I think we're here for the long haul. I think the league this season will be the long haul and that's a good thing.<br><br>Henrik Larsson has been training with United this week ahead of his three-month loan spell, and Ferguson has been delighted with his sharpness.<br><br>"I am pleased. His fitness levels were better than I expected and he's done very well this week. His sharpness was good and his finishing was good," he praised.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What an unbelievable screamer from Scholesy.. Excellent goal! See! Its so much better when they pass the ball around and be patient.. Almost scored a goal from fantastic team movement and passing of ball.. What for play long ball? Lose possesion only like just now Ferdinand ruin it all by trying a long ball which goes nowhere but to the opponents and Man U lost possession just like that.. Senseless.. PJS is a damn brilliant player I love the way he turn into the space between 2 players just now.. Giggs scold Saha for an overhit pass then minutes after that he also mishit a simple ball passed directly to him.. With all respects to Giggs, but I think his form now doesn't deserve a starting place in the team...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For the 1st half, I feel the players din find the odd formation well.  Park i understand, after a long lapse from injury.  Giggs on right, Ronaldo on left?  Quite uncommon.<br><br>I thought the 5-midfield looks a bit stifling, and I din see the "famous" overlapping attacks that overwhelmed Blackburn &amp; Bolton.  And to Aston Villa's credit, they held on very well.<br><br>Its only in the 2nd half that they changed a bit &amp; showed more attack.  Yeah, I agree Giggs is abit jaded but I think that's because he held back in view of the long fixtures list coming up.  Even Saha looks marked out.<br><br>But alarming thing was that the usually rock-liked Vidic was having a hard time handling Abonglahor....hmmm this must improve if they are going to put some distance with Chelsea.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it was a good move by martin o'neil, he play sutton as the roving striker in stopping scholes, and the forward against vidic, using his pace.<br><br>now, we won cause Villa couldn't substain their pace and effort and MUFC wore them down.<br><br>Against a more determined team with a bit more fight, we may not win so easily.<br><br>Again, I applaud SAF for playing park in getting match fitness, and resting Rooney. For he is rotating players for a rest.<br><br>For me, Fletcher played well, Ronaldo out of their world, he linked well with Evra.<br><br>One thing, while Evra got pace to get back, GN seems abit caught when he wonder too far, and that forces Rio to cover and Vidic to face any other attackers.<br>Really worrysome..<br><br>And seeing Giggs playing the roving AM, he is not as effective going forward.<br><br>Rem, chelsea came back against us, when they plugged Essien as right back, and that Giggs instead of going forward, stayed in MF, to cover against FL, and MB. allowing essien to come forward and destroy teams...<br><br></div>
