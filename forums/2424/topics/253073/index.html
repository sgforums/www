            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://i15.tinypic.com/4p2j5hj.jpg"><br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson used his press conference on Monday to heap more praise on his title-winning team and ponder additions to it in the summer.<br><br>"This title is the team's greatest achievement to date simply because it's a relatively new team and really it's their first attempt at winning a title together," said Sir Alex.<br><br>"That's why we're all encouraged, I think this team will get better."<br><br>As for the prospect of players being added to the champions in the summer, Sir Alex said: "We have outlined three targets (ourselves) and David Gill is aware of them.<br><br>"We identify players as quietly as we can so we can do things quickly, because when there is competition, it costs. Chelsea paid Â£27m for Michael Essien. They can outbid us all."<br><br>Transfer targets like Essien, Arjen Robben and one or two others may have ended up in London rather than Manchester but Sir Alex still made some key signings in the four years between his eighth and ninth Premiership titles. And many of these additions were at the forefront on his mind on Monday as he reflected on the fruits of his team-building.<br><br>"We had a good foundation (from 2003) in players like Giggs, Scholes, Neville, Solskjaer and Ferdinand. Then we brought some new players in like Heinze, Vidic, Evra, Carrick, Rooney and Ronaldo, Park... they gave us a far more balanced and powerful squad.<br><br>"Vidic (for example) has been the best centre-half in the country this season. He's been absolutely outstanding. You could see the difference his partnership with Rio Ferdinand made to us on Saturday against Manchester City. It was absolutely peerless, a fantastic performance by both of them.<br><br>"That foundation of strength in the central defensive position is something we've been wanting for a long time, going back to Pallister and Bruce. We've had some good combinations but none lasted as long as hopefully these two will do."<br><br>Sir Alex was asked about his chances of monopolising the Premiership title, just as he did in 1993-94, 1996-97 and 1999-01.<br><br>"For us to dominate the league again will be a difficult task," he replied.<br><br>"I expect Arsenal, Liverpool and obviously Chelsea to add to their squads in the summer. I thought the signings of Shevchenko and Ballack were really designed to win Chelsea the European Cup but they were, in fact, involved on all four fronts until almost the very end.<br><br>"It tells you a lot about their strength in depth, and how difficult it will be for us next year."<br></div>
