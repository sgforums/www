            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/09_04/tevez_468x676.jpg"><br><br><strong>When Wayne Rooney say it's an "honour" to play for this Manchester United team, you know Sir Alex Ferguson is developing something special at Old Trafford. Nobody understands better than Sir Alex that the club's history has been built on exciting young superstars and yesterday, the Theatre of Dreams got a tantalising glimpse of the next generation. A front five of Rooney, Cristiano Ronaldo, Carlos Tevez, Nani and Anderson <span style="color: red;">Â— average age 21 Â—</span> tore apart struggling Middlesbrough in almost cruel fashion. At times, United's forwards seemed to take turns to show off their precocious talents as if in a television talent contest. </strong><br><br>Nani provided the best individual moment, a dribble past two defenders followed by a 30-yard powerdrive for United's first goal. But even that was overtaken by the third Â— a delicious piece of interplay between Tevez and Rooney that ended with the Argentine netting the first of his double. Rooney also scored, for the seventh consecutive game for club and country, as United went top with their eighth straight League win and 11th victory out of 12 games in all competitions. It was also the first time they have scored four goals in four consecutive games in 100 years.<br><br>Behind the statistics lay some breathtaking football. No wonder Rooney was moved to say: "It is an honour to play for this team. Some of the football is brilliant. It's the type I like to play." Better teams than Boro would have been put to the sword by United in this form. Their 55th-minute third goal is sure to be repeated on television for years. Anderson's chipped pass was cushioned first-time by Tevez into the path of Rooney. The striker took a forward stride but instead of shooting, he wrongfooted the defence with a backheel that gave his Argentine team-mate the chance to curl a finish past Mark Schwarzer. "That goal summed their partnership up," said Ferguson. "It was all about vision, quick-thinking and courage. Rooney could have taken an extra touch but he knew Tevez would be making a run so he back-heeled it. A fantastic goal. When they develop, you will see a complete partnership."<br><br>Rooney seemed almost as pleased to be a provider as a scorer. "The relationship with Carlos is going well. He is a very clever player, very intelligent. I was delighted he got two goals. I'm also scoring goals. That is my job, to try and score in every game." No wonder Boro manager Gareth Southgate was fatalistic by the end. His side have picked up just one point in 18 and will slip into the bottom three today if Tottenham get a point at home to Blackburn.<br><br>"We know these kinds of results can happen at United," he said. "We tried to come here and throw a few punches of our own, but they are a class side." Ferguson had to pick a team without the injured Paul Scholes, Michael Carrick, Gary Neville, Louis Saha and Patrice Evra but welcomed back Owen Hargreaves from his knee injury.<br><br>The opening goal was all about Nani, however. The 20-year-old flyer left Gary O'Neil and Lee Cattermole for dead before unleashing a 30-yard shot that left Schwarzer clutching at thin air. "A thunderbolt," was Ferguson's accurate assessment. "It's an amazing sequence," said Ferguson. "We were winning 1-0 earlier in the season, now we are scoring four goals in every game." The last time United went on a scoring run like this was 1907. It may be a little harder to get four goals next Saturday. Their opponents are Arsenal.<br></div>

Tevez and Rooney</span><br><br><strong>LIONEL MESSI is in awe of the Carlos Tevez and Wayne Rooney partnership Â— and believes it will only get better. England hitman Rooney has scored six in his last five Manchester United games while Tevez has come to life with three in four.</strong><br><br>Fellow Argentine ace Messi has been watching closely and feels the duo could lead Alex FergusonÂ’s men to Champions League glory this season. The Barcelona star said: Â“Carlos is making a big difference for Manchester United this season.<br><br>Â“His partnership with Rooney is already something special and I think it will only get better. Â“Although they play and move similarly to one another on the pitch, they are going to help Manchester United a lot. They will scare defenders everywhere.<br><br>Â“Those who play the game well understand each other immediately. Good players always manage to play well together. Â“Barcelona and United are both great teams Â— and are real candidates for the Champions League.Â”<br><br>Tevez, 23, took time to settle following his summer move from West Ham but he is now starting to show his true form. And pal Messi added: Â“Carlos is always in a good mood and never gets mad. If he is on the bench, he just encourages his team-mates.<br><br>Â“Carlos is also a great singer. The name of his band is Piola Vago. When we were at Copa America, we shared the same room and the music was louder than at a disco.Â”<br><br></div>
