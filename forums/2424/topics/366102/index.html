              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>This morning’s papers are awash with talk of Luis Antonio Valencia’s imminent arrival at Old Trafford. <br><br></strong>Okay, so he’s not of Kaka, Ribery or Benzema proportions, but his acquisition, if indeed the press are correct and United beat off competition for the Ecuadorian’s signature, could well prove to be yet another managerial masterstroke by Sir Alex.<br><br>A lot of fans are crying out for big-name signings, especially with Cristiano Ronaldo and Carlos Tevez heading elsewhere, but surely the £80million United will receive from Real Madrid for the Portuguese is better spent on a couple of burgeoning talents than one over-priced “galactico”.<br><br>In fact, United rarely plump for established superstars (Berbatov was the exception in recent years), instead preferring to cast the net at an earlier age. It’s a tactic that’s so often reaped benefits for the club, largely because younger players find it easier to adapt to a new playing style and are eager to soak up the experience from United’s older heads. Stop for a minute and just imagine what an impressionable young winger could learn from Ryan Giggs.<br><br>A player at the beginning of his career is also less likely to feel the weight of expectation or be hounded by a fickle media demanding instant success. That leaves him free to express himself on the pitch and enjoy his football.<br><br>Of course, Valencia is no naive newcomer. For the past two seasons he’s consistently been Wigan Athletic’s best performer. Fans at the JJB Stadium have grown accustomed to watching the skilful Ecuadorian tear down the wing and whip dangerous crosses into the opposition penalty area. United fans will hold similar memories from his outstanding performance here at Old Trafford in January when he terrorised the Reds’ defence in an awesome second-half display. He’s not work-shy either: Valencia tracks back unselfishly and isn’t afraid of getting stuck into a tackle.<br><br>And remember, he also possesses something the likes of Ribery and Benzema don’t: experience in England. Not all players adapt to life in the Premier League – and, to be fair, Valencia hardly wowed Wigan fans when he first arrived on loan from Villarreal in 2006 – but the youngster has now well and truly settled and understands the rigours and intricacies of the English game.<br><br>That’s all very well, but can he handle life at Old Trafford? Standing out in the crowd at Wigan, you might say, doesn’t exactly equate to setting the world on fire at the Theatre of Dreams. <br><br>I agree: it doesn’t. But in June 2006, with the eyes of the footballing world fixed upon a little tournament in Germany called the World Cup, Valencia shone at just 20 years of age, helping Ecuador qualify for the second phase of the finals for the first time in their history. His performances were also noted by astute fans and at one point he was the overwhelming favourite – ahead of even Ronaldo and Lionel Messi – to pick up the prestigious Best Young Player award. (The honour eventually went to Germany’s Lukas Podolski.)<br><br>At the time, Valencia's national team coach, Luis Suarez, said: “He's doing very well right now, but he has an even more exciting future ahead of him.”<br><br>A future that includes a move to Manchester United? I, for one, sincerely hope so.</p>

              <p>well, if he was signed last season, what you said may apply.</p>
              <p>but now, given he is supposed to "fill" Ronaldo's boots, he will have added pressure.</p>
              <p>and the sad truth, if he so fast, and whipped in crosses, mr Berba will still be at the centre circle leh.. how leh?? :P</p>
              <p>Rem how Carrick did when he was handed the #"16" jersey?</p>
