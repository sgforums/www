              <p><strong>Robson, Cantona, Beckham, Ferdinand - they all rate Paul Scholes as
              Manchester United's number-one player. Now the shy midfielder has a
              chance to cap his remarkable career with the medal he wants most...</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://image.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2008/05/17/PaulScholesGettyCliveBrunskill2.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="276"></p>
              <p>Old Trafford, August 2003. Paul Scholes and his wife, Claire, are
              making a rare public appearance at a fundraising dinner for the
              National Asthma Campaign in a suite at the stadium. The Manchester
              United midfielder is nervous. 'Shit!' he says. 'I don't have to get up
              and say a few words, do I? And with a microphone? What do I do?'</p>
              <p>Scholes
              is renowned for being a master on the field who shows no reticence in
              bossing his team-mates around but who is Trappist-like away from the
              game.</p>
              <p>'My wife has asthma, as does Paul, so I know all about it,'
              says Eric Harrison, the lauded coach of the famous United youth team
              that included Scholes, the Neville brothers, Nicky Butt and David
              Beckham. 'It's well down the pecking order when it comes to raising
              money. The campaign people contacted me, but it was a non-starter
              without Paul.</p>
              <p>'I was a bit concerned about asking him because
              he's so shy. But Paul agreed without hesitation. I told him to bring
              his wife, Claire, and although he was happy to help, you could see he
              was worried. When they arrived at around six that evening Paul said,
              "What do I have to do?" I told him he was on the top table for the
              dinner. That got him going. "I'm not!" he said. I had to say to him,
              "Paul, you are, all you have to do is take a few questions, and answer
              them". He did it, and did it well. They raised £22,000 on the night and
              that was all down to Paul and his wife. And he never even had a go at
              me for getting him there.'</p>
              <p>On Wednesday the lad from Salford has
              a chance to take centre stage on the pitch - as he did by scoring the
              stunning goal that defeated Barcelona in the Champions League
              semi-finals - by winning the only club trophy missing from a stellar
              career. Scholes - a 'football genius' to Harrison, a sad loss to
              England head coach Fabio Capello because of his self-imposed
              international retirement, and the man rated number one in English
              football by Patrick Vieira, Rio Ferdinand and many more - is a certain
              starter for United against Chelsea in Moscow.</p>
              <p>He famously
              missed United's 1999 triumph against Bayern Munich through suspension.
              Scholes had come on as a 68th-minute substitute in the second leg of
              the semi-final against Juventus as Sir Alex Ferguson sought to protect
              him from the booking that would lead to him being suspended from the
              final. But Scholes's tackling failed him again and he was shown the
              dreaded yellow card.</p>
              <p>This time, though, Scholes has already
              been promised a starting place by Ferguson. United's manager may be
              less gruff than the public persona allows, but the Scot is hardly
              sentimental. Ryan Giggs's 10 Premier League titles are not apparently
              enough to take him off the bench. Yet the Welshman, along with all his
              team-mates, is happy that Scholes is guaranteed a start.</p>
              <p>When
              Beckham was at Real Madrid, he confirmed that Scholes was the most
              admired opponent in a dressing room boasting Zinedine Zidane, Luís Figo
              and Roberto Carlos. And, asked to name the best in a United squad that
              includes Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney, this is Ferdinand's
              verdict: 'For me, it's Paul Scholes. He'll do ridiculous things in
              training like say, "You see that tree over there?" - it'll be 40 yards
              away - "I'm going to hit it". And he'll do it. Everyone at the club
              considers him the best.'</p>
              <p>He is also the most reticent. Scholes,
              who earns £75,000 a week, has never, unless prompted by club or
              country, granted a one-on-one interview. The one endorsement he has
              allowed himself - a boot deal with Nike - is unusual in that it carries
              few public obligations. 'He's been with us for years,' a Nike executive
              tells Observer Sport. 'For us, association is enough. If you go around
              the world, he is one of the only players not asked to do public
              appointments. He's a shy guy, but that's fine.'</p>
              <p>Paul Aaron
              Scholes was born on 16 November 1974 in Salford. He has a younger
              sister, Joanne, and happily married parents. His father, Stewart, was,
              according to Mike Coffey, the former United scout who taught Scholes at
              Cardinal Langley High School and who persuaded him to join the club, 'a
              superb footballer who played locally in Middleton into his forties'.</p>
              <p>The
              family lived on the large Langley estate and Scholes grew up watching
              football on the terraces at Oldham's Boundary Park. 'His hero was
              Frankie Bunn, the Oldham Athletic striker,' Coffey says. 'He is an
              Oldham nut and it wouldn't surprise me if at 36, or whenever he's
              finished at United, Paul plays for them.'</p>
              <p>Coffey, who scouted
              for United between 1985 and 1999, says Scholes was not academic. 'Paul
              is football crazy. I've followed him since I took his first-year team
              all the way through. And while Paul is not very socially confident,
              give him a group of lads, a football and he's certainly not quiet.'</p>
              <p>After
              joining Oldham as an 11-year-old, Scholes played in a Boundary Park
              Juniors team that included the Neville brothers and Butt. When Coffey
              recommended him to Brian Kidd, who helped Harrison at United, he had to
              pull Scholes into his office and persuade him to join. 'He was very
              reluctant and took a couple of days to be convinced.'</p>
              <p>Harrison
              says that the first time he saw Scholes - then nearly 15 - at the
              Cliff, United's former training ground, he was impressed. 'Brian Kidd
              said to me, "He's only tiny, he's got ginger hair - you'll probably
              have a bit of a giggle. But he can't half play". He was tiny. David
              Beckham was as small then, too, but Scholes is still the same size. Not
              that it matters, he has no real pace, no strength, but he is clever and
              has quick feet. Like all creative players who can pass he scores
              spectacular goals, but he also scores them from everywhere - headers,
              tap-ins and long shots. If David Beckham had not taken all the
              free-kicks, imagine how many more Paul would have got.'</p>
              <p>Harrison
              adds: 'That youth side played on a Saturday morning. We called it the
              Dream Team. It attracted a fair crowd and their favourite was Scholes.
              And remember, United fans have been brought up on players like Duncan
              Edwards - they're not stupid. The standard was as good as first-team
              training. And the manager saw Paul and knew about him.'</p>
              <p>Where did
              Harrison play him? 'He scored so many goals, the further up the better.
              Like Ryan Giggs, we told Paul to go out and perform, while also
              thinking of the team.'</p>
              <p>Scholes was coming into a team who had won
              the 1992 FA Youth Cup and scored against Leeds in the final in 1993,
              when the Reds finished as runners-up. United's big stars, including
              Bryan Robson, Steve Bruce and Eric Cantona, would watch. 'I said to
              Eric one day, "What's the difference between French youngsters and
              English youngsters?"' Harrison recalls. 'He said, "Maybe our youngsters
              receive the ball a little better than your boys". Well, Paul is one of
              the best receivers still today.'</p>
              <p>Scholes, who in 2006 had a
              career-threatening eye injury - 'I spoke to him then and it did worry
              him,' Harrison says - also suffered from Osgood-Schlatter disease, a
              knee problem that affects younger players. 'He had to sit out training
              and was not a happy chappy at all with me.</p>
              <p>'He missed a lot of
              football and it might have held him back a bit at that critical stage.
              But,' Harrison recalls with a chuckle, 'when he returned he was
              absolutely lethal.'</p>
              <p>Scholes, who enjoys a round of golf and has
              three children, has won eight League titles, three FA Cups - he scored
              the second goal in the 1999 final, in United's Treble season - and one
              League Cup. He was a member of the England Under-18 side that won the
              1993 European Championship and, after scoring on his full debut,
              against Italy in June 1997, memorably dealt with the pressure of
              replacing the dropped Paul Gascoigne at the 1998 World Cup by scoring a
              30-yard cracker against Tunisia in England's opening game.</p>
              <p>His
              international career continued brightly with a hat-trick at Wembley
              against Poland in March 1999. But that June he became the first and
              last England player to be shown a red card at the old Wembley, against
              Sweden.</p>
              <p>'He is not as good a tackler as you,' says Chelsea's
              tough man Michael Essien, with a laugh, of the one accepted flaw in
              Scholes' game. 'But I really like him. He's a little boy, but the power
              in that shot... he can really shoot.'</p>
              <p>Despite 14 goals in 66
              appearances, his England career might be viewed as unfulfilled - it
              ended following Euro 2004 after he had breached a three-year goal
              drought. But that is tempered by England's disappointing performance
              overall since the 1990 World Cup. Retirement came at only 29, seemingly
              because Sven-Göran Eriksson had shunted Scholes out to the left of
              midfield, although his public reasons - more family time, and a
              prolonged club career - have also proved credible. Undoubtedly, though,
              it was a loss to England. Eriksson and his successors, Steve McClaren
              and Capello, have all wanted him back.</p>
              <p>'I think we were all
              disappointed because we all know what he can do,' says Micah Richards,
              the England and Manchester City right-back. 'He's always in the right
              position, always seems to be at the end of the box when the ball drops
              in. The complete midfielder - when he's fit, he's the best. Some go
              missing but he's in the right place at the right time. He's my
              favourite player of all-time, unbelievable. If you give him a chance
              it's a goal, isn't it?'</p>
              <p>Like any player, Scholes has suffered
              disappointment. Despite being outplayed, Arsenal won the 2005 FA Cup in
              the final's first ever penalty shootout when Scholes missed the kick
              that would have levelled the score at 5-5.</p>
              <p>Other than some of
              his tackles, the only blatant misjudgment of Scholes' sparkling career
              came in November 2001, during what was arguably his worst season, when
              Juan Sebastián Verón's arrival meant Ferguson asked him to play as a
              second striker. Scholes was dropped against Liverpool, then selected in
              a weakened League Cup team for a trip to Arsenal. Staggeringly, Scholes
              refused to board the coach. He was fined £80,000 and apparently
              considered moving. But that was the start and finish of Scholes and
              controversy.</p>
              <p>On Wednesday, at Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium, he will
              hope to score his 140th goal in a United shirt. 'It was a fantastic
              goal,' Ferguson said following Scholes' decisive strike against
              Barcelona. 'It was a marvellous moment for him. He is one of the great
              players to come through the ranks here. I don't think we can expect
              Paul Scholes to score 10 to 15 goals a season as he did when he was
              younger, but it makes up for all the goals he can't score now because
              of his age.'</p>
              <p>As would the one medal missing from his collection.
              Roy Keane, who also missed the 1999 triumph in Barcelona, has said he
              felt more sorry for Scholes than for himself. The pair could only stay
              up drinking with fans on the eve of the match at Camp Nou, before
              swallowing their disappointment at having to sit and watch. 'No
              celebrity bullshit, no self-promotion - an amazingly gifted player who
              remained an unaffected human being,' Keane wrote in his autobiography.</p>
