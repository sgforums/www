              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">ALEX FERGUSON insists Manchester United new-boy Michael Owen WILL score goals 
              this season.</h2>
              <p class="article">The free transfer from Newcastle missed four good chances against Valencia on 
              Wednesday and has scored just four goals in six pre-season games.</p>
              <p class="article">The Old Trafford faithful have yet to be convinced about the 29- year-old 
              former Liverpool striker.</p>
              <p class="article">His lengthy injury record and disappointing four-year spell at St James' Park 
              have led many critics to suggest he is past his best and has little left in 
              the tank.</p>
              <p class="article">But United gaffer Fergie insisted: "Michael may have reached the stage in his 
              career where he won't figure in every game - but he'll score a lot of goals 
              for us.</p>
              <p class="article">"It'll be in keeping with his tremendous record throughout his career for 
              England, Liverpool and Newcastle."</p>
              <p class="article">Fergie believes Owen can take inspiration from new team-mate Paul Scholes, who 
              came back time and again from injury to feature in last season's Champions 
              League final at the age of 34.</p>
              <p class="article">Ferguson said: "Michael was perhaps our most controversial summer signing but 
              I believe he'll continue to surprise people.</p>
              <p class="article">"There seems to be constant debate about the injuries he's picked up over the 
              years but look at Paul Scholes.</p>
              <p class="article">"He's had two or three injuries and he's always come back. So we are not 
              worried about Michael.</p>
              <p class="article">"If players have the resolve to get back then they always will and there's no 
              doubt Michael still loves the game and is hungry to play."</p>
              <p class="article">Fergie paired Owen with his old England strike partner Wayne Rooney against 
              Valencia as Three Lions boss Fabio Capello watched from the stands.</p>
              <p class="article">And United chief executive David Gill revealed they were planning to sign Owen 
              for several months before swooping at the beginning of July.</p>
              <p class="article">Gill said: "Watching from the sidelines, I've been delighted. He's 
              enthusiastic and very happy to be here.</p>
              <p class="article">"We had discussed signing him for a while as we were aware he was out of 
              contract at the end of the season.</p>
              <p class="article">"So he was someone we had kept an eye on and I hope he'll prove to be a great 
              signing."</p>
              <p class="article">Fergie admits he is still undecided whether England hopeful Ben Foster or 
              Tomasz Kuszczak will be his No 1 keeper for the start of the season.</p>
              <p class="article">SunSport revealed on Wednesday that first-choice Edwin van der Sar is out for 
              two months with a broken finger.</p>
              <p class="article">Back-ups Foster and Kuszczak were each given 45 minutes against Valencia with 
              Pole Kuszczak taking his chance to shine after half-time.</p>
              <p class="article">And Fergie admitted: "Both players have outstanding qualities. Tomasz made two 
              great saves against Valencia as he did against Boca Juniors the week before 
              - but we'll see."</p>
