              <h1>So, what happens next to Manchester United striker Tevez?<br></h1>
              <p><br><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/05/11/article-1180650-04E1DF09000005DC-623_233x423.jpg" alt="Manchester United's Carlos Tevez " width="233" height="423"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Out of Old Trafford? Tevez</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>In an ideal world, Ferguson would retain Tévez’s services after his two-year lease arrangement expires on June 30, but the United manager agrees with David Gill, the chief executive, that a permanent transfer has been rendered almost impossible first by his uniquely complicated situation — with a £22 million transfer fee due to the companies that own his “economic rights” in addition to his wages and the £10 million lease fee that has already been paid — and second by his difficulties in accepting the squad rotation system.</strong></p>
              <p>In the absence of an offer from United, whom he has accused of making him feel unwanted, Tévez is prepared to consider joining Liverpool or City as well as Chelsea, Inter Milan or Real, all of whom are free to negotiate with his adviser, Kia Joorabchian, with no objection from Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>The Spanish club remain favourites to sign him, but the player made clear in an interview published in a Sunday newspaper that he is more than open to the idea of staying in England with one of United’s domestic rivals. The Tévez camp believe that staying in the North West, where he and his family are settled, holds a strong appeal for him and that signing for Liverpool or City would make sense if he is persuaded that he would be central to their plans.</p>
              <p>Liverpool’s interest in Tévez, 25, was first revealed in The Times last month, with Rafael Benítez eager to sign a centre forward to ease the goalscoring burden on Fernando Torres, whose hamstring problems have caused him to miss a large chunk of the season.</p>
              <p>Benítez is confident that Tévez could be tempted to Anfield by the presence of Javier Mascherano, the Argentina captain, who is also a client of Joorabchian and with whom he played at Corinthians and West Ham United.</p>
              <p>City cannot offer Champions League football, but the appeal of signing the forward has grown on Garry Cook, the chief executive, and Mark Hughes, the manager, since it was first proposed in January. Backed by the enormous wealth of Sheikh Mansour, the owner, the club believe that they can offer Tévez a scenario in which he would be the leading player in a team who plan to be contenders in the Premier League next season.</p>
              <p>The prospect of stealing an established player from United holds a strong appeal for City, but it would also be a deal that could take them to a higher level on the pitch and potentially attract other signings.</p>
              <p>Real remain favourites, however, and their desire to sign Tévez may be increased by growing doubts about their ability to lure Ronaldo. The Portugal forward has appeared to be pining for Madrid since his “dream” move was blocked by Ferguson last summer, but, even if his petulant reaction to his substitution on Sunday seemed to be that of a disillusioned player, Ronaldo is believed to be leaning towards staying in Manchester for one more year.</p>

              <p>Just a few thoughts.</p>
              <p>Like every other Man Utd fans, we love Tevez. Everything that he had done in Utd shirt, scoring every goals, winning ones or not, every mile he ran, every tackles he made, we hugely appreciate it and he is deserving of the respect and love that we had shown him.</p>
              <p>However, we cannot control his contract. His dispute is with SAF and the director or whoever. He know very sure, as a Devil, our rivalry with Liverpool. Perhaps, from a personal perspective, he wants to join Pool to chase personal accolades. But never, for a second, expect us to forgive that decision, no matter what you had done for Man Utd. Don't expect us to still respect you for that. We can't. It will end the moment you put on that Pool shirt.</p>
              <p>Just to spite SAF and whoever involved, you want to join Pool. You played your hearts out and score the goals in the Utd shirt not because you respect us, the fans. But because you want to earn our respect, and we give it to you. But with the intention to join Pool, you disrespect us, the fans. And its unforgiveable. For what you had done, Thank You Tevez. But once you join Pool, it will be Fuck You Tevez. Its not about joining other clubs. Its about joining Pool. And we won't be happy with that.</p>

              <p><span id="intelliTXT"><strong>Fergie claims Argentine has been offered terms at Old Trafford</strong><br> <br> Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson has claimed that Carlos Tevez has been offered a permanent deal at Old Trafford.<br> <br> The Argentina star's two-year loan with the defending Premier League
                  and European champions is due to expire at the end of the season and he
                  has been linked with a move to Chelsea, Liverpool or Manchester City.<br> <br> But Ferguson has always maintained that he is keen to keep the
                  25-year-old in his attacking armoury, and the Scot has stated that
                  chief executive David Gill is working to push a deal through.<br> <br> After watching substitute Tevez - who is owned by Media Sports
                  Investment - score United's equaliser as they came from behind to win
                  2-1 at Wigan on Wednesday, the Red Devils boss has said that the
                  forward has been offered terms.<br> <br> "He is a fantastic little player. He knows I want him to stay,"
                  Ferguson told Sky Sports 1 when asked about the former West Ham player,
                  who has been rumoured to be unhappy with a lack of first-team football
                  with the Red Devils.<br> Problem<br> <br> <em>"I have had a chat with him today. David Gill has had some meetings today and it has progressed, I'm sure, further.<br> <br> "We hope we get what we want to get. I'm sorry to have to keep on with this all the time, but it has never changed."<br> <br> Ferguson believes that the stumbling block in a permanent deal has been
                  the fact that business is being conducted with Media Sports Investment.<br> <br> "We are not negotiating with a football club, that is the problem," he added.<br> <br> "I think Carlos himself is okay. I think the terms he has been offered are good."</em></span></p>

              Sir Alex Ferguson is still hopeful of a positive resolution to Carlos Tevez's ongoing transfer saga.
              
              Reports in the media have suggested the striker would leave Old Trafford at the end of this season following a two-year loan deal.
              
              However, on the back of United's win at Wigan - in which Tevez netted a vital equaliser - Sir Alex broke his silence on the matter, and confirmed that the Argentine is very much on his wanted list.
              
              "I think we've had progress today," the manager told MUTV. "David Gill's had a good meeting today, I've spoken to Carlos and we've given him an offer we hope he accepts. That's where we are.
              
              "He's a great little player and once again he's shown his mettle. He's scored so many important goals and he's got another one for us tonight."
              
              Tevez's all-action approach established him as a fans' favourite within weeks of his arrival at Old Trafford last season, and Sir Alex admits the striker's attitude is commendable.
              
              "They (the fans) love him because he's a trier," he said. "He's got tremendous skill, of course, but he never gives in. That's a great quality to have in the modern game, he's got the hunger to fight all the time and it's a wonderful thing to see."

              <p><strong>Tev told: Fight for freedom!</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://i43.tinypic.com/2nkubnk.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">CARLOS TEVEZ can break free from his owners and stay at Manchester United.</h2>
              <p class="article">That was the sensational message last night, as the row over his future 
                  intensified and the European Parliament prepared to get involved.</p>
              <p class="article">United are refusing to pay the £26million fee demanded by a consortium led by 
                  Kia Joorabchian, who owns Tevez.</p>
              <p class="article">And Chris Heaton-Harris, president of the EU’s powerful Sports Intergroup 
                  which deals with sporting matters across the continent, insisted there was 
                  nothing to stop the Argie striker going his own way.</p>
              <p class="article">East Midlands MEP Heaton-Harris is an influential figure in Brussels on sports 
                  issues and admitted he has been shocked by the Tevez saga.</p>
              <p class="article">He told SunSport: “It is unique and bizarre that an entity, rather than a 
                  club, owns a player.</p>
              <p class="article">“In employment terms, Carlos Tevez has a contract himself with this company. 
                  But if he went to the European Commission and said he wanted out of it, he 
                  would get European support.</p>
              <p class="article">“It is just an employment contract. You can’t keep a person to a contract that 
                  he doesn’t want to continue in.</p>
              <p class="article">“Under European law, he has the right to break this contract.”</p>
              <p class="article">There is, of course, no evidence that Tevez wants to break from his owners or 
                  Joorabchian, who is also his adviser.</p>
              <p class="article">They agreed a loan deal with United two years ago. It had the proviso that, if 
                  United wanted to keep the player, they would have to pay £26m for him.</p>
              <p class="article">United have not exercised that option, so Joorabchian and his consortium say 
                  that it is time to look elsewhere.</p>
              <p class="article">Sources close to the player insist he does not want to stay at the club and 
                  that he is happy for his ‘owners’ to decide what his future should be.</p>
              <p class="article">But United boss Alex Ferguson disputed this on Wednesday night, insisting 
                  Tevez wanted to remain and the club had made him a new offer.</p>
              <p class="article">SunSport revealed on Wednesday how Tevez’s contract with his owners could 
                  contravene European labour rules.</p>
              <p class="article">We explained how the argument made by Jean Marc Bosman in 1995, which 
                  radically changed football’s transfer system, could be applied to Tevez’s 
                  situation.</p>
              <p class="article">And United themselves have been exploring possible legal loopholes in the 
                  third-party ownership clause of Tevez’s contract. Heaton-Harris added: 
                  “Bosman was tied to a football club and Tevez is tied to a company. There is 
                  very little difference. It is a simple follow-on from Bosman.</p>
              <p class="article">“The football authorities have been amazingly slow to understand the problems 
                  that this sort of arrangement causes.</p>
              <p class="article">“They could have sent this to the European Commission long ago but chose to 
                  sit on their hands and this is what has happened as a result.</p>
              <p class="article">“If the FA and UEFA had come to us with this problem in the first place, there 
                  would have been none of these contracts and it would have been job done.”</p>
              <p class="article">Tevez grabbed an amazing equaliser in the 2-1 victory against Wigan with a 
                  clever backheel flick and Wayne Rooney has joined the</p>
              <p class="article">fans clamouring for the Argie to be signed up on a permanent deal at Old 
                  Trafford.</p>
              <p class="article">Rooney said: “Carlos scored a fantastic goal to get us level. He is a 
                  world-class player and you always want to see those sorts of player at your 
                  club. He is great to play with. He has a lot of energy and has scored some 
                  vital goals for us. His work-rate is brilliant and, hopefully, he will sign 
                  to stay with us.</p>
              <p class="article">“But I don’t know what is happening behind the scenes. It is hard to say what 
                  will happen.</p>
              <p class="article">“His English isn’t very good but he’s a great lad and it is great to have him 
                  in the camp.”</p>
              <p class="article">The match-winner at Wigan, Michael Carrick, added his call for Tevez to stay.</p>
              <p class="article">He said “We want to keep the squad together as much as we can.</p>
              <p class="article">“It is great here and we still haven’t peaked, so it would be nice to keep 
                  together.</p>
              <p class="article">“Obviously, Carlos is a top player and the fans love him as well. It is not so 
                  much the number of goals he scores but the importance of them.</p>
              <p class="article">“His goal against Wigan was a classic case of that. He came on, scored and got 
                  us back in the game.</p>
              <p class="article">“Hopefully, he can score a few more over the next couple of weeks.”</p>

              <h1>Inside story: How businessmen bought United star Tevez, the West Ham fallout and the man who will shape his future<br></h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1181543" rel="1181543|3| nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/sport/football/article-1181543/Inside-story-How-businessmen-bought-United-star-Tevez-West-Ham-fallout-man-shape-future.html"></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">It is the most complex and mysterious transfer in the history of the Premier League. And now </span><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Manchester United</span></a><span style="font-size: x-small;"> have shown their hand; they are keen to sign Carlos Tevez, but they want a cheaper deal with Kia Joorabchian, his owner. <br><br>So what is the inside story of the latest transfer involving Joorabchian, the deal-maker responsible for more than £100million worth of talent in the English game and whose influence stretches deep into illustrious clubs such as United, </span><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Liverpool</span></a><span style="font-size: x-small;"> and </span><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/everton.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Everton</span></a><span style="font-size: x-small;">?<br><br>Here, including Joorabchian’s own answers to questions posed by Sportsmail, </span><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?authornamef=Lee%20Clayton"><span style="color: #003580;">LEE CLAYTON</span></a><span style="font-size: x-small;"> unravels the Tevez transfer saga...</span></p>
              <p>Such is the demand to work with Kia Joorabchian that one Barclays Premier League manager recently approached him and asked: ‘Everyone else is getting players, why don’t you bring talent to me?’</p>
              <p>Owners are regularly in his company at Les Ambassadeurs, the exclusive fine dining club just off London’s Park Lane, where multi-million-pound deals are completed at 4am over £700 bottles of wine, Beluga caviar and hefty cigars.

              <p><strong>As well as Carlos Tevez, Joorabchian, his company and a team of agents have been central to domestic transfers involving Javier Mascherano, Jo, Alex, Robinho and Afonso Alves. His players, mainly South American, stretch across Europe, playing in countries such as Russia, Portugal, Spain, Holland and Greece. There is a fresh batch of Brazilians on their way, though he insists he plays no formal role in transactions between clubs.</strong><br><br>Joorabchian’s ambitions do not rest there, however. An Arsenal supporter and box holder at the Emirates Stadium, he may soon purchase an English club of his own, a potential trading post for his emerging stable of talent, as well as scouting for young British players to mentor, just as he has Tevez.<br><br>But, because of the mishandling by West Ham of the transfer documents surrounding the arrival of Tevez in England, it is that deal which still draws unwelcome attention to Joorabchian and his business empire — and so many questions.</p>

              <h2 style="color: #0cac0c;"><span style="font-size: small;">Lee Clayton: So how did you come to own Tevez?</span></h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Kia Joorabchian:</span> Originally, I wanted to buy a club in England. I grew up here, I was educated here, I love English football. English football excites me. Instead, I was drawn to Brazil, where Pele’s agent suggested Corinthians. <br><br>They were a club with 25 million fans, the second biggest club in Brazil, but gates were as low as 12,000. I needed a player to spark interest and bring the club to life for the project to stand a chance.</p>
              <p>So, we looked at videos, spoke to scouts; the consensus was that we should buy Robinho. Then I saw one DVD of a Boca Juniors game, involving Carlitos (Tevez). I knew he was the player from the first moment I met him, because of his desire to be a winner.<br><br>I flew back and forth to Buenos Aires and tried many times to sign him. Each time they said ‘No’. He was Boca’s talisman, their hero. I was going crazy. The deal took six months to complete.<br><br>In the end, Carlos decided that he wanted to come and my company agreed a £14m fee with Boca, a South American record. He came to meet me to sign in a Shell petrol station, wearing his flip-flops!<br><br>This was the biggest news in South American football history — and he was in his flip-flops and shorts on the petrol forecourt! When Carlos flew in to Sao Paulo, word got out that he was coming. <br><br>There was a dinner for 400 Corinthians officials but 3,000 people forced their way into the room and 20,000 lined the streets. He started slowly but once he started scoring goals, it was phenomenal. <br><br>I said to him then: ‘This project is yours and mine. You do your bit and I will do mine.’</p>

              <h2 style="color: #0cac0c;"><span>LC: What happened next?</span></h2>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">KJ:</span> I had to return to England after the death of my father. I then tried to buy West Ham. I showed Carlos the club had massive potential, with a huge fan base. He wanted to come to England, along with Javier Mascherano, to join me. <br><br>Like me, he was excited by the potential of the club. He hoped to be playing for a club competing for a place in the top six but they asked him to mark a winger in one game at Chelsea!<br><br>It didn’t work out but then he started scoring and won the player of the year award. His goals helped West Ham to stay up. Ask their supporters about him. At their end-of-season dinner last week, he was still given a standing ovation when they read out his name. That is the impact Carlos Tevez has on any club where he plays.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2 style="color: #0cac0c;"><span>LC: We don’t understand third-party transfers in this country. Talk us through them.</span></h2>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">KJ:</span> What happens in Brazil, Argentina and some European nations is that clubs cannot afford to buy a player. So they go to a business, a bank, a major supermarket, a person, a wealthy individual and say: ‘We want Mr X. You put up 70, 80, 100 per cent of the money, let him play here.’<br></p>
              <p>So that person buys the player outright, invests in the player, maybe helps with education and development, and the club sign him from you; they take the registration. The rights on any resale belong to the individual or company who has put up the money.<br><br>There are no secrets: Brazilian clubs report the details on their websites and include information on who owns the player and what percentage is owned by the club. It is there for anyone to read and it’s the same in Argentina and Portugal.<br><br>There is total transparency. Dodo, who was linked with Manchester United this week, is a good example of this — Corinthians own 50 per cent of the player and Traffic, a different investment group, own the other half.<br><br>It does not afford any right to influence when he can play or where he should play. UEFA president Michel Platini has said this sort of transfer is common in parts of Europe and in South America.</p>
              <p><br style="color: #339966;"></p>
              <h2 style="color: #0cac0c;">LC: Is it all about money?</h2>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">KJ:</span> It is a business, yes, but imagine finding a player in Brazil, nurturing his talent, then watching his adventure unfold in another continent.<br><br>You have to trust your instincts and your knowledge when making the initial investment. When you see a player fulfilling his potential, it is a wonderful feeling of achievement.<br><br>The company owning the player never decides the destiny. That is down to the player.<br><br>It is like Cristiano Ronaldo leaving Manchester United. If he decides to do that, what can they do? The power is with the player. Carlos Tevez will decide where Carlos Tevez plays.</p>
