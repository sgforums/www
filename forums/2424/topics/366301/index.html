              <h1>Benzema To Join Manchester United For €45m - Lyon Teammate Pjanic</h1>
              <h2>The midfielder is confident that his team-mate will go to England this summer...</h2>
              <p><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/30446_news.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="214"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a href="http://goal.com/en/people/bosnia-and-herzegovina/21408/miralem-pjanic"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Miralem Pjanic</strong></span></a><strong> has revealed that his </strong><a href="http://goal.com/en/teams/france/54/o-lyon"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Lyon</strong></span></a><strong> team-mate </strong><a href="http://goal.com/en/people/france/8261/karim-benzema"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Karim Benzema</strong></span></a><strong> is close to joining </strong><a href="http://goal.com/en/teams/england/97/man-utd-news"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span></a><strong>.</strong></p>
              <p>The forward has been linked with a move away from Lyon this summer and even numerous claims from his agent that he will stay has not quelled the speculation.</p>
              <p>Now, Pjanic has told <em>sportsport.ba </em>that he thinks it is just a matter of time before Benzema moves to England.</p>
              <p>"Benzema is nearly gone to Old Trafford. The English club are willing to pay €45 million for him and it is just a question of the day when he will move to England," he said.</p>
              <p>"He does not have anything against going to Manchester. Our side will be reinforced by Lisandro Lopez, the Argentine forward from Porto."</p>
              <p>Certainly Benzema seems like an ideal signing for United as the club will lose the goals that attacking midfielder Cristiano Ronaldo provided.</p>
              <p>At the age of 21, Benzema is widely regarded as one of the best forwards in Europe at the moment and whilst Lyon will not let him leave on the cheap, they have already admitted they might be powerless to keep him.</p>

              <p>well, another toss of the coin  from guardian football -&gt;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Prepare yourself for lots of headlines about Sir Alex Ferguson
              smiling like the cat that's got the Karim. And Everton running out of
              Tim. And Robben red breast. Why? Because they're momentarily amusing,
              that's why. And because <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united">Manchester United</a> plan to follow up their purchase of Antonio Valencia with the acquisitions of <strong>Karim Benzema, Tim Cahill and Arjen Robben</strong>.</p>
              <p>Benzema
              has previously let it be known he'd prefer a move to Spain and, indeed,
              was in Barcelona on Monday shooting a commercial – but excitable French
              media outlets claim that during that sojourn he popped into a sports
              shop and "pretended to try on a Red Devils jersey to see if it would
              suit", suggesting that the striker who has been widely hailed as the
              new Ronaldo (as in the Brazilian phenomenon rather than the Portuguese
              diva) may also be the new <strong>Marcel Marceau</strong>. Just in
              case anyone is barmy enough to think the "Red Devils" referred to are
              Kaiserslautern or the Belgian national team, Benzema's helpful Lyon
              colleague Miralem Pjanic has clarified that United will pay Lyon <strong>£38m for Benzema</strong> and the French side will console themselves by tempting Argentinian striker <strong>Lisandro Lopez</strong> from Porto.</p>

              <p>Lyon have accepted an offer from Real Madrid for striker Karim Benzema.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="sp-inlinePhoto"><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/news/story?id=658536&amp;sec=transfers&amp;cc=4716"><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/PH2/Benzema275.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="275" height="200"></a> 
              <p class="photoDesc">Benzema: Not staying at Lyon after all...</p>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Madrid and Manchester United have been vying for the services of the 21-year-old but Lyon continued to insist before today that the France international would remain at the Stade Gerland for another season at least.</p>
              <p>However, Les Gones announced on their official website this afternoon that they have accepted a fee of at least 35m euros (£30m) from Madrid for the player, with performance clauses set to see that fee rise to 41m euros.</p>
              <p>The statement on Lyon's website read: ''Lyon announce they have reached an agreement with Real Madrid on the details of the transfer of their international attacker Karim Benzema.</p>
              <p>''A few days ago Karim Benzema informed the club president Jean Michel Aulas of his desire to move to the Madrid club, which had always been his favourite club after Lyon, earlier than he had foreseen.</p>
              <p>''The player wanted to seize the opportunity which Real Madrid offered him to be one of the major elements in their new ambitious project based around the greatest players of the world.</p>
              <p>''Lyon accepted Karim Benzema's decision and negotiated the conditions of a transfer which satisfies all the different parties. The club wishes Karim the greatest success with Real Madrid.''</p>
              <p>Benzema will become Florentino Perez's fourth signing since returning to the Madrid presidency a month ago, following the arrivals of Kaka, Cristiano Ronaldo and Raul Albiol. The deal will take Madrid's summer spending to over 200m euros.</p>
              <p>The France forward came through the ranks with the French giants and burst onto the scene in the 2007-08 season with 31 goals in 51 games, a streak that saw him named Ligue 1 player of the year as well as top the league's scoring charts.</p>
