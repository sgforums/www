            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;"><strong>Sporting Lisbon</strong></span><br><br><strong>Are they any good?</strong><br>Runners-up in the Portuguese league for the past two seasons.<br><br>Sporting's world-renowned football academy has produced Luis Figo, Cristiano Ronaldo and Nani.<br><br><strong>Stadium:</strong> Sporting play their home games at the EstÃ¡dio JosÃ© Alvalade, which was purpose-built for the 2004 European Football Championship. The venue has a capacity of 52,000 and was acoustically engineered as a venue for major concerts. Its official opening was on 6 August 2003 when Sporting played United. They beat the Reds 3-1.<br><br><strong>Manager:</strong> Paulo Bento won 35 Portuguese caps before retiring at 34 to become youth team coach at Sporting, the last club he played for. After much success with the SportingÂ’s academy he was promoted to manage the senior team and steered them to second place in the domestic league in 2005/06 and 2006/07. He also won the Portuguese Cup. He is now considered one of the top coaches in the country, and has been likened in management style to compatriot Jose Mourinho.<br><br><strong>Star player:</strong> Without doubt, Sporting LisbonÂ’s star player is front man LiÃ©dson. The 30-year-old Brazilian striker arrived from Corinthians in 2003 and is known for his pace. What he lacks in height - heÂ’s 5ft 9in - he makes up for with commitment and he has no problem in finding the net if given the chance. To date heÂ’s bagged 57 goals in 93 appearances for the club. This season heÂ’ll be partnered up front by new Â£1.3 million signing Serbian Milan Purovic. The towering 6ft 3in forward comes from Red Star Belgrade.<br><br><strong>Last seasonÂ’s Champions League results: </strong>Sporting didnÂ’t get past the group stages last term having been draw against European giants Internazionale, Bayern Munich and Spartak Moscow. Unsurprisingly, they finished bottom of the group with only five points. Perhaps the lowest point came when Spartak ended a record 22-match run without a victory in the Champions League by beating Sporting 3-1 in their final Group B match.<br><br><strong>Last time we met:</strong> The last time these two sides clashed competitively was in the 1963/64 Cup Winners Cup quarter-final. Having been fairly spanked 4-1 at Old Trafford, the second leg was a stunning comeback, in which the home side ran out 5-0 victors, before going on to win the final against MTK Hungaria FC.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Nani nervous about going home</strong><br><br>Nani, who does not yet know if he will be in tomorrow's starting line-up, said that both he and Cristiano Ronaldo feared there might be one or two nerves when they faced their old team.<br><br>Â“It's going to be emotional going back,Â” the young star said.<br><br>Â“My heart is in Lisbon but, as a pro, I want nothing other than a United win.<br><br>Â“I've spoken to Cristiano and we both feel there could be a few early nerves about returning home. But if we can score first the pressure will be on Sporting and having Wayne and Cristiano back gives us an extra edge.<br><br>Â“Wayne's recovery is a real positive, particularly with two huge battles coming up against Sporting and then Chelsea on Sunday.Â”</div>

We are trying to gauge Louis. He has been out for eight months, so the plan was to ease him in the way we are doing.<br><br>"And Wayne has only had one game, which is a month ago now.<br><br>"Basically, I have to decide whether to start with Wayne, or do what I did on Saturday by playing Carlos with Ryan Giggs and then bring Wayne and Louis off the bench.
