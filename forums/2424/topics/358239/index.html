              Wayne Rooney was not happy with his performance in Manchester United's 1-0 Champions League semi-final win at home to Arsenal on Wednesday.
              
              Rooney admits he can be his own harshest critic, but the Gunners will just be hoping he does not improve for next week's semi-final, second leg at the Emirates. 
              
              Rooney, 23, who was played by United manager Sir Alex Ferguson wide on the left, said: "I don't think it was one of my best games. 
              
              "Obviously I did a job for the team but going forward I felt I didn't really offer too much so hopefully I can improve on that next week. 
              
              "In some games it is better to play there [on the left] as you can get more space and see the whole game, but at other times it's better to be in the middle." 
              
              Rooney also admitted to some frustration that United were not able to turn their considerable dominance into more goals, but still viewed the 1-0 victory as a significant step towards making the final in Rome. 
              
              "Yes, of course we were frustrated but the main thing was we were creating chances so if we can create more than Arsenal next week then hopefully we will take them," he added. 
              
              "They will know they have a difficult game next week. They are in a weird situation where they know they can't really afford to concede a goal so overall it's going to be close and hopefully we can go there, get a goal and win." 
              
              The fact that Arsenal need to score means that the game should be open, and that alone is enough to make Rooney fancy United's chances. 
              
              "Of course we do," he said. "We have won the first leg, not conceded and that was what we aimed to do. 
              
              "We have been creating chances and we just need to take a few more. I'm sure we will create chances at Arsenal next week, especially if they are pushing forward to try and score." 
              
              Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger claims United let the Gunners off the hook last night, and Rooney concedes it will not be a stroll in the park come Tuesday. 
              
              "It's always a difficult place to go to," said Rooney. "But I thought we defended quite well and limited their chances of scoring and, if we can defend like that next week, then I'm sure we will be okay. 
              
              "One goal could be enough; if we get one then they will need three and we have been defending quite well over the last few weeks, barring the two goals against Tottenham." 
              
              Rooney's main brother in arms at Old Trafford on Wednesday night was Carlos Tevez. 
              
              The Argentinian, who looks set to leave United once his two-year loan deal expires at the end of the season, exemplified the holders' spirit with a rampaging display which never allowed Arsenal to settle. 
              
              It is clear Rooney would view his departure as a loss. 
              
              "It's brilliant to play with him," he said. "He gives 110% every game and creates chances for other players. 
              
              "He's an unselfish player and it's always nice to play with him." 
              
              Tevez expressed his pleasure at the reception he received from the Old Trafford crowd last night, with fans singing "Argentina, Argentina" and "Fergie, sign him up". 
              
              Tevez said: "It was great to hear the fans chanting my name. The crowd here are great to me and it means a lot."
