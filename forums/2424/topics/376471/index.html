              <p>Paul Pogba's agent has again insisted money was not the main motive behind his move to Manchester United.</p>
              <p>The 17-year-old's move from Le Havre told Old Trafford has caused his former club to threaten the Red Devils with legal action.</p>
              <p>United have refused to be moved by Le Havre's threats, insisting they want a retraction over recent comments - but the French side insist they are in the right.</p>
              <p>Le Havre say they will take the case to FIFA - who recently banned Chelsea from signing players until 2011, subject to appeal, after they were deemed to have illegally signed Gael Kakuta from Lens.</p>
              <p>But Pogba's agent insists United have done nothing wrong and they simply showed belief in the player.</p>
              <p>"Of course, it is a nice contract. But not only money makes a young player and his parents change their country," Gael Mahe stated.</p>
              <p>"They also look at the way people talk to them, the seriousness of negotiation, the respect showed.</p>
              <p>"Did you know what Manchester sent to the Paul's mother? Not a big cheque, but a bunch of flowers. It cost â‚¬30 but the mother has been moved. She felt trust.</p>
              <p>"The father received a book about the club's history, while Paul got a shirt with number 6 and his name in the back. It is a symbol, but they felt Manchester respected them."</p>
              <p>Pogba's mother Yeo also dismissed claims that they have received a new house from United as part of their move to England.</p>
              <p>"That house story made people laugh in the hotel. Why would we be in a hotel, if we had been given a house? I can assure you Manchester United didn't give us anything," she told <em>France Football</em>.</p>
              <p>"Le Havre didn't take care about my son. When Paul missed classes because he played a tournament with the team, we asked to catch up it, but Le Havre didn't care.</p>
              <p>"We understood the club didn't have faith in him. They proposed contracts to other same age players, but nothing to Paul. Trust was broken."</p>
