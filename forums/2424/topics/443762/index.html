              <p><strong>Gaitán, who can play as an attacking midfielder or left-sided forward, impressed against <span style="color: #000000;">Manchester United</span> during Benfica’s Champions League group stage encounters with Sir Alex Ferguson’s team earlier this season, and his arrival at Old Trafford next summer would help fill the void left by Paul Scholes’s retirement last May. </strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p>As revealed by <em>Telegraph Sport</em> in October, United’s European scouting team has monitored the 23-year-old’s performances in recent months, with the player under detailed scrutiny during last month’s games against Naval and Sporting Lisbon, and the club moved to head off growing interest in Gaitán from Inter Milan and Paris Saint-Germain by opening negotiations with Benfica in late November.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="thirdPar">
              <p>With Gaitán’s former club, Boca Juniors, entitled to 20 per cent of any transfer fee Benfica receive, the Portuguese club had been holding out for the player’s full £38m release clause, written into his renegotiated contract two months ago. United made it clear they would not meet that figure, and an outline agreement is now in place for a move next June.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fourthPar">
              <p>Despite United’s mounting injury crisis, which has seen Darren Fletcher join cruciate ligament victim Nemanja Vidic in missing the rest of the season with a chronic bowel condition, Ferguson has conceded Benfica will not sell Gaitán in January.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fifthPar">
              <p>United, who are also monitoring Benfica midfielder Javi Martínez, are prepared to wait until the summer for Gaitán, however, with Ferguson confident that his squad remains strong enough to compete for the title.</p>

              <p>There are many good South American players Argentinians especially... <span style="color: #000000;">Aguero, Tevez, </span><span style="color: #000000;">Gutierrez... This guy is one of the main reasons Benfica qualify for the CL and also tops their group which United were in.</span></p>
              <p>I have seen him played and both times against United, he was their star man. Just go watch the match day 5 on mio which is still available and within the first 10 mins you will notice him already.</p>
              <p>Don't compare him to Veron and Forlan, he isn't that kind of a player, he is more like Tevez chasing for ever ball lots of pace and energy type. I think he will be great for United if they can really get him cos there is not many creative players on sale in the market. And most would likely cost $40m to $50m.</p>
              <p>That read on him was a month ago before he played United in the 2nd leg. It is probably him which cause United to crashed out of the CL cos it wasn't the Basel match that did us in, it was the home match against Benfica that we fail to qualify.</p>
              <p>And to be frank, at $30m... I don't think he is too costly as creative midfielders are hard to come by and he is much younger than Berbatov too when he signed with us and we paid $30 for him too didn't we...</p>

              <p>Benfica playmaker Nicolas Gaitan insists he has not let himself be affected by rumours linking him with a move to Manchester United and says he is happy to stay at the Estadio da Luz.</p>
              <p>Gaitan, 23, has been in sparkling form this season and reports in Portugal have suggested United are lining up a £29 million bid for him in the January transfer window.</p>
              <p>But the Argentina international, who helped his side condemn the Red Devils to a Europa League berth when they came from behind to claim a 2-2 Champions League group stage draw at Old Trafford last month, insists he is fully focused on life at Benfica.</p>
              <p>"The interest of big clubs is not affecting my head," Gaitan told <em>O Jogo</em>. "I am calm about the rumours about Manchester United.</p>
              <p>"It is certain and obvious that some clubs are interested in me and that signifies that I am doing well, but now my mission is to work and help Benfica to be successful.</p>
              <p>"I am not desperate to be sold. I am very comfortable in Benfica because we are an excellent team and the people are happy with me.</p>
              <p>"My future? I do not want any pressure and I wait for news. If, eventually, no concrete offers appear, it's not a problem."</p>
