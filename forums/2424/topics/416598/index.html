              <p>Former Manchester United defender David May believes that <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/24529/Nemanja-Vidic"><span style="color: #225fb2;">Nemanja Vidic</span></a> and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/7825/Rio-Ferdinand"><span style="color: #225fb2;">Rio Ferdinand</span></a>'s defensive partnership is as good as that of legendary Old Trafford centre-backs <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=32"><span style="color: #225fb2;">Steve Bruce</span></a> and Gary Pallister.</p>
              <p>Bruce and Pallister marshalled United's backline together for seven years and played an integral role in United's Premier League title triumph in 1992-93, the first time the club had won the league championship in 26 years.</p>
              <p>The English pair went on to win a league and cup double in 1993-94 and 1995-96, though Bruce was plagued by injuries in the latter season, with May stepping in on a number of occasions to partner Pallister.</p>
              <p>Ferdinand and Vidic have been United's first-choice defensive partnership since the start of the 2006-07 season, after the Serbian initally endured a difficult start to his Old Trafford career following a move from Spartak Moscow in January 2006.</p>
              <p>Since then, United have won three league titles, two Carling Cups and the Champions League in 2008, with the duo forming the backbone of United's defence.</p>
              <p>And May believes that United's current centre-back pairing are just as important to United's hopes of continued success as his former team-mates.</p>
              <p>"They are massive for United," May told <em>ESPNsoccernet</em>. "You only have to go back to last season when we had all our injuries - if those two had been fit for longer, United's chances of winning the title would certainly have improved. When they were missing United never looked as strong, but now that they are back they are a pivotal part of United's trophy challenges.</p>
              <p>"It's just like watching Pally and Brucey again with them. You've got Rio in the Pally mode - a tall centre-back who loves to bring the ball out of defence at his feet, while Brucey and Vidic are both those sort of players who would run through brick walls for you. You only have to look at Brucey's face to see his commitment as a player - he's broken his nose and taken a battering - and Vidic is in the same mould."</p>
              <p>• <em>David May was talking ahead of the West Ham vs. Man Utd Carling Cup tie, when he and Clayton Blackmore will be watching the game in one lucky supporters' front room, as part of Carling's drive to improve fans' home viewing experience.
