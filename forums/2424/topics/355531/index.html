              FERGIE ON.. HIS ROW WITH THE BBC
              
              Pussycat Sir Alex Ferguson reckons the volcano went out of his temper 15 years ago - but his feud with the BBC is the Corporation's longest-running soap outside Albert Square.
              
              The Manchester United boss has not said a word to the Beeb since they broadcast an unremarkable documentary about his son Jason's transfer dealings in 2004.
              
              The only exception was his warm tribute to Sir Bobby Robson at last year's BBC Sports Personality bash - out of respect for the former England boss.
              
              In a Sky Sports interview with Sir David Frost tonight, he reveals he will loosen his tongue next season... if the BBC apologise.
              
              He said: "The thing with the BBC is they never say they are sorry. It's 2008 now... just say sorry, they were wrong. That's all they have to do and I told them that. Sometimes even the BBC has to be big enough to do that. I forgive easily. I don't hold grudges at all.
              
              "What I'm doing with the BBC isn't a grudge, it's a stance. There's nothing wrong with saying you are wrong about something - it's a quality.
              
              "I remember Gary Lineker, a bright boy from the BBC, say I'm childish... well, he should know about that himself.
              
              "He's been the subject of a lot of stuff in the media, so he will understand what childishness means because he's childish. I don't think I'm childish at all - I think it's a stance. What they did was wrong."
              
              But while Fergie's position with the Beeb has remained entrenched, Sky's revelation that the feared hairdryer has now subsided to a gentle zephyr will be a relief to United's players.
              
              Ferguson said: "I think it was Jock Stein who told me there's nothing wrong with losing your temper for the right reasons - and I think 70 to 80 per cent of the time I've done it for the right reasons. Sometimes it would be premeditated to get my point across, to keep the players' feet on the ground, but I'm going back to 15 years ago. I'm a pussycat now - I'm too old to lose my temper.
              
              "Throwing teacups? That only happened once or twice. There was a famous one with Gordon Strachan when we were playing in Romania and he wasn't listening to instructions.
              
              "I came in, there was this big tea urn and I went to smash it - and I'm not kidding you, I nearly broke my arm. I kicked the tray so hard the cups went up over the wall. Archie Knox, my assistant, was sitting there with tea running down the back of his tracksuit."
              
              And what of the famous hairdryer temper? "That was Mark Hughes who invented that phrase. After he left me, of course."
              
              Fergie claims he does not begrudge his own stars their multimillionaire status. But he knows how to keep them hungry, revealing a psychological masterstroke after United ended their 26-year title wait in 1993.
              
              "When we won the League I came out of the dressing room and I said, 'I've written three names and put them in an envelope - those are the three players who are going to let us down next season.' "The players looked at each other and said, 'It's not me!' Of course, there was never any envelope."
              
              FERGIE ON.. BEING FAN OF NEW LABOUR
              
              Labour Prime Ministers who enjoy Sir Alex Ferguson's counsel may be surprised to learn his mother once suspected him of being a Communist.
              
              Comrade Fergie was knighted in 1999 under Tony Blair's Government, and Gordon Brown (below) has even indulged his passion for history by sending 20 dvds on the American civil war from Downing Street to Old Trafford.
              
              But Fergie is still glad he got out of politics and forged a career in football after his maiden voyage on the picket line as a shop steward at the Remington Rand, a typewriter factory in Glasgow.
              
              Apprentice toolmaker Fergie admitted: "It was very much a strong trade union organisation, a very strong Communist union, when we had to make a decision whether to go on strike or not and I was vice steward at the time.
              
              "There's nine people in that toilet, in the Remington Rand, and the voting went to 4-4, so I says, 'Casting vote, we're out !' Of course, as a trade union you need a two-thirds majority, but I wasn't telling them. So we marched out of the factory under the workers' banner - and it was great. It was a bit of an adventure, and you feel a bit of a rebel, so we went on strike for six weeks.
              
              "But I came home once and my mum says, 'Your granny wants to speak to you.' She lived just round the corner, so she was a bit of a matriarch and was on top of anything you did wrong.
              
              "So I went round there and she says, 'Your mother thinks you're a Communist.' She went right through me, saying, 'You had better bloody well not be - I'd never forgive you'."
              
              FERGIE ON.. HIS UNITED SUCCESSOR
              
              Carlos Queiroz could leapfrog Old Trafford legends Roy Keane and Mark Hughes in the race to become Sir Alex Ferguson's successor at Manchester United.
              
              Former Old Trafford skipper Keane's impact in his first managerial post at Sunderland, and ex-Wales boss Hughes' conversion of Blackburn from cloggers to classy European contenders, have turned them into favourites for Fergie's throne when he steps down.
              
              But the Scot, who expects to remain in charge for a maximum of three more years, believes Queiroz is as qualified as any former United player to wear the crown.
              
              Although Fergie concedes his legion of former United stars have their supporters, he insisted: "You can't discount them, but it's not a prerequisite for the job, I'm sure of that - I mean, Matt Busby played for Manchester City, didn't he?
              
              "And you can't discountmy assistant Carlos Queiroz - he is outstanding, he's done fantastic work for the club, so that's no worse than anyone else."
              
              Fergie confirmed he does not envisage emulating former England coach Sir Bobby Robson by working beyond his 70th birthday, adding: "I'll keep my enthusiasm up, but whether I'll still be doing the football (past 70) I'm not so sure about that. No more than three years - maybe two more like the last one.
              
              "I've got to respect my wife because she's suffering. She doesn't go to the games, she's not a football fan - she watches it on Teletext. Can you believe that?
              
              "But the most important man at Manchester United is the manager - the minute that ever changed, it would mean massive freefall in the club. You can never allow players to run the club, you can never allow the supporters to run it - although they all have a massive part to play. Someone must run it, someone has to be in charge, and the manager is the best man and he has always got to be supported."
              
              FERGIE ON.. THE FAMOUS BECKS BOOT INCIDENT
              
              David Beckham scored from inside his own half when Sir Alex Ferguson was threatening to haul him off for being too flash.
              
              But even that 60-yard wonder goal against Wimbledon wasn't as freakish as his facial injury inadvertently inflicted by the Manchester United manager in the amazing case of Fergie's flying boot.
              
              Fergie has rarely spoken about the gash Beckham suffered above his left eye after a 2-0 home defeat by Arsene Wenger's Arsenal in the FA Cup five years ago.
              
              In a monumental strop afterwards, the United boss kicked a boot across the home dressing room at Old Trafford - and watched it hit Goldenballs in the face.
              
              Acknowledging the incident DID take place, Fergie reveals it was "a complete accident".
              
              "It was 10 yards away from him, or something like that. It was amazing." Ferguson, never a fan of Beckham's showbiz trappings, adopted a mood closer to self-deprecation, however, when recalling THAT incredible lob at Selhurst Park in 1996, which he ranks among the greatest goals of his 21-year reign at United.
              
              He said: "How can you forget that 60-yard goal?
              
              "You know, he tried it about 10 minutes before he scored and I said to my assistant Brian Kidd, 'If he tries that again, he's off.'
              
              "At the time, David was getting carried away a bit.
              
              "Well, you know, David could get carried away and you are always trying to keep his feet on the ground.
              
              "When the goal goes in, Kiddo turns to me and says, 'We'll have to take him off!'"
              
              FERGIE ON.. THE PREM'S FOREIGN INVASION
              
              English football's growing foreign legion is becoming a "dangerous" handicap for new national team coach Fabio Capello, warned Sir Alex Ferguson.
              
              Premier League teams featured only four English players on average in their starting line-up last season - although Fergie's Manchester United home guard included Wayne Rooney, Michael Carrick, Paul Scholes, Wes Brown, Owen Hargreaves and Rio Ferdinand.
              
              The United boss blasted title rivals Arsenal and Chelsea for their diminishing contingent of home-grown talent and said: "Is the foreign invasion dangerous? It's a dangerous thing on a team, I'm sure of that. And it reduces the capacity of the England manager to choose from all the (Premier League) teams.
              
              "If you have got Arsenal and Chelsea in particular - and this is not a criticism - he can only pick from two Arsenal players (Theo Walcott and Justin Hoyte) really.
              
              "Chelsea have got four - John Terry, Frank Lampard, Joe Cole and Ashley Cole - that's a far better proportion, but they still have a lot of foreign players.
              
              "I see the danger sign for England managers that way. But on the other side of it, I don't think the academy system in English football is the best."
              
              FERGIE ON.. THE FIGHT TO KEEP R0NALDO
              
              Cristiano Ronaldo's imminent statement about his future has not left manager Sir Alex Ferguson in a sweat - because he is already "more than confident" the winger will stay at Manchester United.
              
              Double Footballer of the Year Ronaldo (left) a Â£100million target for Real Madrid, has said he will make a decision before Portugal's Euro 2008 campaign starts on Saturday.
              
              But Fergie expects the phoney war with Real to have a happy ending for United fans and said: "I'm very confident - it's a game they (Real Madrid) play all the time.
              
              "In the past they have done it with David Beckham, they have done it with Ruud van Nistelrooy and they even took our fitness coach away from us last summer, so we're used to it.
              
              "It's a great compliment to the standard of the players we have but I'm more than confident Ronaldo will be here next year.
              
              "We have very determined directors in the Glazer family, who will not be messed around in this situation. And chief executive David Gill is of the same mind, so the core structure of Manchester United - in terms of the people who run the club - are all adamant.
              
              "We want Cristiano to stay for a long time and we have rewarded that. He is on a fantastic contract and rightly so - he's the best player in the world and he deserves to be recognised in the monetary sense."
