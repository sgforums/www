            <div class='col-md body'>United legend Sir Bobby Charlton believes Cristiano Ronaldo is in the greatest form of his life.<br><br>After firing United's equaliser at Reading on Saturday, the Portuguese winger produced another impressive display on his return to his homeland on Tuesday night, helping United to a 1-0 Champions League win over Benfica.<br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson had earlier saluted Ronaldo's early season form, naming the 21-year-old as United's best player so far this term. Sir Bobby has since added his own glowing endorsement of the winger and believes Ronaldo is currently at the peak of his powers.<br><br>"He's playing better than ever now at the club," Sir Bobby told Sky Sports News. "He's learning not to do the really difficult things. If the simple thing is on he'll do that, but put him round about the 18-yard box, one against one, and defenders have a problem. He's a great talent and he's still only young.<br><br>"I remember when I first saw him in a European youth tournament," recalled the United legend. "I was on holiday somewhere and I watched a Portuguese match that was on with these young lads. I remember saying 'wow'.<br><br>"I was a bit like a lot of people and thought some of the stepovers were a bit over the top. But there was an end product. I thought what a talent and excitement if you could just harness it."<br><br>Sir Bobby has also been impressed with the way Ronaldo has handled the constant jeering from away fans following his supposed involvement in Wayne Rooney's World Cup dismissal.<br><br>"I think he feels welcome here at United," declared Sir Bobby. "He'll get over this little thing where the odd few people boo him because of what happened in the World Cup.<br><br>"He's put that behind him, he doesn't worry about it at all. He's shaken hands with Wayne Rooney, he's apologised and you move on.<br><br>"But they'll keep trying. At the end of the day he seems to thrive on it, it gives him a challenge of trying to keep them quiet and he does that by scoring goals," he added.<br><br><a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA%2D9A47%2D47BC%2DB069%2D3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=366513" rel="nofollow">http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA%2D9A47%2D47BC%2DB069%2D3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=366513</a></div>
