              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Even Sir Alex Ferguson would admit David de Gea will face the sternest test of his young Premier League life at Bolton.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">An £18million summer signing from Atletico Madrid, 20-year-old De Gea has endured a difficult start to life at Manchester United.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Ferguson had to defend the Spain Under 21 star for his performance in the Community Shield at Wembley.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">
              </span></p><p>But while an argument on De Gea's behalf could be made over Manchester City's two goals, there was nothing anyone could say to lessen the impact of an error that gifted West Brom an equaliser in the opening game of the season.</p>
              <p>Since then, things have got better for De Gea.</p>
              <p>He kept a clean sheet against Tottenham on his competitive Old Trafford bow, then contributed an excellent penalty save to the astonishing 8-2 win over Arsenal, even if Theo Walcott's goal did fly through his legs.</p>
              <p>Next up are Bolton, who may no longer be quite as abrasive as before under the stewardship of Owen Coyle but, with Kevin Davies leading their attack, are well capable of making life very difficult for De Gea.</p>
              
              <p>
              </p><p>'David made a couple of mistakes in his first games, which we didn't expect and nor did he,' Ferguson said. 'It was unusual because his form at Atletico Madrid as an 18-year-old was sensational.</p>
              <p>'There is no doubt we have a player of great potential. Our job at this club is to realise that potential and make sure he becomes a top goalkeeper.'</p>
              <p>In the interview with Inside United, he added: 'He'll do that once he gains experience and adapt to the physical nature of the league. It is a different game here compared to Spain - there are more crosses to deal with and there is more contact. Bit by bit, we will get there with him.'</p>
              <p>Ferguson's comments could have been made with Bolton in mind.<br></p>

              <p><strong>David de Gea accepts that it is normal that he should be criticised in the press for his shaky start as </strong><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester United" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span></a><strong>'s new goalkeeper but is confident in his ability to be a key member of Sir Alex Ferguson's team.</strong></p>
              <p>The Spanish keeper was deemed to be at fault for both Manchester City's goals in the Community Shield and was also criticised for the one conceded against West Bromwich Albion in the Premier League. Eyebrows were also raised when he let Theo Walcott's effort through his legs in the 8-2 hammering of Arsenal.</p>
              <p>However, he is unfazed by the criticism that has come his way. "No, it seems normal to me," he said. "When you do things wrong, even though it's a [just] couple of mistakes, the press has every right to criticise you. Especially when you're a goalkeeper, who is always under the spotlight. What happened is something normal and no big deal. Now it's in my hands to change those early negative criticisms into praise."</p>
              <p>De Gea believes he can turn things round by "improving in every training session and in every match, but above all keeping intact my confidence in my abilities and in what I can bring to the team. I'm surrounded by very good people and that means that we can do big things this year. We have to have faith and belief that we can do it. Only that way will I continue to grow as a goalkeeper and having the necessary confidence to become a key player."</p>
              <p>Off the pitch the transition for the 20-year-old who joined from Atlético Madrid for £19m in the summer has been smooth. He says his English is coming along and he describes his new club as "incredible".</p>
              <p>"The club, the supporters, the facilities, the atmosphere, it's all out of this world. All my team-mates are very open, there's a very good atmosphere, and that makes it much easier to integrate. I'm very happy because from the first day I've felt like just one more within the group. They help me with everything and that's pleasing." He added that he was impressed by witnessing Ferguson's personality up close – but surprised by his friendliness.</p>
              <p>De Gea is not expecting to displace Iker Casillas or Pepe Reina in the Spanish national team any time soon, claiming that Spanish goalkeeping is experiencing "the best moment in its history", but notes that he is still eligible for the Under-21s and expects to gather more international experience with them.</p>
