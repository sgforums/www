              <h1>United In Bust-Up With Chelsea Ground Staff</h1>
              <h2>Several of Manchester United's substitutes became embroiled in a
              tussle with Chelsea ground staff while warming down after their 2-1
              defeat to the Blues...</h2>
              <p>It is alleged that the argument started when the players, in the
              process of a warm-down, were asked to move by the ground staff but
              refused. What was said from there on is not quite clear, but things
              quickly turned into a wrestling match, and the groups required
              separating by stewards.<br><br>After being separated, the peace did not
              last long. The spat resurfaced soon after, though there was no more
              physical altercation.</p>
              <p>What consequence this will have for the ground staff and the Red
              Devils remains to be seen, as it is not quite clear who provoked whom
              and who will be held accountable for the incident.</p>

              <h1>Rio Issues Apology To Stewardess</h1>
              <h2>Manchester United has apologised to a steward he kicked by accident and has planned to send her flowers...</h2>
              <p>The defender kicked out toward the end of Manchester United's 2-1
              defeat at title rivals Chelsea, a game settled by a late penalty
              converted by Michael Ballack.</p>
              <p>Ferdinand explained that he was kicking the wall out of frustration,
              and when he realised he had made contact with the steward he apologised
              and plans to send flowers to her as a token of his appreciation upon
              her accepting the apology.</p>
              <p>A statement from Ferdinand released through the club read: "I kicked
              the wall in frustration at the result as I have done in the past.</p>
              <p>"Unfortunately a lady was stood by and I accidentally brushed her
              with my foot. I went back to make sure she was okay and apologised
              profusely.</p>
              <p>"Credit to her she laughed it off and was very understanding. She said she wasn't hurt.</p>
              <p>"I have arranged for a bouquet of flowers to be sent to her."</p>

              <h1>Positive News On Vidic &amp; Rooney</h1>
              <h2>Manchester United may have lost to Chelsea this afternoon, but
              there is some good news on the horizon in that both Nemanja Vidic and
              Wayne Rooney are expected to be ready for Tuesday's Champions League
              chash against Barcelona.</h2>
              <p>Vidic took a blow to his face during a clash with Didier Drogba,
              while Wayne Rooney fell awkwardly on his injured hip diring the
              Stamford Bridge clash.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson has confirmed that the Serb has lost a tooth and
              some blood, but suggested that he could well have come back on today
              itself.</p>
              <p>“He got kneed in the face by Drogba - and no foul was given," said
              Sir Alex, speaking to MUTV. "He’s got a few stitches under his lip and
              he’s lost a tooth.</p>
              <p>"He was dazed rather than concussed but if we’d waited for him to
              come round we would have played 10 or 15 minutes with ten men and you
              can’t afford that in such a big game. So we took him off."</p>
              <p>The centre-half is almost certain to be ready in time for Tuesday's
              game. Rooney's case is slightly more worrying after he aggravated an
              old injury, btu Fergie remains hopeful.</p>
              <p>"Wayne got the same knock as he got last week, straight on the hip bone," said Sir Alex. <br><br>"It
              takes a while for that to clear because when you get a bang on it, it’s
              very painful. I’m hopeful he will be alright for Tuesday's match
              against Barcelona.<br><br>"Other than that, I think everyone’s okay."</p>
