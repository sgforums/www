              <p>the truth is, MUFC just needs to win the next two games against WestHam and Wigan irregardless of this game results.</p>
              <p>unless Chelsea can win next two games 10-0, 10-0.. but then with Roman, nothing is impossible.</p>

              <p>I am not sure if United can win this match... The best we can hope for is a draw i think cos don't forget, United are playing on late wed night... and this match comes on early sat... The problem i feel is the United players won't have enough rest to play to the fullest... Chelsea players gets one day extra since playing on a tue and they will have enought time preparing for Pool on wed whereas United will suffer again having to play Barce on next tue...</p>
              <p>The other thing advantage to Chelsea is they didn't need to travel too far for their match against Pool, United players have to travel from bus to airport, catch a plane, check in, all those things that could add up to match fitness not at their highest level...</p>
              <p>I honest feel that if United lose at Chelsea, they won't win the title cos I doubt they can get 6 points in their last 2 matches against teams like West Ham and away to Wigan with the added pressure. So a win or at worst a draw will see them retain the EPL title.</p>

              <p><br>Not pessimistic, just being realistic thats all... Yes, If United can win at the Bridge, it would be great, I would be happy... But i am saying if they can't even get a draw at the very least... there could really be serious problems...</p>
              <p>Yes indeed West Ham did beat United, I think they did the double over them last season... And so far they have already beaten United this season with Tevez in the United side as well... All i am saying is... there is a strange thing in football that sometimes its hard to explain... Like why Bolton always give Arsenal problems, Pool always seem to do well in European matches,  Brad Friedel always perform like a man possessed whenever he plays against United... These are things that we cannot discount altogether so as just to comfort ourselves... When you think about it, Ronaldo hardly miss penalties but earlier this season he did missed one and it was against none other than West Ham... Strange right, but stranger things have happened.</p>
              <p>Having faith is a good thing but misplacing it is not... Looking at the big picture and understanding the risk of the pitfalls would be a better approach. Mentioning about West Ham, United have lost their last 3 meetings regardless of where they played or who they have on their team...</p>
              <p>Wigan... well we can look at it this way, if they are still in the drop zone... you can be sure they are going to fight like hell... Or if they are safe, they may want to play their best football (without pressure) infront of their home fans for the last time this season... Either way lose lose situation... Thats why i say, winning at the Bridge is very important or at least a draw so that it will demoralize the chelsea players in some ways...</p>

All i am saying is... there is a strange thing in football that sometimes its hard to explain... Like why Bolton always give Arsenal problems, Pool always seem to do well in European matches,  Brad Friedel always perform like a man possessed whenever he plays against United... These are things that we cannot discount altogether so as just to comfort ourselves... When you think about it, Ronaldo hardly miss penalties but earlier this season he did missed one and it was against none other than West Ham... Strange right, but stranger things have happened.</p>
              <p>Having faith is a good thing but misplacing it is not... Looking at the big picture and understanding the risk of the pitfalls would be a better approach. Mentioning about West Ham, United have lost their last 3 meetings regardless of where they played or who they have on their team...</p>
              <p>Wigan... well we can look at it this way, if they are still in the drop zone... you can be sure they are going to fight like hell... Or if they are safe, they may want to play their best football (without pressure) infront of their home fans for the last time this season... Either way lose lose situation... Thats why i say, winning at the Bridge is very important or at least a draw so that it will demoralize the chelsea players in some ways...</p>

              <p><strong>Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson has revealed Nemanja Vidic is likely to miss Saturday's Premier League title showdown with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.</strong></p>
              <p>The defender received hospital treatment for a stomach problem on Tuesday and was forced out of Manchester United's goalless draw with Barcelona on Wednesday night.</p>
              <p>Ferguson confirmed Vidic had a stomach infection and is unlikely to return against Chelsea. "He was 24, 36 hours without eating," the United boss explained. "He had some soup this afternoon, but wasn't ready to play. I don't think he'll be ready for Saturday, that's the situation, it's a stomach infection, (although) we don't know what kind of infection it is.</p>
              <p>He added: "Yesterday before training, he had very severe stomach pains, so we sent him off to a hospital only about a mile away. "We felt that was the best place for him to go. He was kept in until late at night and then they let him go."</p>

              <h2>CECH FIRES UNITED WARNING</h2>
              <div id="printsaveline"></div>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Petr Cech is confident Chelsea can keep up their excellent home form and pull level with Manchester United at the top of the Premier League on Saturday. The Blues face United at Stamford Bridge knowing that realistically they need three points to keep their title challenge alive. There will be just two more Premier League games after this weekend and United's superior goal difference makes them favourites to finish as champions.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But Cech is determined to maintain the pressure on United and is looking to play his part in a Chelsea victory by keeping a clean sheet. "Every game now is like a final. Personally I play football to play in the big games and this is an exciting time for everyone," the goalkeeper told the <em>Daily Star</em>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"The Premier League is getting towards the end and after Saturday we can be neck-and-neck with Man United. "Of course, United score the most goals in the league - they have got the attacking threat. But we have got a pretty good record at Stamford Bridge, so we hope to keep that going. "I always like playing against United with their top players - you know you will have some work to do. When you keep a clean sheet against such an attacking team it is great."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Chelsea could also meet United in the final of the UEFA Champions League if they come through their respective semi-finals against Liverpool and Barcelona. Cech added: "It would be great to meet them in Moscow in the European Cup final, for many reasons, because it's always an entertaining game Chelsea versus Man United - and this time it would be the final of the Champions League. "You know the passion of English fans, so I think it would be a great occasion. Can we beat them twice? We will see. Can we start to dream? I am not dreaming yet."</p>

              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>Riise fluke will energise Blues</strong></p>
              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>MANCHESTER UNITED have not won at Stamford Bridge since April 2002. They have not scored there since Ryan Giggs notched the second in a 2-2 draw the following August. Going backwards from last season, their results have been 0-0, 0-3, 0-0 (League Cup), 0-1 and 0-1.</strong></p>
              <p class="article">Not the most encouraging news at a time when United appear to be staggering towards the title finishing line. Like the bloke who has enjoyed an exceedingly good night out, they know the way home but the personal sat-nav is a little on the blink. But they are going to have to sober up by Saturday. Or else Chelsea will beat them and produce a communal anxiety attack all the way from Gatley to Guildford.</p>
              <p class="article">The Red Devils have been swaggering around Europe and lording it in the Premier League all season. They have been a delight to watch and have drawn applause and appreciation everywhere they go. Well, if a week is a long time in politics, two days is an eternity in football. Because that is the speed with which the epic confrontation between the Premier League’s top two at the Bridge has taken on a totally different dimension.</p>
              <p class="article">Before Tuesday night’s events at Anfield, few doubted United’s ability to salvage at least a point tomorrow and, to all intents and purposes, close out the title race. In fact, that was still the prevailing thought after 94 minutes and 39 seconds of Chelsea’s Champions League semi-final first-leg clash with Liverpool.</p>
              <p class="article">Then came the John Arne Riise own goal — and the whole dynamic changed. That it was a huge stroke of luck — nothing more than a fluke — is now neither here nor there. What it has done is send a huge adrenalin rush through everyone at Chelsea. A belief they can still catch United has not so much been rekindled as sparked into a huge, blazing fire.</p>
              <p class="article">Yes, they will not be able to call on midfielder Frank Lampard. But even without him, Chelsea will be more than enough of a proposition for United, their ranks reinforced by the return from suspension of Michael Essien. After a massively disappointing game at Anfield, Joe Cole will certainly be hell-bent on producing a performance on Saturday.</p>
              <p class="article">The same goes for striker Didier Drogba, who got nothing out of Jamie Carragher — and a flea in the ear from a mocking Kop for all his theatrics. Chelsea, in fact, will be more ‘up’ for this game than any other this season. Four days later comes the return with Liverpool. Again at the Bridge, the Fort Knox of football.</p>
              <p class="article">Two home games that could define a season — on a pitch where they have not been beaten for <strong>EIGHTY</strong> league matches. Some 24 hours after Chelsea got out of jail at Anfield, United scrapped their way to a goalless draw at the Nou Camp.</p>
              <p class="article">Since Barcelona should have won, United will be happy enough. And yet there was a lethargy about the display that suggested the Herculean effort it had taken to beat Arsenal — sandwiched either side by two strength-sapping draws at Boro and Blackburn — might be taking its toll.</p>
              <p class="article">Yes, there were fine individual exhibitions from Rio Ferdinand, Patrice Evra, Michael Carrick and, in the first half, Cristiano Ronaldo. But as a team effort it fell short of what Alex Ferguson was looking for. Wayne Rooney and Carlos Tevez were uncharacteristically quiet in what one regular United watcher called a bit of a return to the bad, old days.</p>
              <p class="article">Poor ball retention and scarcely a shot to worry Victor Valdes. If United’s performance did anything, it was to make Barca believe they can win the tie. Now United head for West London and a hugely physical battle with outstanding athletes like Essien, Drogba, John Obi Mikel, John Terry, Ricardo Carvalho and Claude Makelele.</p>
              <p class="article">It is precisely the sort of game they <strong>DON’T</strong> want.</p>
