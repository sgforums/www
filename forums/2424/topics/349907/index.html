              <p>Inter manager Jose Mourinho has taken time out to pay tribute to
              Ryan Giggs who he believes is the greatest player ever to grace the
              Premier League.</p>
              <p>Since breaking into the Manchester United first team as a
              17-year-old, Giggs has gone on to win ten Premier League titles and two
              Champions League titles and also holds the club’s appearance record,
              having surpassed Sir Bobby Charlton’s landmark last season.<br><br>“What can you say about a man who has won ten Premier League titles? The proof is in his medals," Mourinho told the <em>Sunday Mirror</em>.<br><br>“Yes, maybe we are talking about the greatest Premier League player of all time.<br><br>“At the very least no player has contributed so much to a single Premier League club as Ryan Giggs has to Manchester United.”<br><br>Of
              course Mourinho knows Giggs well after spending three years in the
              Premier League with Chelsea and the two also came face-to-face in the
              Champions League in midweek. <br><br>The Welshman has been partially
              reinvented as a central midfielder this season, to save his ageing
              legs, and Mourinho lauded this decision.<br><br>“He has found new life
              in central midfield this season, and I think that has been very
              important for United’s season,” explained the Inter boss.<br><br>“At
              35, he is going to have lost some of his pace, of course - but Sir Alex
              has been very clever playing him in a new position and like we have
              seen in the past with players like Zola, Bergkamp and Zidane - quality
              shines through beyond age.”<br><br>Mourinho will come up against Giggs
              in the second leg of their Champions League tie at Old Trafford on
              Wednesday evening and he tipped the veteran to outshine his younger
              team-mates in United's bid for more silverware.<br><br>“They have their young, wonderful players like Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney,” said Mourinho. <br><br>“But who knows, maybe it will be Giggs who makes the difference for them in the Premier and Europe this season.”</p>
