              <p>Carlos Tevez has spoken out to reveal that his Manchester United exit, confirmed today, was inevitable as soon as Dimitar Berbatov was signed from Tottenham Hotspur last September.</p>
              <p><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2009/5/16/1242490473448/Man-Utd.-league-champions-018.jpg"><img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2009/5/16/1242490473448/Man-Utd.-league-champions-018.jpg" alt="Man Utd. league champions: Carlos Tevez fans" width="288" height="428"></a><br><br>"I did not feel supported after they [United] signed Berbatov 
                because I was the man for the job he was bought to do," <em>The Daily Telegraph</em> reports him as saying.</p>
              <p>"[United manager Alex] Ferguson told me not to be worried about Berbatov's arrival, but I did not 
                like it when he started to put me on the bench often. I gave my life for the 
                Manchester United shirt.</p>
              <p>"Last year, I was the second top-scorer after Cristiano [Ronaldo]. We won 
                two titles [the Premier League and the Carling Cup] and being shut out like 
                this was something that I could not understand.</p>
              <p>"When I arrived I had to fight for a place like any other player. My 
                first season was good. I was a starter or a substitute, but I respected 
                that.</p>
              <p>"But in my second year, after the match against Liverpool [on September 13], 
                the coach started to overlook me."</p>
              <p>Tevez is reported by <em>The Telegraph</em> as being ready to join Manchester City on July 1, after a protracted and complex transfer saga, further confused by his <a id="KonaLink0" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;" href="http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/85/england/2009/06/26/1348736/tevez-berbatovs-arrival-forced-my-manchester-united-exit#"><span style="color: #0464d1;"><span class="kLink" style="color: #0464d1 ! important; font-family: Verdana,Arial; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">loan</span></span></a> status at Old Trafford due to being 'owned' by a company.</p>
              <p>However,
              he was pleased to have enjoyed the continued support of the United fans
              throughout the course of the last season, concluding, "The fans
              supported me a lot so I thought that something was going on as my
              performances were also good. I was a professional."</p>

              we also know lol.
              
              in 99 treble season, fergie formation is always 4-4-2, like yorke and cole partnership.
              
              why in 2001 after veron arrival, he changed to 4-5-1 formation, always preferring an extra midfielder than a striker.
              
              if he play 4-4-2, tevez can partner with berbatov with ronaldo and rooney on the flanks mah.
