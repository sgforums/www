            <div class='col-md body'><strong>MICHAEL Carrick believes it will be far tougher task for Manchester United to retain their Barclays Premier League crown than it was to win it in the first place.</strong><br><br>With the seasonal opener against Reading on August 12 inching ever closer, the Red Devils began their pre-season programme with an encouraging 2-2 draw against J-League champions Urawa Red Diamonds.<br><br>The result came without the involvement of Sir Alex Ferguson's three major summer signings as both Owen Hargreaves and Nani are carrying minor knocks which will keep them sidelined until next week, while Brazilian youngster Anderson is on a short break following the Copa America.<br><br>And Carrick felt there were enough positive signs in Saitama to remain confident United are capable of meeting the renewed threat provided by Chelsea, Liverpool and Arsenal.<br><br>"It is going to be tough to win the league this season, tougher than it was last year," said the England midfielder.<br><br>"We know just how hard it will be. Everyone will improve. But we are desperate to win it again and feel we will be better ourselves.<br><br>"Once you win one trophy, it is not so much that you want to win more, it is that you expect to."<br><br>In theory, Hargreaves' arrival is bad news for Carrick.<br><br>Although Paul Scholes' involvement may be reduced slightly this term, it is difficult to envisage Ferguson being prepared to enter a major battle without a player who has been such a major influence at Old Trafford for over a decade.<br><br><strong>Preferred</strong><br><br>So, unless the United boss abandons his preferred four-man midfield in favour of something more fluid, Carrick may be facing a straight fight with Hargreaves for a starting spot.<br><br>"The manager has not said anything to us yet about the way he intends to use us all," said Carrick.<br><br>"At the moment, we are just trying to get as fit as we can.<br><br>"It doesn't really matter anyway. Regardless of who has signed this summer, you have to be at your best to play for Manchester United.<br><br>"The more world-class players we have the more it will benefit us.<br><br>"It is a long season and we will be playing a lot of games.<br><br>"There will be times when you are out of the side. But when you are in, you will have to play well.<br><br>"Everyone is raring to go. There is a big challenge out there for us this season."<br><br>After completing the Japanese leg of their four-game Far East tour, Ferguson and his team flew to Seoul - and a reunion with injured South Korean Park Ji-Sung - in the knowledge their bid to land Carlos Tevez has struck further problems.<br><br>With West Ham denying the Red Devils permission for Tevez to undergo a medical, they have signalled an intention - backed by the Premier League - to play hardball over the player's registration, suggesting United legal expert Maurice Watkins may have his work cut out to find a solution in time for the Argentina star to play any meaningful part in his club's pre-season programme.</div>
