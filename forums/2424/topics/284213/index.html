            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Boss salutes defensive starlets<br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson was delighted with UnitedÂ’s convincing 4-0 victory over Wigan Athletic, and had particular words of praise for youngsters Gerard Pique and Danny Simpson who were thrown into the action.</strong><br><br>Pique started the match at right-back, but switched to the centre to partner Rio Ferdinand just before the half hour mark after both Nemanja Vidic and John O'Shea had gone off injured.<br><br>As a result, Simpson was introduced in the 29th minute and the 20-year-old defender came of age during only his second appearance for the club, adding an assist to his name following his excellent cross for Wayne Rooney for United's fourth goal.<br><br>Â“Danny's a very confident boy,Â” Sir Alex told MUTV. Â“HeÂ’s so quick and is a tremendous defender. HeÂ’s improving his technique all the time and he is one of the players that I would not consider going on loan this year because heÂ’s valuable to us.<br><br>"Pique also came in today and was absolutely outstanding. He was one our best players against Coventry [in the Carling Cup] and is improving all the time."<br><br>Carlos Tevez opened the scoring for United on 54 minutes after shaking off two Wigan defenders before calmly slotting past Chris Kirkland.<br><br>Â“The challenges were coming in first from Kilbane and then from the goalkeeper but he kept his nerve, which I think is the most important thing in that situation, and composed himself enough for a  good finish,Â” added Sir Alex.<br><br>Â“Wigan set their stall out with one up as most teams are doing. But we got the spark in the second half and earned a good victory.Â”<br><br>Cristiano Ronaldo capped a fine performance with the next two goals on 59 and 76 minutes, before Wayne Rooney completed the rout after another clinical move.<br><br>Â“It was only his second headed goal for us,Â” acknowledged the United manager. Â“Wayne should get more [headers] because heÂ’s a good header of the ball. It was a great move and fantastic ball in from Danny Simpson.<br><br>Â“ThatÂ’s three in three games for Ronaldo and someone said to me Â‘do you really think heÂ’ll score more than 20?Â’ WeÂ’ll just have to see, but I certainly hope so.Â”</div>
