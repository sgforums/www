              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">MICHAEL CARRICK will be allowed to leave by Manchester United in the summer.</h2>
              <p>The ex-Spurs star has just 18 months left on his contract and there are no plans to offer him a new one.</p>
              <p>Carrick, 29, had an inconsistent first half to this season and only a
               marked improvement will prompt a change of mind by the management.</p>
              <p>Old Trafford boss Alex Ferguson increasingly sees Darren Fletcher, 
              26, and Anderson, 24, as his central midfield partnership for the 
              future.</p>
              <p>It looked like Carrick's United career was going to be cut even 
              shorter after a poor performance in the 2009 Champions League Final.</p>
              <p>Fergie was furious with that 2-0 defeat to Barcelona.</p>
              <p>This season Carrick has struggled as United, while remaining unbeaten, have only fleetingly found their very best form.</p>
              <p>He has never grown into the player United envisaged after buying him for £14million from Tottenham in 2006.</p>
              <p>Carrick has started 19 of United's 32 games this season and is 
              determined to prove he is worth a new deal. But it is a battle he is 
              losing right now.</p>
              <p>United take on Birmingham at home tomorrow as they aim to stay top with games in hand on their nearest rivals.</p>

              <p><strong>Micheal Carrick will open talks about staying at Manchester United after the January transfer window. </strong></p>
              <p>The 29-year-old midfielder has found his form after a slow start to the season and plans are in place to discuss updating his current deal, which has 18 months to run.</p>
              <p>United will decide which of the players nearing the end of their deals that they want to keep.</p>
              <p>Brazilian Anderson has already signed a new long-term contract, while the club are trying to persuade Patrice Evra to stay despite interest from Real Madrid.</p>
              <p>Of those out of contract this summer, offers will be on the table for Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes but Edwin van der Sar, Owen Hargreaves, Wes Brown, Michael Owen and Gary Neville will be allowed to leave.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>although his form sucks for the past 2 seasons and he continue to be weak in tackles and challengers, but he is an english, in itself is a commodity due the rules. if he renew his contract, he can contribute for the next 2-3 seasons yet, but use him sparingly if he doesnt perform.</p></div>

              <p>yep, everyone is spotlighting him since his poor performance in barca game.</p>
              <p>if U read other forums, most fans are happy to see him leave.</p>
              <p>if he really leaves, MUFC should retire #16 la.. the stress of wearing the number is not easy.</p>

              <p>It's not the stress of the number la, I think no one really cares how well Owen performs when he was handed the more important number 7 leh.</p>
              <p>It's just that he's getting old and slower than he already was, where he was already very slow. His passing also went downhill after the first season. I say United should cash in on him while he's still worth some penny.</p>
              <p>Ask Sunderland to grab this bargain la, or best, use him as a pawn to buy Henderson. Sunderland just loveeeee United players: Yorke, Andy Cole, Richardson, Bardsley, Fraizer Campbell, Welbeck, Jonny Evans etc. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="16"></p>

              <p>Using Giggs, and various other old players as example. I really do not think age has anything to do with this.</p>
              <p>I hope he can regain that confidence and vision like he did in the beginning, which is why he was brought over in the first place. If not I'd rather see Fletcher and Anderson on more often.</p>
              <p>Gibson... one game play like star, another game play like flop. Then again, he's still considerably young, won't know in the future. He might be another Fletcher (not in terms of skill), sit back and wait for his chance and continue to grow and train while waiting.</p>
