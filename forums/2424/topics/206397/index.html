            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Alan Smith completed over an hour against Preston as United stormed into the second round of the Lancashire Senior Cup with a brilliant second half display.</strong><br><br>The 25-year-old striker continued his recovery from a broken leg and dislocated ankle with a solid display at Deepdale, and showed no adverse effects to his return.<br><br>Preston, who had gone in level at half-time despite Chris Eagles giving United the lead after just three minutes, were blown away by the Reds' attacking prowess after the interval, succumbing to second half goals from Giuseppe Rossi (2), Danny Rose, Phil Marsh (2) and David Jones.<br><br>The Lancashire Cup was the only trophy the Reserves failed to win last season, having slipped out to Oldham Athletic in the first round, and they quickly set about ensuring there would be no repeat this year.<br><br>Eagles fired Brian McClair's side ahead, winding through the North End defence before slotting calmly home. But Preston drew level on the stroke of half-time through Brian Stock's low, long-range drive, although Smith could have restored United's advantage immediately.<br><br>When presented with a sight of goal by Liam Miller's through-ball, however, Smith lashed his chance into the side netting - a forgivable miss after over six months out of action.<br><br>After a keenly contested first 45, United emerged for the second-half and regained the lead within 10 minutes.<br><br>Serial goalscorer Rossi was the man who restored the advantage, lashing an unstoppable right-footed effort into the top corner from just inside the area.<br><br>Five minutes later United were two goals clear, this time the impressive Rose lashed home a cross-cum-shot from the left-hand side of the area.<br><br>Within a minute Preston had pulled a goal back through Lewis Neal, only for Rossi to smash home his second on 64 minutes following good wingplay from Eagles.<br><br>Although cruelly without the goal he deserved in the first-team's pre-season, the Italian striker can take some solace in the fact that this was his 59th goal in 58 Reserves starts.<br><br>Smith then departed the action to be replaced by Sean Evans, and Rossi was denied the chance of a hat-trick as he was replaced by Marsh on 74 minutes. Almost immediately Marsh slotted home clinically from Eagles' pass.<br><br>With the hosts now totally demoralised, United added further goals - first through Jones' run and low shot, then as Marsh pounced on a poor clearance from North End keeper Andy Lonergan.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>United:</strong> Heaton, Lee, Rose, R Jones, Shawcross, Miller, Eagles, D Jones, Smith (S Evans, 66), Rossi (Marsh, 74), Mullan (Barnes, 7<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">.<br><strong>Substitutes:</strong> Zieler, Burns, Ngalula.</span><br><br><a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA%2D9A47%2D47BC%2DB069%2D3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=356892" rel="nofollow">http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA%2D9A47%2D47BC%2DB069%2D3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=356892</a></div>
