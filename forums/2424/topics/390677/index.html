              <p class="introcopy">Gary Neville and Clarence Seedorf have cranked up the tension ahead of tomorrow’s Champions League showdown between AC Milan and Manchester United. <a href="http://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/posts/view/158049/Pato-main-threat-in-post-Kaka-era"><span style="color: #2a166d;">Milan</span></a> midfielder <a href="http://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/posts/view/25037/Seedorf-Italy-lacking-leadership"><span style="color: #2a166d;">Seedorf</span></a> dismissed<a href="http://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/football/teams/8/Manchester-United"><span style="color: #2a166d;"> Manchester United</span></a> as “outsiders” while Neville said his team will not be distracted by facing old boy David Beckham.</p>

              <div class="padding7north" style="font-size: 12px; margin: 4px 5px 4px 0px; line-height: 17px; text-align: justify;">
              <p class="storycopy">United have reached the last two Champions League finals, but Seedorf believes they are not the same force without Cristiano Ronaldo, Carlos Tevez and the injured Nemanja Vidic.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">He said: “United are one of the outsiders to win the competition. Chelsea are my favourites to win the European Cup this season.”</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Seedorf, a four-time winner of the competition, believes Beckham will cope with the pressure and emotion of facing his old club.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">He added: “He has coped with pressure throughout his career. I hope people will applaud him.”</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Neville says United will not get caught up in the publicity circus that will surround Beckham over the two legs.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">And though he remains one of Beckham’s best friends and was best man at his wedding, there will be no room for sentiment.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Neville said: “It won’t be that strange really to line up against him. We have played against former team-mates like my brother Phil and Nicky Butt, so you get used to it.”</p>
