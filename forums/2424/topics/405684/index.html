              <div class="thinCenter"><em>Trust in youth: Sir Alex will once again rely on his youngsters for success</em></div>
              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1295741" rel="1295741|3| nofollow" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1295741/Alex-Ferguson-talks-Manchester-United-youngsters--HAS-play-cash-tight.html"></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>As Sir Alex Ferguson disappeared into Toronto’s Rogers Centre on the back of a buggy, he had every reason to be happy.</strong></p>
              <p>A Ferguson family reunion in Ontario had been followed by a satisfying win over Celtic, and the manager could afford a cheery smile as prepared for Manchester United’s trip to Philadelphia and the next stage of their North American tour.</p>
              <p>Particularly pleasing was the sight of the youngsters in whom he has placed such faith combining with the likes of Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes and Dimitar Berbatov to give United a 3-1 win over Celtic.</p>
              <p>Not even a silly foul by new boy Chris Smalling which gifted the Scots a penalty could dampen Ferguson’s praise as he talked up the merits of a new generation. ‘We’ve a strong belief in their abilities,’ he said. ‘They will eventually be the next Manchester United.’</p>
              <p>It has become a familiar message. For the second summer in a row he insists there is no value in the transfer market. No reason to spend unwisely or waste the £80million which is supposedly still in the bank following the sale of Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>
              <p>But has Ferguson really chosen to be much more prudent or is there no money left as the club creak under the weight of debt heaped on it by the Glazer family?</p>
              <p>This, after all, is a manager who has broken the British transfer record six times, who decided Berbatov was good value at £30.75m and Juan Sebastian Veron at £28.1m.</p>
              <p>Last summer he brought in Antonio Valencia, Gabriel Obertan and Michael Owen at a net cost of £19m — although the latter arrived on a free transfer.</p>
              <p>United had just won a third straight Barclays Premier League title and reached the Champions League final, and there seemed very little wrong with the squad.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/18/article-1295741-0A720608000005DC-834_468x341.jpg" alt="Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson" width="468" height="341"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><em>Bright outlook: Sir Alex is confident of success despite huge debts heaped on the club by the Glazers</em></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><br></div>
              <p><strong>But after relinquishing the title to Chelsea at the end of a season that saw the growing threat from neighbours City, and seeing his side exit Europe at the quarter-final stage, the situation has changed for Ferguson.</strong></p>
              <p>Yet his stance is the same. He insists there is cash to spend, and it is a view supported by United’s last accounts which showed £95.9m on the balance sheet.</p>
              <p>But there is a growing concern that cash will be needed to service the Glazers’ debts and Ferguson’s reliance on youth is born out of necessity rather than choice.</p>
              <p>While £10m for Smalling is far from insignificant, and £7m has been spent on Javier Hernandez, United again look unlikely to break the £20m barrier, with Ferguson promoting from the youth ranks.</p>
              <p>He said: ‘We have a collection of young players who have been growing up at the club like Danny Welbeck, Jonny Evans, Darron Gibson, and Federico Macheda.</p>
              <p>‘If you don’t give them a chance they’re going to stagnate and move to other clubs who’ll get the benefit of the work we’ve done.’</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/18/article-1295741-0A7D5198000005DC-670_468x286.jpg" alt="when united were big spenders.jpg" width="468" height="286"></div>
              <p><strong>Premier League history suggests clubs who spend the most usually succeed.</strong></p>
              <p>Blackburn did it with Jack Walker, Chelsea with Roman Abramovich, and now City are making their bid. It is 15 years since Ferguson bucked the trend, pitching United’s new golden generation into the spotlight and reaping instant rewards.</p>
              <p>The question now is whether their modern-day equivalents can emulate Beckham, Scholes, Butt and the Neville brothers — and Giggs, 36, believes the signs are promising.</p>
              <p>‘I’m sure these young players will get better and better,’ he said.</p>
              <p>‘I see their determination. They want to do well, they want to learn, they want to play for United, get in the team and stay in the team. That’s what we were like when we were younger and I see the same desire in these young players.</p>
              <p>‘Hopefully their determination and hunger will see them kick on and do even better, because we’re going to need them.'</p>

              <p><strong>With the new season drawing ever closer, Darren Fletcher has urged his young team-mates to make the most of the opportunities they get to showcase their talents during the tour.<br></strong><br>With a goal apiece in the Reds’ opening tour win over Celtic in Toronto, Danny Welbeck and Tom Cleverley have already made a positive impression and Fletcher says it’s important all the youngsters maintain a high level of performance throughout the trip.<br><br>“We have a lot of young players in the squad and they have a great opportunity on the tour,” said the Scottish international. “Arguably some of them could stake a claim for a place in the first team so it’s important they work hard and do their best.”<br><br>The squad will continue to hone their fitness during a week-long stay in Philadelphia which will include a friendly with MLS side Philadelphia Union on Wednesday. Preparations for the new season are going well so far and, after the disappointments in the league and Champions League last season, Fletcher insists the squad will be raring to go come August.<br><br>“We are looking forward to challenging Chelsea again in the league after finishing runners-up last season,” he added. “This club expects trophies and our goal every year is to win the Premier League and the Champions League. Hopefully we can have a successful season.”</p>

              <p>true... but it doesn't mean United should stay static right?</p>
              <p>While I agree "spending more doesn't equal success", i think most United fans won't disagree, that MU is in need of improvements and not an overhaul. For example, someone to come in for our ageing fleet (Scholes, Giggs, Neville, even EdwnVS).</p>
              <p>And while 1pt was the difference, looking at the scoring charts, it is a big alarm. Rooney was holding the fort and the next big thing was own goals. Seriously, we need to have an "insurance cover" in case Rooney repeats his WC performance.</p>
              <p>other teams have strengthened and chelsea has not splash their cash yet,but they have it while MU is a big suspect in terms of transfer funds.</p>
              <p>Also, we can't ignore that SAF is on his last year(s) in MUFC.</p>
              <p>to be fair, RMadrid did not do so badly, if I am not wrong, they got their best performance for a few years, but just Barca too strong. But with Jose, things may change.</p>

              <h3>RYAN GIGGS last night declared that Sir Alex Ferguson is set to go on and on as the Emperor of Old Trafford and may well be leaping from the dug-out at the grand old age of 75!</h3>
              <p>The Welsh wizard can see no end to the Fergie era but told youngsters on their way through the club they will have it a whole lot easier than his generation.</p>
              <p>Giggs looks to be booked for a possible exit to the MLS in the twilight years of his playing days but believes United's Scottish managerial genius will remain at the top for as long as he wants.</p>
              <p>Currently taking his coaching badges in preparation for a career in management - Giggs said: "The manager is as good as ever and will go on for a long time.</p>
              <p>"To be honest I can see him as a manager of United in five years time, easily, even at 75.</p>
              <p>"As long as he is healthy, he'll have the desire to carry on. He has a great team around him and he has his passions away from the game, like horse racing, so when he comes back to football he is always refreshed."</p>
              <p>Giggs has noticed a calm descend over the Premiers League's very special Special One as the years have passed.</p>
              <p>Although Sir Alex retains a fear factor Giggs feels youngsters have less reason to fear him than when he was growing up at the club.</p>
              <p>He added: "Things have changed - he has mellowed, he isn't anywhere near as frightening as he was 20 years ago."</p>
              <p>Like the wine Fergie loves to tipple after games, Giggs' own relationship with the boss has improved with age.</p>
              <p>He said: "I have known him since I was 12 years old.</p>
              <p>"So it has changed from me just being a kid looking up to him, to being an experienced player he talks to - and from whom he actually asks advice about certain players and situations.</p>
              <p>"It's always been a good relationship, but it has never been better than it is at this moment.</p>
              <p>"Mind you I am a better player now than I was in my early 20s, I have lost that explosive pace where I could knock the ball past a defender and knew I would beat him.</p>
              <p>"I have to think about my game more and use the ball a lot better now.</p>
              <p>"In my head I still think I am about 25 - I don't feel like the old guy in the dressing room.</p>
              <p>"I can relate to the young players - we're footballers who share a lot of the same interests.</p>
              <p>"As far as my own playing days are concerned it's a case of seeing how I feel at the end of each season and whether I am still enjoying it and motivated each day.</p>
              <p>"I'm in the middle of doing my coaching badges. I want to be prepared for when my playing days are over, but at the moment I have no plans."</p>
