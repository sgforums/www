              <p><em>The Reds have issued the following statement regarding Cristiano Ronaldo:</em><strong> <br><br>Manchester
              United has watched with growing irritation the comments attributed to
              Real Madrid over their alleged desire to sign Cristiano Ronaldo.</strong> </p>
              <p>The facts are:</p>
              <p>1) The player is on a long-term contract and his registration is held by Manchester United <br>2) The player is not for sale</p>
              <p>The
              Club will have no alternative but to report Real Madrid to the world
              governing body, FIFA, if it continues to behave in this totally
              unacceptable fashion. These public attempts to unsettle the player are
              completely against the regulations and the Club will not tolerate them
              any longer. </p>
              <p>In addition, the Club is certain that they are a
              distraction for the Portuguese national squad as they prepare for the
              European Championships. No-one should be in any doubt that Manchester
              United will do everything in its power to keep its best players.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Schuster's latest comments seem to have prompted a curt response from United today. Ferguson is sure to be infuriated by Schuster referring to the 23-year-old in a manner that would suggest the signing has virtually been completed. "There are other players we have been looking at but everything has slowed down a little due to all this Cristiano Ronaldo business, seeing as he is the big priority for the club," said Schuster.</strong></p>
              <p>"The English way has been a perfect education for a player with such exceptional individual talent."There he has learned to enjoy his football as a complete professional. This means we would get a Cristiano who would arrive here with his lessons learned."</p>
              <p>Given such a statement, Ferguson is probably glad he is due to embark on his annual summer holiday next week, thus avoiding what is sure to be a regular stream of stories linking Ronaldo with a move to Madrid.</p>
              <p>For his part, the United boss is adamant Ronaldo neither wants to, nor will be, leaving Old Trafford this summer, claiming last week the acid test of the relationship between player and club will not be faced for another two years.</p>
              <p>By that time, Ferguson expects his team to have added at least one more European Cup to a tally they took to three with their penalty shoot-out win over Chelsea in Moscow last week.</p>
              <p>In addition, they could have overtaken Liverpool's record of 18 English championships; United moving to within one with their latest success, the 10th of Ferguson's 23-year stint as manager.</p>
              <p>Not that Real are likely to be dissuaded by history. Although they, like United, have won back-to-back titles, European success has remained frustratingly out of reach since 2002 for the nine-time winners, a record Schuster is determined to put right with Ronaldo leading the charge.</p>
              <p>"Cristiano would help us in a lot of ways, without a doubt, but we can't stop with just him," he explained. "He'll be expensive and we'll have to pay a lot of money, but we need more players because he won't be enough.</p>
              <p>"For a few months now we have had a plan and we know what we want, but now Alexander Hleb has been added to that plan. "We didn't know he would be able to leave Arsenal, but now it seems he will."</p>
              <p>Gunners boss Arsene Wenger will be about as happy with Schuster as Ferguson but the German, who has impressed at Real since replacing England boss Fabio Capello at the end of last season, is not likely to be influenced by that. He certainly does not see the man expected to be confirmed as the world's best player in December being a problem to his squad, no matter what massive price tag is attached and what attention he attracts. After all, this is the club that signed David Beckham.</p>
              <p>"In this Madrid side, the kid wouldn't create any problems," he said. "For the fans this signing would be an amazing explosion similar to what happened here when Beckham arrived. "This isn't England, and that change will affect him. We have to be clever about this and sort this problem out for the kid."</p>

              <h1>Real raring to rectify United rift</h1>
              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Real Madrid president Ramon Calderon insists the
              Spanish champions are not trying to unsettle Manchester United winger
              Cristiano Ronaldo.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Madrid reacted swiftly to United's strongly-worded statement, with Calderon adamant his club have acted correctly.</p>
              <p>"We haven't interfered in Manchester United's contractual agreement with Cristiano Ronaldo," Calderon said on Tuesday night.</p>
              <p>"It is a shame that Manchester, a club with which we have
              excellent relations, is annoyed, because Real Madrid have nothing to do
              with that aspect."</p>
              <p>Calderon also claimed Madrid have not been in contact with the Portugal winger.</p>
              <p>"Real Madrid have never negotiated with players under contract
              and we will not do that, because we wouldn't like it if others did it
              with our players," he said.</p>
              <p>The Madrid president believes his side's pursuit of Ronaldo has been blown out of proportion by the Spanish and English press.</p>
              <p>"The media have fed this problem and we are not going to get
              into a conflict with Manchester, who are a club we consider to be our
              friend, and one with which we hope to continue enjoying a good
              relationship," added Calderon, who revealed he hopes to speak to United
              chief executive David Gill to clear up the matter.</p>
              <p>"I<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> am going to personally speak with David Gill</span> because I want
              to clear this up with him and assure him that we are not going to
              influence any player to break a contractual relationship.</p>
              <p>"There is no 'Ronaldo case' and I regret, in the name of Real Madrid, any discomfort this may have caused.</p>
              <p>"Our posture in this case is the same as the rest of the teams when there are players under contract."</p>
              <p>However, the 57 year-old did not rule out signing the United forward at some point in the future.</p>
              <p>"If the team decides to sell the player, that's another thing," he said.</p>
              <p>"What is occurring is a problem between the player and his team."</p>
