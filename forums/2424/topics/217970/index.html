            <div class='col-md body'>Sir Alex Ferguson believes it may take time for Darren Fletcher to receive the recognition he deserves because he is not regarded as one of United's high profile stars.<br><br>While the likes of Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo dominate the headlines, the unassuming Scot leads a relatively quiet life in comparison both on and off the pitch.<br><br>That has worked against him during periods of his senior career at Old Trafford and at times has resulted in him receiving criticism from both fans and press alike. He has, however, made a good start to the current campaign and his performance against Liverpool last Sunday was one of his best in red shirt.<br><br>Nevertheless, Sir Alex still feels the 22-year-old midfielder's low-key lifestyle means he doesn't always receive the credit he ultimately deserves.<br><br>"It happens at our club sometimes with players who don't have the profile of the big stars," reasoned the Reds' boss. "This club is great at building big stars - they've done it for years and years. But there are some players who come along and play for you for ten years and don't have the same profile as others.<br><br>"Denis Irwin was a case in point, as was Steve Bruce who, of course, never got an England cap. It will perhaps take time for Darren to be recognised in the way that others are simply because he doesn't have the profile.<br><br>"He's a quiet, good-living individual whose whole life is football. He doesn't concern himself with photoshoots and all that type of thing, he's a serious player who has done well at this club. He had to overcome a couple of bad injuries when he was younger," added Sir Alex. "And that requires a lot of determination. So I'm pleased with how he's done."<br></div>
