              <div id="div_article_main_content">
              <p><strong>Manchester United's 2-0
              defeat at Fulham on Saturday left Sir Alex Ferguson not surprisingly
              frustrated, with the Red Devils boss disappointed with his team's
              first-half performance and also the second-half dismissal of Wayne
              Rooney.</strong></p>
              <p>The Premier League champions suffered a 2-0 defeat at Craven Cottage
              and ended the game with only nine men, as Paul Scholes was dismissed
              for deliberate handball in the incident that saw Danny Murphy convert a
              penalty and Rooney red-carded for dissent.</p>
              <p>Ferguson, who also played down fears that Dimitar Berbatov had
              suffered a serious injury, despite the Bulgarian leaving Craven Cottage
              on crutches, was angry with referee Phil Dowd for showing Rooney a
              second yellow card for an incident the Scot considered to be innocuous.</p>
              <p>Ferguson told MUTV: "Did he (Rooney) throw the ball at the referee?
              The ball was thrown direct to where the free-kick was being taken - did
              it hit the referee? No.</p>
              <p>"He threw it because he wanted to get the game going. What can you say about that?</p>
              <p>"There wasn't a bad tackle in the game but John Pantsil was booked
              in the first half for nothing - it was just a tackle. Tackling isn't
              always perfect - I thought it was totally unfair.</p>
              <p>"But there's no point talking about the referee - we didn't play
              well enough to win the game in the first half and that's why we lost it.</p>
              <p>"In the second half I thought we did really well - they kept going and credit to them.</p>
              <p>"But we're home to Aston Villa in our next game - and that will be crucial."</p>
              <p>After United's reverse to Liverpool last week, Saturday's defeat to
              Fulham consigned the team to back-to-back Premier League losses for the
              first time in 147 games.</p>

              </span></p><p>Scholes' dismissal for the penalty had
              seemed a fair call by the referee, but Ferguson has cast doubt over the
              decision by noting that the midfielder was little more than a yard from
              the header when it was made by Bobby Zamora.</p>
              <p>"It's close to him so he could have easily not given it, but it's Phil Dowd so what do you expect?" Ferguson remarked.</p>

              <p>Becos ronaldo is the man u free kick taker, i find that they are no longer dangerous at set pieces. Everytime he steps up, u can be sure he will not score. If i'm nt wrong, he hasnt even scored more than 2 free kicks this season.</p>

              all didnt played well. even the much vaulted defence were made to look like schooboy defending against fulham. scholes and giggs in midfield, where they can't run as much as they used to be in their younger days.
              
              these days i shudder when scholes is playing. He either mistimed his tackles and get a yellow, or miss-placed passes in his own half or used his hand to score and block. I dunno if that is automatic reaction, but when u used your hand to block the ball, it is a red card and a pk.

              SAF tinkering is backfiring in these 2 matches. fletcher shd have played last week against liverpool,as he usually put all the UK players against liverpool.
              
              as its away match at fulham, maybe complacency played a part, as Utd thrashed fulham in fa cup 4-0, maybe he reckoned any side he put out will beat fulham, especially the thrashing last week.
              
              Scholes (34)and Giggs (35) cant run no more, so who to protect the back 4? I dun tink carrick want to rest, I think he is raring to go and he is just 28, certainly can run much more than giggs/scholes. I was surprised Rooney was on the bench, but when he came out in the second half, Utd play improved drastically and he almost scored.

              <p>The only other free kick specialists are Giggs and Hargreaves, i think Giggs can't be bothered to argue for the kick and i don't need to tell you what happened to the other one</p>

              <p>it is pure instinct that Scholes block the ball.. lose already lose lor.</p>
              <p>I just wonder who else will be sent off next EPL game, is it Rio, Giggs, Edwin, or even SAF?? seems, we are now on a "red-card" roll..</p>

              <p><span>SAF</span> tinkering is backfiring in these 2
              matches. fletcher shd have played last week against liverpool,as he
              usually put all the UK players against liverpool.</p>
              <p>as its away match at fulham, maybe complacency played a part, as
              Utd thrashed fulham in fa cup 4-0, maybe he reckoned any side he
              put out will beat fulham, especially the thrashing last week.</p>
              <p>Scholes (34)and Giggs (35) cant run no more, so who to protect
              the back 4? I dun tink carrick want to rest, I think he is raring
              to go and he is just 28, certainly can run much more than
              giggs/scholes. I was surprised Rooney was on the bench, but when he
              came out in the second half, Utd play improved drastically and he
              almost scored.</p>

              <p>true la, SAF may be trying a bit too hard.. but would you rather he in charge or someone else given we are now facing such tough times? No thanks to the FA..</p>
