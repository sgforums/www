So Nike have been efficient in that respect and are going through certain solutions."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Do you all know that Nike don't own any of the manufacturing plants themselves, they outsourced everything and then just market and sell those low costs shoes at such overpriced rates? And they made lots of money and people still buy them because Nike has built a brand to influence the consumers perception about their products? I mean, say, if I ask you whether you want to buy ABC shoes or Nike shoes, most would say Nike coz better quality, but their shoes are made in 3rd world countries manufacturing plants similar to those of how some ABC shoes are made, and the way you thought like that is because of how Nike has developed their branding and influence your perception and your thoughts about these products. The same for LV and some other pricy things, they prey upon the consumers mind because that's the only way they can ask you to pay multiple times for items that you usually won't pay.

            <div class='col-md body'>Typically, for boot quality, adidas is the best. Nike has a history of shoes that fall apart. Rooney isn't the first person to complain about his boot, I remember Totti once changed his boots half-way through a half in one match, I think it was an international match.<br><br>He complained that the new ones hurt his feet like crazy and the old ones were better. Nike of course denied those claims. Oh well, we'll just way and see. Nike is a master at advertising, while adidas does have the quality to back theirs up.</div>

Robben and Cisse were endorsing their then new F50 boots series. Robben broke his left foot and Cisse broke his right. Not too good... still, F50s r v comfortable.
