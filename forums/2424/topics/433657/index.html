              <p class="first-para"><strong>MANCHESTER UNITED are spending a staggering £25million to build a "virtual hospital" at their Carrington training base. </strong></p>
              <p>The Glazer family, who own the club, have already given the green light for the stunning state-of-the-art complex.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson is convinced the pioneering project will keep United one step ahead of their European rivals.</p>
              <p>United hope to start work on the project next season after conducting a feasibility study into the benefits of housing medical facilities on site.</p>
              <p>It will include a new sports science unit dedicated to developing ground-breaking training schedules and tailor-made programme for injured players.</p>
              <p>United's remarkable plans also include rehabilitation facilities and top-class fitness and gym areas.</p>
              <p>There are even plans for injured players coming off the field at Old Trafford to be whisked straight to the new centre for scans.</p>
              <p>United are investing in the latest CT scanning and MRI equipment to make instant medical assessments on occasions such as when Wayne Rooney damaged his ankle against Bayern Munich in the Champions League in 2010.</p>
              <p>If the injury requires an operation, then United's players will still be treated at a private hospital.</p>
              <p>Back at Carrington there will also be specialist rooms kitted out with dentistry equipment, osteopathy tables and yoga suites.</p>
              <p>United intend to conduct medicals there as part of a plan to protect the privacy of new signings. Despite spending nearly £20m on Atletico Madrid keeper David De Gea, he was shielded by minders surrounding him with a white sheet when he arrived for his medical. </p>
              <p>Ashley Young was also captured by photographers when he arrived at the Bridgewater Hospital in Manchester last week.</p>
              <p>In future, new signings will be assessed on site in the new medical facility.</p>
              <p>United have committed the funding for the project as part of plans to reshape the future of European football.</p>
              <p>Despite Fergie's 25 years at United, he wants to keep them at the forefront of modern technology and development.</p>
              <p>United officials have been stunned by his enthusiasm for the project, but he is convinced it is in the club's long term interests. Although rival clubs have similar facilities in-house, Fergie has told friends that nothing in Europe will compare when it's built.</p>
              <p>Milan's Milanello complex has long been regarded as the forefront in player development, but Fergie is convinced United are ahead of the game.</p>
              <p>Along with radical strategy to build a virtual hospital at Carrington, United have £100m to spend in the transfer market.</p>
              <p>They have already acquired De Gea, Young and Blackburn defender Phil Jones, with more on the way.</p>
