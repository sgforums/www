              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Friendly matches are opportunities to look at nonfirst team regulars and
                  68,868 spectators spilled into the sunny streets around Old Trafford with
                  the same thought: “That substitute wasn’t bad.”</strong></p>
              <p>Introduced with 25 minutes (including stoppage time) remaining, Manchester
                  United’s fresh-featured and eager replacement forward sent an electric
                  current through the action and turned the game. Of course he did. Ole Gunnar
                  Solskjaer says you could always tell what impact he would have when coming
                  off the bench by the way he ran on to the field. If it was going to be a
                  good one you would see a spring in his stride. On shot knees, with a
                  35-year-old’s shrinking muscles, Solskjaer bounded on to the turf yesterday.
                  He got a standing ovation just for warming up but it will be a source of
                  pride that he had the stadium on its feet not through sentiment but
                  admiration once the football came to his feet.</p>
              <p>There was to be no last, sweet goal for the Norwegian to savour. Fairytales
                  are for the young, but ending his playing career with this final cameo a
                  year after his last competitive appearance, there were still a few moments
                  of goosebump-in-ducing virtuosity in the penalty box left for Solskjaer to
                  produce. Leave them wanting more. “You never know,” smiled Sir Alex Ferguson
                  when an interviewer joked about asking Solskjaer to play in United’s opening
                  game of the Premier League season, at Newcastle. “If we brought him on in
                  the last five or 10 minutes he wouldn’t let us down. He has a knack, it
                  never leaves you,” said Ferguson, serious.</p>
              <p>Being Solskjaer, being self-deprecating, the man himself had been worried
                  about embarrassing himself yesterday. He wondered if he could last 20
                  minutes and didn’t want to be “crap” for the supporters who, turning out in
                  a number only a few hundred short of the British record for a testimonial
                  game, helped him raise close to £2m, from which he plans to build 10 schools
                  in Africa through Unicef. His fears proved groundless, though it is true to
                  say that as the final whistle trilled and he raised his arms in front of the
                  Stretford End he looked shattered. Minutes later Solskjaer addressed Old
                  Trafford via a microphone and, wet-eyed, said: “These last 25 minutes here
                  I’ll remember for the rest of my life”.</p>
              <p>You knew the substitute had something about him from the way he received his
                  first pass, out on the right, and floated the ball over Espanyol’s central
                  defenders to almost play Ryan Giggs in. The magic came in two puffs, a
                  minute apart. It was 0-0, United had a free kick on the edge of the area,
                  and Solskjaer chipped a disappointing effort into the wall. The stadium
                  sighed but Frazier Campbell gathered possession, crossed to Giggs, a flick
                  on found Solskjaer and, suddenly, a shot was screaming from the striker’s
                  left instep towards the far top corner of Alvarez Cristian’s net. The
                  goalkeeper stretched for a spectacular save.</p>
              <p>Then, in United’s next attack, Solskjaer accepted the ball on the edge of the
                  area, faked a pass to his right and checked inside before driving another
                  shot towards goal. It was an even better effort than his first, struck with
                  power and accuracy. Cristian just managed to block but its force meant he
                  could not catch it and the ball spilled to Giggs, who could have scored.</p>
              <p>United controlled the play but had not pursued victory with alacrity and an
                  Espanyol side blessed with the technical proficiency expected of any leading
                  Spanish side were threatening to spoil the party by scoring on a breakaway.
                  There had been some niggle, principally involving Daniel Jarque, who seemed
                  intent on hurting Carlos Tevez, and - as is his curious wont in friendlies -
                  Paul Scholes.</p>
              <p>Nani had thrilled sporadically during the opening passage, Scholes, Tevez and
                  Nemanja Vidic missed chances but did well to fasten onto them none-theless.
                  Of Ferguson’s youngsters, Campbell and Danny Simpson showed promise. There
                  had not, though, been quite enough to satisfy a public seeking a party until
                  Solskjaer bounded on and a few minutes after his brace of efforts, his
                  influence helped Campbell score a winning goal.</p>
              <p>One of Solskjaer’s first acts on entering the fray was to advise the young
                  striker to start changing his movement. And so, with eight minutes left,
                  Giggs sent a lovely pass through Espanyol’s defence and there was Campbell,
                  having lost his markers by peeling to the flank, darting back to the middle
                  to receive the ball and scoop a finish over Cristian. When legends talk,
                  listen.</p>
              <p>“Legend” is an overused word in football, but appropriate for Solskjaer, who
                  is loved as much for himself as his achievements. His schools-building
                  campaign will not stop following this testimonial. He is committed to keep
                  helping African children, one day, to have built “20-30” schools in some of
                  its poorest countries.</p>
              <p>After the match he went to a studio inside Old Trafford and hosted a live
                  telethon programme broadcast in Norway. “What he’s doing tells you about his
                  humanity and the feeling he has for life. It’s the kind of thing you expect
                  from Ole,” Ferguson said.</p>
              <p>Solskjaer’s last steps wearing a playing jersey were around the perimeter of
                  the pitch at Old Trafford, cradling his newborn baby, Elijah, and with his
                  other two children, Noah and Karna. He received another standing ovation and
                  United’s players were waiting to clap him down the tunnel. Everything
                  important to Solskjaer was symbolised in that tableau: his family closest to
                  him, his colleagues part of it, his public smiling. Good guys don’t always
                  win, but they can never lose.</p>
