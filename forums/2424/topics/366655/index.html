              <p><strong>I believe the word is ‘bombshell’.<br><br></strong>United fans across the world were still digesting the news of Karim Benzema’s decision to join Real Madrid, rather than act on alleged interest from Old Trafford, when the wheels were set in motion on one of the most astonishing transfer stories of the summer.<br><br>The odds on Michael Owen joining United took less than 12 hours to plummet from 20/1 to 4/9. Still, it was dismissed as nothing more than fanciful by the majority of supporters on message boards and fan sites.<br><br>As the rumours gathered credence, with more and more news agencies running with the story, the scoffs soon died out. It’s undoubtedly a polemic issue: for years Owen was regarded as the finest English goalscorer of his generation, yet his nightmare spell at Newcastle has done little to uphold that reputation.<br><br>Let’s start with the business angle. There's no transfer fee and reports suggest his wage would be highly incentivised and greatly reduced from the astronomical fees he commanded at St James’ Park. So, nothing ventured, something gained, perhaps. Should he sign for the Reds and fail to impact, he won’t be regarded as an expensive flop.<br><br>The tabloids’ claims that United were pipped to Benzema’s signature seem to carry weight. For all the talk of Ribery, Villa, Aguero et al, the massive majority of the names thrown into the transfer blender are either too old, too expensive or both. If indeed Benzema was the Reds’ primary transfer target, a move for Owen is a quick, decisive reaction to missing out.<br><br>It makes a lot of sense, really. There would be no point in splashing out big money on a player Sir Alex Ferguson didn’t regard as good enough to make his first choice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Without Benzema on board, the first-choice strikers for next season will be Wayne Rooney and Dimitar Berbatov, so any new signing would either have to be better than them both – names, please – or that rare breed of footballer who will not kick up a stink if he’s used primarily as an impact substitute.<br><br>In Owen, United would appear to have found that middle ground: a player who brings much but asks little. Yes, there have been plenty of injuries. But he was rushed back far too often during his time at Newcastle, such was his importance to their increasingly desperate cause. At United he can take his time and iron out any niggles. Should he be injured and then be joined on the sidelines by either Rooney or Berbatov, then Sir Alex can call on Danny Welbeck or Kiko Macheda.<br><br>And how those two young bucks will benefit from training alongside Owen. Not only can they call on coaching from Reserves boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, they can now train alongside Michael Owen – and is there a better finishing school around than learning from those two?<br><br>As for Owen’s motivations, he has a chance to resurrect a once glittering career in which he became famed as England’s finest goal-poacher since Jimmy Greaves. He has another crack at the Champions League and can play his way back into the England set-up in World Cup year. Surrounded by better players and playing alongside a more potent supply line, he can still improve. It’s not even a case of teaching an old dog new tricks, since he’s still the right side of 30.<br><br>There are naysayers among supporters and the media, which is inevitable with an injury-prone former Liverpool striker who hasn’t enjoyed a memorable, prolific season in four years.<br><br>The crux of any gripes with United’s summer would appear to lie</p>
              <p>with the departure of two big-name, glamorous players in Cristiano Ronaldo and Carlos Tevez. Antonio Valencia is the antonym of a glitz and glamour arrival, while Owen’s signing on a free would be a move most noteworthy for its shock value.<br><br>While Europe’s top talents form a winding queue to be paraded before a backdrop of trophies, fireworks and giant screens at the Santiago Bernabeu, United’s summer activity is infinitely more understated. The papers are having a field day, portraying United as the mugs who are left rummaging around bargain bins while Real sweep the shelves.<br><br>But why waste money if what you want isn’t available? It’s not often Sir Alex misses out on a player he covets, but he’s had it happen enough times to know not to panic buy in response. The signing of Owen would buy some time to reassess future signings, while not compromising the present.<br><br>It’s an unexpected punt, but then Sir Alex and Michael Owen both like the odd flutter.</p>
