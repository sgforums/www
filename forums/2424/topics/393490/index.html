              <h3>MANCHESTER UNITED are pushing closer to a £20million move for Everton star Jack Rodwell. </h3>
              <p>And Sir Alex Ferguson wants to do the double on Everton by taking Dan Gosling to Old Trafford in the summer with him.</p>
              <p>Both players scored in the recent 3-1 victory against the champions at Goodison Park. </p>
              <p>United want to unveil Chris Smalling, Rodwell and ex-Plymouth youngster Gosling as part of their new generation of stars for next season but are fully focused on adding the finishing touches to defender Rodwell's transfer as a priority.</p>
              <p>Although United remain the first choice for the player and his representatives, Ferguson is all too aware that discussions between Rodwell's team, fellow title favourites Chelsea and noisy neighbours Manchester City are still in progress. </p>
              <p>There is also some reluctance from David Moyes to part with another of the club's biggest stars after watching former Toffees striker Wayne Rooney set the Premiership and Champions League alight for the Reds. </p>
              <p>One option being tentatively discussed that will ease Moyes' decision involves the Merseysiders picking up an initial £8m fee for the player, followed by two further payments of £5m once Rodwell reaches certain appearance benchmarks for United.</p>
              <p> That would then be followed by a final instalment of £2m once he completes a full appearance for the England national side.</p>
              <p> In such a case, however, Everton would insist on receiving a large proportion of the initial fee upfront rather than factoring the cost over more than one season.</p>
              <p> It is believed that Moyes wants to use any cash raised in the deal to fund a move for Stephen Ireland.</p>
              <p> The Everton boss has been a huge admirer of the Manchester City man for a long time as he could ease much of the midfield goal-scoring burden placed on Tim Cahill.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>That's a good piece of news. Rodwell is highly rated and watching him play week in and week out, he does have the potential to make it big. And Fergie, try and offload Hargreaves to Everton since they like to collect United players: Howard, Neville, Saha. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p></div>

              <p>Sorry but i think
              Fergie's success at spotting cheap and value for money talents are only
              limited to class of 92, the remaining youth products (Brown, Fletcher
              and O'Shea), Keane, Vidic, Park, Pique and to a certain extend Ronaldo.He does not always get talents that are value for money.</p>
              <p>Rafael and Fabio are just starting to find their feet. Macheda hasnt start this season.</p>
              <p>Rooney cost 25.6m and so is Ferdinand (29.1m), Ruud (24m), Carrick (18.6m), Hargreaves (17m and is always injured), Anderson (18m, 3 years and we have not seen the best of him), Berba (30.75m, is he worth the money?),  Nani (17m, on off performance from him, lacks consistency)</p>
              <p>Remember these players? Massimo Taibi (4.4m. Joker of the century. He's no better than Hilario!)? Juan Sebastian Veron (28.1m. Had trouble adapting. Luckily Chelsea took over his payroll and paid us 15m for him. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">) Eric Djemba-Djemba (3.5m, Roy Keane replacement? I'm having a laugh!)?
              Alan Smith (7m, was he a striker or was he a midfielder? I'm confused
              as much as he is)? Diego Forlan (6.9m, 60 matches, 10 pathetic goals. Wait a min, wasn't he the top scorer at Villareal and moved to Atletico Madrid for 21m? Was that the same Forlan we had?)?</p>
              <p>So in conclusion, i think Fergie's success to failure ratio is just about 60-40, for every success story, there's a Kleberson (6.5m). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>true, well, in the past, MU may not have the funds, so he is forced to dig deep.Then MU became better and SAF explore more. and with these continental or SAmericans players, it is a gamble. Plus the fact, MU has to balance footballing with global marketing. so Park came in, EJJ came in, to some extend, Veron came in..</p>
              <p>Alan Smith was primarily a striker but then in MU's system, he has to help out when he has to, like Scholes, he played in the hole b4, Giggs, CM, Winger, Striker, OShea, Fletcher, and OwenH, midfield with defenders' roles. They all have to plug the hole sometimes.</p>
              <p>Oh ya, the Karel Porkosky or even the great Johan Cruyff's son.. All came and went.</p>
              <p>Not defending him, but for the failures SAF has, his system did not 
              change.</p>
