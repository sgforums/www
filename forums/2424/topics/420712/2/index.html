              <p>Personal opinion...the way I look at it....it's a 2 horse race now. Chelsea, Spurs and city are out. 5-6 losses each alrdy and quite a few points behind. Arsenal are 2 points behind with a game more and they have alrdy lost 5 times. Somehow, teams which have alrdy lost 5 times at this midway stage of the season don't win titles.</p>
              <p>It really is united's title to lose. And it's good to see that they don't get too conceited over it as evident in last night's display. They were a few goals up and still running and chasing. Only thing is....looking forward to their 3rd away win.</p>

              <p>Don't discount Arsenal... They are looking very good with Van Persie back and scoring...</p>
              <p>For me, United still have a number of very difficult games coming up... Away to Pool and Arsenal as well as Chelsea who they also have a home tie still to come... are not going to be easy at all. Even if they don't win and just draw them, that's 8 points to lose. Then there is City's visit to United too, another potential draw result...</p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Yeah, confirm plus chop Fergie would choose a reserve side for the FA Cup to preserve energy for next tuesday's midweek clash with Villa.</p>
              <p>O'Shea still looks shaky to me leh. When Bentley was swooped to the Left Flank he gave O'Shea a torrid time because O'Shea is slow in turning and lacking in pace.</p>

              <li id="quotes"><strong>Fergie praise for Berbatov</strong>
              <p> </p>
              Sir Alex Ferguson welcomed Dimitar Berbatov's third hat-trick of the season and now hopes Wayne Rooney can enjoy a touch of luck in front of goal. </li>
              <p>''We hope the goals are going to come for Wayne,'' said Ferguson. ''He is working his socks off. He produced some great football today and his control from Edwin van der Sar's kick for the fourth goal was fantastic.''  </p>
              <p>It was Berbatov who took the plaudits from a victory that consolidated United's status as league leaders and extended their unbeaten run this season to 22 matches ahead of Tuesday's trip to Blackpool.  </p>
              <p>''It was a marvellous performance from Dimitar,'' said Ferguson. ''He could have scored more. We were a bit wasteful with our finishing at times but you can't complain at the performance.''  </p>
              <p>Veteran Ryan Giggs drilled home just before the interval to confirm his well-being after agreeing to stay at Old Trafford for a further season. And, after a series of failed attempts, Nani wrapped up the scoring midway through the second period.  </p>
              <p>''It certainly helps the goal difference, there is no question about that,'' said Ferguson. ''We have some tough games ahead but hopefully the players can grasp the nettle.  </p>
              <p>''We have some experience. We have the squad. Hopefully we can manage all the games we have ahead.''  </p>
              <p>The only downside was an injury to Michael Carrick that Ferguson described as ''sore''. And the United boss also confirmed he will check on the state of Rio Ferdinand's groin injury on Monday before deciding whether to risk the England skipper at Bloomfield Road.  </p>
              <p>For Birmingham manager Alex McLeish the mauling was not the ideal way to prepare for Wednesday's Carling Cup semi-final decider with West Ham. McLeish felt his side paid the price for adopting an enterprising approach, although he admitted Birmingham's wounds were self-inflicted.  </p>
              <p>''To lose a goal to a set-piece in the first minute was criminal,'' said McLeish. ''We did have a spell after that when we started to get in their final third but to concede again just before half-time was verging on the amateur.''  </p>

              <p>okok lol. Better keep fingers crossed first then. The last time balotelli said the attack of him, dzeko and tevez was the best in the world, they lost 1-0 to villa. It pays to nottttt......talk big.</p>
