              <p>United are ruthless at home, they tore Brums apart! How I wish they can do the same while playing away.</p>
              <p>The flops of last season (Berbatov, Nani, Anderson) suddenly became the hero and the hero (Rooney) suddenly look like a flop. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I thought United would have won by a much much bigger margin, possibly even double digit, had Nani not be so selfish, Berbatov would have gotten a double hat-trick all by himself!</p>
              <p>It's obvious that Anderson is pulling the strings in midfield and yet McLeish lets him roam freely. A bad bad mistake and Anderson makes Birmingham pay with so many delicious through balls. He could be out next central midfield general in Roy Keane's mould!</p>
              <p>Gibson is the next Carrick, seriously, his lack of concentration is similar to Carrick and I hope he will leave United sooner than later. O'Shea is still as crappy and Fabio is rusty. Smalling is really began to show potential to become the next Rio - Cool and Compose with precise long passes.</p>
              <p>Kudos to Berbatov, 17 goals already in the premier league this season, the dunno how many Hat-Trick, we've found a new Van Nistelrooy!</p>

              <p>It was a good win... Now let's go on and win at Blackpool cos Arsenal is closing in and don't look like letting up... The rest like Chelsea, Spurs and now City after last night's match, also seem to be losing steam and have fallen off a little...</p>
              <p>I think Rooney has not been scoring but the guy is still doing a lot on the pitch... So we shouldn't underrate the contribution he has made... I felt if without him, Berbatov might not get as many opportunities as he had... So Rooney is still playing an important part. The only worrying sign is Nani's form isn't as good as in the earlier stages... He seemed to have lose something in this last few matches... Hope he rediscover early season form soon cos the problem right now for United is, they don't have an able replacement on the wing... Valencia is still out and even when he comes back, I am not expecting him to hit the ground running and doing well immediately. And with Korea beating Iran last night, Park won't be back anytime soon either... So the wing is abit of a concern cos I don't think Giggs can play a 2nd match in 3 days. So not sure who is going to play in the left-wing against Blackpool away... Rooney?</p>

              <p>But most likely Fergie will die die play Gibson la. No idea why, definitely not because of his performance in recent matches. He seems to be the boss' new pet.</p>
              <p>Rooney missed a couple of clear cut chances when being presented with the opportunity but I must admit, without his and Anderson's precise passing, United wouldn't have won but such a big margin.</p>
              <p>Nani is fast becoming the old player he was, selfish and arrogant, he prefers having a go rather than setting up for his teammate. Where is the assist king at the beginning of the season? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="icon_sad.gif"></p>

              <p>Personal opinion...the way I look at it....it's a 2 horse race now. Chelsea, Spurs and city are out. 5-6 losses each alrdy and quite a few points behind. Arsenal are 2 points behind with a game more and they have alrdy lost 5 times. Somehow, teams which have alrdy lost 5 times at this midway stage of the season don't win titles.</p>
              <p>It really is united's title to lose. And it's good to see that they don't get too conceited over it as evident in last night's display. They were a few goals up and still running and chasing. Only thing is....looking forward to their 3rd away win.</p>

              <p>I think Giggs is not 37. He's so fit that I'm amazed he can outpace some Birmingham players! But in truth, United lack backup on the wings and I'm not surprised at all if Giggs' contract is extended.</p>
              <p>I do hope Scholes is being use sparingly. I think chances should be presented to the younger set of players because you cant expect Scholes to continue forever right? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>

Cos in away matches, wingers must also track back and do well defending and this guy is a bit of a panic kid in defence... Though I don't think Gibson will play but... The possibility of moving Nani to the left might just let Gibson sneak in cos United are down to their bare bones in wingers... lol.</p>
              <p>I think the centre two could be Scholes and Fletcher, in defence, Rio should be back... and Hernandez should be back too in place of Owen...</p>
              <p>Oh perhaps play Rooney on the makeshift left wing position and let Hernandez partner Berba upfront... ? Cos I don't think it's wise playing Giggs and Scholes in the same team in an away match... Cos they can still accommodate one slow mo but 2... It's stretching it a little i feel...</p>

              <p>I think Anderson would start the next match and Fergie always choose defensive formation when playing away, starting with 5 midfielders to choke off the home team. Berbatov will be the lone targetman upfront.</p>
              <p>Giggs, Scholes, Owen and Chicharito would probably be impact substitutes for the next match. The rest of the subs would probably be Smalling, O'Shea and Kuszcak.</p>
              <p>Having said that, this could be the formation Fergie use (4-5-1):</p>
              <p>GK Van der Sar<br>RB Rafael (he's banned only 1 match right?)<br>CD Ferdinand<br>CD Vidic<br>LB Evra<br>RM Nani<br>CM Anderson<br>DM Fletcher<br>CM Gibson<br>LM Rooney<br>CF Berbatov</p>
