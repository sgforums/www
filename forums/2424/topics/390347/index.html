              <h3>SIR ALEX FERGUSON is ready to bring in a new era at Manchester United by fast- tracking a deal for Jack Rodwell.</h3>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fergie's plan is for the Everton defender-cum- midfielder to join next summer's recruit Chris Smalling in the United back line in years to come.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The United boss pipped Arsenal in the hunt for Fulham starlet Smalling, 20.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now he wants to get the ball rolling on a summer deal for 19-year-old Rodwell.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>United value their man at £12million and with relations between Everton and the Reds still frosty over Wayne Rooney's 2005 switch, Ferguson is determined to get talks under way early and amicably.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The manager is doing everything he can to maintain his tried and trusted partnership of Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic and, despite injury worries and rumours of unrest, is confident of them being in place for seasons to come.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But he sees a Smalling- Rodwell partnership as their long-term successors.</p>
              <p>Fergie believes there will be more than enough domestic Cup ties to keep the players occupied while they learn their trade at United.</p>
              <p>The Scot speaks very highly of Rodwell and believes his potential young centre-back pairing could feature regularly together for both club, and maybe even country, if their progression continues at a steady rate.</p>
              <p>However, Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger also wants Rodwell. And he will be even more determined to get him after Smalling slipped through his grasp.</p>

              <p>David Moyes has warned Manchester United not even a massive bid forJack Rodwell will be enough to lure the Everton starlet to Old Trafford this summer.</p>
              <p>Rodwell has enjoyed an impressive season at Everton and Sir Alex Ferguson is a long-term admirer of the 18-year-old, who netted against United last weekend.</p>
              <p>Sunday Mirror Sport revealed this month that Everton have placed a £30million price-tag on Rodwell and now Moyes has vowed to keep his talented midfielder.</p>
              <p>Moye said: “I think everyone will always look at your players but even if they come to me and say, ‘Gaffer, I want to leave’ I will still probably say no.</p>
              <p>“Perhaps if someone made me an offer I thought was too good to turn down then maybe, but it is not about the money. I am not waiting for an offer – that’s not what we are about.”</p>
              <p>Moyes says his side cannot crack the top four like they did in 2005.</p>
              <p>He said: “If we beat Tottenham then maybe we can finish fourth but I think there are just too many teams above us. Our start to the season has given us too much to do.”</p>

              <p>Evans is starting to get on my nerve for silly mistakes. He needs Rio and Vidic to play alongside him to clear this mess for him.  In my opinion, he's overrated at the moment. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="icon_evil.gif"></p>
              <p>Rodwell, on the other hand, is a composed and classy player. I hope United get him. His partnership with Smalling looks good. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>

              <p>i think Rodwell is an unpolished gem, and while Evans may not seems a top notch defender, he has done well in many high level matches that Rodwell has not being exposed to.Similiarly for Smalling..</p>
