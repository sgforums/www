            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm.. even if saha was abit theatrical in going down in the box, it was a definite foul by ben haim nonetheless.<br><br>I feel Mikel didn't deserve the red card. It should be a yellow. Rather, J. Cole's foul on Ronaldo certainly deserved the red card.<br><br>I could see from the body language of the players then most of them like essien, makelele, j. cole would most probably quit Chelsea come end of the season.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Ferguson: Decisions Evened Themselves Out</strong><br><br>In the aftermath Ferguson summed up the key decisions and retrospectively stated that the result was a fair one, adding that his side are on their way back to their best.<br><br>Â“I think in the context of a game of football today the first half hour we played as well as we have all season. I think there was terrific movement, penetration and passing. At that point we could have been two ahead and we dominated,Â” he told Sky Sports.<br><br>Â“We should have had a penalty kick, I think the cameras have shown that it was a clear penalty kick. Then the game changes, the sending off, a bit harsh but there was intent there and it could have hurt the boy, but it was a bit harsh, some referees would have let it go.<br><br>Â“And then when you see that sending off, and then you see Joe ColeÂ’s tackle on Ronaldo, thatÂ’s the kind of tackle thatÂ’s putting players out of the game, and thatÂ’s a straight red card as for as IÂ’m concerned. But he gets a yellow card simply because a player has been sent off in the first half and I think there was a balancing by the referee.<br><br>Â“Then the second penalty looked to me a bit harsh, and thatÂ’s cancelled out the first attempt. In a tight game like that a referee can get it wrong, but I donÂ’t think it affected the match, because I thought we were the better team, some of our football, particularly in the early part of the match, was outstanding.Â”</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Just my own comments on the match.<br><br>Chelsea was as the commentator said, lifeless. The same drive that Chelsea has displayed for the past 3 seasons was absent. Even John Terry looked sian.... which is really bad news.<br><br>The referee was horrible, making quite a few bad calls and did really weird things. Like the incident where Man U played the ball out, Chelsea themselves expected to be giving the ball back from a throw in. No one knew what the ref wanted when he brought the ball back onto the pitch. Free kick? Drop ball? Didn't seem like either. I still don't know what it was.<br><br>Mikel's tackle was a very bad one, hard and with studs showing. But personally I don't think it was worth a straight red card. Yellow definitely but red was a little harsh.<br><br>Rooney could have been sent off. To me he deserved a yellow card when he knocked over Ashley Cole in the second half. But the replay seems to show that it was more of a push than a direct elbow or something like that. The initial footage seemed as if Rooney charged in with an elbow. Still, I wouldn't have been suprised to see Rooney get a second yellow.5<br><br>Referee's judgement calls were inconsistent as well. I can't say for sure the incident involving Joe Cole and Evra was a definite penalty, Joe Cole did get the ball but it was from behind and hard to tell if he got the man first or player first. He definitely brought Evra off his footing. I felt though that John Terry's tackle on Rooney in the second half was a similar tackle, the one where Terry got a yellow card. Based on what I saw from the television, if the first one wasn't a foul, then neither should the second one. At least, that's what I think.<br><br>I'm not too surprised Ben Haim gave away a penalty, but I didn't really expect it to be in that manner. There was definite contact by Ben Haim, and Saha did seem to make a meal out of it, but there was a foul because Ben Haim kicked Saha on the shin. Not hard but he did, mistimed maybe? Cech almost saved the penalty though. In fact, I think Cech did very well during the match.<br><br>Tevez scored as a result of Chelsea not being able to clear properly. Wasn't the first time in the match either so they had it coming. The compusure wasn't there.<br><br>And the protest against the penalty was reasonably mild, if Mourinho was still manager it'd be a different case altogether. Although the penalty call was valid, I've seen teams protest for more clear cut penalties than that.<br><br>Overall it wasn't a great match, no real flair from either side. The match also lacked the atmosphere and intensity you would expect from a match between title contenders.<br><br>I would have liked to see a draw, but with Chelsea played the way they did, they might still have lost even with 11 men. Even if Mikel wasn't sent off, I think he'd be conceding a lot of fouls and maybe another penalty. His sending off did prevent Chelsea from venturing forward more.<br><br>Shevchenko was pretty hard working and you could see he played with less burden than he has for the past year. But he's still a little lacking in sharpness and his anticipation is not quite there. Might be due to different team tactics as well.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, Chelsea truly missed Lampard as the driving force in the middle of midfield. And sadly, Chelsea is supposed to have the player most similiar to Lampard in terms of playing style and ability. Not to forgot more expensive as well.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>kelong la even my man u frds say referee is kelong.<br><br>he probably forgot to take his yellow card from his locker. when giving mikel the red u cld see him stare at the card when taking out of pocket.<br><br>one man down chelsea sian then referee also let play go on so long. after the 47 min corner clearnace shld be half time whistle already.<br><br>and the penalty also under dubious circumstances.<br><br>man u on the whole played better but chelsea missing dogba lampar and dont know why sub joe cole and malouda. also cech was top form.<br><br>i dont support either team but anyway i see that man u also playing like chelsea liao. boring zzz.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>alittle bit pity chelsea for the events happening to them this week though<br><br>referee ruined the match by sending off mikel, he should send off joe cole instead in the second half<br><br>and for the penalty, he should awarded it in the first half rather than award it to the saha incident, which the way he fall down abit too kua zhang <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the way chelsea played before sending off of mikel was still quite ok<br><br>some more this is an away game for them. maybe we should see how they play against fulham next week at stamford bridge, with 11 men on pitch of course <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
