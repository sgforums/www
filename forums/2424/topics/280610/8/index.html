Many confuse supporting the manager or players with supporting the club... I also supported Real but i was very clear about it, i only supported them in spirit while Beckham was there. But i support the club Man u all the way, even if Fergie was no longer in charge.<br><br>Nevertheless, if they were to come to Sg, i wouldn't mind paying money to watch United's match without a second thought but i wouldn't pay if the price was too high to watch a Real Madrid game.<br><br>This is the problem Chelsea is facing i feel... Mourinho a charismatic manager, some fans are attracted to chelsea solely because of him and not for the kind of football they play. Just like some fans are supporting Sunderland cos of Roy Keane. But the day Roy leave them, those who followed Sunderland cos of him will most likely also desert them.<br><br>People seem to forget that Chelsea is an institution and not a mourinho fan club... I guess thats the reason for the 24,000 including away fans turnout in their opening European match. Now onwards, i feel chelsea will only attract real chelsea fans instead of mourinho fans... and neutrals may not dislike them like before.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

United striker Tevez, scorer of United's first goal in their 2-0 win, said: 'Chelsea pushed the violence to the absolute limit and there could have been other red cards during the match. But justice prevailed in the end and we deserved to win.<br><br>'Our game is totally superior to Chelsea's this season and the scoreline was actually a little short of what we deserved. 'I have seen the problems at Chelsea with the change of coach, but this season they have just not developed the rhythm of other years. I don't see that they are superior to any of our other title rivals. Chelsea were very nervous and it was impossible that we were going to lose the match.'<br><br>Argentina striker Tevez revealed that he received special congratulations from United boss Sir Alex Ferguson after scoring his first goal for the club. 'I will always remember the goal and for it to come against Chelsea is magic,' he said.<br><br>'Sir Alex Ferguson gave me his congratulations after. He is key to me being a success here. I'd heard good things about him before I came here but he is even better than I thought.'<br><br></div>
