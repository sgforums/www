              <p><em>Blogging regular <strong>Gavinio</strong> looks forward to seeing the fruits of Rodrigo Possebon's season-long spell in Portugal...<br><br></em><strong>Getting somewhat lost in the reaction to Michael Owen's arrival was the announcement that United's talented Brazilian midfielder, Rodrigo Possebon, will be spending the 2009/10 season on loan at Portuguese side Braga</strong>.<br><br>As a follower of United's reserves, I've taken a keen interest in Possebon's progress so far. Few reserve-team players have impressed me as much as he has in his short time at the club - in fact, I was so impressed by his accomplished, high-energy, box to box midfield displays, I even had his name and number printed on my blue replica shirt last season.<br><br>This time last year, he joined the senior squad in South Africa after a string of fine pre-season performances – and some stunning strikes – for the reserves. Following his unofficial debut in the Vodacom Challenge final against the Kaizer Chiefs, Sir Alex said: “I think the lad has got a chance.”<br><br>Just a couple of weeks later, Rodrigo made his first competitive appearance in the opening 1-1 draw at home to Newcastle. After coming on as sub for Ryan Giggs, he looked calm and confident on the ball, rarely giving away possession and not once shirking a challenge. As with Federico Macheda later in the season, many admirers inside Old Trafford that day wondered who the young foreign lad was but those of us who had seen Rodrigo in the reserves, either in the flesh or on MUTV, stood by smugly and declared we were witnessing the debut of a future United star.<br><br>Of course, injury prevented further progress when, in the first Carling Cup game of the season, he was the victim of a horrendous challenge from Middlesbrough's Emanuel Pogatetz. Seeing Rodrigo leave the field on</p>
              <p>a stretcher had many fearing the worse and it was only through sheer good fortune that the only physical damage done was a sizeable gash to the shin. Perhaps the psychological impact was more serious because when he was fit to play again, I felt his form was adversely affected and he did not feature for the first team as often as many of us had hoped.<br><br>Towards the end of the campaign, his form picked up again and he was rewarded with a cameo appearance in the last day win at Hull, where he looked back to his old, assured self. Although I was glad to see him in the first team again, I had already voiced the opinion on <a href="http://www.manutd.com/talkingreds"><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Talking Reds</span></span></em></strong></a> that his next season with us might be better spent on loan in order to aid his development.<br><br>I initially thought he might join a lower-division English club (in the Championship or League One) so the news he will be playing in Portugal came as a surprise. It could however prove to be a highly beneficial experience for Rodrigo. Braga finished fifth in the league last season and as a result will be taking part in the first Europa League, formerly the UEFA Cup.<br><br>So all being well, not only will Rodrigo be playing regular first-team league football, the prospect of him gaining valuable European experience means that next summer we could be seeing an even better player back at M16 to compete for a first team place. I for one wish Rodrigo well for the next 12 months and look forward to his return.</p>
