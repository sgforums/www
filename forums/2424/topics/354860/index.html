              <p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Jonny Evans has been backed to become a future Manchester United captain and even break Ryan Giggs' appearance record. </strong></p>
              <p>Sunderland boss Ricky Sbragia, who knows Evans well
              from his time at the helm of the Old Trafford reserve team, has tipped
              the Northern Ireland international to become a Red Devils legend.</p>
              <p>On
              top of witnessing Evans' emergence as a youngster, Sbragia crossed
              paths with the gifted centre-back when he spent time on loan with the
              Black Cats under former United midfielder Roy Keane.</p>
              <p>United boss
              Sir Alex Ferguson has handed Evans 23 appearances this season despite
              having Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic as his first-choice partnership.</p>
              <h4>Best players</h4>
              <p>And Sbragia told the <em>Independent on Sunday</em>: "He can be the captain of Manchester United. He'll be at United all his life.</p>
              <p>"I'd
              have though that Alex sees him as potential captain material long term.
              You could see him making a lot of appearances at United - I could see
              him making more appearances than Giggsy.</p>
              <p>"I can never see him
              leaving Man U. He'll be (there) until he's 33, 34 years old. He loves
              the place. He's going to be one of the best players in the league over
              the next few years."</p>
              <p>Sbragia believes United's scouting network should take all the credit for spotting Evans' talents as a youngster.</p>
              <h5>Composed</h5>
              <p>He
              added: "The first time I saw him play he was 16. Straightaway he looked
              a player. The first minute I saw him, you just knew he had something.</p>
              <p>"Jonny
              came in so relaxed, so composed. He had total belief in what he's got,
              he does not have that fear you sometimes get in young players. I don't
              think he ever gets nervous.</p>
              <p>"At United the foundations are good
              and they've got money, which helps, but the scouting is good, people
              who've really got an eye for a player. And Jonny was spotted, the
              reports came back that he was special."</p>
