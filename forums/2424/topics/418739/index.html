              <p>Second of their 4 games in 9 days... I guess this one could be very tough as it's an away match and played about 48 hrs right after their last game only... And also Birmingham will have a huge advantage not having played on Sat as their match was postponed... So I guess towards the end, or after 60 mins... It could start to show the difference...</p>
              <p>Let's hope for the best, a United win again... </p>

              <p>once again, we can see how utd's midfield is starved of creativity whenever gibson plays. No through splitting passes at all from him for 45 mins. And he doesnt assert his authority at all.</p>
              <p>Funny thing is fergie says rooney is in top form but he's losing balls and misplacing passes lol.</p>

              <p>Although Gibson did make the eventual assist for our only goal,i still don't think he warrant the place in the team yesterday considering the opposition we were against and our position in the table.Birmingham has proved time and time again they always let the big boys drop points at their ground and they proved it yet again at our team's expense...</p>
              <p>Some tactical stuff that got me puzzled.Was disappointed that our star man for the season-Nani was out of the team,must be still out with virus.With Park gone for Korean duty,was thinking which winger would replace him,hell,saw Gibson's name on the 4-4-2 line up with him as right wing.But,what they show on graphics isn't whats done on the field.Gibson was still playing as a MC,the right wing was either occupied by giggs or at times empty when rafael gets the ball and gets no support to put in proper balls into the box for the strikers.That's sorely lacking in width.If die die wanna play gibson i would have asked rooney to stick to the right wing instead of the left,and leave the left wing to old man Giggs instead.forming a 4-5-1 with both man on their favoured wings.</p>
              <p>Ideally,Gibson should not play fletcher would have done better on the right wing with his ability to put in crosses,Gibson can't cross for nuts!Would rather see Obertan play with more flair and provide width on the right flank which was very obviously empty.With more width i guess the team could have sealed the game before Birmingham eventually equalised .</p>

              <p>The Birmingham goal reminded me of Drogba's offside goal at Newcastle. But neverthessly, despite Man U kept on drawing at away from home:</p>
              <p>Chelsea vs Sunderland (H) 0-3<br>Birmingham vs Chelsea (A) 1-0</p>
              <p>0 point gotton.....</p>
              <p>Man U vs Sunderland (H) 2-0<br>Birmingham vs Man U (A) 1-1</p>
              <p>4 points gotton!!!</p>
              <p>That should be the reason why Man U is still leading coz they never taste a single defeat whereas the other teams have tasted more than 3 to 4 defeats.</p>

              <p>Realise that most of players were featured in sunderland match. They showed tiredness whereas Birmingham got more time to rest.</p>
              <p>Away from home, maybe. But if home, Man U can win. Only Rangers &amp; West Brom had managed to get a point at OT.</p>

              <h2>BOWYER SHOULD HAVE GONE - FERGUSON</h2>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson felt Birmingham goal hero Lee Bowyer should have been sent off for his first-half challenge on Darron Gibson during the 1-1 draw at St Andrews. </strong></p>
              <p>Bowyer received a yellow card from referee Lee Mason after a late lunge at Gibson, who was starting his first Barclays Premier League game since April.</p>
              <p>Ferguson felt Bowyer, who is 34 next week, should have been given his marching orders and he took advantage of staying on the pitch by scoring a last gasp equaliser.</p>
              <p>The United chief fumed: "The Bowyer tackle in the first half, I thought it was a red card. He's gone over the top of the ball.</p>
              <p>"Bowyer has been given a yellow card so nothing can be done about it (retrospectively). But it's a dangerous tackle."</p>
              <p>Ferguson's anger was also not helped when replays suggested Blues striker Nikola Zigic had been guilty of handball and committing a foul in the build-up to Bowyer's point-saving goal.</p>
              <p>But in the cold light of day he can reflect with satisfaction on United heading into the New Year on top of the table.</p>
              <p>They have lost only two league matches during 2010 and remain unbeaten in the top flight during the current campaign.</p>
              <p>Ferguson said: "I always say if we get to that top position on New Year's Day, then we've always got a great chance.</p>
              <p>"There's five or six teams who are all contesting that area towards the top of the league."</p>
              <p>With Wayne Rooney still without a club goal from open play in nine months, Ferguson will be relieved Dimitar Berbatov continues to sparkle.</p>
              <p>His 15th goal of the campaign at St. Andrew's means he has already passed his totals of 12 and 14 for his previous two campaigns at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Ferguson said: "Dimitar is in great form and it is good to see that. His confidence is high too - and that is important."</p>
              <p>Ferguson will hope that Arsenal will find it as difficult as the other leading teams when they visit Birmingham on Saturday.</p>
              <p>Alex McLeish's side have already beaten Chelsea and drawn with Tottenham at home this season in addition to gaining the point against United which moved them out of the bottom three.</p>
              <p>Ferguson said: "Maybe it will be seen as a good point in the long run. Absolutely. Birmingham is a very difficult place to come to.</p>
              <p>"You see their home record in terms of goals against them. Very few teams score goals at Birmingham.</p>
              <p>"That has been going on since Alex (McLeish) came here as a manager. They set their stall out very well."</p>
              <p>McLeish is constantly full of praise for the resilience shown by his team and their never-say-die attitude surfaced once again in thwarting United.</p>
              <p>But the former Scotland boss is also aware of the need for his team to start being more clinical in front of goal if they are to climb away from the relegation zone.</p>
