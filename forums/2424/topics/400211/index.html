              Rogelio Funes Mori has stated his desire to play in the Premier League 
              in the future. </strong></p>
              <p>The highly rated 19-year-old has just completed his first season 
              as a senior player in the Argentine capital of Buenos Aires, and has 
              caught the eye of some major clubs with a series of eye-catching 
              performances, including a hat-trick against local rivals Racing Club.</p>
              <p>Funes
               Mori, who was previously on Chelsea's radar and was offered trials at 
              Stamford Bridge, made the move to River and played his first game in 
              December of last year.</p>
              <p>A hat-trick against Racing Club at the 
              start of May has now seen him linked with Manchester United, who have 
              already signed young Mexican striker Javier Hernandez to add to their 
              striking riches.</p>
              <p>Funes Mori did not deny that the opportunity to 
              play under Sir Alex Ferguson at United was a fantastic one, but insisted
               he was just concentrating on his current club at the present time.</p>
              <p>"I
               really don't know anything about what is being said about the chance of
               going to Manchester United," Funes Mori told <em>Uno de Mendoza</em>.</p>
              <p>"All
               I know is by what is being said in the press.</p>
              <p>"Every player 
              dreams of having the chance to play in Europe and even more if it's in 
              the English Premier League, but I will have to talk about this with my 
              agent.</p>
              <p>"At this moment I'm enjoying the chance that I've been 
              given playing in River's first team in this championship that has just 
              finished. And at this moment I'm enjoying my holidays."</p>

              <p>Manchester United are reportedly considering making an offer for Barcelona defensive midfielder Yaya Toure. The Ivorian has struggled to retain a place in the Nou Camp starting line up due to Pepe Guardiola’s decision to turn to youngster Sergio Busquets on a more regular basis and this has left the former Monaco man to consider his future at the Catalan giants.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson could well do with a solid central midfielder after seeing Owen Hargreaves spend the best part of two seasons out injured. His other options have also suffered severe dips in form with Anderson and Michael Carrick both having very average seasons last term. The likes of Darren Fletcher and Paul Scholes continue to be consistent performers but neither are out and out battlers who actively seek to break down opposition attacks, which is what Toure does best.</p>
              <p>An added bonus would be the fact that the 27 year old is also a very adept centre back, as he proved in the 2009 Champions League Final against Man United. Arsenal and Manchester City have both been linked with a move for the battling powerhouse.</p>
              <p>The £18m rated Barca man will have to think long and hard about any offers for his services this summer and if he puts in a good World Cup the speculation may increase even further. Yaya will surely not be happy to warm the bench in this period of his career and would surely be interested in a move to Old Trafford.</p>

              <p>agree.. there is no news unless SAF is moving under the radar to avoid the big fishes..</p>
              <p>quite sad that as MU, a big club has to feed out what RM got to throw off their table.</p>
