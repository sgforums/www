That was the view of QPR boss John Gregory on Saturday after seeing his side battle gamely only to be undone by sub Grant Leadbitter's late winner. </strong><br><br>Victory over Rangers - their 14th win in 17 unbeaten matches since the turn of the year - lifted Sunderland four points clear at the Coca-Cola Championship summit with only three games remaining. Last season the Wearsiders were relegated from the top flight with a record low tally of 15 points. The worst team in the history of the Premiership are now poised to return as champions - and Gregory believes there is no chance of them being viewed as a soft touch with Keane at the helm.<br><br>"Sunderland have got that devil in them, which obviously comes from the manager," said the Rangers boss. "He knows what he wants and he'll get it. He expects certain standards, as he did as a player. "He ran the dressing room at Old Trafford for 10 years and if people didn't perform then he let them know about it.<br><br>"He's certainly getting the best out of his players and although the Premiership is a massive step up, Sunderland have the right man in charge. "Roy can attract the right people to the club and he knows what is needed to play in the Premiership. Keane has made an incredible impact on Wearside in his debut season in management and the idea that he will take the helm at Manchester United when Sir Alex Ferguson finally retires is gathering momentum.<br><br>When Keane took over at the Stadium of Light last August, Sunderland were second bottom in the Championship and heading for League One at pace. He has recreated belief and transmitted the same desire he had as a player into his shrewdly-assembled side.<br><br>Last week Sunderland announced a performance-related sponsorship deal with Boylesports which could net the club more than Â£10million over four years. That is nothing compared to the Â£50million bounty which will accompany their promotion to the Premiership.<br></div>
