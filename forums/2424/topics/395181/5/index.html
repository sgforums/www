              <p>hahaha liverpool problems is self made really. rafa likes to tinker his team, play his players out of positions, buy too many mediocre players like insua, riera, ngog, lucas, etc, and play negative football. his away match formation is always lucas and mascherano protecting the back 4. his communication with his players, esp those not playing is almost non existent.</p>

              <p>well, Bayern's coach said it best "no one will know what can happen when 11vs 11".</p>
              <p>In a way, I like what SAF is doing. He must be steaming hot, but he channels his energy outwards. I bet he believes 11vs11, outcome may have been different, but to say so, may destroy a young man's confidence and belief.</p>
              <p>Soccer is still a team's sport, all work as one. The team lost, let's focus on the last few games.  MU still have a blue juggernaut to bring down.</p>

              <p>Bayern should be one of black horses to win UCL. They have managed to avoid BArcelona but to have face them in finals if Catalans win against Inter Milan and they  win against Lyon.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Given that they were on the verge of being eliminated from UCL before the Juventus clash, they had reached the best already since the '99/00 final lost to Man U. Their recent best performance was on quarter-finals (I forgot the year already) but I remembered they lost 5-2 to AC Milan in aggrevate.</p>
