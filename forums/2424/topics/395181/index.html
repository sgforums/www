              <p>man u will prevail cos at the allianz arena, they seem overwhelmed and couldn't play their usual slick posession game. At old trafford, they will attack and attack. Even without rooney, the team has in form nani and valencia. Berbatov is on form too, just that it's not so evident cos everytime he plays well, the next game he makes way for rooney.</p>

              <p>The last time United was in a similar position it was Roma who came to OT with a 2 - 1 lead... And that match ended 7 - 1 to United...</p>
              <p>Bayern may decide to park the bus and hope to be profitable in counter-attacks given they have a slim lead advantage... One goal is all United need to change the outlook of this match.</p>

              <p>now got to rely on berbatov to score goals. need the midfielders and wingers to chip in to score goals liao, as berbatov tend to score one after many chances and fluffled the easiest of chances <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>

              <p>what a bad bad week this week has been.Rooney injured in midweek and united lost to chelsea at home. that said, all is not lost, as chelsea need to travel to spurs and liverpool, who are involved in the race for the 4th place. need both to either draw or beat chelsea.</p>
              <p>I have a feeling united may crash out of the CL against Bayern. if that happened, that would leave united winning only the league cup this season. hope I am wrong.</p>

              <p><strong>Wayne Rooney</strong><strong> has been 
              tipped to make a shock return for </strong><strong>Manchester 
              United</strong><strong> ahead of Wednesday's crucial </strong><strong>Champions League</strong><strong> match against </strong><strong>Bayern Munich</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
              <p>The striker was expected to be out for at least two to three weeks after he 
              injured ankle ligaments in last week's first leg in Germany, which United lost 
              2-1. However, according to reports last night, Rooney has responded well to 
              treatment and could be in line for a surprise recall to Sir Alex Ferguson's 
              squad if he comes through a training session today.</p>
              <p>Rooney has been wearing a protective boot on his injured leg since hobbling 
              off at the end of last week's defeat in Munich. Ferguson will not risk the 
              England forward if there is a chance of aggravating the injury further and last 
              night United's medical staff attempted to play down the chances of a comeback by 
              only rating his chances of playing as "40%".</p>
              <p>Rooney's return would be a boost for a United side 
              that lost 2-1 to Chelsea in the <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Premier League" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague">Premier League</a> without him on Saturday. They now trail Carlo Ancelotti's side by two points 
              with five games left to play.</p>

              <p>Actually do u guys find it funny when at the beginning of the season, Rooney wasnt really on fire, in fact he was facing goal drought. Giggs turned in superlative performances and United were again described as a one man team.</p>
              <p>Now that Rooney has scored plenty of goals and again United is labelled as a one-man team, the only difference is the main man now is Rooney and not Giggs.</p>
              <p>Both losses were due to United inefficiency in closing opposition down and to a large extent, the baffling tactics used by Fergie.</p>
              <p>Against Bayern in the 1st leg, we scored first and then park bus, the only thing is our bus is a single deck, not a double deck. It's a little amuse to see how long Fergie took to notice the problem before he haul off the ineffective Park and switched back to 4-4-2 from 4-5-1.</p>
              <p>Against Chelsea, Berba is simply not the kind of targetman Drogba is. Drogba is so strong and good in air and able to hold up the ball for his teammates to join in the attack. Berba is weak, lousy headers (i bet he'll miss his header even if the goal is empty. ) and flicks the ball away when defenders close down on him.</p>
              <p>Playing 3 supposed-retirees aint helping at all.</p>
              <p>I hope the losses fired up United to push all the way in this crucial period if not all the hard work in this season will be wasted.</p>
              <p>Aren't we good at proving the doubters wrong?</p>
              <p>We cant win anything with youngsters? Yes we can (Eat your words Alan Hansen).</p>
              <p>We cant match let alone surpass the Liverpool's titles record?18 titles and thats a fact.</p>
              <p>We will struggle without Tevez and Ronaldo? Carling Cup and counting. I hope. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>

              <p>The most likely candidate of the 3 oldies must be Neville as his position is relatively not so important and competitive compared to the other 2-giggs and scholes.</p>

              <p>sad to see so many united fans want gary out of the first team <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>but its equally frustrating to see an oldie who won so many trophies for united in the past, deteriorate and slow pace as gary at united RB. for goodness sake fergie, there are no room for being sentimental. you are as good as your last match is the saying. so I suppose gary is as bad as his last match.</p>
              <p>gary experience is his asset, but his lack of pace and tend to do things stupid are his liability.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">There was speculation this morning that the England striker could make a shock return at Old Trafford despite having sprained his ankle in the first leg last week. However, Ferguson dismissed those reports by claiming Rooney had "no chance" of featuring, before admitting there was a slim chance the striker could be involved as a substitute.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"He's got no chance," Ferguson said. "We've made some good progress with the lad, the medical team have done fantastic, but I'm not prepared to take a risk on a player who is not 100 per cent fit."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Ferguson then added: "The boy is making good progress. The medical team have done a fantastic job but it is an ankle injury the same as any other ankle injury. You can't take a risk with a player who is not 100 per cent."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Rooney was originally thought to be sidelined for two or three weeks but the striker's recovery has been quicker than anticipated, which led to rumours that he might be rushed back for the must-win match.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">One piece of good news for Ferguson is the likely availability of John O'Shea, who has not played since suffering complications in his recovery from a dead leg sustained in Ireland's World Cup play-off defeat byFrance in November. </p>

              <p>I rather he play from the start cos that would mean one less defensive player for Bayern... Good attacking players don't make good defenders...</p>
              <p>United will try to up the tempo for this one and force Bayern into a defensive formation... And Robben wouldn't be very useful. What i don't wish to see is Robben coming on as a sub mid-way through the 2nd half. Cos by then some of the United players will be tired so he might be more effective... </p>

              <p>The <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> striker has made rapid progress since

              <p>well, the thing about 451 is berba to hold the ball while wings come in to support. Park is to support berba closely and benefit from any thru balls or flicks. I recall Scholes doing the same at one stage, running off RVN.</p>
              <p>anyway, let's see what the old fox will do to turn the results round tonight.</p>
