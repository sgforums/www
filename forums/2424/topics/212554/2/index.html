            <div class='col-md body'><strong>MANCHESTER UNITED v NEWCASTLE UNITED, 2-0 Sun 1 Oct 2006</strong><br><br>Manchester United brushed Newcastle United aside at Old Trafford, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer netting twice as the Red Devils romped back to the Barclays Premiership summit.<br>The Norwegian tapped United in front just before the break, then sent Nemanja VidicÂ’s volley looping into the net to ensure the hosts scored a decisive victory against a Newcastle side who have not won at Old Trafford since 1972.<br><br>Aside from an injury to Gabriel Heinze, the only disappointment for the hosts was their failure to score more often, with Cristiano Ronaldo particularly unlucky, hitting the woodwork three times on his own.<br><br>The excellent Darren Fletcher was also denied by the post, and the agility of visitorsÂ’ keeper Steve Harper, who pulled off a string of fine saves to keep the margin of defeat within reasonable proportions.<br><br>As a contest, it was something of a disappointment, with Newcastle contributing little as an attacking force and an anticipated midfield duel between England past and future never materialising.<br><br>Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt, making his first appearance at Old Trafford since leaving United two years ago, both have vast experience at international level to call on.<br><br>Indeed, ScholesÂ’ talents are still so obvious, Steve McClaren called him again last week to see if there was any chance he might reverse his decision to retire from the England scene.<br><br>Given ScholesÂ’ desire to spend as much time as possible with his family and away from the limelight, it could hardly have been a surprise to McClaren the answer was no.<br><br>So, with Owen HargreavesÂ’ broken leg ruling him out of next weekÂ’s encounter Macedonia, Michael Carrick and Scott Parker lined up against each other knowing an England cap might rest on the outcome of their personal duel.<br><br>In the event, both men were overshadowed, not just by Ronaldo, who continues to respond in the most positive manner imaginable to the jeers of opposition fans, but Fletcher as well.<br><br>The Scotland international has had some detractors over the past 12 months, but few could doubt his guts, determination and energy helped drive United forward in their search for an opener.<br><br>Until United finally made the breakthrough, Fletcher had gone closest to scoring, steaming up alongside Wayne Rooney and Ronaldo, who combined to set him up for a 20-yard shot which thudded against HarperÂ’s right-hand post.<br><br>Although he could hardly claim to have been overworked, Harper was kept fairly busy and he needed to keep his nerve to hold a vicious Ronaldo free-kick which dipped right in front of him. He also brilliantly tipped over Vidic's powerful header from Ronaldo's corner.<br><br>Heinze was replaced in the 31st minute by Patrice Evra but just as it seemed the visitors would reach half-time on level terms, their defence was exposed by RonaldoÂ’s quick thinking.<br><br>The Portugal winger darted across to take a short corner and, after exchanging passes with Evra, embarked on an arcing run to the edge of the area.<br><br>Once there, he let fly with a shot which proved to be the first of three shots from Ronaldo alone which came crashing back off the frame of the visitorsÂ’ goal.<br><br>On this occasion, Solskjaer was on hand to tap home the rebound.<br><br>While the Norwegian could rightly claim his own poacherÂ’s instinct was responsible for that effort, his second was purely a case of being in the right place at the wrong time as far as Newcastle were concerned.<br><br>Vidic is still waiting for his first United goal but the volley he unleashed from Rio FerdinandÂ’s knockdown two minutes after the restart might have opened his account. Instead, it struck Solskjaer, then looped into the corner.<br><br>Suddenly, the Red Devils were flying. Harper saved superbly from Fletcher, with Ronaldo blasting the rebound against the bar when he should have done better.<br><br>Ronaldo struck the post yet again when, not for the first time, his mesmerising skill outwitted Stephen Carr; then Fletcher had a plausible penalty claim turned down when Taylor appeared to turn the ScotÂ’s shot away with an arm.<br><br>In the end, though, UnitedÂ’s outstanding midfield pair had to let Solskjaer take the goalscoring acclaim from a dominant performance which suggests Chelsea will face a meaningful challenge in their quest for a title hat-trick.<br><br><a href="http://premierleague.com/competition/matchreport/report.html?id=2722755" rel="nofollow">http://premierleague.com/competition/matchreport/report.html?id=2722755</a></div>
