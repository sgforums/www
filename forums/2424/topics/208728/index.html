            <div class='col-md body'>Alan Smith will start his third Reserves game of the season against Stockport County on Tuesday night.<br><br>Smith completed 90 minutes of action against Blackburn last Thursday and showed no adverse reaction, and will partner Aaron Burns in attack at Edgley Park. If the striker emerges unscathed from the Manchester Senior Cup clash, then he could potentially figure in Saturday's first team squad against Spurs.<br><br>The Reds begin their defence of the Senior Cup with several changes to the side that started the league season with a 1-0 win over Blackburn. Tom Heaton replaces Tomasz Kuszczak in goal, behind a back four of Kieran Lee, Danny Rose, Ryan Shawcross and Ritchie Jones. Floribert Ngalula makes his first start in exactly 11 months after missing the majority of last season with a serious hip injury.<br><br>The Belgian partners David Jones in the centre of midfield, with Sean Evans and Michael Barnes prowling on the wings. Burns' inclusion upfront sees Phil Marsh drop onto the bench, alongside Ron-Robert Zieler, Michael Lea and Craig Cathcart.<br><br>All proceeds from Tuesday night's game will be donated to the Stockport County Disabled Supporters Club for a new minibus. The game kicks off at 7:00pm and tickets are Â£4 for adults and Â£2 for all concessions.<br><br>United: Heaton, Lee, Rose, Shawcross, R Jones, D Jones, Barnes, Ngalula, Smith, Burns, Evans.<br>Subs from: Marsh, Zieler, Lea, Cathcart.<br><br><a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=360581" rel="nofollow">http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&amp;newsid=360581</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Alan Smith insists he is ready for a first team recall just as soon as Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson requires his services.<br><br>The 25-year-old has made a remarkable recovery from the horrific ankle and leg injury he sustained seven months ago at Anfield, when United crashed out of the FA Cup to Liverpool.<br><br>It had been thought that Smith would need considerably longer before he would be ready for competitive action but after 246 minutes of reserve team football he is confident of making a return.<br><br>Of the opinion that he could feature against Tottenham on Saturday, Smith is eager to put his injury woe behind him - although he is willing to accept that it will be very much one-step at a time.<br><br>"To come on as a sub would be no problem," he told the Manchester Evening News.<br><br>"But I think 90 minutes of Premiership football would be very difficult at the moment. If you are playing at Old Trafford, you get that adrenaline rush and and that would see you through a sub appearance. But a full game is a different thing.<br><br>"There was no schedule put on the number of reserve matches I need before I am ready.<br><br>"I am fine as far as the injury is concerned. I still need more gym work, but I also need matches.<br><br>"But if the gaffer were to ask me if I would be ready for the bench against Spurs, I would say 'yes' without hesitation.<br><br>"If it is not this weekend then, over the next few weeks, I am hoping to get on the bench. We have the Champions League starting next week against Celtic, and with seven allowed on the bench, then there might be a chance."<br><br>Prior to injury and Smith had primarily been used as a midfielder but in the summer, following the signing of Michael Carrick, Ferguson announced that he intended to play the former Leeds man in his more natural position as a striker.<br><br>While accepting the call made by his taskmaster, Smith is convinced that he could have cut the cloth as a holding midfielder.<br><br>"It could have been a future permanent position for me and I was confident enough to take it on and do it," said Smith.<br><br>"Playing midfield wasnÂ’t a problem. I enjoyed it. But I knew the gaffer always wanted to buy players in the summer for that position.<br><br>"But I am glad to go back up front though because it is my natural position. I love playing with my back to the defender. ThatÂ’s my game and when I am at my best."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Alan Smith is ready to make his long-awaited comeback from injury against Tottenham this weekend.<br><br>"I am fine as far as the injury is concerned. I still need more gym work, but I also need matches. But if the Gaffer were to ask me if I'd be ready for the bench against Spurs, I'd say `yes' without hesitation.<br><br>Â“If it is not this weekend then, over the next few weeks, I am hoping to get on the bench. We have the Champions League starting next week against Celtic, and with seven allowed on the bench, then there might be a chance.Â”<br><br>For Smith to be back in action at all is incredible, given the huge damage his ankle ligaments suffered in February's FA Cup defeat against Liverpool at Anfield.<br><br>He added: Â“I am just plugging away. I had my second 90 minutes at Stockport and I feel better every time.<br><br>Â“My ankle is getting stronger all the time in matches and training. It aches in the last 10 minutes when a bit of fatigue sets in, but that is not unnatural because it is still fixing back together.<br><br>Â“The dislocation of my ankle was the worst part of the injury because all the ligaments have to heal<br><br>Â“I have a plate that supports my leg and takes all the strain off it. So thatÂ’s not a problem. It is just building up the ankle. I need to build up my calf muscle as well.<br><br>"The work goes on in the gym but I am just happy to be playing football again, especially so soon, and that is credit to the all the medical staff at the club.Â”<br></div>
