              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Ferguson has confirmed he has no intention of recruiting top names when the window reopens next week.</p>
              <p>Instead his focus remains on ensuring United are on the shoulders of the Premier League leaders going into 2009.</p>
              <p>United face Stoke on Boxing Day buoyed by the fact they are now
              Club World Champions after defeating LDU Quito in Japan on Sunday.</p>
              <p>Ferguson feels they have the personnel to cope with remainder of the campaign.</p>
              <p>He said: "I do not think there will be any January transfers. I am happy with what I have got.</p>
              <p>"We are probably going to bring back a couple of young players who have been on loan. That may just give us extra protection.</p>
              <p>"We took 23 players to Japan and they are very substantial players. I would be happy to play any one of them.</p>
              <p>"Winning the competition was a great boost to the club and the
              players. It was a great achievement and the important thing was they
              played well.</p>
              <p>"They showed good enthusiasm through the matches and good concentration. We have come through it well."</p>
              <p>While United were away in the Far East, the top two, Liverpool and Chelsea dropped points.</p>
              <p>Most recently, Liverpool drew at Arsenal while Chelsea had to settle for a point against Everton at Goodison Park.</p>
              <p>United are seven points adrift of Liverpool and six behind Chelsea - but have two games in hand on both.</p>
              <p>Ferguson is now intent on regaining the high ground.</p>
              <p>He said: "If we get within a point or two of the leaders by New Year's Day then we are in with a chance.</p>
              <p>"The second half of the season is the most important because if
              you lose a game it means something, particularly when you get to March
              and April.</p>
              <p>"Recent results have been predictable. Arsenal and Liverpool,
              given the position of the clubs and the history of the clubs, you
              expect a tight match.</p>
              <p>"Because of Everton's poor record against Chelsea you were
              worried about that. But having watched the game, they will consider
              themselves unlucky not to win the match. Equally, so I thought Chelsea
              defended well."</p>
              <p>United will train on Christmas morning before making the 40-mile trip after dinner with their families.</p>
              <p>Ferguson expects Stoke to come out with all guns blazing when they meet at lunchtime.</p>
              <p>"We would probably have preferred a later kick-off, " he said. "I just hope our preparation is right.</p>
              <p>"I have been to the Britannia a few times and there is always
              that really hot atmosphere. They are very passionate people. You have
              to deal with that.</p>
              <p>"We expect Stoke to fight for everything because you look at how tight the league is. It is the tightest I can remember.</p>
              <p>"It may need over 40 points for a team to be guaranteed safety, maybe even 43."</p>
