              <p><strong>Two members of the Ronaldo family have backed Cristiano to secure a record move to Real Madrid at the end of the season.</strong></p>
              <p>Manchester United hero Ronaldo remains strongly linked to the
              Spanish champions, and the Portuguese’s godfather understands that
              Madrid are still in pole position to seal a transfer.</p>
              <p>“Last’s year’s mistake was speaking too much about Real Madrid,”
              Fernao told Marca. “This year he doesn’t say anything about it and no
              doubt it will help his move.</p>
              <p>“We are going to see if this year it goes quickly and if there are
              fewer problems. Real Madrid need to sign Cristiano Ronaldo. They need
              such a player.</p>
              <p>“Lately they haven’t been great and his arrival would be wonderful for them.”</p>
              <p>Ronaldo’s nephew Luis Filipe, added: “Cristiano, [Andres] Iniesta and [David] Villa would make Madrid a terrific team.</p>
              <p>“He has won everything with United and I believe that he needs new
              targets in another team. He experienced great years with Manchester but
              to me it’s the moment to succeed somewhere else.”</p>

              haha give him a new contract he won't or able to reject.
              
              Sign him to a 5 years contract, pay him 160k-180k pounds a week, as he is still an important player to Man Utd. 
              
              Give him the benefit of the doubt, as he was playing 2 much games last season plus EURO 2008 and he underwent an operation and was sidelined till September, and he also didnt go thru the proper pre-season training, as pre-season training is very important to perform well in the coming season. Given that he did not, so he needed at least 1-2 months to be match fit after he came back, not to mention coming to form.
              
              This season he was a pale shadow from last season, but he still top scored for Man Utd this season isn't it. Next season and touch wood, he won have to undergo off season surgery and start pre-season training in July, then I expect him to start the season strongly, certainly better than this season.

              Ronaldo hit last season's height because he was the striker in chief, sharing the responsibilities with Rooney and Tevez.
              
              This season, berbatov was the striker in chief and Ronaldo back to being on the wings.
              
              When he first joined Man Utd at 18, I knew he was a special player cos of his abundance of trickery and skills. in 5 years time, he has moulded from a teen to a world class player, although his form of late sucks. But bear in mind he didnt go thru the proper pre-season training. to get match fit, he needed another 1-2 mths of matches to play.
              
              If possible, make him play for Man Utd until he retire.
