But in February we played the Carling cup final against Wigan and I remained on the bench for the full 90 minutes.<br><br>'To me this felt like a stab in the back.'<br></div>

Cos Real have a number of good &amp; young strikers and very soon he will have to make way for them too and if his attitude is the same as how he behave at Man u &amp; Holland after being dropped, then Capello won't take it also.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yup. After 2 games he didn't perform well, MVB decided to drop him. But when he was told, Ruud wasn't happy and they had an argument and he didn't bother to train seriously with the team... That was why, when Holland was losing their 3rd game, MVB didn't bring him on and decided to bring someone else in cos he was upset by Ruud's behaviour and reaction to being dropped.<br><br>Unfortunately, the guy has been playing 1st team for too long that he cannot accept being drop by the coach.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There was no point keeping him really. Tho he has done well before but clearly he is no longer the player that he is 3 yrs ago... He is now slower than before, didn't have the motivation to run at united cos he was too use to life as an old staff so felt he deserve the extra special treatment and respect.<br><br>Fergie treated him well actually... in Dec or Jan when they were selecting a captain, Fergie even considered him together with Neville but felt Neville would be a better choice eventually.<br><br>As much as he had done for the team, he should also realise that the team comes first and not his personal feelings. He should understand that Fergie had to do whats best for the team even if it meant giving his place to someone else who is in form at that point.<br><br>Players like Teddy Sheringham, Dennis Bergkamp all changed their style of play when they became older. They were mostly used as subs too cos with their talent &amp; experience, they found a way to complement the team and lasted an extra few years with their team.<br><br>Ruud badly need to grow up and realise Capello is not going to give him first team games all the time. Very soon, once the new arrival feeling is over... if not this year than next... he will find that he will be on the bench more and more often at Real... Then what is he going to do? Complain about Capello?</div>
