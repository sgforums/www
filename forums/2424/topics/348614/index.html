              <p>Paul Scholes is not known for talking. Instead, the Manchester United midfielder has, throughout a long and distinguished career, preferred to express himself through his actions on the park.</p>
              <p>However, there is currently plenty of talking going on about the Salford-born former England international, with Wayne Rooney and Dimitar Berbatov hailing the unassuming Scholes' contributions to what could be an almost incredible season for the Red Devils.</p>
              <p>Now his manager Sir Alex Ferguson has chosen to add his voice to the
              praise flowing in Scholes' direction by expressing his pride in the
              midfielder's continuing excellence.</p>
              <p>Scholes scored United's openeer in their 3-0 victory over Fulham at
              Old Trafford last night, netting with a trademark volley after
              Cottagers' goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer fumbled his effort.</p>
              <p>"Paul tries that in training every day. He usually tries to hit me," Ferguson joked to <em>The Manchester Evening News.</em></p>
              <p>"He was fantastic. Some of his switches of play were magnificent.<br><br>"These
              lads are great examples to young players in how they live their life.
              They have kept their ambition, which is important. We are delighted
              with their performance and are so proud to have them here."</p>
              <p>Ferguson also felt that Chelsea's title challenge was finished now,
              although he stopped short of completely writing them off, but pointed
              to the size of United's squad as his biggest reason for domestic
              optimisim this campaign.</p>
              <p>"You can never be dead sure, but it is fair to say Chelsea have an uphill fight now," he said.</p>
              <p>"Things can happen. We were 12 points clear of Arsenal in 1998 but
              we got a lot of injuries and lost the league. Now we can cope with it,
              like we have done in the last few weeks.</p>
              <p>"That is the change at this club. We have such a big squad we can make changes."</p>

              <p>Paul Scholes opened the scoring for Manchester United on Wednesday evening, volleying home a corner to spark a 3-0 rout of Fulham.<br><br>Although he's played down the strike, team-mates Dimitar Berbatov and Wayne Rooney have heaped praise on the wily midfielder.<br><br>The
              34-year-old told the club's official website of his goal, which
              squirmed under the body of Cottagers 'keeper Mark Schwarzer, "I don't
              think it was one of my better ones.<br><br>"It was a great ball from
              Michael [Carrick] to find me and I caught it quite well. The keeper
              will probably be a little disappointed he didn't save it but I was
              happy it spun into the net.<br><br>"Over the years I have always
              contributed goals but in the last couple of seasons that hasn't been
              the case as I have been playing slightly deeper. Hopefully there'll be
              more."<br><br>Berbatov, who added the second goal, said of Scholes, "Nobody else in the world can play the way Scholes does.<br><br>"The passes he produces all over the field and the way he changes the game is brilliant."<br><br>The
              returning Rooney came on to put the gloss on the win with his first
              touch but reserved his praise for Scholes, too. ‘Roo’ added, "I thought
              [Scholes' goal] was brilliant and I thought Scholesy was outstanding.<br><br>"Some of his passing you don't see that often from players around the world and it was joy to watch."</p>
