              <p><strong>Alex Ferguson has admitted that axing Park Ji-Sung from his squad for
                      last season's Champions League final against Chelsea was the "hardest
                      decision I have ever had to make".</strong><br> <br> United went on to lift their third European Cup following a dramatic
                      penalty shoot-out victory in Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium on May 21, but
                      South Korean midfielder Park was forced to watch the game from the
                      stands, sat in his club suit, after being omitted from the 18-man squad
                      by manager Ferguson.</p>
              <p>Having fought back from a serious knee injury to return to action last
                      December, the former PSV Eindhoven star had appeared to have made
                      himself a key figure as United closed in on a Premier League and
                      Champions League double.<br> <br> But the 27-year-old still missed out on a place on the bench in Moscow.<br> <br> Ferguson, despite selling the likes of David Beckham and Ruud van
                      Nistelrooy and ruthlessly dropping high-profile players such as Jim
                      Leighton, Bryan Robson and Steve Bruce from FA Cup final teams during
                      his reign as United boss, admits his decision to axe Park was as tough
                      as any.<br> <br> "It was a terrible decision to have to take. In many ways it was the
                      hardest decision I have ever had to make because Ji-Sung had played
                      such a great part in the previous games against Roma and Barcelona.<br> <br> "But I had Owen Hargreaves for that game in Moscow because I felt he
                      was the right one for that specific game. Then I had the decision of
                      choosing our seven substitutes and which players could have an impact
                      on the game.<br> <br> "You look for a mix of defenders, midfielders and attackers and I opted
                      to go with Nani ahead of Ji-Sung, simply because I think Nani has got a
                      goal in him. That was the only distinction and why I finally chose to
                      go with Nani."</p>
