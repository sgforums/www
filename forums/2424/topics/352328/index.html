              <p>After the latest round of games in The Premier League, Opta have
              assessed the performances of the top-flight goalkeepers and reveal who
              gave the best and worst goalkeeping displays, according to their unique
              statistical analysis.</p>
              <p>18th met 19th in the league in a classic relegation
              six-pointer between Portsmouth and Middlesbrough at the weekend, in
              which the South Coast side were eventually forced to return home with
              just a point despite taking a first-half lead through Peter Crouch.
              However the situation could have been worse had it not been for the
              efforts of their veteran goalkeeper, David James.</p>
              <p>James was busy for most of the match, most notably making a
              reflex save to deny Tuncay after the hour mark. However, even though
              Boro found themselves reduced to ten men in the 77th minute, the
              England international still had plenty of work to do in the latter
              stages of the game and was helpless to prevent Marlon King’s header
              from flying past him, though his save from Afonso Alves in the dying
              moments undoubtedly claimed his side a vital point. Having made six
              saves and four catches he is Opta’s best keeper of the week.</p>
              <p><img src="http://i40.tinypic.com/f4oc5h.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>How the mighty are fallen... Two weeks ago Edwin van der Sar was the
              hottest property in English football, having kept a record-breaking 14
              consecutive clean sheets in the league. Then at St James’ Park the
              cracks began to show as he conceded a ninth minute goal away to
              Newcastle, a side who at the time had not scored in two consecutive
              league matches. However it would have been difficult to predict the
              scale of his howler at home to Liverpool.</p>
              <p><img src="http://i42.tinypic.com/2nl5pp0.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>Van der Sar faced five shots on his goal against United’s North-West
              rivals, managing to concede four goals, two of which were from outside
              the area, and failing to make a single save from a shot inside his own
              box.</p>
              <p>Naturally the full blame must not fall on one man’s shoulders,
              but the Dutch ‘keeper will have been feeling red-faced as United
              conceded four goals at home in the league for the first time in the
              Premier League era, as he made just one save during the whole match.</p>
