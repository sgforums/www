              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Manchester United star Ronaldo has heralded the
              past season as "spectacular" but warned his opponents he can still be
              even better.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>The winger scored 42 goals in all competitions
              for United in a stunning campaign which yielded the Premier League
              crown and the Champions League title, and he has taken George Best's
              mantle as the most prolific midfielder in the club's history.</p>
              <p>"Every season at Manchester United I have improved," said Ronaldo.</p>
              <p>"The season was spectacular and I scored many goals on the way to winning two important titles for the club.</p>
              <p>"Next year I'm going to try and play even better and have an even better season than this one.</p>
              <p>"I played a spectacular championship, a good Champions League
              and I am very happy with everything. It was my first European title and
              I want to win it many more times because the feeling is amazing."</p>
              <p>Speculation that the 23-year-old is poised to join Spanish
              giants Real Madrid has been rife all week but Ronaldo has reiterated
              his desire to remain at Old Trafford for the immediate future and
              insists he is now only focused on representing Portugal at Euro 2008
              next month.</p>
              <p>"I have a contract with Manchester United and at the moment I
              am only thinking about having a successful European Championship," he
              said.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo admitted feeling jaded after arriving in Portugal on
              Friday to join up with the national squad following prolonged
              celebrations in Moscow, but is looking forward to continuing his superb
              form on the international stage.</p>
              <p>"I feel a little tired today (Friday) but I am going to have a
              rest in order to be ready for the Euros," he told Portuguese newspaper
              O Jogo.</p>
              <p>"I'm going to arrive there in form and anything is possible."</p>

              <p>well, physically, he can't rely on his speed as what we can see in scholes, giggs or even owen.</p>
              <p>however, he may improve his vision, passing, crossing..</p>

              <p>I feel that he will still improve next season... and the season after that too But after that, if he is still able to maintain his standard... should be thankful... Cos his game is not just speed alone... its also the quickness of his twisting and turning that allow him to beat defenders...</p>
              <p>On the speed side, I don't think he will lose much of it until he is about 28 but the quick twice and turn and how he control and roll the ball over his feet... that part may go...</p>
              <p>The big question is will he be able to adjust his game when he reaches 28 cos not many are able to... Only Ryan Giggs is one of the few that has don't well in this area... I recalled afew years back, Fergie wanted to buy Duff or Kewell to replace Giggs...</p>
              <p>Then Giggs was coming to 29, 30 and lots of people thought he has lost it and the 2 youngsters were like 23, 24... But it has turn out, these 2 have not played their best football for the last 2 yrs already... while Giggs is still going strong at 34... So not every player can last to 30... Some by the age of 27, 28... their career seems to be going down from there... George Best was a good example of a great player finished at 27... </p>

              <p>he still can improve.From my view,this season,he has used less of his fanciful tricks during games.And goals has added to another dimension to his game,it all goes down to his good positioning,more of a striker's instinct to get into gd positionings for team mates to make the crucial final ball to him,n his finishing has improved a lot.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What he can improve now is really his crossing..and long range passing(like carrick,alonso).Add these 2 to his game,and mind you he will be as gd as unstoppable.He can do damage once he has the ball,either making the crucial accurate ball,cross it or strike it.</p>
