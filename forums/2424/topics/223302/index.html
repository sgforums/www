He will then try and keep those players out the side.<br><br>"He's a natural finisher, he's lean and he's as brave as a lion.

            <div class='col-md body'>Sir Alex Ferguson has defended his decision to sign 35-year-old Henrik Larsson on loan and says Manchester United plan more transfer activity in January.<br><br>Ferguson, who also revealed he will be recalling 19-year-old Giuseppe Rossi from his loan spell at Newcastle at the beginning of next month, says Larsson could have the same impact at Old Trafford as Teddy Sheringham.<br><br>'Some players look after themselves very well, so their age confuses you in terms of what you see on the football field,' said Ferguson. 'I let Teddy go five years ago when he got an offer from Tottenham which I told him he'd be stupid to turn down. He has played for two other clubs since then, which is amazing.'<br><br>Having decided against pursuing more striking options following his deal for Larsson, Ferguson confirmed he is now looking to strengthen his midfield, with another bid for injured Bayern Munich star Owen Hargreaves still possible.<br><br>'We're not sitting on our backsides,' Ferguson said of United's general transfer situation. 'There could be another development yet. But I don't want to comment on the Hargreaves situation. I don't want to upset those poor Germans. They're very fragile.'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Larsson loan is a good way to boost the strike force and it's definitely the most clever way. Cos Smith and Ole can work on their fitness quickly to stake their claim in the squad, Rossi can impress Fergie as well and there will be less fear of Saha or Rooney getting injured.<br><br>However, it looks wierd for an experience player to sit on the bench.

Fergie had twice tried to sign Larsson when the Swede was at Celtic but failed in his attempt to convince one of Europe's most prolific goalscorers and most intelligent players to move south of the border. And as he watched Larsson come off the bench to wreck Arsenal's European Cup dream by playing a key part in both Barcelona goals in their 2-1 win.<br><br>But yesterday, almost four years after he first tried to lure Larsson to Old Trafford, Fergie finally landed the 35-year-old on a short-term loan deal. The striker is eligible to play in Europe this season, and the Manchester United boss described the move as "a brilliant bit of business".<br><br>"In Henrik we've got a player who can change games," said Fergie.<br>Larsson's decision to join United stunned the football world, not least because he decided to leave Barcelona last summer in order to see out his playing days at Helsingborg, the home town club where he began his illustrious career.<br><br>Fergie himself admitted he had not given a move for Larsson a moment's thought until United's chief scout Jim Lawlor was alerted to the striker's potential availability during the Swedish winter break by Helsingborg coach Stuart Baxter.<br><br>"When Henrik left Barcelona last summer, we were under the impression he wanted to go back to Sweden, which of course he did," said Fergie. "But our chief scout is friendly with the Helsingborg coach, and he mentioned to us about the prospect of taking Henrik on loan during Sweden's winter break.<br><br>"We got in touch with the Helsingborg board of directors and were fortunate enough to be able to agree a deal with them to get Henrik on loan. Although Fergie steered clear of the comparison yesterday, there are uncanny similarities between Larsson and former United striker Teddy Sheringham in terms of their style and intelligent reading of the game.<br><br>But where Larsson will be most effective for United is in performing late cameo roles for games in which United are unable to break down opponents and need a player with his vision and goalscoring ability to make a breakthrough.<br><br>He is more than just a goalscorer, as Arsenal skipper Thierry Henry pointed out in the aftermath of last season's Champions League Final.<br><br>"People always talk about Ronaldinho and his magic, but I didn't see him in this game," said Henry. "I saw Henrik Larsson. That's where the magic was. Two times he came at us with those little short runs. When he started buzzing around the box he changed the game, that is what killed us.<br><br>"People talk about Ronaldinho and Samuel Eto'o for Barcelona, but they need to talk about the proper footballer who made the difference against us - Larsson."<br><br>And only last week, Ronaldinho was expressing his regret Barcelona had failed to hold on to Larsson, the double World Player of the Year describing the mercurial Swede as "my idol".<br><br>So if he's good enough for Henry and Ronaldinho, despite his advancing years, surely Larsson will be good enough for Fergie and United, perhaps proving as big a coup as the 1992 deal that saw Eric Cantona join from Leeds.<br><br>'It's a brilliant bit of business. In Henrik we've got a player who can change games.. he can play left, right, or through the middle because he's an intelligent player'<br><br></div>

In the transfer market dominated by Chelsea and Barca / Real Madrid, its something that no one will think of.<br><br>Moreover, the role that Larsson will play does not require him to play the full match - but rather to come in at the later part to score.<br><br>Besides, SAF is good working with Scandavian players and Man U always thrive well with them.  And if there's anybody who can coax the best out of these evergreen players, it will be SAF - he has done that with Laurent Blanc, Sheringham, and theres no reason why he cannot do the same with Larsson.<br><br>In addition, Larsson's credentials ranked him well amongst the top.</div></blockquote>huh, Laurent, don't go that lah...</div>
