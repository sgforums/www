            <div class='col-md body'>I kinda feel that Smudger shld continue to work on being a midfielder. He started as a striker no doubt, but he has qualities that'll make him better suited as a DMF for united.<br><br>With united's playing style, Smithy's striking style does seem a bit off. Still, with United's current lack of strikers, i do wonder why SAF doesn't play him at all. Oh well, we'll just hv to wait and see.</div>
