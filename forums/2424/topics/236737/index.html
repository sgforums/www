            <div class='col-md body'>Sir Alex Ferguson believes Rio Ferdinand has been value for money as he prepares to make his 200th appearance for Manchester United.<br><br>Ferdinand, who joined United for a then British record of Â£30million from Leeds in 2002, is in line to reach the milestone of 200 games for United against Charlton on Saturday.<br><br>Ferguson believes the England international has justified his massive transfer fee during his time at Old Trafford and rates him as the best defender in the world.<br><br>"It is hard to pick a better defender in the world than Rio," said Ferguson.<br><br>"When he came to us, he was a player of enormous potential. That was evident in everything you saw of him.<br><br>"He has always had fabulous technique, great pace and balance. He is two-footed and 6ft 3in, so he has everything you would wish for in a centre-half.<br><br>"But he also had moments when he was careless and he would give the opposition a chance, because he was so relaxed.<br><br>"Thankfully, his maturity has brought that edge to his game where he handles everything now.<br><br>"When I paid that kind of money for Rio we were looking for a return in terms of getting 10 years' service out of him.<br><br>"Well, he has been here five years now - and we are looking at 10 to 12 years in total.<br><br>"He is happy here and he is on a good contract. The longer he is here, the more it benefits us."</div>
