              <p><strong>IF Darren Fletcher's value increased with every passing minute of last
              week's Champions League final spare a thought for Owen Hargreaves.</strong><br> <br>The
              absence of the England international for almost the entirety of last
              season was papered over by a collective responsibility at Old Trafford,
              with Fletcher rising to the occasion better than anyone and Ryan Giggs
              reinventing himself as a central midfielder supreme.<br> <br>But
              despite a campaign that came so close to perfection, there has been the
              niggling feeling throughout that United's engine room has lacked that
              certain something.<br> <br>That certain something provided by the likes of Bryan Robson, Paul Ince and Roy Keane in Sir Alex Ferguson's greatest creations.<br> <br>That
              certain something that despite Michael Carrick's swagger and vision,
              Giggs' ageless intelligence and Fletcher's snapping and snarling, has
              remained conspicuously absent since Keane left in acrimony three and a
              half years ago.<br> <br>That three titles and one Champions League
              have been acquired without a recognised midfield general is a testament
              to Fergie's ability to reinvent his side without the enforcer that his
              best teams have always included. But it's a deficiency that's been
              highlighted by Liverpool and Barcelona.<br> <br> <strong>Display</strong> <br> <br>How
              United could have done with a Keane to bully Andres Iniesta and Xavi in
              Rome last Wednesday - or if nothing else stir a lifeless United out of
              their inertia. It's hard to imagine such a lack-lustre display had
              Fletcher been on the field - such is the impact of the Scotland
              international, who has transformed himself from terrace joke to one of
              the most valued members of Ferguson's squad.<br> <br>His
              performances against Arsenal in the Champions League semi-final were
              arguably the crowing moment of his United career thus far. His unjust
              sending off in the second leg robbed him of a place in the final and
              Fergie of the one man in his squad who might have been able to get to
              grips with a brilliant Barcelona midfield.<br> <br>But for all
              Fletcher's progress, it will be with great expectation that Fergie
              anticipates Hargreaves' return from operations on both knees to cure
              tendonitis.<br> <br>After undergoing career-saving surgery at Dr
              Richard Steadman's Colorado clinic in September, Fergie will hope to
              have a fully-fit Hargreaves for the first time since signing him from
              Bayern Munich for £17m in 2007.<br> <br>At the time Hargreaves was
              seen as one of the best combative midfielders in world football and the
              ideal foil to release Carrick further up the pitch as the pinnacle of
              the midfield, rather than the base.<br> <br>Only rarely has
              Hargreaves been deployed in that position, instead plugging gaps on the
              right of midfield or defence as needs be.<br> <br>But he was signed as a player to succeed Keane rather than emulate John O'Shea as a dreaded utility player.<br> <br>Ferguson
              now faces an anxious wait to discover whether Hargreaves will be ready
              for the start of next season - and is not expected to find out until
              July if the 28-year-old has got the all clear.<br> <br>That could
              leave the United manager with the difficult decision of whether to
              start the 2009/10 campaign with Fletcher as his only recognised
              combative midfielder. There are options available if he chooses to
              splash out in the transfer market, with AC Milan's Italian
              international Gennaro Gattuso an obvious choice.<br> <br>Sir Alex
              is a confirmed admirer of the former Rangers midfielder, who produced
              such a sterling performance against United in the Champions League
              semi-final in 2007.<br> <br> <strong>Departure</strong> <br> <br>Though
              he has so far resisted any attempts to be lured away from the San Siro,
              the departure of coach Carlo Ancelotti to Chelsea could colour his
              thoughts.<br> <br>It is extremely unlikely Ancelotti will take him
              with him to Stamford Bridge with arguably the best midfield general in
              Europe already there in Michael Essien.<br> <br>Chelsea also have
              Jon Obi Mikel, whose outstanding performance against Everton in the FA
              Cup final on Saturday only endorsed the contention that he has the
              ability to fill the role vacated by Claude Makelele.<br> <br>Ferguson
              may now be regretting his decision not to firm up his interest Wigan's
              Wilson Palacios in January, with the Honduras international playing
              such an important role in Tottenham's revival in the second half of the
              season.<br> <br>The United manager was an admirer of Palacios, who
              cost Harry Redknapp £12m, but having already laid out for Zoren Tosic
              and Adem Ljajic during that transfer window, he was reluctant to spend
              again.<br> <br>Another option - if a little unlikely - is Gareth
              Barry of Aston Villa. City, Liverpool and Arsenal are all interested in
              the England international, who might get his wish to quit Villa Park
              this summer, and how Fergie would love to get one over those rivals.<br> <br>But
              while Barry performs a holding role for England, he might be seen as
              too similar to Carrick, especially with a price tag in the region of
              £17m.<br> <br>Much will depend on Hargreaves' fitness, but while
              Barcelona proved a diminutive and mobile midfield can still reach the
              summit of European football, Fergie's sides have always looked more
              balanced with the type of aggression that only a Robson, Ince, Keane -
              or even a Hargreaves - can provide.</p>
