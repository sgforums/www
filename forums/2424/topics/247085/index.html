            <div class='col-md body'>I agree that they should forget about the CL. Like i said before, the CL will cause them to play 2nd rated players like Richardson, Fletcher and O'Shea in the league... Honestly, i hope they will go out of the CL asap cos its not helping with the current injury situation they have got. If they don't have injuries to important players i will wish to see them going all out in every competition but that is not the case right now. Fergie just have to look at Wenger and he should learn from the mistakes Wenger did in trying to spread his team too thin... At the beginning many thought how good the gunners was but at the end, they were out of all competition within 11 days.<br><br>People shouldn't be too upset with the lost, we can see from the match how Portsmouth played... they were like a crazy team chasing everything. But then they could afford cos they don't play a match in every 3 to 4 days... This was an away match, is wasn't going to be easy... away matches at this stage are very hard... we have just saw how Chelsea needed injury time to save them and that was only against a lowly Watford team. But West Ham, Newcastle and Arsenal could give them more problems.<br><br>I would say the title is still pretty open... We should all be happy that united are still in the title chase at the stage of the competition cos last year this time the title was long gone. We have to remember that united have only added $20m to their last year's team while last season's winner have added another $80m to theirs... So don't give up hope, united are still doing well.<br><br>It will help if united get vidic and neville back soon... Anyway, the match at Stamford Bridge is not a given... If any team can get points out of them, it is united. They have ended Arsenal's 49 games unbeaten run, and they have also ended Pool's 2 yrs unbeaten home record as well... So why not Chelsea's.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>
