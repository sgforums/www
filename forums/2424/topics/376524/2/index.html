              <p>either team win or draw is a good result for utd, but if they were to draw and cancel each other out, it would be the most favourable result for utd, supposing utd were to beat sunderland at home.</p>

              <p>O'Shea has done well at RB, but he is not a specialist right back. his best position may have been central defence due to his height.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>he started at left back for man utd when he first came on the scene in 2003, but faltered in the next season and in 2005. he then became a utility player in central defence, right back and defensive midfielder, but injuries to brown landed him the spot since last season.</p>

              <p>well, glad that we still have these two veterans to call upon, else we will be staring @ a draw.. (Funnily, just looking @ EPL table, seems a lack of draws this season leh).</p>
              <p>anyway, IMHO, we can see Valencia lacks the confidence, that even when 1-1 with keeper, he can't finish.but with his pace, close control &amp; strength, this fella got potential (hard to dispose him of the ball). but from his face, feels he is very pressured..</p>
              <p>Nani is back to his worst. Trying too hard, and not passing when necessary.</p>
              <p>Scholes was fortunate to stay on pitch after his "handball". Another ref, another day, and he would be off.</p>
              <p>Foster did well, and he even cleared one with his right leg. Surprise, surprise.</p>
              <p>Park, Carrick seems to fall down the pecking order. Wonder what happened..</p>
              <p>If I am not wrong, it is only Berba 2nd goal of the season.. Just hope he can "explode" and score more..</p>
