              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">DARREN FLETCHER says he owes George Burley and the Tartan Army a Manchester 
              United display today.</h2>
              <p class="article">The Scotland skipper admits he has fallen short of his own high expectations 
              during the wretched Group Nine campaign.</p>
              <p class="article">Fletcher said: "I owe George a performance, I don't think I've had my best 
              games for Scotland under the manager.</p>
              <p class="article">"I don't know why that has been. I feel I've not done myself justice in his 
              teams.</p>
              <p class="article">"I've given 100 per cent and tried as much as I have in any other game but the 
              performances haven't been there.</p>
              <p class="article">"I know that myself and I'm desperate to do well for him.</p>
              <p class="article">"I'm bitterly disappointed when that happens and it does affect me.</p>
              <p class="article">"I put more pressure on myself than anybody knows. Maybe sometimes you can try 
              too hard to do well and it doesn't come off."</p>
              <p class="article">Fletcher has been a key player for United already this season but Scotland 
              fans argue he never delivers on the international stage.</p>
              <p class="article">Fletcher, 25, who wins his 44th cap today, added: "It's hard playing a certain 
              way week in and week out then, for one or two weeks, having to change your 
              style completely.</p>
              <p class="article">"That's something you have to learn to do every week at international level.</p>
              <p class="article">"But I'm desperate to put in a performance for the manager and the country.</p>
              <p class="article">"I accept the responsibility which comes with being a captain. With United I 
              know my role in the team - it's not the person who has to go and win the 
              game.</p>
              <p class="article">"It's not the person who has to make the big pass or score the goals - I'm the 
              player that gets us playing.</p>
              <p class="article">With Scotland, there is more pressure on me to go and play that killer pass or 
              create goals." Fletcher agrees with James McFadden that it is the players 
              and <strong>NOT</strong> the boss who are at fault for the team's World Cup woes.</p>
              <p class="article">Booze-ups, bust-ups and cock-ups have stalked Scotland, shredding the feelgood 
              factor built up following the heroics of the Euro 2008 qualifying campaign.</p>
              <p class="article">Fletcher admitted: "A lot of players have let the boss down.</p>
              <p class="article">"That's in terms of our performances and things off the pitch.</p>
              <p class="article">"But he has not let that shine through and has always been there to lead by 
              example.</p>
              <p class="article">"He is constantly encouraging and playing things down and always saying we've 
              still got a great chance.</p>
              <p class="article">"All the lads have found a great respect for him in this campaign and are 
              desperate to go out there and do it for him."</p>
