              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">MANCHESTER UNITED are ready to launch a sensational bid for Sol Campbell.</h2>
              <p class="article">Old Trafford boss Alex Ferguson sees the former England centre-half as the answer to United's defensive problems now he is finally allowed to play again.</p>
              <p class="article">Campbell, 35, has been training by himself since leaving Notts County in September, just weeks after signing a five-year deal worth £10million with the League Two side.</p>
              <p class="article">The one-time Spurs and Arsenal star has now reached agreement with County over his registration which leaves him free to join another club.</p>
              <p class="article">United desperately need Campbell's experience to overcome a back four crisis that has Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic, Wes Brown, Gary Neville, Jonny Evans and John O'Shea all crocked.</p>
              <p class="article">Midfielders Michael Carrick and Darren Fletcher started at centre-half against Wolfsburg last night.</p>
              <p class="article">United are investigating how quickly they can sign Campbell and the signs are he will be fit for his debut for the champions early in the New Year.</p>
              <p class="article">Campbell could face the Gunners on January 31 and another ex-club, Portsmouth, on February 6.</p>

              <p>Woah.... haven't heard from him in ages.....</p>
              <p>I suppose if he can still play a decent game, then, why not. Certainly his contract would be tempered with performance-related clauses as was the case with Owen.</p>
              <p>It may well turn out to be a better idea than to have to continually force Fletcher and Carrick to play out of position.</p>

SunSport revealed yesterday that Manchester United boss Alex Ferguson was considering a swoop for the free agent. And the 35-year-old former England defender would jump at the chance of joining the champions.</h2>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Campbell said: "I have heard nothing officially but there have been suggestions and it would be a great move for me. "I would love to play for Manchester United, but I am not counting any chickens. I shall just have to wait and see if a call comes through the right channels.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">"I am training as usual at Arsenal, and would go to train at Manchester United if I was asked." Campbell can resume his playing career after ending his contract dispute with Notts County.</p>

              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson has ruled out a January move for former England defender Sol Campbell - and insisted he has money to spend if he wanted to.</p>
              <p>Speculation rose earlier this week that Ferguson would look to bring Campbell in when the transfer window opens next month as he battles with an ongoing defensive injury crisis.</p>
              <p>Even the mere suggestion of signing the 35-year-old triggered more negative rumours about the money Ferguson has been given to spend at a club whose debt is currently £790million.</p>
              <p>But Ferguson insists there is no link.</p>
              <p>"I don't know where this came from but it is all wrong," he said. "Sol Campbell was a great player but he is not a player we are thinking about getting to come to United."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A move for Campbell always seemed unlikely given the player's age, and the fact he has played only one League Two game since he left Portsmouth at the end of last season.</p>
              <p>And, as Ferguson confirmed, many of the current problems - while leaving him short of options once more for tomorrow's Old Trafford encounter with Aston Villa - are unlikely to be long-term.</p>
              <p>"Jonny Evans could be back in 10 days and John O'Shea will be with us in January," he said.</p>
              <p>"We are having a hard time with centre-backs at this moment in time but I am sure by January most of them will be back."</p>
              <p>The issue of United's debt and the world record £80million received from Real Madrid following the summer sale of Cristiano Ronaldo has been a subject of debate for some time.</p>
              <p>Ferguson's preference to keep his spending down last summer only fuelled talk of a squeeze being applied by the Glazer family.</p>
              <p>It is an issue the United manager is happy to address.</p>
              <p>"It has been said I do not have the money," said Ferguson.</p>
              <p>"But the money is there if I wanted to use it.</p>
              <p>"I didn't see any value in the summer and I don't see any value at the moment either.</p>
              <p>"I am happy with the players I already have at the club."</p>
