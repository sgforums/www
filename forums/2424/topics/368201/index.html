              <p>Carlos Tevez completed his move to Manchester City on a five-year contract on Tuesday, and rubbished claims made by Sir Alex Ferguson that he had shunned calls from his former manager.</p>
              <p>The Manchester United boss claimed he had attempted to contact Tevez on a number of occasions to persuade him to remain at Old Trafford, but was blanked. But Tevez has now claimed that is not true.</p>
              <p>Tevez, who cost the club a fee in the region of Â£25m, said: "I was there for two years and Sir Alex never called or sent any text messages in that time.</p>
              <p>"The only time he talked to me was after a match against Roma to discuss a situation about going to play for Argentina.</p>
              <p>"It doesn't seem that this is the way to treat a player in two years at the club. it doesn't seem there is a line of communication.''</p>
              <p>The 25-year-old did go on to thank United, adding: "David Gill (United chief executive), Alex Ferguson and the club's fan base I thank you for the time I spent there, but this is a new life for me and I am happy to be at Manchester City.''</p>
              <p>Sir Alex also believed that Tevez had agreed to join City as long ago as January, something else the 25-year-old denies: "It is United people talking about signing a contract (in January) but it is not true that it was decided then.''</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Mark Hughes confirmed that City are still looking for further signings and that talks are on-going with Emmanuel Adebayor of Arsenal, and he is a firm admirer of Chelsea skipper John Terry.</p>
              <p>Hughes said of his future summer transfer dealings: "There may well be opportunities that present themselves. There are areas of the team we still want to strengthen.</p>
              <p>"We would like to obviously be in a position at the beginning of the season to have a team in place that we think can challenge this year.</p>
              <p>"If opportunities present themselves we could possibly buy more players.</p>
              <p>"I think there's been discussions between ourselves and Arsenal [for Adebayor] but, as is my usual response about players that we haven't signed, really it's not the right time or place to discuss that - only in as much as yes there has been contact.</p>
              <p>"There's a deal to be done possibly but it's not been concluded as we speak. Until it actually happens, really it's not the time or the place to discuss it here.''</p>
              <p>When asked about Terry, he replied: "I have fantastic respect for John Terry, ever since I saw him as a young player when I was at Chelsea as a player myself.</p>
              <p>"He's a great player and an outstanding captain. But he's very much a Chelsea player at this moment in time.</p>
              <p>"I have huge respect for him. I think any manager would covet a player of the type of John Terry, but at this moment in time he's a player for Chelsea so we have to respect that.''</p>
              <p>When asked whether Tevez represents good value for money, Hughes said: "Absolutely, for Manchester City, it's absolutely good value.</p>
              <p>"From our point of view, where we are in our development, to be able to bring one of the top strikers in world football to our club is a fantastic thing for us as a club, for our fans and everybody connected with Manchester City.</p>
              <p>"We're absolutely delighted that Carlos is here.''</p>
