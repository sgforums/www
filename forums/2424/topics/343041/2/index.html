              <div class="newsStory">
              <p><strong>The margin of defeat was one of the
              scarce positives for Sir Alex Ferguson following United's Carling Cup
              reverse at Derby County.<br></strong><br>The Reds boss believes his
              side could have been staring at a mountain rather than a molehill of a
              task for the second leg, after the Rams fluffed a few chances at Pride
              Park.<br><br>"The positive is we've only lost 1-0," reflected Sir Alex.
              "I think we're lucky to only lose 1-0. You need a bit of luck in the
              cup and we've had a bit of luck tonight.<br><br>"It's a fantastic result for us considering the performance. We just didn't play well.<br><br>"I
              think we were overworried about their crossing and setpiece play. I
              think we looked a bit panicky at the back. We normally can deal with
              that very well but we didn't do that tonight.<br><br>"We could have lost four goals so 1-0 is a great result for us and it gives us a fantastic chance now at Old Trafford.<br><br>"In
              any semi-final you hope to give yourself a bit of breathing space by
              winning the first leg but if we take any team back to Old Trafford with
              a one-nil deficit, we expect to overcome them. I'm sure we will
              (overcome Derby)."<br><br>Sir Alex will again back his young players to
              finish the job, after seeing them conquer Middlesbrough, QPR and
              Blackburn at home in previous rounds.<br><br>"I think we'll persevere with our younger players," Sir Alex confirmed.<br><br>"They
              deserve to play. Gibson was one of our better players tonight and I
              have sympathy for Welbeck - he never really had any service so it's
              unfair to judge him."</p>

              <p>The whole team played poorly, I don't even know who to pick out if there was one player who performed last night... Tevez and Welbeck were useless... Nani was selfish as usual, Gibson, I didn't even noticed he played... This match show us how useful Berbatov is to United cos there was not even an ounce of creativity from the rest when Rooney and Ronaldo is not playing...</p>
              <p>Rafael, Evans, Gibson and Welbeck show us again that youngsters are inconsistent... Evans had his 2nd poor match in a row now... Hopefully Rio will be back for Chelsea... And I not dare to think what will happen when they meet Inter  with Evans.</p>
              <p>Anyway, they have lots of games in Jan so if they had to lose one I think this is the best one to let go cos I don't think it will be costly as the 2nd leg will be at OT. So I don't think Derby will be able to get anything there, not even a draw. Also I think this match had something to do with a new manager sitting in the stands... The player want to impress the new manager so played like crazy too...</p>

              <p>is gibson a winger or CM? I saw him being deployed on the right ala beckham.</p>
              <p>Yes, I think Evans is still wet behind the ears, and slowly, opponents are exploring and learning how to go pass him. He reminds me of Pique.</p>
              <p>Sadly, Nani is not progressing. Not sure whether he has something to prove or etc. But if the Serb winger can perform as per Vidic, then Nani is history.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>To be fair to Nani, he is not a left winger in the first place... He is more of a right winger than a left so not expecting too much from him in that corner. Overall, I feel he has the technique and the skills to be a good player but he is just too selfish with his style of play... If he learns to be more generous with his passing and style, then I belief he will fast become a better player...</p></div>

              <p><br>I don't think the future is going to be any different... Players, like most people are either left footed of right... Its not going to change... Most of us just do things better with our right or our left... Its very difficult to find someone who can do both... Even if there is, one side will still do better than the other so if they are a natural right footer, the chance of them cutting in to cross with their right foot is greater than a natural left footed player... And I suspect why Fergie bought Tosic, a natural left footed player could be because even tho Ronaldo or Park could adapted better, they are still not a natural.</p>
