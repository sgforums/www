              Michael Carrick is warning that the Redsâ€™ excellent Old Trafford showing in the Champions League semi-final first leg will count for little if United produce an equally impressive display at the Emirates Stadium next Tuesday.
              
              John Oâ€™Shea gave the Reds a slender 1-0 lead at the halfway stage of the last four tie. It could, and almost certainly should, have been more.
              
              â€œWe played well, especially in the first half when we created a number if chances,â€� Carrick told MUTV. â€œIt would have been nice for one or two more to have gone in, but weâ€™ve won the game and weâ€™ve kept a clean sheet so we can be pretty happy with that. It gives us something going into the second leg.
              
              â€œItâ€™s easy to say that [all we have to is play like that again in the second leg], but every game throws up different situations. Iâ€™m sure Arsenal will come out and be a real threat in the second leg. Weâ€™re confident that we can create enough chances to score again and hopefully that will make it even more difficult for them.â€�
              
              Arsenal were strangely subdued and Gunners boss Arsene Wenger admitted that his side would have to be much more of a threat in North London, something Carrick says United will have to be aware of.
              
              â€œTheyâ€™ve got world class players and some real threats. Fortunately tonight we nullified them as best as we could and weâ€™re very satisified to have kept a clean sheet.
              
              â€œThey had one or two opportunities when they could have threatened a bit more but overall we were quite happy with the way we defended as a team. That probably allowed us to attack a bit better as well. In the second half we could have played a touch better but we did enough in the first half to win the game.â€�
