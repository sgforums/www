              <h1>Portsmouth 0-1 Man Utd</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/44958000/jpg/_44958084_fletcher_226.jpg" alt="" width="226" height="170"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="first"><strong>Darren Fletcher's deflected first-half strike was enough to give Manchester United victory over Portsmouth.</strong> <strong>Pompey went close after only 12 seconds when Papa Bouba Diop's shot whistled past the post, before Wayne Rooney shot straight at David James from 12 yards.</strong></p>
              <p>United began to look dangerous down the flanks and from Patrice Evra's cross, Fletcher bundled in via Sol Campbell. Pompey's best efforts came after the break but Jerome Thomas and Papa Bouba Diop saw their shots saved comfortably. </p>
              <p>Portsmouth might have lacked any real cut and thrust but boss Harry Redknapp will take some consolation that their performance was better than the one that saw them thumped 4-0 by Chelsea in their opening game of the season last week.</p>
              <p>Redknapp brought in on-loan left-back Armand Traore in a move designed to shore up the defence. But with United restoring striker Carlos Tevez and Anderson to their line-up, Pompey were always likely to be stretched.</p>
              <p>Yet it was the hosts who almost struck first when Bouba Diop rode a challenge before cracking a shot from 15 yards which zipped off the wet turf and was inches wide of the post.</p>
              <p>Soon, though, United began to dictate the play, pulling Portsmouth - and particularly Bouba Diop - out of position. Wayne Rooney made space in the box but hit his shot straight at David James, and shortly after the England keeper kept out a swerving Paul Scholes free-kick. Jermain Defoe and Peter Crouch were playing their first game together at Fratton Park and they almost combined to get Crouch in, but Evra nicked the ball of the former Liverpool man's toes when he about to shoot.</p>
              <p>Back came United and when they worked the ball inside Diop, for the second time in a few minutes, Evra crossed from the left and Fletcher's effort went scrambled in off Campbell as Sylvain Distin failed to hook it off the line.</p>
              <p>United might have led 2-0 at the break, but Rooney fired a shot just wide after he had superbly made space with an excellent first touch and turn on the edge of the box.</p>
              <p>An hour of the game had been played before Portsmouth forced Edwin van der Sar into his first save, beating away substitute Thomas's vicious drive. The slicker passing, more incisive movement and more dangerous play continued to come from United after the break, as it had in the opening 45 minutes.</p>
              <p>However, the visitors seemed content to sit on their lead as the half wore on and as Pompey crept forward, Van der Sar had to be alert to keep out Bouba Diop's swirling shot. But with the game compressed into he middle third, and Pompey short of ideas, chances were few and far between.</p>
              <p>Despite playing within themselves United always seemed more likely to add to the scoring but Carlos Tevez shot wide from distance and then lofted a free-kick into the arm of James. The result leaves Portsmouth rooted to the foot of the table, while United move up to third.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <hr>
              <p><strong>Portsmouth boss Harry Redknapp:</strong><br>"I thought I was a very even game up until they scored. The way the first half went, I was well pleased. "We have three or four players who haven't played for a while and missed a pre-season and I had to throw them in and take a chance on them. "The work rate was much better today and you couldn't fault the effort. I thought we played okay."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson:</strong><br>"We played some excellent football tonight. This is a difficult place to come, so it is a bonus to come here and win. "We tried to play a system where the players would be comfortable. We wanted to have Anderson playing centrally, close to Carlos Tevez. "We let Paul Scholes control the game, and used Darren Fetcher's energy."</p>

              <p><span><span class="italic"><em></em></span></span></p>
              <p><strong>England duo Gary Neville and Owen Hargreaves will both be in Manchester United's Super Cup line-up in Monaco on Friday.</strong></p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson has pledged to take the encounter with UEFA Cup winners Zenit St Petersburg seriously after losing out to Lazio the last time United played in the game following their Champions League triumph over Bayern Munich in 1999.</p>
              <p>However, Ferguson also recognises the clash offers a perfect opportunity to give some match practice to some key figures within his squad. Neither Neville nor Hargreaves have played a competitive game for the Red Devils yet this season.</p>
              <p>Hargreaves has been trying to overcome a tendinitis problem, while Neville has missed out due to the form of Wes Brown. Nani is also available having completed a three-match ban for his dismissal against West Ham last season.</p>
              <p>Ryan Giggs should be fit as well after missing last night's win at Portsmouth with a hamstring problem. While the Super Cup would not normally be given such a high priority in the Old Trafford outfit's fixture calendar, reminders of nine years ago still grate at Ferguson, who is determined to beat Dick Advocaat's men this time around.</p>
              <p>"I want to win," said the United boss. "I remember the last time we went there I only played half a team because we had a Monday league game against Newcastle. "When I saw Lazio celebrating at the end, it was like they had won the World Cup. "I was not too pleased. I thought, 'That will not happen again'."</p>

              <h1>Manchester United stand proud again after riveting draw with Chelsea</h1>
              <h2>Chelsea (0) 1 Manchester United (1) 1</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/00995/michael_ballack_995869c.jpg" alt="Manchester United stand proud again after riveting draw with Chelsea - Honours even: Michael Ballack (c) vies with United's Jonny Evans (l) and Patrice Evra" width="460" height="288"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>As well as a bottle through the window of their bus, Manchester United took pride and a point back home from Stamford Bridge. Although frustrated that Salomon Kalou eventually equalised Ji-sung Park’s goal, the champions can take heart that they reminded everyone in the country of their class and their character. The title will not be surrendered without a fight, not with Sir Alex Ferguson motivating United’s players so stirringly.</strong></p>
              <p>As well as another magnificent advertisement for the people’s soap opera that is the Premier League, a riveting 90 minutes revealed certain truths for United. Dimitar Berbatov, the lord of languidness, and the all-action Wayne Rooney still need time to develop their partnership, although the rich potential was thrillingly in evidence here. Cristiano Ronaldo also requires games to bring his form and fitness back to last season’s Himalayan heights.</p>
              <p>Apart from the point and the gutsy display, Ferguson can take other positives from the Bridge, notably an assured performance by Jonny Evans alongside Rio Ferdinand, a buccaneering contribution from Patrice Evra and sweat-soaked shifts from Owen Hargreaves and Darren Fletcher.</p>
              <p>For Chelsea, a confident start to the season cannot mask the reality that Didier Drogba must return to the starting fold. Nicolas Anelka again failed to impose himself, and missed a chance presented by Joe Cole that could not have been more gift-wrapped had it come with ribbons and a card that began “Cher Nicolas’’.</p>
              <p>In keeping with the celebratory mood, assorted balloons were blown on to the field, prompting Ferguson’s No 2, Mike Phelan, to stamp on one. “I wish he had burst it under Mike Riley because it might have woken him up,’’ quipped Ferguson. The Yorkshire referee actually handled the game well, allowing advantage when possible, mainly stopping only to book four United players for fouls and three more for dissent. If Riley erred, it was in ignoring an outrageous piece of simulation by Ronaldo, a swallow dive so preposterous that Frank Lampard burst out laughing.</p>
              <p>Occasional subterfuge and tirades aside, United impressed. Their hunger was palpable. Ferguson had ensured his players were in the right, determined mood. So had the stadium announcer, welcoming the champions to the Bridge with a cheeky, “Here’s the 14th team in the Premier League’’. United’s impatience for the opening whistle quickened.</p>
              <p>In hounding Luiz Felipe Scolari’s players all over the pitch, United did to Chelsea what Liverpool had done to the champions eight days earlier. Scarcely two minutes had crept on to the clock when both Paul Scholes and Park had clattered Joe Cole. A familiar intensity characterised the fray. Even Berbatov, so relaxed he looks like he should be playing in a smoking jacket, deigned to win a tackle. Until he tired badly in the second half, Berbatov was influential, knitting together moves, helping Rooney create a shooting opportunity for Ferdinand that would have brought reward but for Petr Cech’s reflexes.</p>
              <p>Berbatov and Rooney played significant parts in United’s goal. When the lively Evra broke down the left and played the ball inside to Berbatov, Rooney was alive to the move’s possibilities. Berbatov’s lay-off drew a superb response from Rooney, who guided the ball first time down the inside-left channel, picking out Evra’s continued run. He raced on, but then cut the ball back to Berbatov. As Scholes dummied, the Bulgarian unleashed a shot that rattled into Cech’s midriff, gifting a sitter for the unmarked Park. As Ferguson celebrated, little details leading to the goal will have incensed Scolari. His full-backs, such a force going forward, were caught out badly. Jose Bosingwa failed to deal with Evra’s run. The Portuguese international has proved a marvellous addition, giving Chelsea real strength down the right, but he needs to tighten up defensively.</p>
              <p>Over on the left, Ashley Cole had shuffled across to deal with unfolding problems in the middle, allowing Park the space to score. Liberated by Scolari, encouraged to raid upfield, Cole’s primary duty must always be to track his winger and he let Park go. Otherwise, the England international enjoyed an afternoon of non-stop endeavour that confirmed him as one of the leading left-backs in the world.</p>
              <p>With Cole and Bosingwa quick to push up, Chelsea hit back, responding to the urging of their fans. Chances came and went. Joe Cole’s shot deflected over. The Matthew Harding Stand then screamed for a penalty when Edwin van der Sar caught Florent Malouda. United’s keeper was clearly going for the ball, his momentum carrying him into Malouda, injuring his knee in the process. The Bridge was in ferment, the fans in uproar, the players storming forward time and again in pursuit of an equaliser. John Terry, leading by example, charged 40 yards, taking the game to the champions. Then Joe Cole glided into the box, bringing an unconvincing stop from Van der Sar. Ferdinand moaned at his keeper, tapping his head as if to question the Dutchman’s mental state. Ferdinand’s stance quickly softened on realising the keeper was struggling. Tomasz Kuszczak leapt from the bench and into the fray.</p>
              <p>The tempo never dropped. When Scholes clipped Michael Ballack’s heels, the German squealed like a ballerina who had been trodden on, making sure Riley was aware of the offence. Scholes escaped sanction that time but soon kicked the ball away, making his inevitable entrance in Riley’s bad book. More worryingly for United, they were dropping deep, dangerously so, inviting Chelsea on. They also stood off Alex, allowing the Brazilian to let fly from 25 yards. Kuszczak fumbled, Ferdinand cleared. Not for the last time. Ferdinand’s fuse was burning, the defender raging at a linesman. “There’s only one England captain,’’ sang the John Terry fan club.</p>
              <p>Enmity filled the air. When Hargreaves fell over by the hoardings, a couple of Chelsea supporters bent over to deliver some west London witticisms. Bonhomie broke out only during the interval when Team GB’s successful Olympic sailors performed a lap of honour that drew a standing ovation.</p>
              <p>Chelsea urgently needed someone to take the wind out of United’s sails. Scolari acted. Malouda was hooked and Drogba unleashed, entering like a favoured gladiator, intent on inflicting damage. Wary of Drogba’s threat, United pulled even further back, almost permanently to the edge of the box. When Lampard and Joe Cole conjured up some magic, Evans intervened.</p>
              <p>For defenders like Evans, binoculars were required to see United’s attack. The gap was huge, but fortunately Rooney shuttled back and forth, carrying the ball to Berbatov, making a mockery of those who questioned the Merseysider’s fitness. The only thing heavy about Rooney is his heavyweight talent.</p>
              <p>But he needed assistance. Ronaldo arrived and, the dive apart, produced some decent moments, although the force remained with Chelsea. When Kuszczak failed to hold a Joe Cole shot, Ferdinand again cleared and again complained about the marking, the officiating, the weather, the price of ciabatta bread. Still a tide of blue rolled towards Ferdinand and company. When Joe Cole drove the ball across, Anelka missed woefully. Rooney almost punished such profligacy, turning the Ronaldo’s exceptional cross into the side-netting.</p>
              <p>Surrendering possession needlessly moments later, Rooney received a curt reminder from Ferguson of the need to keep control of the ball. It was a pity he did not throw in a caveat about self-control. Rooney subsequently flew in on Ashley Cole, who commendably jumped up immediately, but the damage was done. To United.</p>
              <p>As well as the booking for Rooney, the champions had a free-kick awarded against them, 30 yards out, to the left of centre. As John Obi Mikel lifted the ball in, United focused most on Terry’s movement with Ferdinand shoving the Chelsea captain over. Unnoticed amidst the pushing and pulling, Kalou ghosted in to equalise. Chelsea had their point. United had also made their point.</p>
              <p><strong>FlashPoint1... </strong><br>The bad feeling that marred last season’s match between Chelsea and Manchester United boiled over again as Rio Ferdinand stormed from the field after clashing with Didier Drogba.The pair had been involved in a challenge on the edge of the United penalty area just as referee Mike Riley blew the final whistle of a bad-tempered affair.</p>
              <p><br><strong>FlashPoint2... </strong><br>The United team bus was attacked as it departed from Stamford Bridge following the match. A bottle was thrown and left a crack on one of the windows. Police arrested one man. It is understood that no United players or officials were hurt. “There was an incident but the matter is now in the hands of the police,” a United spokesman said.</p>

              </strong><p></p>
              <p class="first"><strong></strong></p>
              <p class="first"><strong>A controversial penalty scored by Cristiano Ronaldo set Manchester United on their way to victory over Bolton.</strong></p>
              <p>Ronaldo put United ahead after referee Rob Styles awarded United a penalty even though Jlloyd Samuel's tackle on the Portuguese winger was a fair one.</p>
              <p>The incident proved decisive because up until then United had been thwarted by Bolton keeper Jussi Jaaskelainen.</p>
              <p>Wayne Rooney curled in United's second after a Ronaldo back-flick as Bolton were left seething over the penalty. </p>
              <p>The incident could spark renewed debate about video technology but in all honesty the official should never have given a penalty.</p>
              <p>United eventually ran out comfortable winners and deserved the three points but had the penalty not been awarded the result could have been different.</p>
              <p>Although another refereeing decision will grab the headlines following this game, United were superior in every department.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson rotated his side ahead of the Champions League trip to Aalborg in midweek but it was Bolton - with Johan Elmander operating as a lone striker - who took the game to United.</p>
              <p>Ricardo Gardner saw an early shot blocked before Kevin Nolan tried his luck from long distance.</p>
              <p>Jaaskelainen was Bolton's busiest player and his first save was a comfortable one when Darren Fletcher picked out Dimitar Berbatov but the £30m striker headed tamely at the Finnish keeper.</p>
              <p>United - playing their first 3pm kick-off at Old Trafford since New Year's Day - began to find some rhythm and Ji-Sung Park scooped a close-range shot over the top.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo then went close with a trademark 25-yard free-kick which Jaaskelainen did well to push wide.</p>
              <p>Bolton were pushed further and further back as United took control and the visitors packed all 11 players into their own penalty area for a corner which Nemanja Vidic headed over.</p>
              <p>Anderson saw his well-placed curling shot from wide on the right tipped away for a corner after Fletcher's perfect pass.</p>
              <p>United finally got the breakthrough that they deserved - but it came from an inexplicable decision from referee Styles.</p>
              <p>He awarded United a penalty when Ronaldo was fairly tackled by Samuel even though none of the home players or supporters appealed for a spot kick.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo stepped up to slam home a routine penalty but it was hardly surprising that Bolton's dismayed fans were soon singing "1-0 to the referee".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>United boss Sir Alex Ferguson</strong></p>
              <p>Agreed that it was a poor decision but argued that his side have been denied clear penalties by referee Styles in the past. "I was surprised because it looked as though their lad got a foot on the ball," said Ferguson. "But Rob Styles turned us down four or five times last year so maybe it is payback time. But he still owes us another four." </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Man Utd: </strong>Van der Sar, Neville, Ferdinand, Vidic, Evra, Ronaldo (Nani 80), Fletcher, Anderson (Scholes 71), Park, Tevez (Rooney 71), Berbatov.<br>Subs Not Used: Amos, Giggs, O'Shea, Evans.</p>

              <p><strong>Manchester United will have even less time than they thought to prepare for their Boxing Day fixture at Stoke after flying back from the Club World Cup. United will be in action on December 21 in Yokohama whether their win or lose their semi-final match three days previously. </strong></p>
              <p>Already, the Red Devils' home game with Wigan, scheduled for December 20, has had to be postponed due to their participation in the seven-team tournament. But Ferguson knew his side were due to face Stoke at the Britannia Stadium on Boxing Day, only four days after their return from the Far East.</p>
              <p>The United manager has previously hinted at leaving players at home to ensure they are fully prepared for the Stoke game, realising how drained the men who make the journey to Japan will be.</p>
              <p>That scenario is even more likely now it has been confirmed United must kick-off at 12.45pm on Boxing Day after their game was brought forward a couple of hours by Sky TV.</p>
              <p>At least United are not in action again until December 29, after Setanta chose to screen the Old Trafford encounter with Middlesbrough, scheduled for the previous day.</p>
              <p>Not that Chelsea will feel much sympathy, given they must visit Everton on December 22, two days later than they originally anticipated, and only four days before they host West Brom at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>Other highlights chosen for live TV coverage are Chelsea's traditionally feisty London derby with West Ham on December 14, Arsenal's home game with Liverpool on December 21 and the return of Manchester City boss Mark Hughes to Blackburn on December 28.</p>

              <p class="first"><strong>Wes Brown and Wayne Rooney got the goals as Manchester United recorded a fourth consecutive win by seeing off Blackburn at a rain-soaked Ewood Park.</strong> <strong>Brown headed in from a Rooney cross, although Blackburn claimed keeper Jason Brown had been impeded by United's Nemanja Vidic in the build-up.</strong></p>
              <p>Rooney swept home a second after a blistering burst of pace from Cristiano Ronaldo down the right wing. Blackburn rarely threatened and Carlos Tevez was denied a third by the post. It was a thoroughly convincing display by the Premier League champions, who appear to have fully recovered from an indifferent start to the season.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson had apologised to his opposite number Paul Ince in the build-up to this game for comments made years ago about the former Manchester United midfielder. But United were in no mood for further niceties on a ground where they have only won once in the league in over 10 years.</p>
              <p>They were boosted by Rooney declaring himself fit and willing to play and it was he and strike partner Dimitar Berbatov who were behind much of United's best work. Former Tottenham forward Berbatov oozed class as he repeatedly opened up the Blackburn defence with some incisive passing.</p>
              <p>Darren Fletcher was the first to benefit as he ran on to a angled ball only to slot wide of the target. The recalled Ryan Giggs was the next to profit from a Berbatov ball but he saw his left-foot spectacularly saved by Brown. A minute later and keeper Brown was somewhat harshly picking the ball out of the net.</p>
              <p>The Blackburn stopper, standing in for the injured Paul Robinson, collided with Vidic as he went to try and collect a Rooney cross and the ball was headed in by Brown at the back post.</p>
              <p>While the United defender celebrated only his third goal for the club, his namesake in the Blackburn nets vented his fury at referee Steve Bennett for allowing the goal. Rooney could have added a second after another defence-splitting pass from Berbatov, but Brown came out quickly to narrow the angle and save with his left hand.</p>
              <p>Other than a Matt Derbyshire shot that was saved by Edwin van der Sar and a Brett Emerton effort that flashed wide, there was little for Ince to be positive about in the opening half. And his half-time team talk failed to alter the flow of the game as United dominated, with Berbatov setting up Ronaldo only for him to drag his shot wide shortly after the break.</p>
              <p>For an hour the Portuguese winger had looked a shadow of his former self as he continues to battle back from injury. But then he received the ball on the right and exploded past Martin Olsson before squaring for Rooney to curl a shot past Brown.</p>
              <p>Rooney could have had a second when he ran through before lobbing Brown, only to see it land on the roof of the net, before the Rovers keeper did brilliantly to deny Berbatov a deserved goal with his feet.</p>
              <p>Blackburn had a chance to pull one back but Emerton's volley was blocked by Vidic. Ronaldo slid a shot past the post and then set up Tevez to fire against the upright as United kept going until the end.</p>
              <p>Ince's side simply had no answer as he was handed a lesson from his former boss, but on this form few teams in the Premier League could have lived with United.</p>

              <p><strong>Blackburn boss Paul Ince on the controversial opening goal: </strong><br>"I wouldn't say it cost us the game but it was 0-0. "If the referee can't see it then he shouldn't be a referee. If not then the linesman should see it - it was a diabolical decision. "They (United) were absolutely awesome, they are a fantastic side and champions of Europe but decisions change games."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson:</strong><br>"We said before the game this is one of most difficult grounds to come to, but it was a really emphatic performance. "The confidence was outstanding and everyone was on song. Everyone's use of the ball was spot on and we controlled the match. We missed a lot of chances and it could have been a big score for us."</p>

              <h1>Man Utd 4-0 West Brom</h1>
              <p>Saturday, 18 October 2008</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">WAYNE ROONEY was at it again as Manchester United eased past the Baggies. The England hotshot made it eight goals in six games as United joined Chelsea, Liverpool and Arsenal in the top four.</h2>
              <p class="article">Rooney opened the scoring with a superb effort as he cut inside from the inside left and tucked the ball home at the near post. Cristiano Ronaldo netted his third goal of the season on 69 minutes as he latched on to Rooney's throughball before slotting home. Dimitar Berbatov got in on the act with an instant flick from close range before Nani tapped home in the final minute.</p>
              <p class="article">Rooney was asked whether he is currently playing the best football of his career. "Yes, possibly," he replied. "I'm really enjoying it at the moment. I feel fit and the team is helping me. "Hopefully I can help the team win some more trophies. "Anyone at the club will tell you that I work hard. I want to learn and I listen to various people at the club to get better."</p>
              <p class="article">The result lifted United into the top four for the first time this season. And Rooney now wants to make sure they stay there. He said: "It's really important to be up there. We just have to make sure we win our games.</p>
              <p class="article">"As long as we stay near the top until Christmas then we are doing okay." West Brom huffed and puffed to stay with the champions in the first half.</p>
              <p class="article">Rooney saw a goal disallowed after he was adjudged to have pulled Gianni Zuiverloon. The England star then saw his near-post header kept out by Scott Carson.</p>
              <p class="article">Rooney and Berbatov made Carson work again after the break. And the pair linked up again to carve out the opening goal. Berbatov sent Rooney scampering down the left flank and he came back on to his right foot before beating Carson with a low shot.</p>
              <p class="article">The shackles were now off and Rooney fed Ronaldo for No2. Berbatov grabbed his first Premier League goal for United on 71 minutes. Rooney and Ryan Giggs went close before the former found Nani at the far post to tuck home.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><br><strong>GORDON STRACHAN backed magical Manchester United to win the Champions League again.</strong></p>
              <p class="article">Strachan hailed United the best side he had ever faced after Celtic were blitzed. And the Bhoys boss called Wayne Rooney ‘unplayable’ as the Reds ran riot — with Dimitar Berbatov striking twice before Roo finished the job.</p>
              <p class="article">Strachan said: “We’ve played a lot of good teams in the Champions League like AC Milan and Barcelona. “But nobody as good as Manchester United were tonight. It will take some team to stop them from winning this again.</p>
              <p class="article">“They could defend this for the next couple of years. “Wayne Rooney is simply unplayable. We tried to do everything to stop him. “But when you are facing someone like that you just have to hold your hands up and say tonight we have come up against a world class player.”</p>
              <p class="article">Strachan refused to make a big deal out of Berbatov’s two goals looking offside, — as the home side put one foot in the last 16. He said: “I’m not going to scream about that because I know we were well beaten. “That was one of the best performances I’ve come across watching European football.”</p>
              <p class="article">Berbatov admitted he is putting more effort in at United than at Tottenham. He said: “In the past I did have some moments when I was not 100 per cent but here you cannot hide.”</p>
              <p class="article">Boss Alex Ferguson said: “Celtic got us on a really good night.”</p>

              <p><strong>Everton 1 - 1 Man Utd</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="first"><strong>Marouane Fellaini's header capped a fine recovery by Everton and earned a point against Manchester United.</strong> <strong>United dominated the first half and deservedly took the lead when Darren Fletcher ran onto Ryan Giggs' pass to slot home after 22 minutes. </strong></p>
              <p>Everton keeper Tim Howard kept his side in the game until Fellaini rose to head in Phil Neville's cross. Yakubu then had a shot turned on to the post by United keeper Edwin van der Sar to deny Everton an unlikely win. </p>
              <p>United boss Sir Alex Ferguson will see this as two points dropped after they dictated the first half - but his side became unsettled by Everton's highly-combative approach in the second period.</p>
              <p>In contrast, Everton counterpart David Moyes will be delighted at how they recovered from an early pounding to earn a draw, thanks to their £15m record signing.</p>
              <p>United dominated the opening exchanges, although it took a superb block from Wes Brown to halt Louis Saha as he found himself in space on the edge of the area. And a prolonged period of possession ended with United almost inevitably taking the lead after 22 minutes.</p>
              <p>Giggs was the creator with a clever pass into the box, giving Fletcher the chance to take a vital touch away from Joleon Lescott and beat Howard with a composed finish. Everton were in serious danger of being totally over-run, and keeper Howard was their saviour shortly after with three vital saves in the space of a minute.</p>
              <p>He dived to his left to save from Cristiano Ronaldo, blocked Nemanja Vidic's header from the resulting corner and then produced an outstanding stop from a 20-yard drive from Giggs as United controlled the game with almost embarrassing ease.</p>
              <p>Wayne Rooney was in search of his 100th career goal against his former club, but he missed an opportunity seven minutes before half-time when he saw a close-range effort scrambled wide by Joseph Yobo.</p>
              <p>Everton had a half-chance a minute later following a mix-up between Vidic and Van der Sar, but Yakubu lifted his effort well off target. Moyes' side needed to do something to at least to gain a foothold in the game, and they understandably adopted a more physical approach at the start of the second half.</p>
              <p>Brown's mistake almost created an opening for Fellaini, and there there was a flashpoint when a challenge from Neville flattened Ronaldo. Ronaldo completed several rolls before Rio Ferdinand raced yards to get needlessly involved, the tussle ending in a yellow card for the Everton captain.</p>
              <p>Everton's renewed vigour had shaken United's composure, and their spirits were lifted further when the giant figure of Fellaini drew them level after 63 minutes. Neville lofted a cross into area and the Belgian, who had troubled United with his aerial prowess, rose to beat Van der Sar with a downward header.</p>
              <p>Matters almost got worse for United a minute later when Ferdinand's poor back pass let in Yakubu, only for Van der Sar to divert his shot on to the post.</p>
              <p>The setback upset Rooney, who was harshly booked for a collision with Mikel Arteta. He then foolishly gestured at his badge in front of the Everton fans to earn another rebuke from the referee - and was then swiftly removed, to be replaced by Nani.</p>
              <p>Giggs almost created an opening for Ronaldo with six minutes left, but Joseph Yobo made a crucial interception. Ronaldo, who had been given an uncomfortable afternoon, then dragged a highly-presentable chance wide from only 12 yards as United finally regained some momentum. It was the final serious action of a pulsating encounter, that ended with Everton more satisfied with the result than United.</p>

              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>If squads rather than teams win league titles then Manchester United provided firm evidence last night that they remain English football's eminent force.</strong></p>
              <p>Having seen his side take only a point the weekend meeting with Everton, United manager Sir Alex Ferguson made five changes for the visit of West Ham and he was rewarded with a comprehensive and stylish victory.</p>
              <p>Even though arch rivals Liverpool have started this campaign brightly, does Rafael Benitez really have a squad deep enough to outrun Ferguson's? Does Arsene Wenger at Arsenal?</p>
              <p>Truthfully, they probably do not and it will still be some surprise if United do not battle head to head with Chelsea again when the season enters its business end next Spring.</p>
              <p>In truth, they probably do not. United, for example, have three good right backs. Liverpool do not really have one.</p>
              <p>So it will still be a surprise if United do not again battle head to head with Chelsea for supremacy when the season enters its business end in the spring.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/45155000/jpg/_45155813_ronaldo_b282.jpg" border="0" alt="Cristiano Ronaldo" width="226" height="282"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>United were terrific at times, albeit against poor opposition. Cristiano Ronaldo scored two first-half goals while Ferguson even found room for Carlos Tevez in his starting line-up. Wayne Rooney, United's best player this season, began the night on the bench.</strong></p>
              <p>Ronaldo, of course, will gather many of this morning's headlines, as much for celebrating his goals as for the actual scoring. Did he smile after scoring? Or did he frown again? After his first, he managed to do both, but who really cares?</p>
              <p>Last night's work was about very much more than one man.</p>
              <p>Gianfranco Zola's team did improve after half-time and even had a chance to scare the champions when substitute Luis Boa Morte shot weakly at Tomasz Kuszczak with 15 minutes left.</p>
              <p>But earlier, during the meat and gristle of the game, they were dreadful. United won comfortably and Ferguson's suggestion that his team disappointed him in the second half said much about his own high standards.</p>
              <p>The United manager said: 'In the first half we were magnificent and I was looking forward to more of the same. We wanted more goals as that could be important. But they took the foot of the pedal and they ended up too lax for me.' <br></p>
              <hr>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Manchester United assistant manager Mike Phelan:</strong><br>"We felt we should have attacked the game more and gone for more goals. We weren't as comfortable as we should have been in the second half.</p>
              <p>"Berbatov showed his credentials and that piece of skill was the highlight of the game.</p>
              <p>"We need to keep the run going and the players realise that goal [difference] could be important at the end of the season."</p>
              <p><strong>West Ham boss Gianfranco Zola:</strong><br>"They are the champions of Europe so it's difficult but at least they gave everything in the second half.</p>
              <p>"My players deserved a goal in the second half but Sears and Collison came on and did very well.</p>
              <p>"I have a great belief in my players, I trust them very much, and I am sure this bad spell will be over soon."</p>

              <h1>Man Utd 5-0 Stoke</h1>
              <h1><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/45209000/jpg/_45209731_-5.jpg" alt="Cristiano Ronaldo" width="226" height="282"></h1>
              <h1><em>Ronaldo's third minute free-kick was his 100th Man Utd goal</em></h1>
              <h1> </h1>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 1in;  "><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Cristiano Ronaldo's 100th Manchester United goal set his side on their way to an emphatic home win over Stoke. The Portuguese winger smashed home a trademark free-kick from 25 yards before turning provider for Michael Carrick to fire in United's second.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 1in;  "> </p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Dimitar Berbatov volleyed home to extend the lead before 17-year-old Danny Welbeck marked his Premier League debut with a stunning strike.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Ronaldo sealed the win with his second, another expertly taken free-kick. The three points were a fitting reward for manager Sir Alex Ferguson, who was celebrating 50 years in football after making his playing debut as a 16-year-old during Queens Park's 2-1 defeat at Stranraer on 15 November 1958.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">United played with a verve the visitors never came to terms with and made light of the absence of injured Rio Ferdinand, Wayne Rooney and Ryan Giggs.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The game was barely two minutes old when a robust challenge from Amdy Faye on Tevez gave Ronaldo the type of chance he craves.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">And the Portuguese winger duly stepped up and struck a blistering free-kick that dipped and swerved in front of Thomas Sorensen, who allowed the ball to slip through his grasp.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Ronaldo could have had a second soon after as United piled on the pressure, but Faye threw himself in the way of his rasping shot. Stoke dug in and a trademark long throw from Rory Delap was headed towards his own goal by John O'Shea, only for Edwin van der Saar to claw the goalbound ball to safety.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">United began to lose some of their early momentum, but Sorensen still had to be alert to deny Ji-Sung Park before Ronaldo tested the Danish keeper from distance.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Despite gaining some decent possession in attacking areas the visitors failed to create many chances and found themselves with a bigger mountain to climb when Carrick doubled United's lead just before the break.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The midfielder collected Ronaldo's pass on the edge of area and despite having four defenders around him, he managed to rifle home a left-footed shot from 16 yards.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">After the break the home side looked to put the result beyond doubt and Berbatov did just that as he controlled a cross from Carlos Tevez and volleyed home.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Ronaldo was now running the show and twice tested the Stoke keeper from distance as United hunted a fourth before Tevez tried his luck and curled a shot narrowly wide.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The fourth goal eventually came courtesy of Welbeck, another substitute brought on by Ferguson, who gave Sorensen no chance with a powerful shot from 25 yards.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Ronaldo then capped a fine individual and team performance with his second free-kick two minutes from time, struck past the left-hand edge of a badly positioned wall.</span></span></p>

              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson on the performance of Cristiano Ronaldo:</strong><br>"That is nine for the season now. I am sure he will be into double figures very soon. "Overall, he has scored 101 times in 253 appearances, which is an unbelievable return for a winger. </span></span><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">"He is back now that's for sure. We have been waiting for him to get a free-kick and the power he hit the first one with was very impressive."</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Stoke City manager Tony Pulis:<br></strong>"We were doing okay until United scored just before half-time. "When they got another just afterwards, it killed us. "We have done quite well against the other big clubs this season but once we had to chase the game, United just picked us off."</span></span></p>
