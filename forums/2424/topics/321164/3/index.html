              <p><strong>Cristiano Ronaldo was sent off as Wayne Rooney's 100th club goal proved enough to give Manchester United a derby win.</strong></p>
              <p>United were dominant early on but Manchester City came closest to scoring when Stephen Ireland grazed a post.</p>
              <p>Rooney followed up Michael Carrick's shot to break the deadlock before Ronaldo was sent off for a second booking after inexplicably handling.</p>
              <p>Richard Dunne almost levelled but saw his shot cleared off the line before Joe Hart kept out a late Rooney lob. &lt;!-- E SF --&gt;</p>
              <p>Hart, who had joined City's attack for an injury-time corner, ran the length of the pitch as United broke and got back to his goal just in time to deny Rooney his second goal of the game.</p>
              <p>The home side had come close to equalising seconds earlier when Patrice Evra did brilliantly to block Dunne's effort but United were still convincing winners.</p>
              <p>Although they were against 10 men for the last 20 minutes following Ronaldo's dismissal, Dunne's shot was the only time City came close to breaking down a well-organised United defence in that period.</p>
              <p>And Sir Alex Ferguson's side had been just as impressive going forward for the majority of the match.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <div><em>Cristiano Ronaldo inexplicably handled the ball from a Wayne Rooney corner</em></div>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The only blemish on an otherwise perfect day for Ferguson was Ronaldo's red card, which came after an inexplicable handball by the Portuguese winger.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo had already been booked for bringing down Shaun Wright-Phillips and, when he almost caught Rooney's corner at the near post less than 10 minutes later, referee Howard Webb had no choice but to dismiss him.</p>
              <p>It was a bizarre incident but did not take the shine off an impressive display by the visitors.</p>
              <p>While City began nervously, United were into their stride from the start and could have been out of sight by the end of a one-sided first half.</p>
              <p>Dimitar Berbatov, operating behind the marauding Rooney, tormented the City defence in the early stages, while Evra and Rafael da Silva were constant threats on either flank.</p>
              <p>But, for all their possession, a goal continued to elude United.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo nodded over from a corner, Hart brilliantly pushed a Berbatov header round the post and Evra blazed over when his own cross was cleared back to him in the box.</p>
              <p>It took City over half an hour to create any sort of opening but, when it came, they should really have taken the lead.</p>
              <p>A whipped Javier Garrido free-kick was only cleared as far as Ireland, who fired the ball goalwards with United keeper Edwin van der Sar out of position.</p>
              <p>Ireland's shot bounced towards Micah Richards, who was stood in front of the net, but instead of turning it home the defender left the ball and it hit the outside of the post.</p>
              <p>That sparked City's best spell of the first-half, with Robinho inches away from collecting Didi Hamann's slide-rule pass in front of goal, but United remained dangerous and it was no surprise when they scored after 42 minutes.</p>
              <p>The home side had plenty of opportunities to clear the ball but instead it fell for Carrick to fire in a low shot that Hart could only parry into the path of Rooney, who converted with glee for his 100th club goal.</p>
              <p>Ferguson's side continued to get plenty of men behind the ball and even Ronaldo's dismissal did not help the home side, who looked to have run out of ideas before Dunne's late chance came and went.</p>
              <p>The scoreline would have reflected the game far better had Rooney scored with his audacious injury-time lob and, in truth, the match perfectly illustrated the gulf in class between the two sides that City's wealthy new owners Abu Dhabi United are hoping to narrow.</p>

              <p><strong>Manchester United turned up the heat on Premier League leaders Liverpool and manager Rafael Benitez as they closed the gap at the top of the table with a convincing win against Chelsea at Old Trafford.</strong></p>
              <p>Nemanja Vidic headed United in front in first half injury-time after Dimitar Berbatov flicked on Ryan Giggs' corner. Wayne Rooney then turned in Patrice Evra's cross after 63 minutes to set United on the path to a deserved three points - leaving them five points behind Liverpool with two games in hand.</p>
              <p>Berbatov rounded off the win by grabbing the third from close range four minutes from time, turning in Cristiano Ronaldo's free-kick as United's fans finally sensed their title charge was hitting top gear.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson will regard the victory as the perfect response to public taunts from Liverpool counterpart Benitez that United may be "a little bit scared" at the sight of their great rivals at the Premier League summit.</p>
              <p>United were not at their free-flowing best in a game that was too stop-start to be of the highest quality, but they showed none of the fear Benitez might have been hoping to detect.</p>
              <p>And if this weekend was the start of psychological warfare between Benitez and Ferguson, there is no doubting that it is United's boss who has taken the first round.</p>
              <p>They were vastly superior to a Chelsea side that lacked a cutting edge, despite coach Luiz Felipe Scolari pairing Nicolas Anelka and Didier Drogba together up front after the break.</p>
              <p>It may also make Benitez question the timing and content of his tirade against United and Ferguson - who appeared inspired rather than deflated by the remarks coming from down the East Lancashire Road.</p>
              <p>For Scolari, it was a sobering afternoon when he received further confirmation that he needs to inject threat, particularly in the shape of more width, into his Chelsea side.</p>
              <p>Former Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho watched from the stands in readiness for Inter Milan's Champions League clash with United. He will have been dismayed at how Chelsea failed to trouble Edwin van der Sar and ended up losing so lifelessly.</p>
              <p>Ferguson sprang a selection surprise by leaving Michael Carrick on the bench and choosing to go with veteran Giggs in midfield, while Drogba was handed Chelsea's lone striking role.</p>

              <p><em>Man Utd winger Cristiano Ronaldo attempts to go on a dangerous run but gets upended by Frank Lampard who receives a yellow card</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img id="picture_5" src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/45365000/jpg/_45365654_ronaldo2_pa300.jpg" alt="Carvalho and Ronaldo tussle" width="300" height="300"></p>
              <p><em>Tempers flare shortly before the half hour when Portuguese compatriots Carvalho and Ronaldo tangle and both get booked.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Referee Howard Webb was in the spotlight after Benitez's blast about Ferguson and officials - and he showed his intent to clamp down quickly with a third minute booking for Frank Lampard after he fouled Ronaldo.</p>
              <p>It set the tone for a scrappy first 45 minutes that only truly burst into life in the closing stages as United finally exerted a measure of supremacy.</p>
              <p>Giggs tested Petr Cech with a powerful free-kick that Chelsea's goalkeeper pushed to safety, before referee Webb produced another flurry of yellow cards.</p>
              <p>He booked Chelsea's Jose Bosingwa for a foul on Rooney, quickly followed by Portugal team-mates Ronaldo and Ricardo Carvalho for a penalty area clash.</p>
              <p>Berbatov has yet to win the hearts and minds of Manchester United supporters, and they were frustrated when he wasted their best chance after 30 minutes, shooting tamely at Cech after he had been played in by Rooney.</p>
              <p>John Terry - taunted mercilessly by United's fans as a result of his miss in the penalty shoot-out in the Champions League final - then rescued Chelsea with a brilliant tackle on Ji-Sung Park as he looked poised to slide home Ronaldo's pass.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img id="picture_6" src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/45365000/jpg/_45365669_flag_afp416.jpg" alt="Man utd's players protest" width="416" height="300"></p>
              <p><em>The hosts appear to take the lead just before the break but a flag-waving assistant sees that Ronaldo's headed effort is ruled out.</em></p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><em>Fortunately for them the corner is re-taken and Nemanja Vidic arrives at the far post to head the Red Devils into a half-time lead.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There was a flurry of action and controversy in the closing seconds of the half that led to United taking the lead. Ronaldo's header was ruled out from Giggs' cross after Rooney had taken a short corner that went virtually unnoticed by anyone inside the stadium.</p>
              <p>United were furious, but their pain was eased when the re-taken corner from Giggs was flicked on by Berbatov for Vidic to head in at the far post. The diving Cech got a hand on his effort but failed to keep it out.</p>
              <p>It threw the pressure back on Chelsea to take the initiative away from United, and Scolari responded by replacing Deco with Anelka at the restart.</p>
              <p>Chelsea enjoyed a period of possession without posing any serious threat, and were then hit with a killer blow when Rooney added United's second after 63 minutes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img id="picture_8" src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/45365000/jpg/_45365716_rooney3_afp416.jpg" alt="Rooney celebrates with Man Utd's fans" width="416" height="300"></p>
              <p><em>Rooney doubles United's advantage when he meets Patrice Evra's cross and volleys home from between Ashley Cole's legs.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ronaldo's flick released Evra on the left flank, and when his cross avoided Terry and Berbatov, Rooney poked the ball through Ashley Cole's legs to beat Cech.</p>
              <p>It was Evra's last act as he limped off, to be replaced by John O'Shea.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img id="picture_9" src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/45365000/jpg/_45365734_berbatov_getty300.jpg" alt="Berbatov celebrates scoring the third" width="300" height="300"></p>
              <p><em>Dimitar Berbatov seals the win in the 87th minute as Man Utd go third, five points behind leaders Liverpool with two games in hand</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Chelsea never mounted any serious response, and it was no surprise when the unmarked Berbatov slid in Ronaldo's free-kick late on to set the seal on a hugely satisfying afternoon for United and Ferguson.</p>
              <p>It was a statement of intent that will leave the confrontational Benitez and Liverpool looking nervously over their shoulders after a win that would have increased United's belief that they can retain their crown.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p class="first"><strong>Manchester United moved back to the top of the Premier League as a sublime Ryan Giggs goal saw them overcome West Ham.</strong> <strong>The Hammers gave United a stern test but their best chance was an ambitious Carlton Cole chip that was well saved. </strong></p>
              <p>The visitors were not at their free-flowing best but Giggs cut in from the left and curled in a shot to provide the moment of magic needed for the win. The hosts pushed for a leveller but United stood firm to complete a 13th-straight clean sheet in the league. </p>
              <p>The result ended West Ham's run of six league games without a defeat and, despite their good play, they just could not find a way through United's defence. The Hammers showed plenty of the style and vision that boss Gianfranco Zola was famed for in his playing days as they tried to end United's run of seven league wins on the trot.</p>
              <p>That was no mean task considering the visitors had not conceded a goal since 8 November, 2008, but the Upton Park side twice went close in the early stages. A corner fell to Lucas Neill and his well-struck shot from the edge of the area was well held by keeper Edwin van der Sar.</p>
              <p>In-form striker Cole, who was called into the England squad on Saturday, was played through by Jack Collison and, after shrugging off Rio Ferdinand, tried an audacious chip which was easily saved.</p>
              <p>Rising star Collison then wriggled his way into the United box but his lay-off to Cole was just behind the striker and allowed the visitors to clear.</p>
              <p>United were also passing the ball around with their customary ease and authority, although without penetration, and found West Ham's defence in just as stubborn mood as their own.</p>
              <p>Former Hammers player Carlos Tevez was being well-marshalled as the both midfields wrestled for superiority.</p>
              <p>United did come close to a breakthrough when an off-target Paul Scholes strike was diverted goalwards by Cristiano Ronaldo, who saw keeper Robert Green tip the ball over.</p>
              <p>But Sir Alex Ferguson's side pose a threat from every department and it was the veteran skipper Giggs who rolled back the years to put his side ahead after collecting a sweeping Scholes pass.</p>
              <p>He cut inside the diving challenge of Cole and into the Hammers box from the left before curling a low right-footed shot through a crowd of players for his first league goal of the season.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo could have had a penalty late on after a trip by Neill but referee Phil Dowd waved away his appeals.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, the visitors comfortably secured a 1-0 victory - their ninth by that scoreline in the league this season - that lifts them two points clear of rivals Liverpool.</p>

              <p><strong>West Ham manager Gianfranco Zola:</strong><br>"It was a close match. Unfortunately for us they have some great players and if you make a mistake they punish you. "My team is a young team. They are growing up and improving. "I am pleased with what they are doing. We need to give this team time."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Manchester United assistant manager Mike Phelan:</strong><br>"The result was important. "We felt we needed to come here with the experience and with those two (Giggs and Scholes) you don't get much more experience. "The match was great value for money. Both teams attacked and we managed to get the win."</p>

              <p class="storycopy">Nani had the best chance though, letting fly with a snap-shot that threatened to creep in at the corner, only for Gomes to get down to make a fine save at the near post.<br><br>Unfortunately for Roman Pavlyuchenko, he could not locate his radar at half-time. He skied a terrible free-kick way over the crossbar and while his effort could not be faulted, it was no surprise when he made way for O'Hara.<br><br>Cristiano Ronaldo finally broke free of his shackles and crashed a brute of a shot against the post with almost the last kick of normal time.<br><br>Tevez glanced an extra-time header just wide, with Darren Bent drawing an excellent feet-first save out of Foster later on. But there was no salvation from the penalty lottery which both teams have profited from over the past 12 months.<br><br>This time, it was United's turn. Foster emerged the hero with a save to deny O'Hara and Bentley's miss, combined with Anderson making it four out of four from the spot for the Red Devils, meant the trophy headed to Manchester.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Manchester United fans formed a huge mural from placards before kick-off, spelling out the word "BELIEVE’’, as if confidence could ever possibly be a problem for an untouchable set of players who are champions of England, Europe and the world.</strong></p>
              <p>Each of Sir Alex Ferguson’s players believes in himself, in his team-mates and in the manager. Stars like Wayne Rooney and Dimitar Berbatov were rested but the belief remained in the red shirts. Such faith guided United through squalls of high pressure whipped up by the outstanding Luka Modric and Aaron Lennon. Such poise helped United negotiate a penalty shoot-out with ease, the safe hands of Ben Foster assisting United in getting their eager hands on the trophy.</p>
              <p>The Carling Cup may appear small beer when set against United’s intoxication with more celebrated chalices, notably the Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup, but there was an undeniable thirst for victory here. United’s DNA ensures they give everything in every game. Ferguson’s men wanted to lift this trophy, and keep the momentum going. One down, three to go. Sunday was all about Carling, Foster and dreams of a four-pack.</p>
              <p>After two hours of interesting but not compelling action, the assurance that flows with the red blood and adrenalin through United veins was particularly evident. Their spot-kick hopes heightened by winning the toss to have the shootout staged in front of their fans, United were brutal in executing their dead-ball duties.</p>
              <p>Ryan Giggs stepped up first, a picture of concentration on St David’s Day, a model professional still shining on the eve of the 18th anniversary of his debut. Giggs’ penalty flew in off a post and any belief drained from Tottenham. Poor Jamie O’Hara, Spurs first taker, resembled a man heading towards a firing squad.</p>
              <p>His left foot made strong enough contact but it was at an inviting height for Foster, who pushed it away. Omitted from Spurs’ triumphant team here last year, O’Hara’s eyes again reddened. But when the tears dry, this versatile, highly promising young footballer should reflect that it was his semi-final performance at Burnley that carried the holders back to Wembley.</p>
              <p>As the United camp celebrated O’Hara’s error, one of their number remained unmoved. Ferguson stood there, unflinching. Like any great leader, Ferguson exudes control at the most tense of times. His players looked at their manager and drew even more belief.</p>
              <p>Carlos Tevez broke away from the band of United brothers on the halfway line and made the long walk to the spot. It was the only time the livewire Argentinian did not run all afternoon. Tevez’s non-stop movement, creating chances, linking play, even tracking back, was astonishing, particularly when lesser frames were succumbing to cramp. Gomes was beaten with an irresistible low penalty.</p>
              <p>Vedran Corluka kept Spurs in contention, making light of the pressure with an emphatic strike down the middle, but Cristiano Ronaldo immediately restored United’s advantage.</p>
              <p>At 3-1 down, the spotlight burned fiercely on Spurs. David Bentley marched into the limelight confidently enough. His kick was poor, sent scurrying into the hoardings. The ever-confident Anderson completed the coup de grace with an unstoppable kick past Gomes, one Brazilian beating another.</p>
              <p>A cynic might argue that the sight of two white-shirted Englishmen, O’Hara and Bentley, missing penalties was good practice for Fabio Capello but the watching England manager will also have been buoyed by the work of Foster. With two exceptional earlier saves, from Lennon and Darren Bent, Foster confirmed his right to be considered the eventual successor to David James with England and Edwin van der Sar for United. No wonder Ferguson spoke so enthusiastically about Foster afterwards.</p>
              <p>As Foster and company partied on the pitch, Ferguson, a figure of real dignity, sought to console Harry Redknapp and his vanquished players. As Spurs returned last night to their Berkshire base empty-handed and broken-hearted, their hotel, the castle-like Oakley Court, must have lived up to its old setting for Hammer House of Horror films.</p>
              <p>Modric, a pocket dynamo of Croatian guile, had not deserved to lose. Ditto Didier Zokora, tireless from box to box. Lennon was similarly involved, giving Patrice Evra an exhausting afternoon. Redknapp had set Spurs up well, 4-4-2 with a tweak, the team anchored by the Zokora while Modric drifted in from the left.</p>
              <p>Ferguson’s version of 4-4-2 saw the industrious Tevez working off Danny Welbeck, the Argentinian delivering such a prodigious shift that he was even tackling back by his corner-flag to dispossess Modric. Yet such is the flexibility in United’s ranks, and the depth of their resources, that Ferguson switched seamlessly to 4-3-3 and eventually 4-2-4.</p>
              <p>Eye-catching duels broke out all over the pitch, not only Lennon’s constant eluding of Evra but Ronaldo’s far more even contest with Benoit Assou-Ekotto. Another duel involved Paul Scholes continuing to confound Father Time, United’s 34-year-old midfielder delivering some sublime cross-field passes. With such talent on view, chances arrived. Darron Gibson, Nani, Rio Ferdinand and Tevez went close for United but so did Jermaine Jenas and Bent for Spurs.</p>
              <p>The game’s flow had been maintained by Chris Foy’s sympathetic handling but the St Helens referee, who has been enjoying a good season, erred badly midway through the second half by failing to brandish a second yellow to John O’Shea for clattering Modric. Foy then booked Ronaldo for diving when he had clearly been brought down by Ledley King inside the box. Reputation, not reality, was punished here.</p>
              <p>Extra time was almost avoided but Foster thwarted Lennon and then a post frustrated Ronaldo. United’s nerve held during the shootout. As their coach pulled out of Wembley, it encountered traffic heading towards the nearby Arena for a reality TV show. United have an X-Factor of their own: belief.</p>
