            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Rene happy with squad progress<br><br>Rene Meulensteen is relishing his coaching role with the first team following his return to Old Trafford after a managerial spell at Brondby.</strong><br><br>The former United Reserves' boss spent five months in charge at the Danish club but the move didn't work out, with Meulensteen opting to step down from his post. Sir Alex Ferguson wasted little time in re-signing Meulensteen as the club's Technical Skills Development Coach in January this year and he is now an integral part of the backroom set-up.<br><br>Meulensteen has been working with the players both individually and in groups during the Reds' Asia Tour and so far he's delighted with the squad's progress.<br><br>"They're all doing really well," he told ManUtd.com. "To be honest every one of them came back for pre-season in very good condition; I could see that in the first few days of training back in England.<br><br>"We've been doing lots of passing routines, as well as other short and sharp exercises so the players can work on their turns.<br><br>"One of the big reasons behind United winning the title last season was the fact that the team enjoyed such a good start and that's what we'll be aiming for this time round.<br><br>"Playing in the humid conditions over here in Asia will certainly help the players with their fitness and I'm very happy with how things are going so far."<br><br>Meulensteen arrived at Old Trafford in 2001 as Skills Development Coach. He was promoted to Reserves manager at United in 2005, leading his side to a superb treble.<br><br>Since returning to United, his work with the senior squad is something he is thoroughly enjoying and he says the players are responding well in training.<br><br>"Before I left United I'd primarily worked with the Academy players as Skills Coach but I'd also done some work with the senior players and Sir Alex saw the benefit of that, as did the players," he explains. "So when I came back he decided to bring me closer to the first team.<br><br>"I've thoroughly enjoyed it and I hope the players have too. Sometimes players can get into too much of a pattern and they just go through the motions to a degree.<br><br>"I therefore try to get them to think about the detail of different techniques and moves during training. My role is very much focused on the analytical part of the game because in this day and age minor details can make a massive difference.<br><br>"Tactically you cannot just rely on passing the ball from A to B. Players like Cristiano Ronaldo, Ronaldinho and Thierry Henry have shown that, so it's important for every player to learn the simple, functional techniques which will allow them to keep possession or change the angle of attack, even if they are in a defensive position."</div>
