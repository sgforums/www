              is it fatigue, complacency or loss of form dramatically the problem?
              
              even playing at home, for the past 4 matches, conceded 2 goals at home, besides the 4-1 thrashing by Liverpool.
              
              After 14 matches not conceding, the defence suddenly become leaky.
              
              With ferdinand not playing, gary neville and John O Shea are not exactly top notch replacements, are they?
              
              what happened to that hash brown? didnt see him for the past few months liao, injury so long meh?

              the league cup finals win against spurs albeit needed pk to win them, plus the world club cup matches in Japan and Fa cup must have taken a toll at these late stages.
              
              Just like Villa, lost their steam as they played in July in the Inter-ToTo cup matches and having a small squad compared to the big 4. After Man Utd equalised 2-2, Villa players looked very tired, no wonder Man Utd scored in the last min.
              
              The same thing can be said of Man Utd, when Man Utd scored their second goal, man u players are knackered and lost concentration.
              
              Gary Neville and John O Shea look disastrous, played extremely poor. Poor is an understatement to their performance.

              seeing the way they played these days, even spurs, Bolton and Man City can easily score against Man Utd.
              
              Looks like the BPL title is not a foregone conclusion after all. Liverpool will take advantage if Man U were to slip up between now and end of season.
              
              If Liverpool is to pip Man Utd for the title, its really Man Utd losing the title this season, having built a 7 points advantage with a game in hand, just like Man Utd lost the title to Arsenal in the 97/98 season, despite leading the Gunners 12 points in February.

              <p><strong>Extract from <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/philmcnulty/2009/04/f.html">http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/philmcnulty/2009/04/f.html</a></strong></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>United's defence, which does not seem to have recovered from the wounds inflicted by Liverpool in the 4-1 defeat at Old Trafford, extended an open invitation to Porto's incisive attackers from,the start.</p>
              <p>Rio Ferdinand was once more a spectator, and United's chances of
              progress in Porto will be hugely enhanced if he returns, although it is
              highly unlikely he will play at Sunderland at the weekend.</p>
              <p>This is no criticism of Jonny Evans, but Nemanja Vidic is a more
              formidable presence with Ferdinand's pace and anticipation alongside
              him.</p>
              <p>United's midfield lacked drive and Paul Scholes needs to produce
              more of those outstanding performances from the past just to prove time
              is not threatening to catch up with him. He rarely influenced events.</p>
              <p>And then we come to Cristiano Ronaldo. A glorious talent, but a
              glorious talent who needs to take a long, hard look at team-mate
              Rooney's determination to chase every ball and pursue every lost cause.</p>
              <p>Too often, when Ronaldo loses possession, he almost acts as if it is
              beneath him to go and retrieve the situation, preferring instead to
              stand around and wait for a team-mate to do his dirty work.</p>
              <p>He performed the trick against Aston Villa on Sunday and was at it
              again in the build up to Porto's opening goal last night. It was
              significant that Old Trafford warmed to Rooney's non-stop endeavour
              while Ronaldo's occasional shrugs after losing possession were met with
              audible impatience.</p>
              <p>United's fans expect to see perspiration running alongside
              inspiration. And rightly so. They are used to it from men such as
              Rooney, Scholes and Ryan Giggs, so Ronaldo need not feel exempt.</p>

              <p>agree with u "omg"...<br>MU defense was horrible for the pass few matches..escpeacially agaisnt villa and porto..i was bitting my nails everytime the opposition attks...and there are not much good penetration going with MU midfied n attackers..either the passing go way off or there are no threat...MU goals seems to come on a short moment of brilliance/luck...<br>hopefully MU will buckle up..</p>

              <p>I belief fatigue is one or the reasons they are playing this way lately... As the season comes towards the end and playing more matches by the weeks... They are finding it hard to cope... The 2nd squad like the O'Shea, Evans, Anderson, Nani isn't good enough with consistency. But more importantly, injury to Rio, Rafael, Brown and at times Vidic have added to the problem.</p>
              <p>Another area I feel is... Losing Hargreaves was a big lost cos he is their best and most experienced defensive midfielder... Anderson has been in and out too with injury and lost of form... He played a key role last season when Scholes was out for 3, 4 months... This only leave them with Fletcher to do all the running which is clearly not enough with so many matches coming towards the end of the season... Scholes and Giggs can't run thesedays making their midfield "soft" whenever they play. And when the midfield breaks down, it effect the rest of the other departments...</p>
              <p>If we look at Pool, their strength in the closing stages comes from their midfield... Its not that their defense is any better than at the start of the season but Gerrard, Alonso and Mascherano have perform really well together these last 3 months... and Gerrad has been in great form this last 2 months.</p>
              <p>United's current problem could also be down to losing Rafael... I don't know but ever since he got injured, they are not the same... That boy is really fast and he helps out the midfield area as well more than O'Shea or Neville does. Hope he and Rio return soon... I belief it could solve a lot of their current defensive problems...</p>

              <h1 class="sIFR-ignore">VDS and Vidic call for greater focus</h1>
              <p><img src="http://www.setanta.com/Global/Images/sport/football/2008-2009/portugal/Porto/mariano_neville_united-goal.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <div id="div_article_main_content">
              <p><strong>Edwin van der Sar and Nemanja
              Vidic are demanding a defensive improvement after Manchester United’s
              disappointing showings in recent weeks. </strong></p>
              <p>Van der Sar went 1,311 minutes without conceding a goal earlier this
              season, but they have shipped ten goals in their last four games and
              their bid for domestic and European success has come under threat as a
              result.</p>
              <p>And, after Porto twice took advantage of some slack defending in the
              2-2 draw at Old Trafford on Tuesday, Van der Sar has called for greater
              concentration.</p>
              <p>“It is not that they are great goals from the opposition,” he said in The Daily Mail.</p>
              <p>“We have to sort it out and start focusing.</p>
              <p>“We have been successful for a long time this season and we have to get back to that.”</p>
              <p>Vidic, meanwhile, believes the absence of the likes of Rio
              Ferdinand, Wes Brown and Rafael has had an impact, but he accepts that
              they cannot continue to make mistakes.</p>
              <p>"It's very disappointing to lose a goal at the end like that when you are winning 2-1,” he said.</p>
              <p>"If you look at the last four games then obviously we haven't played like we did in the ten games before that.</p>
              <p>“We have conceded too many, so definitely we need to get back on the right road and we need to get back that mentality.</p>
              <p>“I don't think it's a case of players not having the confidence but
              maybe we've had so many games and also we've had players injured – at
              this stage of the season, you need all your big players to be ready.</p>
              <p>"After the Liverpool game, we said we had to fix it but we didn't. Now we have to put it right."</p>
