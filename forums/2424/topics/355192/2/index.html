              <h3 class="headline">Fergie pinpoints defensive lapse</h3>
              <p class="article-date">April 08, 2009</p>
              <p>SIR Alex
              Ferguson has admitted United's defensive resolve has collapsed since
              their amazing clean-sheet record was brought to an end by Blackburn.<br> <br>It
              is hard to comprehend how a team that can set a new Premier League best
              of 14 successive clean sheets should suddenly appear so vulnerable.<br> <br>The
              10 goals United have conceded in their last four games is the same
              number it took 22 matches to let in prior to the Old Trafford hammering
              by Liverpool on March 14.<br> <br>But Ferguson believes the actual
              malaise dates back a further three weeks, when Blackburn were
              distinctly unlucky to suffer a 2-1 defeat to the Reds, having outplayed
              the world club champions for long spells.<br> <br>What Sam
              Allardyce's side did manage to do was score, through Roque Santa Cruz.
              It robbed United of an in-built need to concentrate, and they have
              never recovered.<br> <br>"We were doing very well when we weren't conceding any goals because there was a record to defend," recalled Ferguson.<br> <br>"Once
              we lost that first goal against Blackburn, the battle to try to keep
              the record had gone. Since then we have lost really bad goals."<br> <br>Injuries
              and poor form have also come together at just the wrong time, a deadly
              combination from which, at present, there seems to be no escape.<br> <br>When
              Rio Ferdinand returned from the Club World Cup in Japan with a back
              injury that kept him out for five weeks, Jonny Evans stepped
              brilliantly into the breach.<br> <br>But now Ferdinand is
              sidelined again, Evans' confidence has ebbed as the rigours of playing
              so many games have caught up with his 21-year-old legs.<br> <br> <strong>Presence</strong> <br> <br>Similarly,
              the once reliable presence of John O'Shea, who was superb at left-back
              when Patrice Evra was ruled out by suspension and then injury, is
              struggling for form after being switched to the other full-back
              position and then centre-half last night when Evans went off with a
              groin injury that makes him a doubt for next week's second leg with
              Porto.<br> <br>Nemanja Vidic's recent disciplinary troubles mean
              he was starting only his fifth game out of nine in last night's 2-2
              draw and the rustiness showed.<br> <br>The list of senior men
              currently operating well below their peak is lengthy and includes Evra,
              plus Michael Carrick and Paul Scholes, who can normally be relied upon
              to keep possession but are currently giving it away with alarming
              regularity.<br> <br>Gary Neville is only just back off the
              treatment table, Dimitar Berbatov, Anderson, Wes Brown and Rafael da
              Silva are on it, along with Ferdinand, whose groin injury has not given
              Ferguson any sign of clearing up.<br> <br>Little wonder it seems
              like Wayne Rooney is carrying the fight on his own, with occasional
              flashes of genius from Cristiano Ronaldo, Carlos Tevez and Federico
              Macheda.<br> <br>Indeed, given the importance of next week's
              second leg and the need to retain an element of freshness for Portugal,
              it would be no surprise if Macheda was handed his first start on
              Saturday, when the Premier League leaders head to relegation-threatened
              Sunderland.<br> <br>O'Shea is set to partner Vidic in defence as
              United attempt to subdue Kenwyne Jones rather more effectively than
              they managed with Aston Villa's John Carew on Sunday.<br> <br>However, the problem of fatigue goes far deeper.<br> <br>"We are suffering," said Ferguson.<br> <br>"Park Ji-sung is the one player who never misses a beat in terms of his movement and endurance work in a game.<br> <br>"He has such natural stamina. He was well off the pace last night and looked tired."<br> <br>Park's
              World Cup commitment to South Korea could not have helped, one of the
              reasons Ferguson felt he was placed in an unfair position last weekend
              when he was forced to choose between facing Villa on Saturday lunchtime
              with no preparation, or Sunday afternoon knowing aching limbs could
              drain his team last night.<br> <br>Only the foolhardy would write off United's chances of overcoming Porto in the second leg next week.<br> <br>But
              Ferguson also knows he must look beyond the task of ensuring United
              become the first English team to beat the Portuguese champions on their
              own soil after 11 previously failed attempts.<br> <br>For, if
              United do fall, the Scot will have a major job on his hands trying to
              raise spirits in a squad that sees the finishing line too far away to
              simply drop across. And hungry predators from Merseyside - Rafael
              Benitez in the Premier League and David Moyes in the FA Cup - are lying
              in wait to pounce themselves.</p>

              <p><strong>Jonny Evans admits Manchester United could have given more during Tuesday’s 2-2 Champions League draw with Porto. </strong></p>
              <p>Evans was one of many under-performers in the United side at Old
              Trafford, making a poor error as the Portuguese ambushed their hosts
              from the opening whistle.</p>
              <p>Having gone on a record run without conceding, United have now
              conceded twice against Fulham, Aston Villa and Porto, and four times
              against Liverpool.</p>
              <p>Evans admits complacency has crept into the camp, and he
              sheepishly confirmed that Sir Alex Ferguson’s men have not been
              fighting for the red jersey.</p>
              <p>“Maybe it’s our own fault, maybe we’ve become a bit complacent,” Evans was quoted as saying in The Sun.</p>
              <p>“We haven’t been defending for our lives as well as we should have.</p>
              <p>“It’s something we have to address.”</p>

              <p><br> oh they were that big? didnt notice lol. But they are super
              fit....running and running. I thought those in EPL are the
              fittest?</p>

              <p>they were not very fit, I think they came with a plan to hit MU in the first 20mins cause they know MU just played a tough game vs Villa a few days ago. Actually, I tot the last 20mins were their weakest, but ironically, also United..</p>
