              <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's sense of timing as a manager would appear to be as impeccable as it was as a player.</p>
              <p>In
               the week that Sir Alex Ferguson celebrates 25 years in charge of 
              Manchester United, his former striker provided compelling evidence of 
              his own managerial pedigree by steering Molde to a first Norwegian title
               in their 100-year history.</p>
              <p>Solskjaer, whose legendary status at 
              United was assured with the winning goal in the 1999 Champions League 
              final to clinch the Treble, one of 126 plundered in 366 appearances, has
               long been tipped by Ferguson to make a successful transition from 
              player to manager.</p>
              <p>For a man who spent much of his United career 
              as a substitute and forged his reputation as an impact player, the 
              dugout would appear to be Solskjaer's natural habitat, Ferguson having 
              remarked in the past how Solskjaer's astute reading of the game from the
               bench set him apart from other players.</p>
              <div class="news_mpu_article"></div>
              <p>While some subs might brood on the bench at the perceived injustice 
              of failing to make the starting line-up, Solskjaer used his time there 
              to analyse the subtle nuances of a game, ensuring he knew how to make 
              the maximum impact if and when he was introduced to the action.</p>
              <p>When
               a persistent knee injury forced Solskjaer to retire in 2007, Ferguson 
              had no hesitation in handing the forward a job on his staff, using his 
              expertise to help coach United's strikers for the remainder of the 
              2007-08 season.</p>
              <p>And when the job of United reserve team coach 
              became available in May 2008, Ferguson handed it to Solskjaer, who made 
              an instant impact, leading them to victory in the Lancashire Senior Cup 
              and Manchester Senior Cup that season.</p>
              <p>That success saw Solskjaer 
              offered the job of coaching Norway but, then 37, he considered himself 
              too young and inexperienced to take on the role at such an early stage 
              of his managerial career, instead choosing to take the next stage of his
               development in charge of Molde, where he spent two years as a player 
              before joining United in 1996.</p>
              <p>Solskjaer's success at Molde has 
              raised the inevitable question of him one day managing United, given the
               ease with which he has adapted to the role of coach, and the 
              38-year-old will certainly not be short of offers from other clubs 
              following his championship success with Molde.</p>
              <p>Yet Solskjaer is an
               astute man, devoid of ego, and knows he must prove himself over a 
              period of time, and at a higher level, if he is ever to be considered 
              for the United job, although his immediate success with Molde suggests a
               long and fruitful managerial career.</p>
              <p>And with Ferguson showing no
               signs of slowing down, despite turning 70 next month, the United board 
              are in no rush to begin the unenviable task of finding a successor to 
              the most successful British manager of all-time, putting off the 
              inevitable as long as they can.</p>
              <p>Talking to former United chief 
              executive and chairman Martin Edwards this week, the man who appointed 
              Ferguson and who - crucially - resisted calls to sack him in 1990, his 
              view was that the Scot's successor had to be a manager with experience 
              and success at the highest level, given the size and scale of the job.</p>
              <p>If
               United follow that blueprint when it comes to appointing Ferguson's 
              successor, then the short-list will include the likes of Jose Mourinho 
              and Pep Guardiola, while Everton boss David Moyes, consistently 
              championed by Fergie, is also likely to come into the frame.</p>
              <p>But 
              Solskjaer has served notice of his potential to one day manage United 
              and continue the attacking philosophy and success laid down by his 
              mentor Ferguson.</p>
