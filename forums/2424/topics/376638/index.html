              <p>Manchester United midfielder Owen Hargreaves has taken another step towards recovery
              from his knee surgery, returning to the Red Devil's Carrington training ground to continue his rehabilitation.</p>

              </div>
              </div>
              <p>The England star has been plagued by a tendinitis problem that preceeded his 
              £18million move from Bayern Munich in the summer of 2007.</p>
              <p>Although Hargreaves did manage to get through his first season at Old Trafford,
              and play in the 2008 Champions League final victory over Chelsea, the problem
              surfaced once more at the start of last season and it was decided to send him for surgery.</p>
              <p>Under
              the guidance of renowned Colorado knee specialist Dr Richard Steadman,
              who counts Ruud van Nistelrooy and Alan Shearer among the players he
              has helped recover from ruptured cruciate ligaments, Hargreaves had
              operations on both knees.</p>
              <p>The
              Calgary-born player has remained in the United States for an extended
              period of rehabilitation ahead of his return to Manchester. he has been
              accompanied by the physios who have been working with him across
              the Atlantic, and they will now offer the United medical staff guidance
              on the
              best way to manage his recovery.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson is determined not to rush Hargreaves' return, knowing the
              player could be a very influential figure if he does eventually regain full
              fitness. However, he has been registered to play in the group stages of the Champions
              League, withthe United manager optimistic he will be fit to play a role by the end of November.</p>
              <p>"Hargreaves
              [has been included] because, having taken the medical advice, we think
              he'll be available for the last three Champions League group-stage
              games," said Ferguson when naming his 25-man Champions League squad.
              "He's a versatile player who can perform in so many positions, so he
              could be a very important player for us at that time of the season."</p>
