              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Dimitar Berbatov</strong></span> <strong>has revealed he makes notes about</strong> <span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson</strong></span><strong>'s management techniques in case he decides to be a coach in the future.</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=826433&amp;sec=england&amp;cc=4716"></a></strong></p>
              <p>Berbatov is rewarding Ferguson for the immense faith he has shown in him by finally finding the form that persuaded the Manchester United boss to spend a club record £30.75million to sign him from Tottenham two years ago. As well as his manager, Berbatov is treating Ferguson like a mentor by recording the valuable lessons he can garner from the Scot.</p>
              <p>"He is one of the most successful managers in the history of the game,'' Berbatov told <em>MUTV</em>. "I write things down about the way we train and how he treats people. It is like a school. You work with the best manager and play with the best players. I try to learn. I am at the biggest club in the world. If I can learn anywhere it is here.''</p>
              <p>Berbatov admitted he was in awe of Ferguson when he first moved north from Tottenham. But it soon became apparent the most decorated British manager of all time was a multi-dimensional character, who even when unleashing the infamous hair-dryer, always does so with an end goal in mind.</p>
              <p>"At first I was star struck but when you start to know him, you see he is a very nice guy,'' said Berbatov. "He jokes around with the players but when things don't go the way he wants he can be tough. It is not that it makes you feel uncomfortable. He just wants you to be sure in yourself. Every human being is different. You need different approaches and he goes to every player and speaks to them alone to motivate them.''</p>
              <p>Berbatov seems certain to start against Bolton at the Reebok Stadium on Saturday but another striker staking a claim for more involvement is <span style="color: #000000;">Michael Owen</span>, following his two goals at Scunthorpe on Wednesday. Ferguson admitted Owen's form, in addition to the presence of <span style="color: #000000;">Wayne Rooney</span>, left him with a welcome selection headache.</p>
              <p>"It does give me a problem,'' said Ferguson. "I have known it was going to be a problem since the start of the season, that is why I let <span style="color: #000000;">Danny Welbeck</span> go to Sunderland and <span style="color: #000000;">Mame Biram Diouf</span> to Blackburn on loan. The form of Dimitar Berbatov has meant that other players have taken a back seat, which is unfortunate for them because they are good players.''</p>
