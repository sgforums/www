            <div class='col-md body'>Ferguson: It was a similar scenario to the one that occurred at Highbury two years ago when Thierry Henry caught out Chelsea's Petr Cech. Then, as on Tuesday, the referee (Graham Poll) asked whether the player wanted the wall back 10 yards and the whistle blown. When the offer was declined, the official simply walked away and allowed the kick to be taken.<br><br>'The laws of the game are the same for every country,' declared Ferguson. 'France are not exempt from them.<br><br>'They took free-kicks on five occasions during the game, we took some ourselves. You just put the ball down and get on with it. That is the option you have. You don't need a referee to blow his whistle.<br><br>'If that had happened to us, I would have been unhappy with my defence. I wondered why their goalkeeper spent so much time on his post? How long does it take to line up a wall?'</div>

For those out there who have had a different view and argued hard on it, have UEFA's statement from the laws of the game clear up your minds?<br><br>Like i have said earlier, no one here is blindly supporting a wrong action. We are just stating a fact of the rule. It is not anyone's fault that some of us are ignorant of it cos we are afterall not professionals in this area but one should be big enough to admit and accept once it is proven to them that they got it wrong.<br><br>There is no shame in admitting that we have got it wrong, if anything my perception of the person will be one of respect... by admitting he got it wrong, he instil a credibility to his future post...<br><br>Or others may choose to be quiet on it from now on. But to those who still insist that they are still correct obviously prove one thing... that they are totally bias towards man u and their future post should be disregarded by people who can see they have a different agenda.<br><br>Anyway, you can still catch First Edition on Ch 23 later at 2pm if you missed last night's...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Peace people</div></blockquote>that guy prob wont understand what u juz typed.<br>but seeing that he still insisting on his way of sh!tt!ng boils my blood.<br><br>he simply rockmyworld man..</div>
