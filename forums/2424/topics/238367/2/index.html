That 'goal' which was 'scored' by peter odemwingie was rightly disallowed due to an infringement or foul for a push on Vidic. The ref had a fair game. </div></blockquote>You are spot on.<br><br>We were trying to use larsson to be a holding forward whenever we pump the ball to him and using him, release to either rooney or ronaldo coming in to support. Isn't that what RVN used to do? We seems to lose a lot of fluidity whenever we do that.<br><br>It was not fun seeing MUFC struggling while RM is scoring in the other game.<br><br>And once Ronaldo was off, the whole team loses its shape.<br><br>I would have put Saha in and Larsson as sub for impact, given the physical strength of each.<br><br>But for once, the whole defence played as a whole.<br><br>And all credit to referee who did a good job.<br><br></div>

A problem erupted 15 minutes into the match at Lens' Stade Felix-Bollaert, with some fans being pushed against the 10-foot-high metal security fences. </strong><br><br>Fans reacted angrily, prompting riot police to fire tear gas into the stand. However, after two fans, one an elderly woman, were lifted over the barriers to safety, the unrest was quelled. United goalkeeper Edwin Van der Sar suffered double vision as a result of the tear gas fired into the stand.<br><br>Television reports suggested the gates at the back of the stand had been opened by police to allow Red Devils supporters with tickets for the home section of the stadium to sit with their own fans. United had expressed concerns about the basic facilities at the ground before the match.<br><br>Uefa spokesman Rob Faulkner said: "Having seen what went on on the security side and in the match itself, it would be standard procedure for the referee to report the incidents and for the Control and Disciplinary Committee to take the appropriate action.<br><br>"The whole issue of Lille playing in that stadium will also need to be addressed. "We cannot say now what action the Disciplinary Committee will take, but if they find against Lille, it could well be severe."<br><br>United were surprised Lille were allowed to move the game to the compact 42,000 stadium in northern France rather than a larger, more modern venue like the Stade de France.<br><br>Manchester United secretary Ken Ramsden revealed the club would meet with Uefa and Football Association officials after the game to discuss the incident.<br><br>A Manchester United club official, at the match, said he had not been made aware of any injuries to fans.<br><br></div>
