            <div class='col-md body'>Aiya... just read this part and get a better understanding of the game before making all those comments...<br><br>The latter complaint is likely to be rapidly dismissed. Under Fifa guidelines Eric Braamhaar, the Dutch referee, was correct in allowing Giggs' goal, scored from a free-kick taken while Tony Sylva, the Lille goalkeeper, was lining up his defensive wall. Such flexible refereeing may be rare in Le Championnat but given that Thierry Henry has twice scored such goals in the Premiership, and once for France, the French game can hardly be unaware of the practice.<br><br><strong>Giggs' Goal </strong><br><br>With seven minutes remaining and the game goalless Manchester United were awarded a free-kick. As Tony Sylva, the goalkeeper, lined up his defensive wall, <span style="color: red;">Ryan Giggs asked the Dutch referee if he could take a quick kick. Eric Braamhaar agreed.</span> Giggs scored. Sylva was booked amid protests by Lille. The French club then kicked the ball into touch from the kick-off and began to walk off. After several minutes of argument involving match officials, and players and staff of both clubs, play resumed with a United throw-in.<br><br><span style="color: red;"> <strong>The Free-Kick Law </strong> </span><br><br>The referee only needs to blow his whistle if the attacking team ask him to move the wall back. Otherwise, the kick can be taken quickly, without warning.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wooh wooh.. Cool it guys. Stop pointing fingers here and there cos everyone is entitled to their own opinions.<br><br>Giggs' goal is allowed and UEFA is not going to make a rematch. If the organisers of the tournament is happy with it den i don't see why we should argue till our faces are red.<br><br>In my opinion, it was quick thinking by Giggs. Desperation or not i do not know but I give Lille players credit as they were indeed playing out of their skin after Cabaye's introduction. Also, this is only the 1st leg and United is only leading by a goal, anything can happen in the 2nd leg(Choy!).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>So everyone please, dont start flaming with colourful languages(fresh yellow, Cyan Chocolate Blue, etc), insulting and name-calling teams.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Afterall, it is still NEW YEAR!
