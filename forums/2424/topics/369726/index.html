              <p><strong>United's eventful four-game tour of Asia ends on Sunday with a friendly in China against Hangzhou Greentown.</strong></p>
              <p><a href="http://www.manunited.com.cn/"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">ManUnited.com.cn</span></span></strong></a> spoke to opposition coach Zhou Suian about his side and the prospect of facing the Reds...</p>
              <p><strong>Tell us a little about Hangzhou Greentown.<br></strong>We're renowned as a good passing team but we're also not afraid to put a tackle in where necessary. We're currently in mid-table in the Chinese Super League. The team has been affected by injuries and player movement, but we are still playing well and are hopeful of getting in to the top four.</p>
              <p><strong>What's your opinion of the city of Hangzhou and Greentown's fans?<br></strong>Hangzhou is a beautiful city and our fans are superb. They are known as the "Green Soul" and will follow us come rain or shine. So they'll be supporting us on Sunday, but they'll also respect United because they appreciate quality football.</p>
              <p><strong>What are your impressions of your opposite number, Sir Alex Ferguson? <br></strong>I am full of respect for him. His mix of young and experienced players over the years has ensured great consistency in his team's performances. There are two things I most admire about him. Firstly, his ability to spot potential – he pays great attention to his players and bloods them early so that they become accustomed to playing at the highest level at a young age. Secondly, his guiding principle is clear: winning is about teamwork and all players</p>
              <div class="newsStory">
              <p>must follow the Manchester United 'way'. That's the foundation of his success.</p>
              <p><strong>Can you predict what the score will be on Sunday?<br></strong>It’s a friendly, so we’re not attaching too much importance to the scoreline, but we are aiming to help United to put on a show for the fans. This is a rare chance for our players to compete against one of the best sides in the world, which will hugely benefit our future development. We will be aiming to play at our best, focusing on ball control, and will be aiming to attack as much as defend.</p>
              <p><strong>The friendly is in the middle of your domestic season – will that affect the way you play?<br></strong>The game can only have a positive effect on us. This game has not conflicted with our league season and we've had plenty of time to prepare for Manchester United. This is a very important opportunity for our players, who rarely come into contact with such world-class teams. We'll learn lessons from United that we can take into our domestic competition.</p>
