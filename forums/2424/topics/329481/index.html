              <p>I think Mark Hughes has done United a big favour by taking Robinho away from Chelsea... And the way he took him away from them could also have a psychological effect felt throughout the whole squad...</p>
              <p>Chelsea were chasing Robinho for such a long time and many or almost everyone expected them to get Robinho... But the last minute event not only took away their invincibility in the transfer market but also prevented them from getting a replacement on time...</p>
              <p>I believed many in the Chelsea squad expected Robinho to arrive sooner of later after Kenyon said "It was a done deal" and even started selling his shirt... Lampard &amp; Deco was also saying how much Robinho could add to their squad...</p>
              <p>I feel that before the transfer windon closed, Chelsea were odds on favourite for the title but after tue morning... They having lost Robinho and United added Berbatov... At least now I think its almost even tho I still think Chelsea having a little edge, very slight cos of their midfield powers... But should they get injury in that department... United could pound on it.</p>
              <p>This Robinho event could have unending effects... ill feelings could be sow from it... Now we may have Scolari blaming Roman and Roman blaming Peter... and maybe an unhappy feeling amongst them develops... And Scolari now has no "plan B" which Robinho was suppose to give him... Scolari tried desperately even calling Robinho over the phone just before deadline time not to accept City's offer but to no avail...</p>
              <p>All these appears well for United it seems but they still need to be at their best to beat the already powerful Chelsea squad.</p>

              <p>Well, i see this transfer move the same as tevez and masherano. Stepping stone to other big club.</p>
              <p>Think he will be up for grabs next season.</p>
              <p>Maybe city is at the bottom and he will say he regrets the decision and wants to move away. Chelski perhaps? ... or SAF gonna ?... =X</p>

              <p>Another aspect of losing robinbo to city, Roman will find for a start, he is not longer the one with the most money, and maybe just maybe his interest may wade.</p>
              <p>And given Chelsea is asking for more and more each season from his pocket, I believe being a shrewd businessman, he may pull and run..</p>

              <p><br>What make you think so? For all we know he wanted Berbatov first than when they missed out, change their target to Robinho... Whatever, he was their manager when Robinho was signed and he immediately gave the press conference once it was confirm...</p>
