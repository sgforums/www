            <div class='col-md body'>Gary Neville is refusing to get carried away in the title race despite United's six point lead over champions Chelsea.<br><br>The Reds' skipper said recently that he fully expects more twists and turns between now and May, and he has reiterated the need to stay calm over the coming months as United look, at the very least, to maintain their advantage over Jose Mourinho's men.<br><br>"Until the campaign gets to March I think we are still jostling for positions," the England right back is quoted as saying in the Manchester Evening News. "We are only just over halfway. It is not a race yet. People want to try and create a race and I can understand that.<br><br>"But as a player you just look to get to March and April. Then you have internationals returning and you could be in the mix in the Champions League and the FA Cup. That is when you are involved in a dogfight.<br><br>"At this moment in time it is still quite calm," he added. "We are not discussing championships and winning FA Cups or the Champions League. We just look to keep ourselves in a good position and keep our form.<br><br>"I am not going to say now that this Manchester United team are going to win the championship because I know full well that, with 16 games to go, in a week we could be 12 points clear or we could have our lead wiped away. That's the way a championship goes "For two or three years we haven't achieved what we would like to have achieved. But we are confident the way we are playing and we have a determination to do something."<br><br>Despite having seen the team underachieve over the last three seasons, the Reds' captain says he always expected United to get back on the track.<br><br>"I never feared that we wouldn't turn it around again in my time," insisted the defender who turns 32 next month. "The manager has said publicly over the last few years that we were in a period of transition with younger players and it would take time for them to mature and for us to develop as a team. That has happened.<br><br>"There was no doubt it was going to come back to a better level for us because we have good players. What you are seeing now are players playing to their capabilities.<br><br>"There are many challenges ahead of us in all competitions," he added. "It is exciting and something to be enjoyed. We are certainly not fearing it. We never fear any match at United. That just would never happen."</div>
