            <div class='col-md body'><strong><br>Neville eyes Reserves return<br><br>Gary Neville is expected to be named in United's Reserves squad for the visit of Stockport County in the Manchester Senior Cup on Thursday 1 November</strong><br><br>A series of injuries have forced the Reds' captain to miss more than seven months' action, but Sir Alex Ferguson told English press last week that Neville, 32, has regained full fitness and trained without incident for more than two weeks.<br><br>Ferguson told Manchester United Radio of his desire to reintroduce Neville to first-team action as soon as possible, although he admitted a Reserves run-out is perhaps more realistic at this stage.<br><br>"Gary's doing great," Sir Alex said. "We'll probably just wait for the next Reserves game to play him."<br><br>Neville, also speaking to the club's radio station, said he can't wait to take the field again, although concedes he may have a difficult time forcing his way back into the first XI.<br><br>"I've made myself available," he confirmed. "But with the way Wes [Brown] is playing Â– and Danny Simpson has been great, too Â– it might be a case of easing me back in over the space of a couple of weeks."<br><br>Neville's injury nightmares began when he picked up an ankle knock against Bolton Wanderers in March. At the time, it was hoped he would return in time to skipper United against Chelsea in last season's FA Cup final. That date came and went, before calf and thigh injuries further delayed his return.<br><br>"It's been too long," he sighs. "Missing the end of last season was bad enough but then for it to go into this season is doubly frustrating. Hopefully it's over now and I can get back into the team.<br><br>"The worst part about it has been going into the gym every day. It's okay for a couple of weeks but after that it's just mundane and boring. The physios try to make it as exciting as possible for you, but there's only so much excitement you can get out of a rowing machine or a bike.<br><br>"Most of all, I miss going out on the pitch. I'm seeing the lads playing well and they're getting good results and I want to be part of it. Coming in every day and then not being able to train with my mates is hard. An hour and a half on the training pitch flies by, but an hour and a half in the gym can feel like three days."</div>
