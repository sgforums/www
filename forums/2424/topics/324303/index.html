              <p>Berbatov : The new Cantona?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>WITH all the controversy surrounding Cristiano Ronaldo, it is already becoming one hell of a long pre-season for Manchester United fans. He’s going. He’s staying. He’s injured. He’s a slave. Blah, blah, blah.</strong></p>
              <p class="article">But Red Devils fans fear not. Where there is hope, at least there is Dimitar Berbatov. The moody Bulgarian is bang on Alex Ferguson’s radar and I reckon he is the Eric Cantona clone the United faithful have been praying for. The languid style. The look of not being interested — before turning on the stunning skill. The pure class.</p>
              <p class="article">Cantona had bucketloads of it and so does Berba. He’s just got the vibe, if you know what I mean. There is a bit of Dennis Bergkamp about him, too but the Cantona comparison is spot on. People look at him and think he isn’t quick. But they are wrong. He is deceptively fast and so technically gifted. He can do fantastic things with the ball and scores some cracking goals — just like Eric used to.</p>
              <p class="article">Left foot, right foot, close range or far out. The guy has it all. To be honest, I am surprised there haven’t been more clubs sniffing around. The Tottenham star is exactly the type of player who would fit into Ferguson’s line-up without any fuss at all. The United chief has a knack of getting guys in who easily walk into the team.</p>
              <p class="article">And I can just see Berbatov strutting round Old Trafford. Up front with Carlos Tevez? Playing just off Wayne Rooney? Any way you look it, it’s one hell of a tasty proposition. Berbatov is a great link player who will love the free-flowing football United served up last season.</p>
              <p class="article">At times he resembles someone who looks like he would rather be somewhere else. But with the lure of the Champions League and fighting for the title, we may just see a smile on his face.</p>
              <p class="article">Certainly being teed up by the likes of Paul Scholes, Rooney and Ryan Giggs every week would make me smile. The quality of service and the players around will make Berbatov a better player and, perhaps, he will be happier within himself. That would see a new, maybe more determined player.</p>
              <p class="article">Let’s remember what a brilliant couple of seasons he has had at Spurs and think that this guy, 27, can still improve and become even better. It’s an exciting prospect and Premier League defences wouldn’t like it one bit.</p>
              <p class="article">Fergie? He would absolutely love it and perhaps take some of the pain away from the Ronaldo situation and what has been one of the worst transfer sagas in living memory. Everywhere you look around this sorry mess it just stinks.</p>

              <p>30m, is quite a big sum..</p>
              <p>I think I saw the stats for the past 2 EPL, and the top two players with double digits in goals and assists are Rooney and Berba..</p>
              <p>so maybe a logicial reason to get him, but then with Spurs, it is not easy leh.</p>

              <h1>Dimitar? Like Cantona - Pallister</h1>
              <h2>Former Manchester United defender Gary Pallister has compared transfer target Dimitar Berbatov to club legend Eric Cantona...</h2>
              <p><img src="http://www.goal.com/images/26490_news.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Pallister, who had a distinguished career in the centre of defence alongside Steve Bruce for the Red Devils, believes that Berbatov, 27, has the playing style to the man known as King Eric.</strong><br><br>Manager Sir Alex Ferguson has revealed that the club have finally lodged a bid, rumoured to be just over £20 million, for their long-time transfer target. "Berbatov reminds me of Eric Cantona so much it is almost scary," said Pallister.<br><br>"Maybe he does not have the same barrel-chest but he is similar in every other aspect of his game. "He caresses the ball in the same manner, he has the touch, can score goals, bring others into the game and play up front on his own.<br><br>"He is the type of player fans of United love. "There is an arrogance about him, just as Eric had, and you can tell straight away he would fit in. "After winning the Premier League and Champions League last season, I am sure Sir Alex Ferguson felt he only needed to tweak his squad a little bit and in buying Berbatov, that is what he would be doing."<br><br>Sir Alex himself is positive the deal will be completed, complimenting the Bulgarian and hopeful of discussing a transfer with Tottenham Hotspur shortly. "We have good expectations this deal will go through," said Sir Alex. "Berbatov has been impressive for a long time and would be a great addition to our attack.<br><br>"I think time will work for us more than against us. "We will not stress and we are hoping to have a constructive conversation with Tottenham in the near future."</p>

              <p><strong>Spurs fine sulking Berba as Fergie threatens to sue</strong></p>
              <p class="add-linkout">Spurs have fined want-away striker Dimitar Berbatov for becoming the biggest pain in Spain.</p>
              <p class="add-linkout">His
              sour-faced sulking at the club's pre-season jaunt in the sun - caused
              by the stall on his move to Manchester United - has enraged boss Juande
              Ramos, who has docked him a week's wages of £40,000.</p>
              <p class="add-linkout">United
              boss Sir Alex Ferguson will make an increased bid of £25million this
              week that should finally land the 27-year-old - and relieve Spurs of a
              player some of his team-mates have branded "misery guts."</p>
              <p class="add-linkout">A
              Spurs source revealed: "From the first day the players reported for
              pre-season training Berbatov has had a look of thunder on his face and
              behaves like a man who does not want to be here. So it is not
              surprising Juande has taken action because he doesn't want Berbatov's
              moodiness to affect the morale of the squad."</p>
              <p class="add-linkout">Ferguson
              will press ahead with his Berba bid despite criticism from Spurs
              chairman Daniel Levy, who said he is hypocritical and arrogant.</p>
              <p class="add-linkout">Fergie said: "You know what Daniel Levy is like - he is different. I am sure our legal people will be looking at his comments."</p>
