"I just tried to play through it, and hoped that the adrenaline would get me through it.<br><br>"Right now it's swollen like a balloon, and I'm hoping that the flight back hasn't taken too much out of it.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Hopefully the 157th league meeting between the clubs this Saturday will be every bit as entertaining as the 156th...</strong><br><br><strong>Ins and outs:</strong> Everton will be without midfielder Tim Cahill (metatarsal) and striker James Vaughan (shoulder) and there are question marks against Thomas Gravesen (knee injury) and Tim Howard (dislocated finger) after they sustained injuries on international duty. However, record signing Yakubu is fit to make his home debut. The Reds could benefit from RooneyÂ’s earlier than expected return, not least because heÂ’s  scored in two games for United at Goodison, his former home ground of course.<br><br><strong>Star men</strong>: No current Red has faced Everton more times than Ryan Giggs - he made his United debut against them at Old Trafford on 2 March 1991. Two goals for him at Goodison Park will bring up another landmark, his century of league goals. In the blue corner, beware Yakubu - he netted in wins over United for previous clubs Middlesbrough and Portsmouth. It took the Yak just 11 minutes to score on his debut for David MoyesÂ’ side, in the 2-1 win at Bolton on 1 September.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Arteta: Bullocks to Ferguson</strong><br><br>MIKEL ARTETA is determined to leave Alex Ferguson grimacing at his second boot to the bullocks this week.<br><br>Five days ago the Manchester United chief was left beaten and bemused, when he was the victim of an unprovoked assault by a drunken yob at Euston station.<br><br>Now Arteta wants to rub salt in the wounds when Fergie brings his Premier League champions to Merseyside this lunchtime.<br><br>United came back from 2-0 down to win 4-2 at Goodison in April.<br><br>Spanish playmaker Arteta insisted: Â“We couldnÂ’t believe what happened last time we played United. I hope the memory of that can drive us on.<br><br>"To give away four goals in the last 20 minutes after weÂ’d played so well, was unbelievable. Do we owe them one? I donÂ’t think of it like that.<br><br>Â“But I thought we played well on the day and we showed we can get a result against them. We just need to take that extra step now.<br><br>Â“WeÂ’re the team thatÂ’s up at the top at the moment and weÂ’re really looking forward to showing what we can do.Â”<br><br>This time United will be facing a new-look Everton, with Yakubu, Phil Jagielka, Leighton Baines, Stephen Pienaar and Thomas Gravesen all arriving this summer.<br><br>Arteta added: Â“WeÂ’re only just starting to work together and work on the understanding between the players.<br><br>Â“But we know that, despite their start to the season, United are going to be fighting for the title so itÂ’ll be so, so hard to beat them. They wonÂ’t want to lose many more points.Â”</div>
