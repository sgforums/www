            <div class='col-md body'>From Soccernet:<br><br>Everton 0-1 Man Utd<br><br>PA<br><br>Nemanja Vidic nodded home a priceless winner seven minutes from time at Everton to complete a third successive single-goal triumph for Premier League champions Manchester United.<br><br>Mikael Silvestre receives treatment on what looked a seriously injured knee.The Serbian's effort, a near-post header from Nani's corner, enabled United to record a 13th win in 16 visits to Goodison Park and also keep pace with their major rivals.<br><br>Taken in isolation, a victory at one of the Premier League's most progressive outfits is a cause for celebration. But Sir Alex Ferguson knows his side's recent winning run is masking a few deficiencies in front of goal.<br><br>In six outings this season, United have still to score more than once, even though Ferguson has added Carlos Tevez, Nani and Anderson to the top flight's most prolific attacking force last term.<br><br>And, with the Red Devils due to begin their Champions League campaign in Lisbon on Wednesday and Chelsea due at Old Trafford next weekend, he needs to find a cutting edge fast.<br><br>Having threatened to unleash Wayne Rooney on his old club, Ferguson did not even have the young striker on his bench, presumably deciding the risk to the foot fractured on the opening weekend of the new campaign was too great.<br><br>Still, even with Owen Hargreaves missing as well, it was something of a surprise to see Patrice Evra lining up on the left wing, as both Nani and Louis Saha - United's matchwinner against Sunderland a fortnight ago - were on the bench.<br><br>The experiment did not last a half, as Evra was quickly shoved back into the visitors' defence when Mikael Silvestre went down in agony as his knee buckled attempting to block Mikel Arteta's run forward.<br><br>Yet Evra had already shown his offensive talents, his raw pace possibly causing Everton more problems than Cristiano Ronaldo, who was well shackled by Leighton Baines on his return from a three-match ban.<br><br>Carlos Tevez dropped deep as often as he could, releasing Evra with one magnificent pass inside Tony Hibbert, only for the Frenchman to fire into the side-netting.<br><br>Although United gradually assumed dominance in a swift-moving encounter, David Moyes' men succeeded in restricting them to a series of long-range efforts, with Michael Carrick among those to try his luck.<br><br>Vidic lost his balance at just the wrong time when Ryan Giggs dropped a corner into his path and the Serbian was already slipping to the floor when he skidded a shot wide.<br><br>Everton could be pleased with their defensive efforts though, and while Andrew Johnson and Ayegbeni Yakubu lacked support at times, they were quite dangerous at the other end too.<br><br>Indeed, had Yakubu not been hauled back by referee Alan Wiley for a debatable push on Wes Brown, the Nigerian would have been clean through.<br><br>Wiley had a difficult day. If he was not annoying the home fans by handing United dubious free-kicks, he was upsetting Paul Scholes by appearing to take more notice of the crowd than his own eyes when penalising the former England man for handball.<br><br>Scholes took exception to the decision and punched the ball away in frustration. Wiley immediately produced a yellow card and within seconds was being implored to brandish a red as Scholes wiped out Arteta near the United box.<br><br>Instead, the official called Scholes out to administer a final warning.<br><br>If the opening period had been short on goalmouth action, an expectant crowd did not have to wait long for a genuine chance in the second as Johnson rose to guide Arteta's corner towards the far post, only for Scholes to volley off the line.<br><br>Scholes was certainly in the thick of things and, when Tevez combined brilliantly with Giggs to set the midfielder up with a potential goal of the season, the midfielder could only thrash his volley over.<br><br>Tevez actually came closer with a long-range effort on the hour, the failure of which heralded the introduction of Saha for Giggs.<br><br>The move did stretch Everton's defence more than it had been previously, but they continued to hold Ferguson's team at bay, United's frustrations only increased by a yellow card issued to Ronaldo for a dive inside the area under pressure from Leon Osman.<br><br>Yet, just as it appeared time was ticking down to yet another blank day for United, up popped Vidic at the near post to power home Nani's near-post corner.<br><br>Belatedly, Everton threw men forward looking for an equaliser and Scotland's midweek hero James McFadden had a shot magnificently saved by Van der Sar before Rio Ferdinand blocked Victor Anichebe's follow-up.<br><br>For a short while, it allowed United to assume a position at the Premier League summit, but Ferguson needs to find a more potent blend up front if they are to stand a chance of being there when it really matters in May.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Was bewildered by Fergie's decision not to start Saha. Luckily brought him on as a sub. He created more opportunities for the team with his presence up front. Tevez also did pretty well, his passes cut the Everton defence on quite a few occasions.<br><br>Ronaldo was kinda off though, he couldnt connect with Brown. Hopefully Nevilles comes back asap.<br><br>Everton are a tough team to play so i feel it was a good result overall. But the majority of the squad can perform better.<br><br>Bring on Sporting and Chelsea.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
