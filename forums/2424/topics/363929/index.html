              <p>hi,</p>
              <p>just want some feedback from real MU fans, who would improve MU now??</p>
              <p>(any references to Sleague players, or any nonsensical posts will only be ignored so please spare us your verbal vormit, much appreciated.)</p>
              <p>Key Concern - With CR7 gone, MU is also looking @ replacing Scholes, Giggs, GVN. Importantly, it has shown in CL finals, we lack an influencial MF. </p>
              <p>Probable Solution - In a way, Rooney can be thrust upfront to fulfill his scoring potential, but provided we get someone in the wings who willing to track back to help defensively, or in short, a team player.</p>
              <p>Some potentials (in the news) -</p>
              <p>1) benzema - I got this niggling feeling, he is CR7 the 2nd. All along, he wants to go La Liga. If he comes MU, it is only a stepping stone.</p>
              <p>2. Ribery - 90M, it is a joke, plus he is 27yrs, not 19. </p>
              <p>3. Yaya - given his bro is @ gunners, unsure how this will turn out. At back of SAF's mind, I think he maybe gambling on OwenH.</p>
              <p>4. tevez - can we keep him?</p>
              <p>5. Berba - interesting to see his agent coming out to say he is staying. Was his position threatened? a Veron??</p>
              <p>6. valencia - till date, we know he is a speed demon. But does he have the craft to replace Giggs? a big ??? </p>
              <p>Appreciate your valuable feedback.</p>

              buy Robben, Man Utd last time one time target before he joined chelsea.
              
              Although he is 25 and is injury prone, but can play him occasionally, as he has the skill and pace to trouble defences. if he is playing on sat, then he should not be playing in midweek, and vice versa.
              
              Doubt that Ribery wants to join Man Utd. He think he rather joined Barcelona than Utd. Is he a fan of Man Utd? if so, then he will join Man Utd, but I doubt it.
              
              can buy huntelaar also lar, to replace tevez if he does leave, most likely he will leave.
              
              another player to buy is de rossi from roma. as owen hargreaves is often injury prone, better buy a defensive midfielder like de rossi.
              
              another player I would like see joining is Buffon, long term replacement for VDS.
              
              In brief, man utd need to buy 2-3 players, no need to buy 4-5 players, but the 2-3 players must of quality.

              if Benzema comes, thats awesome, but rooney wont be happy playing at left wing or rite wing.
              
              he stated he want to play as striker next season.

              <p>yea i would like big benz to come too</p>
              <p>if im not wrong, rooney's fine playing behind the main striker so i think benzema should fit in well...</p>
              <p>im more worried about our white elephant berbatov... maybe we should just sell him now!</p>

              <p>well, I think David Silva is good given his good track record, he seems better than Valencia.</p>
              <p>Benz is good given he also can command the flanks. but lyon chairman is a tough nut to crack.</p>
              <p>just to check, has Ronaldo even signed yet?</p>

              <p>well, SAF always give chance to youth,  else how we see welbeck, macheda or etc.</p>
              <p>However, being in a "sprint-like" EPL now, it is quite hard.</p>

              <p>My personal opinion says some players are not good even while in EPL until they start playing regular games in the EPL.</p>

              <p>Based on last season, I see a couple of weak links in MU's lineup. Most noticeably, Berba (Striker) *Not scoring, but debut season's blues maybe?*, Giggs (LM), Scholes (ACM), Gary Nev (RFB) and VDS (GK) *All getting old, no offence to their contribution to MU but time to move on imo*. And now with CR gone and Tevez maybe, SAF got a RM and backup (Striker) spots to cover too...</p>
              <p>Seems to me SAF is planning for</p>
              <p>Foster to replace VDS (Possible, the fellow is not bad, he just need more playtime to be more seasoned imo)</p>
              <p>Rafael to replace Gary (Maybe still too young, but boy I love his energy. Maybe it's Wes's time.)</p>
              <p>Anderson to replace Scholes (Possible, the fellow is not bad, he just need more playtime to be more seasoned imo, there's also Carrick.)</p>
              <p>Park or Nani to replace Giggs (I hope SAF go and buy Silva instead though. Park is good, but he is just a workhorse imo. Nani for all the hype, yet to deliver though it may change with him getting more playtime and thus more confidence?)</p>
              <p>Fletcher to be the next Keano (Though if OwenH is fit, Fletcher will be back warming the bench in a heartbeat. But if Fletcher keep up with the kind of performances he shown last season, I won't bet against him making the DCM his permanently.)</p>
              <p>Valencia to replace CR (But apparently not many of us think he is up to the task, I for one, prefer SAF to convince Tevez to stay and take over CR's spot on the attacking RW instead.)</p>
              <p>I really hope SAF buy Villa too, he will be a bigger attacking threat as compared to Berba imo. And Berba can be the new Backup striker!</p>
              <p>Another factor I took in my reasoning is too much changes is never good. But in this case, buying Silva and Villa (who played longside each other in Valencia) have a added benefit of 2 new superstar players who are comfortable with each other as compared to Kaka and CR who are superstars but god know if they can gel immediately at RM next season.</p>

              <p>the major hit we hope to see is Silva.. he is much better than valencia.</p>
              <p>and tevez seems gone, unless SAF can convince him with CR7 leaving, he won't get another striker.</p>
