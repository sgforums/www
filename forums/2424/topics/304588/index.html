I'm not sure what the FA would make of it though."<br><br>The use of noise and visual displays to intimidate opponents is nothing new. It is not unknown for teams to artificially raise the decibel level.<br><br>The NFL's Super Bowl-bound New England Patriots recently accused the Indianapolis Colts of pumping artificial crowd noise into the RCA Dome during key points of their AFC clash to prevent the offence hearing their quarterback Tom Brady's play-calls.<br><br>After an investigation, NFL chiefs said the allegations, refuted by the Colts, had no foundation.<br><br>But with so much at stake, Dr Bahrami has called upon Premier League chiefs to undertake further study into the possible effects of LED boards: "In order to prove or disprove the subliminal effects of the boards, a detailed academic study would be necessary, looking at how players react in different situations through the course of the game," he added.<br><br>"The Premier League may then wish to consider its conclusions."</div>
