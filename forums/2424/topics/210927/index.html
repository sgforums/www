            <div class='col-md body'>Gary Neville says United need to regroup and embark on another winning run after suffering their first defeat of the season against Arsenal.<br><br>A run of four straight domestic wins came to an end courtesy of Emmanuel Adebayor's late strike, and club captain Neville wants his side to bounce back quickly.<br><br>"We've got to make sure we don't get too downhearted about today," Neville told MUTV. "We've had a tough week and we've now got to recover tomorrow, Tuesday and Wednesday and then look forward to Reading.<br><br>"We've got to win the next match. You've got to make sure when you've lost at this club that you recover quickly and go back on another run."<br><br>The Reds took maximum points from games against Tottenham and Celtic earlier this week, but Neville admits they were founding wanting at the final hurdle of a tricky period.<br><br>He said: "We knew we had three big games this week and we wanted to win all three. We failed at the last one today.<br><br>"We looked tired for some reason. Arsenal have had the same games this week so there's no reason why we should have looked in a worse state than them, but it did look like that at times and they were fresh."<br><br>Like Sir Alex Ferguson, Neville was generous in defeat and lavished praise on Arsene Wenger's side.<br><br>He said: "I think today we can't complain. We looked tired at times, didn't pass the ball well and got punished.<br><br>"We found out today that if you give the ball away in the middle of the field Arsenal are still the best at running off you and breaking quickly. We did that too many times today.<br><br>"We definitely let ourselves down with our passing. We pride ourselves on that, it's what we do all week and in every game we try to make the pitch as big as possible when we get the ball. Today our passing wasn't crisp enough, quick enough or accurate enough.<br><br>"When you've not played well and there's five minutes left you think 'a draw's not a bad result'. But we paid for our mistakes once, and once is all it needs."<br><br><a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=363994" rel="nofollow">http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&amp;newsid=363994</a></div>
