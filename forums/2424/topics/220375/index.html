            <div class='col-md body'>Ryan Giggs says he is constantly adapting his game in a bid to prolong his already illustrious career.<br><br>The Reds' winger has been in fine form so far this season as United have mounted a serious bid to knock Chelsea from their Premiership perch.<br><br>Giggs believes the experience he has garnered over the years is now playing a key role in helping him stay young.<br><br>"I have been pleased with the amount of games I have played," he revealed. "I didn't expect to play so many, but I still feel fresh and we will see how many I do play.<br><br>"I have that bit more experience; the only difference is that I am not running as fast. You are more selective in your runs and more effective when you are involved in the game.<br><br>"You have to adapt," added the Welshman who will his 60th international cap in the friendly with Liechenstein on Tuesday evening. "I'm a winger and not as quick as I was 10 years ago. I will continue to adapt.<br><br>"But I can't see myself going on as long as Teddy Sheringham. That is an unbelievable achievement to still be playing in the Premiership at 41. That is something special, and I can't see myself doing that."<br><br>Giggs, who turns 33 later this month, also insists he is gaining more enjoyment from his football than ever before.<br><br>more so than when I was younger," he explained. "Maybe once you can see the end you make sure you enjoy it a bit more. When you are 21 you think it will go on for ever. It doesn't. So now you relax and try to play off the cuff.<br><br>"Teams do change," he adds. "The manager consciously wanted to bring the average age of the squad down with big signings like Ronaldo and Rooney.<br><br>"But you realise there is a need for a mix, people like Gary Neville and I who have been there for a long time.<br><br>"If you keep performing, no matter how old you are, he is going to pick you. He's always done that. If I keep performing I believe the manager will keep picking me."<br><br><a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=379234" rel="nofollow">http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&amp;newsid=379234</a></div>
