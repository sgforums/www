United may struggle to win, but a win nevertheless. anything other than a win and if arsenal were to win and united were to draw, arsenal may go level on points with united, but united goal difference is better than arsenal. 3 April is a crucial game for both united and chelsea. chelsea will need to beat united at Old Trafford. if united can beat chelsea at home, it can once and for all spell the kiss of death for chelsea title aspirations this season.</p></div>

              <p><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Wayne Rooney" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/wayne-rooney"><span style="color: #005689;">Wayne Rooney</span></a> should be fit to lead <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester United" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united"><span style="color: #005689;">Manchester United</span></a>'s title challenge at Bolton Wanderers this weekend, despite concerns the striker suffered an injury in the defeat of Liverpool.</p>
              <p>The England international limped away from Old Trafford on Sunday having scored his 33rd goal of a remarkable campaign in <a title="the 2-1 victory over Rafael Benítez's team" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2010/mar/21/manchester-united-liverpool-premier-league"><span style="color: #005689;">the 2-1 victory over Rafael Benítez's team</span></a>. United have not confirmed the nature of Rooney's problem but the 24-year-old, who missed the <a title="1-0 win at Wolverhampton Wanderers" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2010/mar/08/wolves-manchester-united-premier-league"><span style="color: #005689;">1-0 win at Wolverhampton Wanderers</span></a> this month with a knee injury, was not among those players who reported for treatment at the club's Carrington complex today.</p>
              <p>Only United's injured contingent were expected at the training ground, with the rest of the first-team squad given the day off, and Rooney's non-appearance has eased fears that he aggravated or sustained a problem during a typically hardâ€‘fought clash with Liverpool.</p>
              <p>Rooney suffered inflamed tendons in a kneecap following England's friendly against Egypt on 3 March, when his 86-minute appearance at Wembley prompted Sir Alex Ferguson to suggest the striker's determination to play had contributed to the injury and subsequent absence at Molineux. Sunday marked the striker's 45th game this season, with the demands of the <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Premier League" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague"><span style="color: #005689;">Premier League</span></a> title race, Champions League and a World Cup to come.</p>
              <p>Michael Owen, meanwhile, has admitted he has no chance of featuring this season but remains committed to his contract despite the frustrations of his first season in Manchester.</p>
              <p>Owen, who suffered a detached hamstring in the Carling Cup final victory over Aston Villa, also revealed he has an option for a third season at United as part of his free transfer from Newcastle United last summer.</p>
              <p>The 30-year-old said: "I had the operation two weeks ago, so I'm going to be on crutches for six weeks now. I'm not allowed to do anything on it for six weeks, so I am definitely out for the season. I'm just looking to next season now. And I'll be back in a United jersey.</p>
              <p>"I've got another year left on my contract here and have the option of a third as well. I've had a great time here and I am really looking forward to being back next season."</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Rio Ferdinand" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/rio-ferdinand"><span style="color: #005689;">Rio Ferdinand</span></a> has stressed his side's enthusiasm for the pressure of the Premier League title chase. "This is probably the best title run-in for years," said the England captain. "There are three teams in it, which makes it fantastic for the fans and the neutrals to watch."</p>

              <h2>GARY CAHILL: I`M READY TO RETURN</h2>
              <div id="printsaveline">
              <div><img id="articleImage" src="http://images.football365.com/10/01/240/Bolton-v-Sheff-Utd-Gary-Cahill-Henri-Camara_2410621.jpg" border="0" alt="Gary Cahill - has proved his fitness."><br></div>
              <div><br></div>

              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Gary Cahill has declared himself ready for action after fearing for his long-term future. The central defender could now be pitched into Bolton's showdown with league leaders Manchester United at the Reebok Stadium on Saturday. </strong></p>
              <p>That would be Cahill's first senior appearance since January 30 as he has spent the last two months recovering from a blood clot that led to him undergoing surgery to remove a section of a rib.</p>
              <p>"It came as a total shock to me and, at first, I feared the worst and thought it was going to be long term," Cahill told the Bolton News.</p>
              <p>"But I've come back a lot earlier and quicker than some people thought, and it's good to be back."</p>
              <p>After coming through 90 minutes in the reserves on Monday, Cahill added: "You would have to ask the gaffer, but I'd like to think that's me finished in the reserves.</p>
              <p>"I've proved I'm fit to play 90 minutes and that was a big thing, so this weekend I'm available for selection."</p>
              <p>Fellow defender Zat Knight, meanwhile, is convinced Bolton can put a spanner in the works of United's championship charge.</p>
              <p>Wanderers head into the game on the back of an impressive recent home run that has seen them take 10 points from the last 12 at the Reebok Stadium where they have kept four successive clean sheets.</p>
              <p>Towering centre-back Knight believes Bolton can build on that, despite facing a United side going for their fourth consecutive title.</p>
              <p>"It's going to be a tough game, but our home form has served us well in the last few months," said Knight.</p>
              <p>"Anything you get against Manchester United is still a good result at home.</p>
              <p>"On the road, it's hard, but any time you have a game at home then you expect to get something from it."</p>

              <p><strong>We're going for goals</strong></p>
              <div id="news05LeftStory">
              <p><strong>In theory the team with the most points come 9 May will be crowned champions, but Sir Alex Ferguson admits he would not be surprised if the destiny of the Barclays Premier League title was decided by goal difference.</strong></p>
              <p>Just three points separate United, Chelsea and Arsenal at the top of the table, with United and Chelsea locked on +47 apiece on goal difference.</p>
              <p>The Gunners are seven behind on +40, but as Chelsea proved this week with their 5-0 thumping of Portsmouth, it only takes one game to turn things around in the goal stakes.</p>
              <p>"Chelsea’s win the other night has brought them level with us on goal difference and goals could be important,” insisted Sir Alex.</p>
              <p>"I've said that a few times over the years but I just have a feeling I’m going to be right this time. We’ve always been in a strong position with goal difference over the years, but it’s very tight this time.</p>
              <p>“The only way to solve it from our perspective is to win our games starting with Bolton on Saturday.”</p>
              <p>Many believe Arsene Wenger’s side have an advantage with their fixtures over the coming few weeks,</p>
              <div id="news05LeftStory">
              <p>but Sir Alex isn’t so sure.</p>
              <p>“On paper they have the easier run-in, but at this time of the season I’m not sure that theory works or means anything,” he said.</p>
              <p>“You can drop points anywhere as Chelsea did at Blackburn and your advantage on paper all of a sudden doesn’t look so good.</p>
              <p>“I don’t think you can say with certainty you’d be confident going anywhere at this time of the season and winning.</p>
              <p>"We just have to rely on our experience and hopefully we can keep a relatively clean bill of health between now and the end of the season.</p>
              <p>“The name of the game is to win your games and hopefully we can do that. That’s our best way of looking forward.”</p>

              <p>Match Pack: Bolton</p>
              <p><em>With Chelsea and Arsenal potentially moving ahead of the Reds in their 3 o'clock kick-offs on Saturday, United must keep up the pace in the tea-time start at Bolton...</em><br><br><strong>Form guide</strong>: Bolton are now pretty much safe from relegation, and look much more steady under Owen Coyle. Their form overall remains a little erratic. Their last four games have yielded a 2-1 win at West Ham, a 4-0 loss at Sunderland, a 4-0 win against Wigan, and a 2-0 defeat to Everton. But at home they have proved very difficult to beat this year. United, on the other hand, have lost just once in the last 13 in all competitions, scoring 35 goals.<br><br><strong>Ins and outs</strong>: Wayne Rooney is fit to play - although could he be rested, with Chelsea and Bayern Munich ties to follow? United are without long-term absentees Wes Brown (metatarsal), Michael Owen (hamstring), Anderson (knee) and John O'Shea (thigh), while Owen Hargreaves continues his rehab from double knee surgery. Out for Bolton are Chris Basham (knee), Gavin McCann (ankle), Sean Davis (ankle) and Joey O'Brien (knee).</p>
              <p><strong>Star men</strong>: Kevin Davies is a handful, and Chung-yong Lee and Jack Wilshere are technically gifted, but keeper Jussi Jaaskelainen is likely to be the key man against United.<br><br><strong>Manager</strong>: Owen Coyle (did you know his middle name is Columba?) has steered Bolton into a safe position in the league. He's got the Trotters organised in defence and playing some decent football at times. He's also made the Reebok Stadium a fortress, losing only once there in his reign - his first game in charge, a 2-0 defeat to Arsenal. "We are in terrific form at the Reebok and if we show our spirit and desire and our undoubted quality, then that will serve us well," he says.<br><br><strong>Referee</strong>: Martin Atkinson has taken charge of three United games this season - 4-3 home win over City, 0-1 defeat at Chelsea in November, 0-1 loss to Aston Villa at Old Trafford.<br><br><strong>Rivals watch</strong>: Chelsea v Aston Villa; Birmingham v Arsenal (both Saturday 15:00 GMT).</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">DIMITAR BERBATOV put United back on top by proving there is life without Wayne Rooney. </h2>
              <p class="article">Jlloyd Samuel's bizarre own-goal opener broke Bolton's resistance early on. Then lone striker Dimitar Berbatov's double and substitute Darron Gibson's simple late finish put United a point clear of Chelsea and four above third-placed Arsenal.</p>
              <p class="article">Berbatov's poaching rewarded boss Alex Ferguson's gamble to leave 30-goal Rooney completely out of the squad. But Ryan Giggs was just as influential. </p>
              <p class="article">The fit-again veteran swept the 11th minute cross from which Samuel planted a firm 15-yarder into the bottom corner past his own keeper Jussi Jaaskelainen. </p>
              <p class="article">Then, after United weathered Bolton's best spell, Giggs slipped a clever pass for Darren Fletcher, whose fierce shot parried poorly by Jaaskelainen for Berbatov to tuck home on 69 minutes. </p>
              <p class="article">Nani's solo run teed up Berbatov's second goal nine minutes later. And Gibson slotted home in the 82nd minute when beleaguered Bolton once again saw their defence opened up with ease. </p>
              <p class="article">Boss Alex Ferguson admitted he would have fielded both Rooney (bruised foot) and Rio Ferdinand (groin injury) had United's need been more dire. And Bolton were certainly unlucky to lose so heavily.</p>
              <p class="article">Aside from United's freak goal, Bolton had the best chances of a first half that ended on a pretty sour note. Jack Wilshere's superb through-ball to Johan Elmander allowed the Swede to bring an excellent low save out of Edwin van der Sar. </p>
              <p class="article">Within a minute of Samuel's mishap, the veteran Dutchman did even better to tip Fabrice Muamba's goalbound effort over after the excellent Wilshere had created the opportunity. </p>
              <p class="article">Shortly afterwards, referee Martin Atkinson ruled Van der Sar was time-wasting as he went to collect a ball at a Bolton corner, then waved play on with the Dutchman still off the field. </p>
              <p class="article">The half-time whistle that eventually followed brought Atkinson a confrontation with Ferguson, who had been appalled by an earlier Sam Ricketts tackle on Patrice Evra that went unpunished. </p>
              <p class="article">Elsewhere on the pitch, Nani and Ricketts had to be separated. Tempers calmed during the interval, but there was always an edge to the contest. That only brings out the best in United centre-back Nemanja Vidic, more towering than ever in Ferdinand's absence. </p>
              <p class="article">Vidic won virtually every aerial challenge as Bolton peppered the visitors' penalty area. But, thanks to their teak-tough Serb, United held firm until play quickly switched to the other end and Jaaskelainen was unable to hold Fletcher's firm drive, allowing Berbatov to tap home. </p>
              <p class="article">Having already beaten United once this season, when he was still in charge at Burnley, Bolton chief Coyle must have known there was no chance of a repeat. </p>
              <p class="article">And this time United were not finished, Berbatov and Gibson adding flattering gloss to their victory margin.</p>
