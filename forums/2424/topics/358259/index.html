              Manchester United winger Cristiano Ronaldo is hoping to end the season in spectacular style by breaking the 30-goal barrier.
              
              Ronaldo has found the target 23 times during the 2008/09 campaign, but could have up to seven games in which to reach his target depending on the Red Devils' progress in Europe. 
              
              Sir Alex Ferguson's men hold a slender advantage in their Champions League semi-final with Arsenal after claiming a 1-0 win at Old Trafford on Wednesday. 
              
              Ronaldo was off-target that day but believes he is capable of netting in all of United's remaining fixtures as they look to end the season with four trophies - the Champions League, the Premier League, the Carling Cup and the World Club Cup. 
              
              The Portuguese superstar, and the reigning World Player of the Year, insists the prospect of landing a quadruple is spurring him on and he is determined to ensure that he plays a major part in United's quest for multiple winners' medals. 
              
              "I'm quite happy with my season so far but we've got seven games left if we get to Rome so hopefully I'll be good in those last games and maybe get to 30 goals," he said in The Sun. 
              
              "Maybe the prospect of more trophies is pushing me on. We've won quite a lot and that has given us extra confidence that we can do something again." 
              
              Ronaldo is also confident that United can go to Emirates Stadium on Tuesday for their return meeting with the Gunners and snatch a priceless away goal. 
              
              "To win 1-0 is a good result but we know we could and should have scored more goals," he said on a first leg dominated by the Red Devils. 
              
              "We created a few clear chances and didn't score from them, (Manuel) Almunia made a few great saves but I still believe we can go to Arsenal and score a goal or two."
