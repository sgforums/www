              <p>Manchester United-bound midfielder Adem Ljajic will miss Partizan Belgarde's Champions League qualifier against Rhyl at Belle Vue.</p>
              <p>The 17-year-old has been excused duty by coach Slavisa Jokanovic as he is preparing for the forthcoming European Under-19 Championships with Serbia.</p>
              <p>Ljajic was immediately loaned back to Partizan after arriving in January at Old Trafford with Zoran Tosic.</p>
              <p>While Partizan are clear favourites to progress, Jokanovic believes they need to show the Welsh side respect in this second qualifying round first leg match.</p>
              <p>He said: "I approach each game in a serious way. We have no right to underestimate any club, any country.</p>
              <p>"We have all played matches against semi-professional sides and no-one is going to give you anything."</p>

              <p>Rhyl caretaker-coach Osian Roberts is disappointed Adem Ljajic will be missing from Partizan Belgrade's line-up at Belle Vue.</p>
              <p>The Manchester United-bound midfielder has not travelled to Wales for this Champions League qualifier as he is playing for Serbia in the forthcoming European Under-19 Championships.</p>
              <p>Roberts said: "It would have been nice if he had played because our players would have liked to have faced him.</p>
              <p>"It would have been interesting and fans of Manchester United in north Wales would have liked to have seen him.</p>
              <p>"However Partizan won't be missing much in terms of quality as the technical ability throughout their squad is of a really high standard."</p>
              <p>Partizan have been building up their stamina in a mountain training camp and are overwhelming favourites to progress.</p>
              <p>Roberts added: "I would expect a few scouts as well as supporters to be out looking at Serbian players. It is a one-off opportunity to see a team like Partizan in our area.</p>
              <p>"However we like to play good football as well and get the ball on the floor. We will have a go."</p>
              <p>Partizan coach Slavisa Jokanovic believes they need to show their opponents respect.</p>
              <p>He said: "I approach each game in a serious way. We have no right to underestimate any club, any country.</p>
              <p>"We have all played matches against semi-professional sides and no-one is going to give you anything."</p>
              <p>In the Europa League, Crusaders are hoping to make it third-time lucky for the Irish League.</p>
              <p>They entertain FC Rabotnicki of Macedonia knowing Linfield and Lisburn both suffered damaging defeats when the competition began last week.</p>
              <p>Manager Stephen Baxter said: "There is a hunger about us, which is satisfying. I have been happy with our work-rate in pre-season and it would be good if we could keep the momentum going."</p>
