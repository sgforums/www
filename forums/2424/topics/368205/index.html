              <p><strong>The Heroes series continues with tributes to more football legends...<br><br>Ben Foster on Peter Schmeichel<br></strong>Peter Schmeichel was always the player I looked up to. He was a cut above the rest in his era and he changed the face of goalkeeping. I still try to model myself on him and use aspects of his game in mine. He produced some unbelievable saves - I still watch a lot of them again on You Tube. One that sticks out is the starfish jump to deny Zamorano in United's Champions League win over Inter in 1999. That moment just summed him up – he made himself unbeatable at times.<br><br><strong>Dimitar Berbatov on Ivan Berbatov, Marco van Basten, Alan Shearer <br></strong>There are three players I really looked up to when I was a kid. My father, Ivan (who played professionally for local club Pirin Blagoevgrad) taught me a lot, so I have a lot to thank him for. The others were Marco van Basten and Alan Shearer. When you hear these names - maybe not my father! [laughs] - van Basten and Shearer, you don't need to know why they were great players. They scored goals and played magnificent football. They were the best. But I didn't ever try to copy them, because you must have your own style of playing. If you start copying someone, I don't think it will be you. You must stay with what you have. They inspired me to be the best player that I could be rather than made me want to replicate everything they did. But I watched them a lot, I had many video tapes of them and all their goals. Sometimes I watch the videos just to remind me of how good they were.<br><br><strong>Darron Gibson on Roy Keane<br></strong>I'd have to say Roy Keane. Obviously he's Irish and was arguably one of the greatest midfielders in the world over the last ten years. His goal and performance against Juventus in the 1999 Champions League semi-final were just</p>
              <p>fantastic.<br><br><strong>Patrice Evra on Romario<br></strong>I didn't have a football hero when I was a child; I just loved to play the game. I never thought to myself one day I'd like to be as good or as famous as a certain player - I simply played football because I loved the game. As I got older I started to follow Romario a lot. I wouldn't say he was my hero, but he was certainly a player I got excited about watching.<br><br><strong>Edwin van der Sar on Marco van Basten<br></strong>I didn't really have a hero growing up, but the player that stood out for me as I got older was Marco van Basten. His famous volley in the Euro '88 final [against the Soviet Union] which helped clinch the European Championships for Holland is definitely my favourite moment. He was top scorer in the tournament and that goal is one of the best anyone's ever scored.<br><br><strong>Ji-sung Park on Dunga, Jung-Hwan Yoon<br></strong>When I was young I looked up to Dunga, the Brazilian, as well as Korean midfielder Jung-Hwan Yoon. As a kid I played in the same position as Dunga, so I admired him because of that. Also, it seemed like everyone around him was so confident in him – the fans, the coaching staff and all the players. If he was on the pitch, people believed the team would win. I liked the way he inspired everyone and I wanted to do the same.<br><br><strong>Darren Fletcher on Fernando Redondo<br></strong>It was Fernando Redondo. He was a brilliant central midfielder and that’s where I always played when I was growing up. He’s a player who caught my eye from a young age. I loved the way he played, how he sat in midfield and controlled the game. He sprayed passes around and was very intelligent on the ball. He was also good at breaking up opposition attacks and could be physical if necessary. I</p>
              <p>remember watching the 1994 World Cup when he played centre midfield for Argentina and he was just unbelievable. He had a great tournament and from there I followed his career at Real Madrid. He was their focal point. I remember when Madrid came to Old Trafford - it was a special moment because two of my idols – Redondo and Roy Keane – came up against each other.<br><br><strong>Federico Macheda on Marco van Basten, Zlatan Ibrahimovic<br></strong>I used to watch videos of Marco van Basten playing for Milan and I'd try to copy the things he did in games. He was always my favourite striker when I was really young growing up in Rome. He's what made me want to be a footballer and, especially, a striker. When I got a bit older I used to love watching Ibra [Zlatan Ibrahimovic]. They’re both good players and very strong on the ball. They are the type of forwards that I look up; strong and skilful. They’re two of the best strikers ever in my opinion.</p>
