              <h1 class="h2">Sir Alex takes revenge on Preston</h1>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson
               has exacted some form of family revenge on Preston North End by calling
               back Manchester United's loanees from the club that sacked his son 
              Darren this week.</p>
              <p>United youngsters Joshua King and Ritchie de Laet have been recalled 
              from Deepdale with immediate effect while a request has also been put in
               for Preston to release Matty James "as soon as possible".</p>
              <p>Preston
               chairman Maurice Lindsay said: "It's come as a shock to us and a big 
              blow. Ritchie and Joshua won't be available because we got a message 
              from Manchester United that they've been summoned back immediately. They
               would like Matty back as well but his contract is a little different."</p>
              <p>Championship
               cellar-dwellers Preston removed Darren Ferguson on Wednesday, elevating
               coach David Unsworth to the manager's position as a short-term 
              solution.</p>
              <p>"What a baptism of fire for David Unsworth, to be told 
              within half-an-hour in the job that two or three of your best players 
              have been summoned back," Lindsay said.</p>
              <p>Ferguson Snr is reportedly
               furious at his son's sacking, despite Preston's lowly position 
              seemingly justifying the change in direction for the club.</p>
              <p>Lindsay
               added: "I was hoping this would never occur but when we're approaching 
              the new year bottom of the league and with the future of the club itself
               in serious jeopardy if we are relegated, there clearly had to be some 
              soul-searching and we had to tell Darren that for the sake of the club 
              we needed a new manager. I went to his house for the sad task of talking
               to him and he was very dignified."</p>

              <h2>EXCLUSIVE</h2>
              <p><strong>Preston suffered further misery in the wake of Darren Ferguson's sacking today  when they lost two more loan players ahead of schedule.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail </span>revealed how <span style="color: #000000;">Manchester United </span>manager Sir Alex Ferguson reacted furiously to his son's dismissal by demanding the recall of loanees Ritchie de Laet, Josh King and Matty James.</p>
              <p>Now shellshocked caretaker boss David Unsworth has had his Preston squad further depleted after Ferguson's close friend Tony Pulis ordered on-loan pair Michael Tonge and Danny Pugh back to <span style="color: #000000;">Stoke</span><span style="color: #000000;">.</span></p>
              <p>Midfielders Tonge and Pugh had played key roles for Preston, since arriving at Deepdale in the middle of November, and only recently agreed to extend their stay until January 16.</p>
              <p>But both have had their loan spell cut short after Stoke boss Pulis intervened and followed Ferguson's lead in recalling them early.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">Tonge and Pugh are both Manchester-born and both launched their careers at Old Trafford before being released by Ferguson.</p>
              </div>
              <p>Tonge, once a target for Liverpool during his Sheffield United days, is a highly skilled attacking midfielder, while Pugh's contract at Stoke was extended to 2013 shortly before Christmas.</p>
              <p>After losing his Old Trafford trio, just as he was planning to involve them in the Bank Holiday double header against Derby and Crystal Palace, temporary boss Unsworth now has his work cut out, trying to steer Preston away from the foot of the npower Championship, in the wake of his latest stunning setback.</p>
