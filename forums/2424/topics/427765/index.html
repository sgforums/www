              <p><br>soccernet's is yesterday's news denying to Tue's (12/4) report... This is today's (14/4) news... Latest, probably someone found out something which no one is confirming just yet...</p>
              <p>This latest one only reveal they have agreed, between clubs but the player and nothing has been sign yet that's all...</p>
              <p>But agreement between clubs is already something very much in the final stages of a deal already...</p>
              <p>Though nothing is being confirm for reasons that only United knows... Maybe they scare someone comes along and offer more money with it's not sign yet? lol.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I am still not sure about this guy... I find he is too young to be United's no.1...</p>

              <p>Peter Schmeichel hopes <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/84774/Manuel-Neuer"><span style="color: #225fb2;">Manuel Neuer</span></a> will reassess his reported decision to choose Bayern Munich over Manchester United when he appears at Old Trafford next week.</p>
              <p>Neuer produced a superb performance despite Schalke's 2-0 defeat in the first leg of the Champions League semi-final on Tuesday night and was given a warm handshake by <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=30"><span style="color: #225fb2;">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></a> after the match.</p>
              <p>However, Ferguson subsequently said that he suspected Neuer, a reported long-term target for United, would be signing for Bayern having already disclosed he would not be signing a new contract at Schalke. On Wednesday, Bayern also confirmed their interest in the player.</p>
              <p>Though it is believed Neuer is destined for the Allianz Arena in the summer, former United hero Schmeichel is clinging to the hope that the grandiose surrounds of Old Trafford and a warm reception from the the club's faithful will change the Germany international's mind.</p>
              <p>"Maybe he (Neuer) will have another think," Schmeichel told <em>Sky Sports News</em>. "He's seen what Manchester United are capable of first hand. He's going to Old Trafford on Tuesday and it's just such a special place to play.</p>
              <p>"He will probably experience, if nothing happens within that week, an Old Trafford crowd that absolutely welcomes him and sees him as the next goalkeeper for United.</p>
              <p>"If Alex Ferguson comes over to you and says, 'Listen, I want you to play for my team', it's very difficult not to say 'yes'. He (Neuer) is probably the best goalkeeper in the world.</p>
              <p>"He is 25 years of age. He's been captain for that team for a number of years. He is very mature in the way he plays. He doesn't make mistakes - I haven't seen him make a single mistake - and the way he played yesterday, he wasn't lucky in the way that he saved the shots and one-on-ones, it was very calculated.</p>
              <p>"I just thought his overall game was fantastic and absolutely well-suited for Manchester United."</p>

              <p><span><strong>Holland goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg has admitted he would be "insane" if he did not want to play for Manchester United, but insists the only offer he currently has on the table is to stay at Ajax.</strong></span> </p>
              <p>With Edwin van der Sar due to retire at the end of the season, the man who replaced him in the Dutch national team has been strongly linked with a move to Old Trafford. </p>
              <p>After celebrating claiming the Eredivisie title with Ajax on Sunday - during which he echoed Sergio Ramos by dropping the trophy - Stekelenburg said he is considering a new contract offer from the Amsterdammers, but admitted he would like to hear from United. </p>
              <p>"I have received a fantastic offer from Ajax which is under consideration," he told NUsport magazine. </p>
              <p>"There has been nothing else, zero. Maybe because I have been injured."</p>
              <p>But he added: "Anybody who does not want to play for Manchester United would be insane." </p>
              <p>Stekelenburg has one year left to run on his contract at the Amsterdam ArenA, but says he is in no rush to finalise his future as he waits to see if other offers materialise. </p>
              <p>"I wanted to see how things develop," he said. "Nothing has happened, so I will talk with Ajax. I have had a fantastic time here and I have great respect for the board. </p>
              <p>"I have always been treated very well. They have made a fantastic offer, and a second meeting is scheduled. But it has to do with whether anything else might come my way."</p>

              <p>From the way some of the words coming out and how confident Gills spoke about it only recently, I am afraid this deal is done already... And perhaps for sometime also only they are not announcing it just yet preferring to wait until after all the league matches are over on both sides...</p>
              <p>Otherwise since Jan, Neuer and Reina were very interested but since April both have changed their minds probably they already know something about it from agents... Now Neuer saying he wants to stay in Germany, Reina saying he wants to stay at Pool kind of stuff...</p>
              <p>I still think he is too young to come and be the no.1 at United. Not sure if he has the mental side of it to meet the challenge as well. I also find Maarten Stekelenburg a safer option... I think getting a dutch is also better than getting a Spaniard. Cos lots of Spanish players got problem settling in England... The food lah, the culture lah, the traffic lah or the weather lah... All sorts of nonsence reasons they give when they want to go... And also, if they do well after a few years, there is this possibility that Real or Barce will come knocking and they may want to go back to sunnier Spain after they had their experienced in England.</p>
              <p>Let's hope I am wrong loh...</p>

I do hope utd go for someone older......keepers go thru ups and downs in their lives. Some bounce back while others don't. When VDS made that howler against sunderland this season, he recovered so strongly that a mistake like that never happened again. How do we get that? Mental strength and it comes with age.</p></div>

              <p>Respected football journalist Guillem Balague made the declaration on his official website on Tuesday, adding that United could make the announcement of the signing of the 20-year-old on Monday.</p>
              <p>“Atletico Madrid goalkeeper David de Gea has decided to sign for Manchester United following the agreement of a £17 (€19.5) million deal between the two clubs,” he explained. “The fee was agreed around two months ago, with agent Jorge Mendes at the centre of negotiations, but the player needed time to make up his mind regarding his future.</p>
              <p>“The young keeper has risen to prominence in a very short space of time and after establishing himself as the number one choice in this, his second season in the first team at his hometown club, was unsure whether he was ready to leave the familiar surroundings of home and move to the Premier League so early in his career.</p>
              <p>“However, de Gea has now told his team-mates at Atletico that is leaving to join Manchester United and that his parents and girlfriend will be joining him in England.”</p>
              <p>He continued: “An official announcement could be made on Monday, but a delay is possible while the player resolves a contractual issue with his agents.”</p>
              <p>The journalist further added on Sky Sports programme ‘Revista de la Liga’ that De Gea will take his parents and girlfriend with him to Manchester and that he is currently in the process of having his ties with current agent Hector Rincon terminated.</p>
              <p>Last week <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Goal</strong> revealed that United were set to secure the services of De Gea in the subsequent two weeks.</span></span> The young Spaniard will replace the retiring Edwin van der Sar.</p>
              <p>The news of De Gea’s departure to England comes just a day after Atletico striker Sergio Aguero declared that he wants to leave in the summer and has asked the club to consider bids that come for him.</p>
              <p>Fellow forward Diego Forlan too could be on his way out of the Vicente Calderon, as Al Wasl, who recently appointed Diego Maradona as their coach, are interested in the Uruguayan.</p>

              <p>The Spanish youngster, 21, is widely regarded as one of the top goalkeeping prospects in world football, having established himself as Atletico’s number one for the past two seasons. </p>
              <p>"We've been working on it for quite a while, we identified him a while back as one we should go for," Ferguson told SkySports on Tuesday. </p>

              <p><strong>Atletico Madrid goalkeeper David de Gea has reportedly denied that he has agreed to sign for Manchester United - and said that he could yet pen a new contract with his current club.</strong></p>
              <p>Manchester United revealed earlier this week that they had moved for De Gea as the replacement for the retiring Edwin van der Sar, with manager Sir Alex Ferguson confirming that they hoped to formally announce the transfer early next week.</p>
              <p>But now the 20-year-old is said to have released at statement through his lawyer to Spanish news agency <em>EFE</em>, insisting that he will make no decision on his future until after the European Under-21 Championships. Spain play England in the group stages of the competition, with the final due to take place at the end of June.</p>
              <p>The statement from De Gea, released by lawyer Jose Bouzas Aragon, read: "I hereby deny information that appeared in various media today indicating that David de Gea Quintana, football player of Club Atletico de Madrid, has signed for Manchester United. It is not true that he has been signed.</p>
              <p>"De Gea will not consider the contract extension offer from Atletico or any other offer until June 30 when he has finished his commitments with the Under-21 national team.''</p>
              <p>Atletico have already denied any deal is in place with the Premier League club with Enrique Cerezo, the Atletico president, telling Spanish radio station <em>Cadena Ser</em>: "We don't know anything. Officially neither Manchester [United] or the player at this moment have informed us of anything.</p>
              <p>"He [De Gea] knows very well that he can negotiate [with other clubs] but always that they have to pay his buy-out clause."</p>
              <p>It was reported that United had agreed to pay £17 million for De Gea, who was part of the Spain squad which won the 2007 European Under-17 Championship but has yet to win his first full cap being behind both Iker Casillas and Pepe Reina.</p>
