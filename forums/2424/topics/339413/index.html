              <p><strong>Roy Keane is on the brink of quitting as </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Sunderland </strong></span><strong>manager. <span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail </span>understands that talks are set to take place today in an attempt to convince Keane to stay at the Stadium of Light, but the former </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span><strong> and </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Celtic </strong></span><strong>midfielder appears to have made up his mind.</strong></p>
              <p>Sunderland have endured a poor start to the season and have lost six of their last seven games to leave the club in the bottom three of the Barclays Premier League.</p>
              <p>Keane took charge in August 2006, winning the Championship title the following May and promotion to the Premier League, but he has struggled to make an impact in the top flight despite spending millions in the transfer market.</p>
              <p>Sunderland chairman Niall Quinn wants Roy Keane to end speculation over his future.<br>The manager has not been seen on Wearside since the 4-1 defeat by <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/bolton-wanderers.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Bolton </span></a>last Saturday, sparking rumours he had already quit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I feel Roy Keane is chickening out of this one? Knowing his style, he can't stand losing so better quit now before his side gets another hammering by United this time... Darren Fletcher, one of those he criticized then... could start in this match...</p>

              <h1>Sunderland players celebrate after Roy Keane resigns</h1>
              <h2>Roy Keane's shock departure as Sunderland manager sparked celebration among the players, it emerged on Thursday night.</h2>
              <p><img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/01128/roy-keane_1128005c.jpg" alt="Sunderland players celebrate after Roy Keane resigns " width="460" height="287"></p>
              <p><span class="caption"><em>Gone: Roy Keane's resignation from the position of Sunderland manager appears to have sparked celebrations among the players</em></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>"He ruled by fear," said one source close to the squad, who added that Keane's hardline management methods had alienated many at the relegation-threatened club.</strong></p>
              <p>Keane is understood to have announced his departure by sending club chairman Niall Quinn a text message. Quinn made several attempts to contact Keane to try to change his mind, but his calls and texts went unanswered.</p>
              <p>However, Quinn's fears were confirmed when Keane's London-based solicitor, Michael Kennedy, faxed a statement signed by his client to the club on Thursday at lunchtime.</p>
              <p>Keane later put out a brief statement which read: "I would like to thank my staff, players, Niall Quinn and, in particular, the fans for their support during my time at Sunderland, and I would like to wish the club every success in the future."</p>
              <p>Quinn, who is considering installing Sam Allardyce as Keane's successor, had returned from a short break in Portugal to sort out his fellow Irishman's future. But Keane has not been seen at Sunderland since last Saturday's 4-1 defeat by Bolton and he maintained his distance by staying at the family home in Cheshire, from where he has been commuting to Wearside by helicopter recently.</p>
              <p>"After the weekend, without going into too much detail, we gave him a bit of time to himself because everyone hurts after a result like that," Quinn told a media conference. "He was down and we tried to move it along, but we couldn't quite get there.</p>
              <p>"He will get a bit of time to himself now and I am sure he will recharge and get going again, and I am sure we all know the Premier League hasn't seen the last of him and he has got great things to come."</p>
              <p>Keane did not bother heading to the club's training ground to bid farewell to the players in person.</p>

              <p><strong>Sept 2006</strong>: Inspires Sunderland to a 2-1 win over Derby in his first game as manager.<br><strong>March 2007</strong>: Leaves three players behind when they are late for team bus to Barnsley.<br><strong>April 2007</strong>: Carlo Edwards scores a great winner over Burnley to put Keane on course for promotion and title.<br><strong>April 2008</strong>: Premier League survival ensured with a 3-2 win over Middlesbrough.<br><strong>Oct 2008</strong>: Sunderland fans dance in thestreet as they beat Newcastle for the first time in 25 years.<br><strong>Nov 2008</strong>: Keane says he may quit after abject 4-1 defeat by Bolton. He walks away four days later.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">ALEX FERGUSON is delighted that Carlos Tevez is jostling to play more first-team football.</h2>
              <p class="article">The Argentine has been the odd man out since Dimitar Berbatov’s arrival at Manchester United, with questions marks over whether his loan move will be made permanent in the summer. But four goals in the midweek Carling Cup defeat of Blackburn means Tevez is back in the reckoning for Premier League duty — a headache Ferguson is only too happy to have.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: “It is obvious Carlos doesn’t enjoy it. He wants to play. But do I want players who are quite happy to sit in the stand? “I have to manage that situation the best I can. I understand he wants to play. “I want to pick a team that wins. I have to be as fair as I possibly can. Performances do matter and his performance on Wednesday gives me a big problem.</p>
              <p class="article">“I have been doodling on my pad trying to see how I could fit all these players in, but one of the important parts of your team is a proper balance. I am working on that. “It was a fantastic performance from the lad on Wednesday, full of energy and aggressive running.</p>
              <p class="article">“The lad always tries and I admire him for that, even if it does not make my job any easier.”</p>

              <p>This season, lucky we have Rafael coming through cos Brown is out until new year and Neville isn't what he use to be anymore... If depend on O'Shea, die lah...</p>
              <p>Just like last season when Scholes was out for a long time and Anderson step in and performed very well like we never miss Scholes like that...</p>
              <p>Hope the Sunderland players continue their poor form and not let the new manager make them suddenly like super players for this match...</p>

              <p class="first"><strong>Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson has decided to leave out Paul Scholes following the midfielder's recent comeback from a knee injury.</strong></p>
              <p>Darren Fletcher is likely to shake off a hamstring problem in time to play.</p>
              <p>Managerless Sunderland will be without suspended midfielder Kieran Richardson at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Keeper Craig Gordon is unlikely to be involved after aggravating an ankle problem, while George McCartney (foot) remains a doubt. </p>

              <p><strong>Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson:</strong> <br>"Carlos Tevez has given me a big selection problem after he scored four goals in our last game. "I have been doodling on my pad trying to see how I could fit all these players in, but one of the important parts of your team is a proper balance. I am working on that. "It was a fantastic performance from the lad on Wednesday, full of energy and aggressive running. "The lad always tries and I admire him for that, even if it does not make my job any easier."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Sunderland caretaker boss Ricky Sbragia:</strong><br>"The players were upset after hearing that Roy Keane had left but we have a game on Saturday and we have to be focused and prepare properly. "I never thought I would be in the dugout at Manchester United managing a Sunderland team. "I don't think Sir Alex Ferguson will be worried about me, to be honest. He's a great manager and great person as well."</p>
