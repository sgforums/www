              <h2>Carlos Tevez is still on course to complete his permanent switch to
              Manchester United, despite speculation suggesting the forward has
              become increasingly frustrated with his lack of a regular starting
              berth.</h2>
              <p>The Argentina
              international has become a crowd favourite at Old Trafford since joining the
              Premier League champions from West Ham United, and he played an influential
              role in the side securing the domestic league title as well as Champions League
              glory.
               
              <br><br>However, the arrival of Dimitar Berbatov
              from Tottenham Hotspur in the summer, the red-hot form of Wayne Rooney and the
              return to fitness of Cristiano Ronaldo has seen Tevez fall down the pecking
              order.
              <br><br>Thus, reports over the last few weeks have purported that the 24-year old would
              seek a move away from The Red Devils when the transfer window re-opens in
              January, but the player’s advisor, Kia Jooraabchian, has moved quickly to dispel
              such stories.
               
              <br><br><strong>Great Relationship</strong><br><br>He said: "Carlos Tevez is not going to be sold in January. He plans to
              stay until the end of season and talk to Manchester United then.
              <br><br> "He has a great relationship with Manchester United. There have been
              absolutely no conversations with other clubs and there won't be."
              <br><br>The permanent deal is likely to cost Sir
              Alex Ferguson’s club just over £30 million, and while United splashed out a
              similar figure for Berbatov, Joorabchian insists he has word that a deal will
              be completed at the end of the current campaign.
               
              <br><br><strong>Assurances</strong><br><br> "Manchester Untied have assured us they intend to sign Carlos at the end
              of the season,” he continued.
              <br><br> "We are looking at next year, then we will start to move the situation forward.
              Carlos is happy with his position at the club. He is a Manchester United player
              for the foreseeable future.
              <br><br> "He is just concerned, for reasons he does not understand, some people
              appear to be mischief-making. Carlos has a great relationship with Sir Alex
              Ferguson and (chief executive) David Gill and he hopes that continues." 
              <br><br>The news will delight Manchester United fans already rejoicing
              at the fact that Wayne Rooney has pledged his commitment to the club
              for the rest of his career, while Cristiano Ronaldo expects to continue
              his Old Trafford stay beyond the current campaign.</p>
