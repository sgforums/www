              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>My wife doesn’t like Manchester. I’ve had offers from AC, Barca, and Madrid, but I’m staying</strong></span></p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">NEMANJA VIDIC has come through some tough battles to be regarded as one of the 
              world’s top central defenders.</h2>
              <p class="article">But, as most men can testify, the missus can be the toughest opponent of all.</p>
              <p class="article">The Serbian star has revealed how he received offers from AC Milan, Real 
              Madrid and Barcelona this summer and the wife wanted him to take one up as 
              she was unhappy with her life in Manchester.</p>
              <p class="article">Vidic, however, put his foot down.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: “My wife Ana is unhappy with our lifestyle in Manchester 
              but I am not going to change my mind as I am happy with the team and 
              Manchester and the club’s ambitions for next season.”</p>
              <p class="article">Having moved to United from Spartak Moscow it makes you wonder quite what life 
              was like in the Russian capital where a WAGs’ hairdo can crack from 
              frostbite in the winter.</p>
              <p class="article">But, hey, you just can’t please some people.</p>
              <p class="article">Vidic has certainly pleased United fans and his manager since arriving at Old 
              Trafford.</p>
              <p class="article">After losing both Cristiano Ronaldo and Carlos Tevez there was no way manager 
              Alex Ferguson wanted to see the foundation of the team’s success 
              completely disappear.</p>
              <p class="article">That is why he turned down the £26.5million offer from Barcelona and 
              gave Vidic a new three-year contract and pay rise of £20,000 a week 
              to £70,000.</p>
              <p class="article">Vidic, now Serbia’s highest-earning player, revealed: “I 
              got offers from Milan, Barcelona and Real Madrid and I played a very honest 
              game — I disclosed all these offers to my boss Sir Alex.</p>
              <p class="article">“He reacted quickly. I was told he was raising my pay to bring it to 
              the level where my reputation is in the Premier League and Europe.</p>
              <p class="article">“After Milan and Real Madrid made their offers, Barcelona came in — 
              they wanted to pay 30m for my services but after Sir Alex’s move, I 
              am definitely staying in Manchester until my contract expires in 2012.</p>
              <p class="article">“I don’t care that I will still not be paid as much as my 
              good friends Rio Ferdinand or Wayne Rooney but I guess I will be at the same 
              level as Berbatov and Carrick.”</p>
              <p class="article">He probably needs to take a closer look at Berbatov’s contract as he 
              is still a good £20,000 a week ahead on £90,000 — 
              but let’s not split hairs.</p>
              <p class="article">Vidic had an uncertain start to his United career but has been proving his 
              worth each season since he joined the club in January 2006.</p>
              <p><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v313/coolninja02/My%20Pictures/84669580.jpg"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v313/coolninja02/My%20Pictures/84669580.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="215"></a></p>
              <p class="article">He said: “People often forget that when you move from one country to 
              another and from one league to another, you have to change your playing 
              style.</p>
              <p class="article">“My style of play is now completely adjusted to the Premier League.”</p>
              <p class="article">He has made more than 150 appearances for the club but last season was 
              undoubtedly his best.</p>
              <p class="article">Vidic was the only constant in the back four as United established a 
              top-flight record of 14 consecutive clean sheets.</p>
              <p class="article">The 27-year-old said: “It’s always nice to do things like 
              this and set some new records but it’s a tribute for the whole team.</p>
              <p class="article">“It’s a great team to play in and it makes it easier for us 
              as the defenders to do our job.”</p>
              <p class="article">Vidic has also proved to be a potent force from set-plays at the other end of 
              the field, notching up 12 goals for the club.</p>
              <p class="article">All in all not a player Fergie wanted to let go and one who has won him rave 
              reviews.</p>
              <p class="article">Vidic said: “You play football to do the best you can and you try to 
              improve yourself in every game, every training session.</p>
              <p class="article">“So if people say nice things about your game, then you have to feel 
              happy.</p>
              <p class="article">“If you’re doing well and the team is flying high, then that’s 
              what you aim for.”</p>
              <p class="article">The understanding between keeper Edwin van der Sar and Vidic and the rest of 
              the back four helped United to a trophy treble last season, picking up the 
              Club World Cup, Carling Cup and Premier League.</p>
              <p class="article">Van der Sar said: “Nemanja was fantastic last year and this year 
              even more so.</p>
              <p class="article">“It’s a great understanding we have — and that 
              goes for all the defenders.</p>
              <p class="article">“You’re sure that they’ll protect you but also 
              know that if they’re in trouble they can give the ball to me and I 
              can do something with it.</p>
              <p class="article">“It helps that we have been playing together for three or four years 
              now.”</p>
              <p class="article">The only time that their understanding collapsed was in the 4-1 home Premier 
              League defeat to Liverpool and in the 2-0 Champions League final loss to 
              Barcelona.</p>
              <p class="article">Those two games were undoubtedly Vidic’s worst — but they 
              are engulfed by many more when he has proved just why the world’s 
              top clubs want his services.</p>
              <p class="article">In an otherwise disappointing summer so far, the Serb’s commitment to 
              the club is good news for United fans.</p>
              <p class="article">As for Vidic’s wife Ana, an extra £20,000 a week will surely 
              open many more doors at the Trafford Centre.</p>
