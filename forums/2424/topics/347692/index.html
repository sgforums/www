              <p>In England, more than in any other country, there is a tradition of supporters travelling <em>en masse</em> to away games.</p>
              <p>Those football fans who regularly follow their team away from home will
              be familiar with the concept of the face of a person you regularly see
              but rarely know, someone you nod at without saying hello to who reminds
              you that you're in the right place.</p>
              <p>Occasionally
              you may even give them a name so in my group of Manchester United
              matchgoers, we silently greet Dowie, The Ghost, Napalm Death and Mr
              Milky Milky. There'll be those within United's support who recognise
              the people I mean, others who won't and some who'll know them by
              another name entirely, maybe even the one their parents gave them. But
              one person who everyone could identify - usually by his surname only -
              was Mike Dobbin.</p>
              <p><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/jb2/dobbin_own275.jpg" alt="" width="275" height="200"></p>
              <p><strong>Mike Dobbin, who passed away last month, attended close to 2,000 Manchester United matches in 44 different countries.</strong></p>
              <p>Dobbin died on January 29 at the age of 61, but
              in those years he crammed in more United games than seems humanly
              possible. Born in Prestwich, Manchester in 1947, he began going to Old
              Trafford as a child and over the course of his life his remarkable
              devotion to the red cause has cemented him into United folklore.</p>
              <p>There
              are numerous anecdotes and statistics that illustrate Dobbin's loyalty,
              so here are a few. Despite moving to London to pursue a career in
              accountancy, he attended every single first-team game - competitive and
              friendly - from October 1991 until Boxing Day 2008. In all, he watched
              United on close to 2000 occasions and in 44 different countries, not
              missing a Euro away from 1965 onwards. On last summer's tour, to get to
              Nigeria from South Africa he flew via London, claiming it was cheaper
              that way, but few who knew him were surprised when he showed up at a
              reserve game at Oxford in between.</p>
              <p>Most impressive of all,
              though, and certainly my favourite piece of Dobbin-related trivia, is
              that in the Fergie era he has attended more United games than the man
              himself, Sir Alex having missed a few occasions for family reasons,
              part-timer that he is.</p>
              <p>Dobbin's loyalty wasn't just to the boys
              on the pitch. As travel secretary of United's London Fan Club, he spent
              a ridiculous number of hours arranging transport and tickets for those
              based in the area. He was particularly active during the "Red Army"
              years of the 70s and 80s when United would take thousands from the
              capital to every game, even though he didn't agree with the slightly
              mischievous philosophy of many of its members.</p>
              <p>Some may think
              that this is of no relevance to anyone who isnt a match-going United
              fan, but they'd be wrong. Every club has its Dobbin, people who
              encapsulate everything that football was once about, and still is for
              those with eyes to see.</p>
              <p>When Manchester United began life in
              1878 as Newton Heath, it wasn't as a business or a brand, but a group
              of mates kicking a ball around for fun, just the same as nearly every
              other institution in both the professional and amateur game. That's why
              the league comprises football clubs and not football teams; the point
              was that they should be groups of like-minded individuals gathered
              together for a unified purpose, of which the men selected to take the
              field were but a constituent part.</p>
              <p>Those on the pitch are
              merely transient, just passing through; incidental to the whole shebang
              when compared to those who were there before they arrived and will be
              there long after they've left. United supporters refer affectionately
              to the team as "the shirts" because ultimately it doesn't matter a
              stuff who's wearing them as long as they do so with honour and pride;
              what's important is the people and place it represents. Which is why
              Mike Dobbin is a mark one, <em>bona fide</em> red legend, woven into the fabric of the club every bit as much, if not more, than Edwards, Best, Law and Cantona.</p>
              <p>The shame is that those playing and running the game continually fail
              to realise this. Players become ever more remote, content to milk the
              adulation of the crowd for the duration of the 90 minutes, before
              insulating themselves from its members the rest of the time behind
              minders, gates and VIP areas.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile clubs have effectively
              taken on the mantle of the local drug dealer, treating
              pathetically-addicted supporters like the worst kind of crackhead,
              while hopelessly in hock to wholesaling television companies whom the
              FA are entirely unable or unwilling to police.</p>
              <p>All this means
              that the concept of accountability is exactly that - a concept - with
              the blame for exhorbitant pricing and inconvenient kick-off times
              passed around the little circle like a Chinese whisper. Nonetheless its
              members would do well to remember that ultimately there will be a
              price; not all supporters have the limitless loyalty of Mike Dobbin.</p>

              <p><strong>Until his death, Mike Dobbin had actually attended more United games than Sir Alex Ferguson (and Fred the Red).</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dear Sir, you are indeed a Red Devil. Batman salutes you for your greatness and undying support to the greatest club in the world. You will be forever remembered by your fellow Devils. May God hold the faithfully departed.</p>
