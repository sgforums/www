              <h1>Cristiano Ronaldo: I Am 'Analysed To Death'</h1>
              <p>Cristiano Ronaldo has, of course, become Manchester United's first Ballon d'Or recipient since George Best in 1968.</p>
              <p><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/45155000/jpg/_45155813_ronaldo_b282.jpg" alt="Cristiano Ronaldo" width="226" height="282"></p>
              <p>It's the ultimate fix of positive recognition, even if opinion is still split on the free-scoring Portuguese superstar.<br><br>However, speaking to <em>The Sun</em> before picking up the prestigious European Footballer of the Year gong,
                  the 23-year-old was bemoaning the downside of his superstar status.<br><br>Perhaps
                  peeved after being sent off for a strange second yellow - for a
                  calamitous hand ball - during Sunday's Manchester derby win, the
                  winger-cum-striker said: "I have come to understand that every movement
                  I make, on or off the pitch, is analysed to death.<br><br>"If I don’t
                  celebrate goals, it is because I am sad. If I talk to the public, it is
                  because I have lost my humility. My slightest gesture gets every type
                  of criticism.<br><br>"People are always waiting for me to do something
                  and they just pick on what are absolutely normal and unimportant things
                  to criticise."<br><br>He then made a dreadful attempt at trying to be humble, slipping into the third person and describing himself as 'the best'.<br><br>He added: "Cristiano Ronaldo will continue to be the same as he always was, regardless of what happens.<br><br>"People who know me well say, 'they only criticise the best'. I am damned if I do and damned if I don’t."<br><br>For
                  now, at least, Ronaldo is on top of the footballing world and, while
                  he's perched there, people will continue to watch him like vultures.<br><br>At least he didn't hear a phantom whistle and punch the Ballon d'Or, or throw it into the crowd like Didier Drogba.</p>

              <h1>Ronaldo Blames Everyone But Himself For Derby Red Card</h1>
              <p><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/45254000/jpg/_45254882_handball_getty282.jpg" alt="Ronaldo inexplicably handles the ball" width="226" height="282"></p>
              <p>It's fair to say that <a href="http://www.goal.com/en/people/portugal/1945/cristiano-ronaldo">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> probably finds it difficult to accept when things are his fault. Now,
              rather than coming clean and just admitting that he made a stupid
              mistake when he handled the ball for his second bookable offence on
              Sunday during the Manchester derby between <a href="http://www.goal.com/en/teams/england/109/manchester-city">City</a> and <a href="http://www.goal.com/en/teams/england/97/manchester-united">United</a>, he has blamed referee Howard Webb.</p>
              <p>Webb was left with no choice but to give Ronaldo his second yellow
              card after the forward somewhat bizarrely jumped and palmed the ball
              away following a United corner rather than heading it. The Portuguese
              player claims that he was actually acting 'responsibly' though.</p>
              <p>The player had received his first yellow card a few minutes earlier
              for a foul on City's Shaun Wright-Phillips, a player who was allegedly
              targeted for rough treatment by United's midfielders.</p>
              <p>"Rooney took the corner, I jumped and that was when I heard a shout
              from (Micah) Richards and simultaneously the sound of a whistle," said
              Ronaldo earlier.</p>
              <p>"At that moment I was convinced the referee had blown for a foul. I
              stopped trying to head the ball and score a goal and I grabbed the ball
              so that Richards could get help.</p>
              <p>"It never entered my mind that the referee would show me a yellow
              card because for me I had not done anything wrong. To the contrary
              after Richards yelled I thought he was hurt and needed assistance.</p>
              <p>"I heard the whistle, so I took the initiative and stopped the match."</p>
              <p>And Ronaldo was even prepared to blame the Manchester City supporters for what happened.</p>
              <p>"I understood the referee wanted to talk to me but maybe influenced
              by the fans, he put his hand in his pocket and sent me off," the player
              added.</p>
              <p>"I tried to explain what happened but he did not want to listen."</p>

              <p>if u saw the match, he was trying to tell the ref that he heard the whistle.. he did motion it to the ref.. otherwise, a bit weird right he use his hands like that? Why would he want to purposely use his hands on the ball like that knowing that he's on a yellow card smore.. He's not even trying to hit the ball into the net.. Its just seems too weird.. In fact, he could have even head the ball into the net..</p>
