            <div class='col-md body'>Sir Alex Ferguson believes his United side may need to produce its best away performance in Europe this season if the Reds are to reach the Champions League final.<br><br>United are 3-2 up against AC Milan after the first leg at Old Trafford. But, with two away goals in their favour and a formidable reputation at the San Siro, the tie is relatively evenly poised.<br><br>United have lost to Copenhagen, Celtic and AS Roma on the road in the competition this season and even the narrow 1-0 victories over Benfica and Lille will have to be improved upon, according to the United boss.<br><br>Â“We have to step up a gear,Â” urged Sir Alex.<br><br>Â“ThereÂ’s a chance that we will concede over there, so we have to score. And we will be going over there with an attitude to score.Â”<br><br>A draw would do for the Reds, but aiming for a draw is a dangerous standpoint to take, especially with the quality of opponents now a notch higher.<br><br>Â“Away from home, against Benfica and Lille, we have picked up 1-0 results without being brilliant. But we need to really play well in Milan and have a goal threat about us.Â”<br><br>Defeat in Milan two years ago ended UnitedÂ’s hopes of European glory. But with a team whose maturation has been remarkable since 2005, Sir Alex knows full well that this is a test of just how far the Reds have come.<br><br>Â“What we have got to do is crossing the line like we did against Juventus in 1999, when we needed to go there and get a result,Â” he said. Â“Milan have got a richer European history, but we have got a great history also. I think it could be any score, I really do.<br><br>Â“In the first leg, even at 2-1, I still fancied us. I thought at half time we had a chance.<br><br>Â“When you see the goals we lost, they were poor goals to concede. But we had something to cling to Â– we were creating chances. I said to the players: Â‘If youÂ’re conceding goals like that, what chance are you giving yourselves?Â’.<br><br>Â“But I thought the quality of our football in the first half was good. We were making chances and there was a momentum to our game. I felt that the longer that went on the better it would get.<br><br>Â“I wouldnÂ’t say we are favourites, but we have given ourselves a great chance,Â” added the boss. Â“A goal lead is a great start in European football. But we also have a good counter-attacking capability in our team with our speed on the break.Â”</div>

This away fixture would be the toughest but if our players play like they did in the first, we can make it through!! GO UNITED!!<br><br>^.^/<br>\^.^<br>\^.^/</div>
