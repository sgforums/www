            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Spending surprises Sir Alex<br><br>On the day Sir Alex paraded two new signings and confirmed the Reds were in talks with West Ham over striker Carlos Tevez, the United boss admitted he was surprised other Premier League clubs had so far been thrifty in their summer spending.</strong><br><br>Most reports estimate United's transfer bill will surpass the Â£70m mark if the Reds are successful in luring Tevez away from Upton Park. In contrast, Chelsea have acquired four players on free transfers, while Arsenal have generated more than they've spent after offloading Thierry Henry to Spanish giants Barcelona.<br><br>"I thought there would have been more spending," Sir Alex said at yesterday's press conference. "There's a lot of money in the Premier League at the moment, so I expected more [transfer activity].  That's one of the reasons we wanted to do things so quickly [with Nani, Anderson and Hargreaves]. That allowed me to enjoy my holiday Â– I didn't have to be on the phone to David Gill every two minutes. It was a good bit of business."<br><br>The manager also praised the Glazer family, who took over ownership of the club in May 2005.<br><br>"They've been nothing but supportive," Sir Alex said. "They've demonstrated that support by giving us a lot of money this summer and I appreciate it. I think it gives us a really strong squad this season, which was maybe our downfall last season when we just didn't have enough of a squad to handle all the competitions we were in.<br><br>"Hopefully with the addition of Owen, Nani and Anderson Â– and another signing soon Â– we'll have a promising start to the season."</div>
