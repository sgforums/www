              <p><strong> As it looks like United might at least get a substantial windfall
              should Cristiano Ronaldo leave the club, the Reds are almost certainly
              searching for a number of big-name replacements.</strong></p>
              <p>And the Euro 2008 tournament is like one big supermarket for top players.</p>
              <p>But who has caught your eye most at the tournament and who should United be priming their cheque book for?</p>

              <p>Actually, this Euro didn't bring out any nice good players that impress me very much tho... I rather United stick to their original targets like Richards, Bervatov, Valencia...</p>
              <p>Anyway, if have to pick one, i go for Spain no 17... That big striker that seem to impress me more than Arshavin... He is big and strong... good for the premiership... like Bervatov, Santa cruz and Drogba...</p>

              <p>sadly, I don't think so. Players like ronaldo are unique, and it is a sad loss if MU loses him. I too are irked by his attitude, but when MU has him, it is a different team.</p>
              <p>nani is still wet behind the ears but he has alot of potentials..</p>

              <p><br>Its not just about goal scoring or the last 2 seasons... Its his improvement that make him stand out... From 2003-04 to 07-08, his goal tallies rose as: 4, 5, 9, 17 and 31.</p>
              <p>Messi's is another great player but his impact is only mostly felt on the wing and to be more precise, mostly right-wing only... Whereas Ronny has effectively become a team's play-maker apart from its goal getter...  </p>

              <p>Well, it is true messi is more injury prone &amp; never have aerial power of Ronaldo.</p>
              <p>Do rem, Ronaldo was bought to replace another No7, a Right winger.And for first two seasons, his play was purely a winger.</p>
              <p>Only with the sale of Ruud and Saha's Injury did he managed to flourish. Cause effectively, MU is without a target man, and switches to this mobile attack of Rooney, Tevez and Ronaldo. And this is where Ronaldo soared, and hence "team"-player.</p>
              <p>@ the last meetings between Barca and MU, Messi was clearly the greater threat. he was drifting from left, right and centre. I felt he just did not have the proper support. Rem when Barca won the European Champions, Messi was superb.</p>
              <p>Despite his injury concerns, he is not built like Robben, Kewell or Giggs, in that they are slender and build for speed. Messi is stocky and reminds me of one Maradona. I think Ronaldo was less muscular when he first came, like a Nani, but has added a lot of bulk since then.</p>
              <p>As for whether he can shine in MU, one thing is for sure, if SAF treats him the way he did with Giggs,Ronaldo, he will be more productive.</p>
              <p> Well, I am not saying Ronaldo pales but just that Messi has more impact when fit.</p>

              <p>Yeah, since you agree Messi is injury prone and Ronaldo is better in terms of goal scoring and aerial powers... This more or less sums it up already...</p>
              <p>Impact players they all are... Messi, Ronny, Robben and even Giggs in his younger days. Yes, Ronaldo was bough as a winger and till the end of last season, he was still a winger most of their matches... United played with a target man last season and usually it was Rooney and when he was moved to the left, Tevez took over the striker's role... Ronaldo hardly plays in that position... His improvement as a player or goal scorer shouldn't be put down to rvn leaving or injury to Saha... Its more to do with his maturity over these last 2 yrs and his own determination to improve and succeed that got him where he is today.</p>
              <p>The meeting between Utd and Barce was a strategic affair... Fergie set out shop to defend in the first leg therefore that could explain their lack of attacking opportunities for Ronaldo to shine but despite that, he still got them a penalty.</p>
              <p>The 2nd leg was also almost the same story tho United started out attacking but they got an early goal by Scholes and decided to changed their strategy into one of defending which work out well for them... Anyway, i can't recall Messi was drifting in from the left, right and centre in that match... I only remember watching him on the right most of the time and Evra more or less had him covered and only on one occasion did he beat him but Evra got back again and it came to nothing...</p>
              <p>Another thing i remember when Barce won the CL, Messi was only a bit part player then... Ronaldinho was superb, Ludovic Giuly, Rafael Márquez, Deco and Puyol all played well... Larsson was also a great impact player... Messi didn't even played in that final... His only goal contribution was a goal in Barce's 5-0 win over <span style="color: #000000;">Panathinaikos in the group stages. So its rather a long shot to call him superb in their CL win.</span></p>

              <p>i do agree with you, but I still feel it is a matter of mindset.</p>
              <p>I still think, without a target man, MUFC evolves into a 3man attack pong with Ronaldo, Tevez and Rooney, moving and shifting.  And hence Ronaldo shines.</p>
              <p>Yes, I don't deny his own hardwork put him where he is, but then, I firmly believe even with all the hardwork and dedication, there still have to be opportunity to shine.</p>
              <p>Well, from my angle, Messi is different in what he brings to the table than Ronaldo.Hence my comment that if he is MUFC, and taken care by SAF, perhaps he can be more productive. Like Ronaldo, he was good in Sporting, but until he was given the "shine" by a master craftsman, he will just only be as good as he was.</p>
              <p>Just thinking out loud, if Messi plays such a bit part, why is he the 2nd player after ronaldinho whereas Ronaldo was 3rd in the world player?</p>
