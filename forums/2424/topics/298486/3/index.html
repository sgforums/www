            <div class='col-md body'>yes, letting simpson play was too risky, and you can see the effect of having oshea there -&gt; no more crosses for everton, thus negating cahill.<br><br>everton goal came about, when two everton players went to simpson side, and being inexperienced, it lured brown, CentreHalf to cover instead of carrick or anderson, thus making any crosses into centre, a worry.<br>True enough, with vidic guarding one, evra needs to guard the other attacker which is cahill.<br><br>Evra has always been targetting as the weak link when the ball is swing to the farpost.<br><br>However, the thing that upset me is the Gk's kicking. Comparing to how robinson of spurs was finding berba easily, our keeper is kicking stupidly.<br><br>the ref was too serious, and he gives the yellow too early which to me, kills off rooney's attack.<br><br>anyway, it was a good win..</div>

Just being tall and strong isn't enough to deal with aerial threats... Experience and composure is more important. Neville isn't very tall but he still does a decent job in the centre. Look how he dealt with that soft ball that went over his head due to his bad judgement and landed so conveniently right on Anelka's feet for him to score?<br><br>To be fair, Pique is just as inexperience as Simpson, the only difference is the centre position is a far more important part than the right back area. One mistake and possibly result in a goal.<br><br>I get real nervous when i see Pique on the starting eleven nowadays. But i also guess Fergie is just resting and rotating players at this time of the year.<br><br></div>
