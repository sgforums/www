              <p class="first"><strong>Manchester United assistant boss Carlos Queiroz has been appointed as the new coach of Portugal.</strong></p>
              <p>The 55-year-old, who had a spell in charge of Portugal in the 1990s, has signed a four-year contract.</p>
              <p>The deal with Portugal's Football Federation is believed to be worth around £1.5m.</p>
              <p>Queiroz has also previously managed Real Madrid, South Africa and the United Arab Emirates as well as Portugal's Under-20 side.
              </p>
              <p>He has had two spells with United, first coming to Old Trafford in the summer of 2002.</p>
              <p>He then spent one year in charge of Madrid before rejoining United on a one-year rolling contract in 2004.</p>
              <p>The loss of Queiroz could also further unsettle winger Cristiano Ronaldo, who has a close relationship with his compatriot.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo's future remains uncertain as Real Madrid continue to make it known they want to sign him.</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Reds agree to release Carlos</strong></span></p>
              <div class="newsStory">
              <p><strong>Manchester United have reached an
              agreement in principle with the Portuguese FA for the release of Carlos
              Queiroz from his Old Trafford contract.<br><br></strong>Sir Alex
              Ferguson's assistant has been appointed to the post of Portugal
              manager. Reacting to the news, Sir Alex and David Gill were united in
              their praise for Carlos.</p>
              <p>“Carlos is one of the best coaches in world football," Ferguson said. <br><br>"His
              attention to detail, ability to innovate and will to win have been a
              key factor to the team’s recent successes. He has played an important
              role in building and blending the exceptional squad of players at the
              club."</p>
              <p>United chief executive Gill added: "Carlos has played a
              major part in the club's recent success. I have thoroughly enjoyed
              working with him over the last few years.</p>
              <p>"His experience and
              professionalism have undoubtedly been a key factor in his securing his
              new role and everyone at Old Trafford wishes him the best of luck in
              guiding Portugal to the 2010 World Cup."<br><br>Queiroz's appointment
              as Portugal boss brings to an end his second spell at United. This
              four-year stint saw the Reds win two Barclays Premier League titles,
              the UEFA Champions League, the Carling Cup and the Community Shield.<br><br>His
              first stay at United (2002-03) also yielded a title. He then became
              Real Madrid boss, only to rejoin the Reds after one season in July 2004.</p>

              <p class="story"><strong>Whether Queiroz is still as committed to dissuading his star player from moving on remains to be seen. He certainly has his own horror story to tell, having spent one unhappy season as Real coach in 2003-04 before returning to United as Ferguson's No 2.</strong></p>
              <p class="story">After four successful years at Old Trafford, he admits leaving is a wrench, despite feeling the time is again right to strike out on his own.</p>
              <p class="story">"It is with a very heavy heart that I leave the greatest football club in the world," said Queiroz, who will take full responsibility for all aspects of Portugal's national teams, including oversight of the youth teams.</p>
              <p class="story">"This has been a special period in my life both personally and professionally. "To Sir Alex, I thank him for his faith in me and his knowledge, spirit and desire from which I will take strength and have confidence in my new role."</p>
              <p class="story">Ferguson was full of praise for his departing assistant, adding: "Carlos is one of the best coaches in world football. "His attention to detail, ability to innovate and will to win have been a key factor to the team's recent successes. He has played an important role in building and blending the exceptional squad of players at the club."</p>
              <p class="story">FPF president Gilbert Madail expressed his gratitude to United for releasing Queiroz from his contract, saying: "I also want to recognise the co-operation of Manchester United from the beginning of this process."</p>
              <p class="story">Queiroz, who is to be presented to the media on Wednesday, added that his first priority will be qualification for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. Ferguson must now decide who to appoint as replacement for the highly-rated Portuguese coach.</p>
              <p class="story">Former United players Mike Phelan and Brian McClair are already on the coaching staff at Old Trafford, as is Dutchman Rene Meulensteen, and they could take on extra responsibility in the short-term.</p>
              <p class="story">Other candidates include Bordeaux coach Laurent Blanc, the former France defender who spent two seasons with United at the end of his career, and Pako Ayesteran, Rafael Benitez's former No 2 at Liverpool.</p>

              <p>true, but at least SAF got a few games to get it right.. I am unsure how many games he have to get it right?</p>
