            <div class='col-md body'>http://football.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/0,,1994591,00.html<br><br>Food for thoughts, read this portion-&gt;<br><br>"The purchase of Hargreaves, which seems certain to happen at some stage, would fill the one obvious gap in United's squad - they have no quality cover for the central-midfield pairing of Carrick and Paul Scholes - although how he would fit into the first XI is not immediately clear.<br><br>United's success this season has been built around a slick, aggressive midfield four whose excellent ball retention has reduced the need for a classical defensive midfielder. Hargreaves would fill that role but, by his own admission, his is a fetch-and-carry job and his inclusion would dictate a slight change in United's approach. Ferguson, however, apparently believes he is worth it."<br><br>a lot of truth!!</div>
