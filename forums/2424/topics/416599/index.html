              <p>From the Busby Babes to Fergie's Fledglings, Manchester United is a club that has always placed great emphasis on the development of young players. While the likes of Duncan Edwards and later George Best flourished under Sir Matt, Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes did, and still do, lead Sir Alex's side with aplomb.</p>
              <p>Ferguson has continued to put his faith in young players, though a new 'golden generation' of academy talent has yet to follow in the footsteps of Giggs, Scholes and Beckham to emerge as the bedrock of the United team.</p>
              <p>The Old Trafford chief will continue a trend he first started in the mid-90s when he once again turns to the club's younger faces when United visit West Ham in the Carling Cup quarter-finals on Tuesday. But former United defender David May, who watched Fergie's Fledglings spread their wings during a nine-year stay at the club, has cast doubts over the ability of the likes of Ben Amos, Darron Gibson and Bebe to preserve United's legacy by leading the club to future glories.</p>
              <p>"I think everybody else's approach to the Carling Cup has changed more than United's, which has been the same for many years," May tells<em> ESPNsoccernet</em>. "Sir Alex has always valued the Carling Cup as an opportunity to give youth a chance. I remember Scholesy making his debut against Port Vale away in 1994 and that was the start of Fergie's Fledglings coming through. The gaffer got a lot of stick for that and he was accused of not taking the competition seriously. But it's strange how over the years, other teams have used it to give the younger lads an experience of playing competitive football."</p>
              <p>Scholes netted both goals in a 2-1 win over Vale and few players, Wayne Rooney's hat-trick against Fenerbahce in the Champions League aside, have made such an impact on their United bow. This season, the Carling Cup has provided the world with a first glimpse of Bebe, while Federico Macheda and Gabriel Obertan have also been given chances to shine. But there have been no displays that have caught the eye in such a way that a more permanent step up to first-team action would be deemed just reward.</p>
              <p>And, asked if he believes this season's Carling Cup regulars represent a bright future for United, May replied candidly: "To be truthful: no. I think they are a different breed of players now. If you look back at the lads who came through in the 90s - Butt, Giggsy, Nev, Becks and Scholesy - there is no comparison to the players who are coming through now, the likes of Macheda. I think they are good players and they will go on to forge careers in the game, but to get into the first team you have to be something special and I think it's going to be hard for them. In 12, 18 months' time I might be eating my words, but I honestly can't see them having the same impact."</p>
              <p>Too often, Macheda has been anonymous when given playing time both this season and last, but the 19-year-old's impressively-taken goal against Aston Villa two weeks ago illustrated the ability of a player who promised so much when he announced himself in such spectacular style against the same club 18 months ago. The jury is still out on fellow youngsters Obertan and Bebe, too, while United have been unable to reap the rewards of their two best-performing starlets this season, with Danny Welbeck and Tom Cleverley earning plaudits for their displays on loan at Sunderland and Wigan respectively.</p>
              <p>One player who May feels is pressing his claim to be an integral part of United's future is Chris Smalling, whose commanding displays have caught the eye of the centre-back who won seven trophies - including the 1999 Champions League - during nearly a decade at the heart of United's defence.</p>
              <p>"I think he's done brilliant, he's looking really good," said May. "Considering he's only been playing professional football for two years, I think he's been fantastic. I watched him all through pre-season and he looked a bit nervous but when he's come in to play in the Premier League and Europe he's been fantastic. I don't think he has quite ousted Jonny Evans as first-reserve for Rio [Ferdinand] and [Nemanja] Vidic yet as I think he is a great centre-half too. Jonny's let himself down a few times this season but he's admitted that and I think his future at United is nailed on. I think in the future that those two could be a fantastic defensive partnership for United."</p>
              <p>Evans' United debut came in the Carling Cup in 2007, a match in which he and fellow centre-back Gerard Pique endured a dreadful night against Coventry City striker Michael Mifsud, who scored twice in a shock 2-0 win at Old Trafford. The Northern Ireland defender has come a long way since then but while he is viewed as a worthy stand-in for Vidic and Ferdinand, Pique - whose own debut came in the Carling Cup in 2004 against Crewe - has gone on to achieve great success at Barcelona. However, May does not feel Ferguson will be losing any sleep over his decision to sell Pique.</p>
              <p>"I don't think he will have any regrets about selling Pique. Yes, he's gone on and played for Barcelona and in the World Cup final and he's done remarkably well but what the manager can take out of it is that he has nurtured him into a great player. Although he has gone on to Barcelona and won all those trophies I'm sure if you asked Gerard Pique, he would acknowledge the manager's role in helping him get there."</p>
              <p>Pique is an example of the new breed of United starlet, brought in from abroad part way through his development and Ferguson will be hoping that other young foreign imports like Macheda, Rafael and Fabio, will reach his heights - though at Old Trafford and not Camp Nou. For now, the Carling Cup will continue to provide them with an opportunity to showcase their talent.</p>
