            <div class='col-md body'>de rossi can be a little too hot headed at times. i prefer hargreaves, a more solid rock who sits deeper. paired with carrick, it might just be the english version of gattuso and pirlo. besides, didn't der kaiser say he might consider a deal?<br><br>my dream signings would be Berba, Nani/ Perdersen, Hargreaves, and Glen Johnson as cover for rightback. I wouldn't mind if Deco made the switch too.<br><br>players out would be Richardson and maybe, just maybe, Saha. Saha has fantastic pace, very valuable for fast breaks, but he's horribly fragile. We'll really have to wait and see then.</div>

Ideally, Ferguson would like Tottenham's Dimitar Berbatov in his place.<br><br>United face a struggle to snare Berbatov, one of the Premiership's star turns. Initial soundings have not yielded much encouragement, and yesterday Spurs manager Martin Jol reiterated the club's determination to hang on to him.<br><br>Chelsea are also keen on Berbatov but Jol insisted: "I have no fears. The chairman wouldn't sanction it even if I would like to sell him.<br><br>"We always keep our best players, 99 per cent over the last five or six years, even before my time.
