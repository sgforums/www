            <div class='col-md body'>Hee exciting.. Alright.. I feel we should get a few players:<br><br>1) Versatile left/right back in the age of 28+ so at least when he grow old our youngsters can fill in the gap.. Like Spector, Pique and Craig and all. I would love Carragher but too bad hahahah dreams only..<br><br>2) A Solid DM. Flethcer still needs a few more years to ripen up his technique and passing. If he can achieve mastery of these 2 attributes, I assure y'all he will be a world class player sought by many. De Rossi would be good.<br><br>3) A versatile striker who can fit in with Man U style. Look at Rooney, Ronaldo, Giggs and Solksjaer. They can play wingers too as well as strikers. Saha and Smith are good enough up front. Not to forget up and coming Rossi who needs a few more years. Pedersen would be great. Joaquin. Simao. Quaresma. Maybe Raul? Gudjohnsen would be great too. Robinho I would love to have him at United but worried that EPL might not suit him. So small.</div>
