              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Going Dutch: Stekelenburg is top of United wishlist</em></p>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Maarten Stekelenburg is Manchester United's first choice to replace his fellow Dutch goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar at Old Trafford.</strong></p>
              <p>Van der Sar, who turned 40 in October, confirmed this week he will quit at the end of the season after six years at United.</p>
              <p>And Rene Meulensteen, United's first team coach, revealed Sir Alex Ferguson has chosen £10million-rated Stekelenburg, 28, ahead of Manuel Neuer, of Schalke, and Atletico Madrid's David de Gea after asking Van der Sar for his opinion on the 6ft 5in Ajax keeper.</p>
              <p>'Stekelenburg is the keeper who is at the top of our wanted list,' Muelensteen told Dutch magazine Voetbal International. 'We talk a lot among ourselves about who should replace Van der Sar. Alex Ferguson has spoken about Stekelenburg with Edwin.'</p>
              <p>Van der Sar will sit out today's FA Cup fourth-round tie at Southampton, leaving Ferguson to choose between recalling Tomasz Kuszczak or giving a debut to Anders Lindegaard.</p>
              <p>But Lindegaard has been signed as a back-up keeper and Kuszczak will leave Old Trafford this summer. It is even possible Ferguson could sign a third keeper after assistant boss Mike Phelan confirmed United's interest in Rui Patricio, the 22-year-old from Sporting Lisbon.</p>
              <p>'We've known Rui Patricio for a long time,' said Phelan. 'He's a young keeper with enormous potential.'</p>
              <p>Ferguson paid tribute to Van der Sar yesterday, saying: 'When you get to the age of 40 and you're still playing top-level football, you know you're going to hit the wall sometime. All Edwin is doing is making sure he doesn't hit the wall while he's at United. If I was in his shoes, going out at the very top would be the thing to do.'</p>
              <p> </p>

              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/01/28/article-1351584-0CE90589000005DC-332_468x356.jpg" alt="Thirty-something: Rejuvenated Dimitar Berbatov" width="468" height="356">

              </div>
              <p><strong>Meanwhile, Ferguson has indicated that United will open negotiations over a new deal for Dimitar Berbatov, whose £100,000-a-week contract runs out in 18 months.</strong></p>
              <p>The Bulgaria striker is finally producing the form United hoped he would when he signed from Tottenham for £30.75m two-and-a-half years ago.</p>
              <p>Berbatov already has 20 goals this season and Ferguson believes the player's birthday tomorrow will not be his only 30th celebration of the season.</p>
              <p>'He's playing with great confidence and could easily get to the 30-goal mark,' said the United boss.'</p>
              <p>Ferguson will take a 'strong' squad to St Mary's as he looks to avoid a repeat of United's only defeat this season - a 4-0 Carling Cup loss at West Ham, where the manager felt his fringe players let him down. He will be without full backs Patrice Evra and Rafael.</p>

              <p>Inter Milan goalkeeper Julio Cesar has played down reports linking him with a move to Manchester United.</p>
              <p>Cesar has been linked with a possible switch to Old Trafford in the summer as a replacement for the retiring Edwin van der Sar.</p>
              <p>Speculation over Cesar's future at Inter has intensified amid rumours that Inter have lined up Bologna's Emiliano Viviano as the Brazilian's replacement at the San Siro.</p>
              <p>However, Cesar insists he remains committed to Inter and will stay until the end of his contract in 2014.</p>
              <p>"United? I never heard from anyone, and from what I know, neither have Inter," Cesar told <em>Gazzetta dello Sport</em>.</p>
              <p>"If the club has something to tell me in future then I will sit down with president Massimo Moratti and speak with him.</p>
              <p>"For me Viviano's arrival wouldn't change anything.</p>
              <p>"I don't see why I should change club when my contract expires in 2014."</p>
