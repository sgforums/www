              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson has ruled out any possibility of Ben Foster going out on loan to further his World Cup dream.</span><span><span id="intelliTXT"> </span></span></p>
              <p>With Edwin van der Sar due to return for United against Burnley and Tomasz Kuszczak establishing himself as the veteran Dutchman's deputy in the last 11 games, Foster has slipped to number three in the Old Trafford pecking order.</p>
              <p>Given he was Fabio Capello's first-choice in the last two England internationals, it is little wonder Foster has already expressed his frustration at the situation, nor that speculation is mounting the former Watford star will be allowed to leave during the current transfer window.</p>
              <p>Yet Ferguson insists that will not happen. And, without actually offering an explanation how, the United boss feels Foster can play enough matches to keep his England spot.</p>
              <p>"There is absolutely no chance of loaning Ben out, absolutely none," he said.</p>
              <p>"The World Cup is four months ahead. Let's hope he gets some football that gives him a chance.</p>
              <p>"It is Fabio's decision but Ben's qualities are going to put him forward as a definite choice and England are not endowed with great goalkeepers."</p>
              <p>On the other hand, Ferguson feels he is, especially as Kuszczak has produced some eye-catching performances of late.</p>
              <p>Yet the United manager expects Kuszczak to show an element of understanding should Van der Sar get the nod against Burnley.</p>
              <p>Initially ruled out by a knee injury picked up against Everton on November 21, Van der Sar has more recently been back home in Holland helping wife Annemarie, who collapsed before Christmas after suffering a stroke, from which she has since thankfully recovered.</p>
              <p>"I know that for a young lad like Tomasz it will be disappointing because he has been doing well," said Ferguson.</p>
              <p>"But he has to understand that bringing Edwin back is going to help him because he can only gain from watching Van der Sar.</p>
              <p>"Edwin cannot last forever, of course, and these moments should be cherished by Tomasz learning from someone like him."</p>
              <p>The decision though will be automatic providing, as expected, Van der Sar tells Ferguson he feels fit and in the right frame of mind to play what would be only his eight game of what has turned out to be a frustrating season for the 39-year-old given it started with him breaking two fingers during a pre-season friendly in Munich.</p>
              <p>"Experience is vital and Edwin has it," said Ferguson.</p>
              <p>"People point to the record of the back four last season but you have to look at Edwin.</p>
              <p>"Fourteen clean sheets is an amazing number and he is a phenomenal goalkeeper.</p>
              <p>"Bringing him back won't be a problem for me."</p>

              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson insists Carlos Tevez's form this season has not left him contemplating what could have been.</p>
              <p>The Manchester United boss did all he could over the summer to convince the Argentina international to pen a permanent deal at Old Trafford, but his efforts fell on deaf ears.</p>
              <p>Tevez made it clear that, after two years on loan at United, he was looking to take on a fresh challenge at a club who could guarantee him regular first-team football.</p>
              <p>That team happened to be Manchester City, with the ambitious Blues digging deep to snatch the 25-year-old away from their cross-city neighbours.</p>
              <p>It appears to have been money well spent, with Tevez settling quickly into life at Eastlands.</p>
              <p>He already has 15 goals to his name in all competitions this season, but Ferguson insists he has no regrets about seeing the South American star slip through his net.</p>
              <p>"What Tevez is doing now is not an issue for me," he said.</p>
              <p>"We made a pitch, he didn't take it, and he went to City. It's no problem for us, we have moved on.</p>
              <p>"It's not the end of the world for us. He's done well and so be it, but I've got no issues about it."</p>
              <p>While Ferguson insists life goes on without Tevez, the Argentinian's new team-mates feel he has quickly become an invaluable asset for City.</p>
              <p>Midfield enforcer Nigel de Jong has been impressed by Tevez's impact at Eastlands and feels he is more important to their plans than Wayne Rooney is to United's.</p>
              <p>He said: "It isn't just about the goals he is scoring at the moment. Even before that his work rate and determination for the team made him a special player for us.</p>
              <p>"Now the goals have started to come, I'd have to say that he's the best forward in the league at the moment.</p>
              <p>"Rooney is a fantastic player as well but, for me, Carlos has the edge.</p>
              <p>"I know people will think I have to say that because he is a team-mate but Carlos is on fire at the moment. I wouldn't swap him for anyone else."</p>

              <p><strong>Carling Cup presents dilemma for United</strong></p>
              <p><strong><br></strong>It's impossible to call Tuesday’s Carling Cup semi-final between City and United. City need a response following the Everton defeat, while United must perform better than they did against Burnley. They may have won, but they were awful again. There is no doubt that City will be sensing a real opportunity to swing the balance of power in Manchester in their direction. They have the finances to strengthen and improve, while United need to strengthen but don’t have the money. Sir Alex will know that United will end up with nothing this season if they continue to perform so poorly and that’s why he has a dilemma going into the City game. Does he go with the kids or does he field his best team to try to spark a return to their best form? Whichever way he goes, there is no guarantee that it will be the right solution. <br><em>Alan Hansen, Telegraph<br><br></em>Elsewhere in the papers, Oliver Kay writes in <em>The Times </em>that he believes it's "only a matter of time" before Nani is "shipped out" of Old Trafford. This despite a bright performance by the winger against Burnley.<br><br>Speaking of Burnley, most of the papers agree United's 3-0 win somewhat flattered the home side. Danny Taylor in <em>The Guardian </em>notes: "Burnley created as many chances as any other side at Old ­Trafford this season, striking the post twice as well as squandering two one-on-ones with the game goalless."<br><br>In <em>The Mirror</em>, David McDonnell has concerns over the Reds' frontline: "Their over-reliance on Rooney is dangerous and yet the reluctance – or, more likely, inability – to buy a new striker this month will not ease the burden on their star man."</p>

              <h3>SIR ALEX FERGUSON will look to his homegrown stars to provide the passion required to match Manchester City in Tuesday's Carling Cup semi-final.</h3>
              <p>The United chief accepts the match has tremendous significance for the supporters with the Old Trafford faithful delighting in reminding their neighbours of an embarrassing trophy drought.</p>
              <p>Fuelled by their new owners' cash injection, City are emerging as a real threat for honours under Roberto Mancini and a place at Wembley is in touching distance.</p>
              <p>After handing places to his youngsters earlier in the competition, Ferguson intends to stick out a side with a seam of experience and is calling on his homegrown stars to shine in the derby atmosphere.</p>
              <p>He said: "It's a fans game. It is the emotion of the fans who have supported the club all of their life, from grandfathers right through that will count.</p>
              <p>"There are a lot of emotions attached to that and you have to recognise that. There is no question of that.</p>
              <p>"And that is where the likes of the players who grew up at this club will know about it.</p>
              <p>"Giggs, Scholes, Neville and Fletcher and O'Shea. All of them grew up at the club. Wes Brown as well.</p>
              <p>"So the impact of a derby game is not lost on us. Our record over the years has been pretty good in the derby games.</p>
              <p>But you don't underestimate it. I never do. I will play particular attention to it because once you are in the semi-final, you want to be in the final.</p>
              <p>"You always feel getting anyone back to Old Trafford in a healthy position is always a big advantage to us. That is not just playing City, it is anyone. Anyone over the years has a chance in two-legged games.</p>
              <p>"So we tell the players if they do the job right in the first leg, you have a chance."</p>

              <p><span class="italic">Carlos Tevez - cupped ears gesture to the stands.</span></p>

              <p><span class="italic">
              </span></p><p>Carlos Tevez enjoyed a heated exchange with Gary Neville after inspiring Manchester City's win.</p>
              <p>Tevez scored both goals as the Blues came from behind to claim a precious 2-1 first-leg victory at Eastlands to set up the decider next Wednesday.</p>
              <p>The first, a penalty that came after Rafael needlessly tugged Craig Bellamy back just before the interval, was followed by what initially was a restrained reaction as the Argentina star raced past the United fans behind the same goal.</p>
              <p>That soon changed, though, as Tevez encountered Gary Neville warming up by the touchline.</p>
              <p>In a weekend newspaper column in Malta, Neville backed Sir Alex Ferguson's decision to let Tevez leave Old Trafford last summer despite supporters repeatedly clamouring for him to be retained on a permanent deal.</p>
              <p>A childish exchange, which seemed to involve the United captain making a one-fingered gesture at Tevez, ended with the South American using a hand signal of his own to indicate Neville should shut his mouth.</p>
              <p>"I don't know about this situation," said City boss Roberto Mancini.</p>
              <p>"I only hope that he plays the same way in the second game because he played a big game tonight."</p>
              <p>Tevez's second came after Wes Brown and Jonny Evans both went to close down Vincent Kompany and failed, meaning the former West Ham star was on his own as the Belgian hooked the ball back into the six-yard area.</p>
              <p>Tevez gleefully headed home his 17th goal of the season before repeating the cupped-ears gesture he first performed in front of the United dug-out during last season's Manchester derby at Old Trafford as the home fans sang "Fergie, sign him up".</p>
              <p>"I am very happy for Carlos," said Mancini.</p>
              <p>"He is an ex-Manchester United player so this game was very important for him. To score two goals was excellent."</p>

              <p><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Carlos Tevez" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/carlos-tevez"><span style="color: #005689;">Carlos Tevez</span></a> has accused his former <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester United" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united"><span style="color: #005689;">Manchester United</span></a> team-mate Gary Neville of being "disrespectful" for sparking their row in the <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Carling Cup" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/carlingcup"><span style="color: #005689;">Carling Cup</span></a> semi-final yesterdayby commending Sir Alex Ferguson for not signing a player whose financial demands were "too big".</p>
              <p>Tevez was so incensed by Neville's remarks he made a provocative gesture to the former England right-back after scoring the first of his two goals in <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester City" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchestercity"><span style="color: #005689;">Manchester City</span></a>'s 2-1 first-leg victory. Neville responded by flashing his middle finger and though the Football Association is unlikely to take action against him it plans to write to United, asking the club to remind their players of their responsibilities before the return leg at Old Trafford on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>"I just think Gary was very disrespectful which, to be fair, is out of character, but he didn't know the whole story of why I left Manchester United and I believe I deserved his respect," Tevez said last night. "We achieved a lot together at United, I was the second top scorer there in my first season at the club and I deserve respect from my fellow professionals."</p>
              <p>Neville, writing a column for the Times of Malta, had said of Ferguson that "he knows exactly what he's doing and understands when a player's time is up". He added that he could not "disagree with Ferguson's decision" even though United also lost their most penetrative player, Cristiano Ronaldo, last summer, and that "the manager has almost always been proved correct".</p>
              <p>Tevez said he was "hurt" by the comments but said it had inspired him to play well against United, and he defended his goal celebrations. "Football is a form of theatre and as far as I am concerned it was just a form of banter," he said.</p>
              <p>"There was nothing malicious intended whatsoever. I was not trying to incite anyone but I was entitled to say to Neville that he should have been more respectful. For the second goal I ran to the touchline and cupped my ears and looked up to the part of the ground where the United directors were sitting, and also to Ferguson in the dugout, because I wanted them to know this was my response to them saying I was not worth the money.</p>
              <p>"People from United have been speaking about me publicly and criticising me but I wanted to do my talking on the pitch because that was the best way of responding to all these people, such as Neville, who were saying United were right to let me go."</p>
              <p>Tevez has now scored 13 goals in 11 games and he added: "I'm disappointed I received so much criticism at the start of the season. What people don't realise is that I was playing with a very sore knee injury and needing injections every day."</p>

              <p>Both Fabregas and Gerrard have been plagued with injuries so we cant discount them for that but Neville? Even if he's fully fit, Fergie still puts him on the bench!</p>
              <p>Anyway, Neville never use his brain when he speaks. United are indeed making a mistake for not signing him for that fee, which is so much lesser than what we have paid for Berba. It's not hard to see this mistake when we compare the statistics.</p>

              <p>Yet Ferguson insists that will not happen. And, without actually
                                      offering an explanation how, the United boss feels Foster can play
                                      enough matches to keep his England spot.</p>
