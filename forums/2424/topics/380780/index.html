              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>He spent 12 months at the Bernabeu
              earlier in his career and Michael Owen hopes to be back there again
              next May, this time with the Reds.<br></strong><br>Last season's
              Champions League runners-up can seal qualification for the knock-out
              stages with a win over CSKA Moscow at Old Trafford on Tuesday night.<br><br>With
              doubts over the availability of Wayne Rooney and Dimitar Berbatov, Owen
              is likely to start against the Russians. Having never won the
              competition, the 29-year-old is relishing the opportunity to play his
              part in the Reds' quest for Champions League glory and is desperate to
              help his team-mates book a third consecutive final spot in Madrid next
              May.<br><br>"It’s everybody’s dream [to win the Champions League] and
              coming to a club like Manchester United you’re always competing at the
              top level," he told reporters at United's pre-match press conference.<br><br>"That's
              one of the things you look at when you’re first asked to join the club.
              It’s one of the big things that stuck in my mind – playing in big
              European games and top League games is everybody’s dream.<br><br>"It’s very difficult to win these competitions but it’s our aim to do that and it’s exciting to be part of it."<br><br>Four
              months into his United career, Owen says he feels completely at home at
              Old Trafford and is pleased with his progress to date.<br><br>"I've
              loved every minute of it. It’s been everything I expected... and more,"
              he insists. "Everybody has been so welcoming, right from the coaching
              staff, the</p>
              <div class="newsStory">
              <p>canteen ladies and the kit man, not to
              mention the lads and the fans. I’m really pleased that the fans seem to
              have taken to me and sang my name. I feel like I’ve been here many
              years even though it’s only been a few months."<br><br>Despite constant
              fears in the media over Owen's ability to remain fit, the Reds' no.7
              pointed out that he's only been unavailable once this season. That's a
              better injury record than the likes of Nemanja Vidic, Rio Ferdinand,
              Wayne Rooney and Ryan Giggs.<br><br>"United has a great structure
              behind the scenes," he explained. "The amount of staff that look after
              the players is incredible. If you want to do anything, be it weight
              sessions or yoga, it’s all catered for. You can go into any room and
              there’s a member of staff there ready to give you a programme that’s
              specific to you. <br><br>"I’ve always done extra bits and the type of
              player I’ve been – a quick player – means you’re always prone to muscle
              niggles. So I'll continue to do work off the pitch that hopefully
              limits the danger [of picking up injuries].<br><br>"Also, as you get
              older you learn more about your body. In the last Champions League game
              at home [against Wolfsburg] I came off before it was too late. If I’d
              carried on I might have done another sprint and pulled my groin and
              been out for a month."</p>
