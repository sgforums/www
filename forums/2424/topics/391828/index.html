              <p>“He got a twinge in his back yesterday morning in training,” said Ferguson. “He had been training great with no mishaps at all, but you get these twinges and you cannot take a chance. He will not be ready [to face Aston Villa] on Sunday. Unfortunately he will miss a couple of games.”</p>
              <p>That assessment all but rules Ferdinand out of the fixture at Wembley on Wednesday, the first since Fabio Capello appointed him John Terry’s successor as captain, and leaves the Italian’s defence in tatters just 100 days before England’s World Cup campaign begins in Rustenburg.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>need to find a permanent replace for rio, who has been injury prone for the last few seasons, his back. I think he cant play for more than 20 games a season now, due to his back injury. Smalling maybe recruited in part due to rio missing regularly due to his injury. But if vidic were to leave at end of the season, another defender is needed. i am wondering who fergie will go out to buy as replacement for vidic if he does leave.</p></div>

              <div class="sp-inlinePhoto">Van der Sar is Ferguson's obvious first choice and, having played in both legs of the semi-final victory over Manchester City, would be regarded as a good bet to feature at Wembley against Aston Villa on Sunday.</div>

              <div class="sp-inlinePhoto">However, the Dutch stopper has suffered two long injury-enforced absences this term and was allowed time off on compassionate leave over Christmas when his wife Annemarie suffered a stroke, allowing both his deputies long runs in the side.</div>
              <div class="sp-inlinePhoto">.</div>
              <p>Kuszczak played in the opening round against Wolves and the quarter-final victory over Tottenham, which formed part of an extended run in the side, while Ben Foster was in goal for the fourth-round triumph at Barnsley.</p>
              <p>Foster would appear to be the outsider of the three, even though he was the penalty shoot-out hero against Tottenham at Wembley last season and was also recalled for Tuesday night's victory over West Ham.</p>
              <p>"I have three good goalkeepers and I need to choose the right one,'' Ferguson said. "I gave Edwin the rest on Tuesday because he has come through quite a tough period with his injury and also his family situation.</p>
              <p>"He has not missed a game, including all the midweek ones, so this week was an opportunity to give him a rest. Now I have to consider what is the right thing to do on Sunday.''</p>

              <p><strong>Darron Gibson, a Carling Cup winner last season, sat down with ManUtd.com ahead of this year's Wembley showpiece against Aston Villa...</strong><br><br><strong>How much are you looking forward to Sunday’s final and what kind of game are you expecting?</strong><br>It’s going to be a very tough match for us because Aston Villa are playing very well at the moment. We’re all really looking forward to it - I think it’ll be a good cup final and hopefully we can win it.<br><br><strong>After starting last season’s final, you must be hoping for another chance this time round…</strong><br>I always hope to be involved. I’m not sure what the team will be, but hopefully I’ll be involved at some stage of the game.<br><br><strong>If you are involved, how much will the experience of playing at Wembley in the final last year help?</strong><br>It’ll be a big help. Last season’s final was probably the biggest game of my career and there was a lot of pressure on, but having played there last year I don’t think I’ll be as nervous this time. Last year was a great experience and hopefully that will help me if I’m involved on Sunday.<br><br><strong>You must have been pleased to get a full game under your belt against West Ham having only made a couple of substitute appearances in the last few weeks…</strong><br>Yes I was very pleased to get a run-out especially as I haven’t played too much recently. It’s always nice to get a start and playing alongside Paul Scholes was great. He’s been in really good form recently and you learn so much from him. It’s great to play alongside all the midfielders, but Scholesy has got so much experience and you pick up so many little things from him.<br><br><strong>Is there an extra determination to win on Sunday as it would be the <strong>first time in the club’s history that United have retained a cup?</strong><br>Everyone wants to win trophies and the Carling Cup has become a better competition in the last few years. The lads are all in good spirits and raring to go, and if we play well I think we’ll win.<br><br><strong>Aside from the defeat at Everton, United have been in great form of late. Why is it that the team always seems to come into form after Christmas?</strong><br>I’m not really sure and I guess if we knew why then we’d come into form before Christmas! It just seems to be what happens and it’s been the same this season - we’ve kicked on again and picked up some decent results. Hopefully we can keep that going.<br><br><strong>Villa have taken four points off United this season. Do you feel like you owe them one at Wembley?</strong><br>I wouldn’t say so. We’re just concentrating on getting the job done on Sunday and if we play the way we know we can I think we’ll be okay.<br><br><strong>Which Villa players will you be keeping a particularly close eye on?<br></strong>They’ve got some very quick players in Ashley Young and Gabby Agbonlahor, while someone like John Carew gives them a different dimension up front. He’s big and strong and a real handful. They’ve got some great young players and as a team they’re a very good unit. So they are dangerous, but I think we’re equally as dangerous, if not more so.<br><br><strong>Some people believe the new Wembley doesn’t have the same feel and magic about it as the old stadium. Do you agree?<br></strong>No, the magic hasn’t gone at all. It’s a great place to play and a cup final is always a great occasion and a great day out. Winning it obviously makes it even better and hopefully we can do the business on Sunday.</strong></p>
