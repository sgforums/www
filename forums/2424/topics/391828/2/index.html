              <p>Wah... I thought that Villa keeper a jinxed to United ovr the years was going to spoil the party again... Thanks to Roon's special goal United become the first side to retain the Carling Cup in 20 yrs... </p>

              <p><strong>Roo beauty as United retain cup</strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Wayne Rooney came off the bench to net the winner as Manchester United retained the Carling Cup with a 2-1 win over Aston Villa at Wembley.</span><span><span id="intelliTXT"> </span></span></p>
              <p>Rooney, a first-half replacement for Michael Owen, powered a header past Brad Friedel with 16 minutes to go as United claimed their fourth League Cup final success.</p>
              <p>Villa, who themselves were looking for their sixth League Cup win, had taken the lead early on through a James Milner penalty but Owen levelled for United before hobbling off.</p>
              <p>Martin O'Neill's men will probably point to the fact that Nemenja Vidic should have seen red for his part in the penalty incident, but United probably deserved to lift the silverware in a closely contested match.</p>
              <p>Villa flew out of the traps and took the lead with just five minutes on the clock, although they should also have been given a man advantage by referee Phil Dowd.</p>
              <p>Ashley Young's ball over the top for Gabriel Agbonlahor saw the England frontman outpace Vidic into the area, but the Serbian defender repeatedly tugged at Agbonhalor's shirt and eventually clipped his legs to bring him down. Dowd correctly pointed to the spot, with Milner converting emphatically from 12 yards, but should have shown Vidic a red card for being the last man - in fact he wasn't even shown a yellow!</p>
              <p>Villa's lead did not last long, however, with United hitting back seven minutes later.</p>
              <p>Richard Dunne was ponderous on the ball and was robbed by Dimitar Berbatov who broke into the box - Dunne got back to get a tackle in but the ball broke to Owen who produced an expert finish across Brad Friedel and into the far corner.</p>
              <p>Owen, who was looking bright, suffered yet more injury woe when he pulled up with what looked like a hamstring problem shortly before half-time and was replaced by the in-form Rooney.</p>
              <p>It was United who started the brighter in the second period, with Michael Carrick forcing Friedel into a smart stop to his right.</p>
              <p>But, after a decent spell of Villa pressure, Sir Alex Ferguson's men took the lead with yet another Rooney header.</p>
              <p>Man-of-the-Match Antonio Valencia and Berbatov played a neat one-two down the right, the former's cross picked out Rooney 12 yards from goal and he strained his neck muscles to send a majestic header into the top corner.</p>
              <p>It could have been 3-1 moments later when another Valencia header found Rooney again, but this time the England striker's downward header struck the foot of the post and rebounded to safety.</p>
              <p>Villa piled bodies forward in search of an equaliser but United held out to make it back-to-back Carling Cup wins.</p>

              <p><strong>Nemanja Vidic claimed ref Phil Dowd was right not to send him off as 
              Manchester United beat Aston Villa 2-1 in Sunday's Carling Cup final at Wembley. </strong></p>
              <p>Vidic hauled down Gabriel Agbonlahor inside the opening five minutes and 
              though Dowd awarded a penalty which James Milner duly converted, he didn't even 
              book Vidic for the offence.</p>
              <p>The Serbian was later booked for a foul on Agbonlahor but played the entire 
              90 minutes as United recovered to win 2-1 with goals from Michael Owen and Wayne 
              Rooney.</p>
              <p>Afterwards Vidic claimed the official had got it right, saying: "I can react 
              better but Agbonlahor did well. "I don't think it was a red card because I got in front of him, not behind. 
              If I had got behind then yes.</p>
              <p>"It's always nice to win big games but it was hard. They played with two 
              forwards but I thought we deserved it."</p>
              <p>Villa defender Richard Dunne refused to blame the decision for his side's 
              defeat. "It's very disappointing but we gave it a good go," he said. </p>
              <p>"It was a great start, that was what we wanted to do - to get in front and 
              try and hold on. But I made a mistake and after that it was tough. Unfortunately 
              it wasn't our day."</p>
              <p>On the possible sending-off, he added: "Possibly, but the game went on and it 
              was an even game all the way through.</p>
              <p>"They got a man sent off at Villa Park and it didn't make any difference. It 
              was probably better to play against 11, it made it more enjoyable." </p>

              <p>Villa's Collins also was the last man when he brought a United player down... He didn't get sent off either... So it's up to the referee to make the decision... and how serious it was.</p>

              <p><strong>Wayne Rooney led the celebrations as the Reds retained the Carling Cup at Wembley on Sunday.<br></strong><strong><br></strong>Rooney scored the winning goal which ensures the trophy stays in Manchester for another year.<br><br>“It’s a great feeling, we’re delighted," said Wayne. "I think we created the better chances in the game, but full credit to Villa, they played well today. It was a good final."<br><br>The striker has now scored 28 goals this season and is getting ever closer to matching Cristiano Ronaldo's best yield for a season of 42. But Wayne insisted, "The goal tally isn’t in my mind. If the goals come then that’s great but I’m focused more on winning medals."<br><br>United’s other goalscorer <strong>Michael Owen</strong> was chuffed at earning a first medal with United, but admitted that it was a bittersweet experience, given his withdrawal just before half-time due to a hamstring injury.<br><br>“It’s a bitter end to have limped off but it’s great that I played a big part in the win," said Owen. "Winning the cup is fantastic.”<br><br><strong>Darren Fletcher</strong> was, as ever, a driving force in the Reds’ engine room. He said the players always kept their belief despite going behind early on.<br><br>“After going a goal doing early we had to get the ball down and keep believing in ourselves. Villa are a great team on the counter attack but we showed great courage to go and get the equaliser.<br><br>“We feel sorry for Michael Owen because he went off injured but he’s scored a goal that helped us win the cup. He’s played his part and went up to get his medal with everyone else. He’s played his part in the earlier rounds too.”</p>
