            <div class='col-md body'>hes not doing so bad actually for his first season wif United. he passess better and tackles better, keeps the ball posession better than fletcher.. with the possibility of hargreaves joining up in the central midfield, everyone thinks that carrick's position is threatened, but most ppl  fails to see that hargreaves might be brought on to replace scholes in future. SAF is not thinking bout the present squad build up but also for the future replacements of all the veterans.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi there! Welcome.. No I don't think up till now I haven't seen Carrick prove his price tag.. Don't think he is even doing the behind the scenes job.. Just a string of accurate passes.. But I felt the number he is wearing deserves more work rate, aggression, hunger, cards and tenacity.. In other words, he should be getting his jersey and shorts more dirty than the other 21 players on the field..</div>

Hell even Everton and Newcastle, Tottenham has a more history than your current chelski squad.<br><br>Of course you won;t understand the significance of the past... because all you know about is the present winning team and i'm sure when the time comes and another team dominates the EPL, you'll probably hop onto the same bandwagon.<br><br>So the past doesn;t count? well 2 league title in the last two season is also in the past.. then it shouldn't count as well huh?... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One thing, can you redirect all your posts to Chelsea forums? In short, can you leave?<br><br>Chelsea is consistent, then how the hell did MUFC manage to sneak a 2pts lead over you, if your Chelsea consistenly won all the GAMES?? If you can't win all the games, meaning, some teams don't fear you, or have beaten you, how is that possible??<br><br>Let me say this for the last time, your Chelsea revolves around Roman and his money. Without him, you are nothing, till date, you are just one of his many toys. You were in the pits, ready to do a "leeds", suddenly, you hit Russian Oil, and you expect the whole EPL history to be wipe clean &amp; to be in awe of your pitiful two crowns. You think the whole EPL started in 2004?<br>You want respect but doesn't give respect. You want to be talked in the same breath as Liverpool, MUFC, Arsenal but yet, your achivements fail you. Win an European Cup, then we talk.<br>Do you think beating Barca has already won you the cup. Open your eyes, I endear you, there are many other teams out there with sharper knives waiting to carve you apart.<br><br>You think your fans having force one referee into retirement and throwing death threats is going to force the world into hiding?<br><br>Let me give you a resounding "NO".<br><br>Before I proceed, open your eyes, and see. Don't try to do a blue ketchup like ManCity, or try to paint yourself blue. Know something, while you shout yourself "blue" to be heard, no one in Stamford Bridge CARES. Not Roman, Not Terry, not even SWP who is probably doing his manicure in the dugouts.<br><br>So wake up. And before you even reply, think.<br><br>After this, I really won't reply to any of your postings for fear of being asked to apologies publicy and retract my statement, I consider that a big shame and big slap of my face.<br><br>And before I get this topic locked out,<br><br>I strongly believe that Carrick is a fanastic buy who will mature and together<br>with OwenH rule the midfield for United for many years to come.<br><br></div>

The thread is reasonable but I have given warning that if it goes out of hand it shall be locked. I'm resisting ideas to delete posts because it is the forumners views and it shall be respected if deemed reasonable.<br><br><strong>I shall warn again, even if you are rebutting please be tactful and that includes both the Red Devils and non Devils..</strong></div>
