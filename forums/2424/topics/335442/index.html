              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson has sought to reassure Carlos Tevez he remains an
              integral part of his Manchester United side despite his infrequent
              opportunities at present.</strong></p>
              <p>While the Argentina international started Wednesday night’s 2-0 home
              win over West Ham, the arrival of Dimitar Berbatov has impacted on his
              first team chances considerably and Tevez has failed to start seven of
              the 11 games since the signing of the Bulgarian.</p>
              <p>It has been suggested that Real Madrid are closely following Tevez’s
              situation given he is currently in the second year of a two-year loan,
              but United are in talks with MSI regarding a permanent deal and hopeful
              of signing the forward on a long-term basis.</p>
              <p>Ferguson is determined to keep hold of the three time South American
              Footballer of the Year and has held talks with the player to reassure
              him of his role in the title-chasing side.</p>
              <p>"I sat down with him only last week to stress that our faith in him
              is absolute, that he remains a top player in the eyes of myself, the
              players and our supporters," said Ferguson in The Guardian.</p>
              <p>"It's just that three players won't fit into two positions and my
              job is to balance the team. It could be done against certain
              opposition, but it isn't the real solution and we are doing so well I
              don't want to meddle too much.</p>
              <p>“Carlos understands this and I have explained that when the season really hots up we will need everyone.</p>
              <p>"Our attackers have been drawing all the attention, with Rooney
              having the time of his life and striking up a fine partnership with
              Berbatov. But my thoughts have probably centred on the forward who has
              been the odd man out.</p>
              <p>“I am thinking of Carlos and the fact that I have not started him in
              as many games as he would like. But Carlos remains as important as the
              guys who have been hogging the headlines."</p>
              <p>It was Cristiano Ronaldo who stole the show against West Ham on
              Wednesday night as the Portugal star scored twice at Old Trafford to
              keep United within eight points of league leaders Liverpool and with a
              game in hand.</p>
              <p>Ferguson was unhappy that his side passed up the chance to improve their goal difference in the second half though.</p>
              <p>“I wanted us to add more goals because that could be important at the end of the season,” said Ferguson.</p>
              <p>“But we took our foot off the pedal and played a couple of gears below what we were capable of. We were too relaxed for me.”</p>
