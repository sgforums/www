              <p class="caption"><strong>Ten years ago today, Teddy Sheringham's goal sparked the remarkable comeback against Bayern Munich in Barcelona</strong></p>
              </div>
              <p>I had scored in the FA Cup final four days earlier and I thought I would have a shout at starting at Camp Nou. I was quite upset when the manager told me that I wouldn't be.</p>
              <p>Bayern scored early but they kept on playing well. There is a selfish element – I wanted to play a part and I wanted to be the hero. I remember Sir Alex [Ferguson] coming up to me at half-time and saying, 'I'm going to keep it the same but make sure you are ready because if it stays like this for 10 or 15 minutes you're going to be coming on'. I didn't want our team to score in the next 10 or 15 minutes. I wanted the team to stay 1-0 down so I would have a chance to play in the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/championsleague"><span style="color: #005689;">Champions League</span></a> final.</p>
              <p>I did not realise it was so near the end until I saw Peter Schmeichel coming up for the corner, then I knew there could not be long left to play. The ball came in from Becks [David Beckham], it went to the far post and Dwight Yorke headed it back before a defender half-cleared it and it went to Giggsy [Ryan Giggs] on the edge of the box. He scuffed his right foot shot and it came my way.</p>
              <p>I knew I was onside because they had a fella on the line. Before I hit it he ran out, so when the ball came to me it looked like I was offside but I knew that I wasn't. After I'd scored I went off celebrating but I checked with the linesman to make sure he'd seen it right.</p>
              <p>A few seconds later we had another corner and Becks took it again. I went to the near post and got in front of my man but I got up a little bit early and realised I wouldn't be able to score, so I flicked it on to the far post into an area where I knew one of our players would be and Ole [Gunnar Solskjær] stuck out a leg and put it in the top of the net.</p>
              <p>It was a complete shock how we turned it around and to this day people come up to me and tell me that by the time they had finished celebrating the first goal we were celebrating the second one. People watching it in pubs were still celebrating reruns of the first goal and then were celebrating even more – some didn't know there had been a second goal, it happened that quickly.</p>
              <p>I've never celebrated on a pitch for so long, I think we must have done three or four laps of honour. We really milked the moment. We were not just celebrating the Champions League, we were celebrating the previous 11 days, winning the Premier League and the FA Cup. We chilled out in the bath after that for a while but we made up for it that night, we were still partying at seven in the morning. Without a doubt it was the most enthusiastic celebrations of my career – we were celebrating winning the Treble, so we made it one hell of a party in Barcelona.</p>
