            <div class='col-md body'>it was reported that Arsene Wenger blames the move to Emirates stadium as the main reason why their form dip so badly and Henry had also mentioned that he didn't quite felt in home playing in the new pitch....<br><br>whats your take???<br><br>for me, i'll to only to a certain extend agree that the move did unbalance the team alittle..yes just alittle IMHO, the differences in width and length will no doubt have some effect on to the playing of the team but they had also been playing in other team's pitch and did well so i guess its just a small potion that makes them what they are today..<br><br>the main reason IMHO starts with the departure of Viera, (and more started leaving after that) they've since fail to replace him, unlike Man Utd whom had the money to buy players to fill the large gap with the departure of Keane, (even thou Carrick haven't fulfilled the role yet) Arsenal hardly had much to spend since they decided to build the new stadium and by the look of it the loan that they took up to pay for the construction will probably takes a serious impact on to their transfer kitty unless someone or something happens and happen fast i think Arsenal might not be able to move up another step to match the renew pace of the EPL<br></div>

I don't think it was their choice to have a smaller field, it was just that their older place didn't have the space for it...<br><br>That could explain why they went for a bigger field rather than their previous size when they move to the new place...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yes, it makes sense.<br><br>in the old stadium, the crowd is near and in your face, and they affects the game, whereas the new one is bigger and thus alienates your support a bit.<br><br>but I think the main reason gunners is not doing well, is that they are still in transitioning.  they are performing but not finishing. given that they beat MUFC in OT, shows their potentials.<br>They are a good team, but not mature yet.<br><br>they need a RVN type of player, who can just finish, and they got that in VPersie and Ebode.<br><br>One thing about Wenger, he seldom buys wrong players.<br>I would expect them to mount a serious challenge next season.<br><br>One key factor, Gunners can play well against teams who are attacking but not teams that are defensive or even physical. This will not change as Wenger likes to play one touch, quick soccer that is more suited for light-weight players like gilberto or helb.<br></div>
