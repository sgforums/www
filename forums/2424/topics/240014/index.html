But everyoneÂ’s an international now, almost by default.<br><br>Â“ThereÂ’s a lack of quality throughout the Premiership.<br><br>Â“There are a bunch of players who seem content to just stroll along week-in, week-out.<br><br>Â“I donÂ’t think any of these fringe players come back to train in the afternoon and are determined to get in the team. I think they just accept theyÂ’re going to be part of a squad. To be a part of Manchester United is fantastic, but you need to drive yourself.Â”<br><br>Macari did not name names but Kieran Richardson, John OÂ’Shea, Wes Brown and Darren Fletcher were among those in a changed United side on Tuesday.<br><br>Despite racing into a 3-0 lead, United allowed Reading to get back to 3-2 and almost force extra time.<br><br>Clearly former Celtic and United star Macari believes the current Reds squad have got it too easy.<br><br>He said: Â“In the 70s and 80s the norm was that you worked at your game almost morning, noon and night. ThatÂ’s changed dramatically now.<br><br>Â“We used to flog ourselves and only when you got to the top did you get your reward financially.<br><br>When youÂ’re an up -and-coming player, youÂ’re trying to get into the team and past established players like I had to do when I started at Celtic.<br><br>"There were European Cup winners in front of me and the thought of ever getting into the team, I just couldnÂ’t see it happening.<br><br>Â“But I had a manager who insisted I worked and grafted, along with the likes of Kenny Dalglish and Danny McGrain.<br><br>Â“We were made to come back every afternoon and work on our deficiencies. Deficiencies that Kenny had, funnily enough, he wasnÂ’t a good goalscorer.<br><br>Â“I had no strength and no power, so I was made to come back and work.Â”<br><br>United will field a full strength side at Liverpool on Saturday with wing wonders Cristiano Ronaldo and Ryan Giggs back in action.<br><br>On-loan striker Henrik Larsson singled them out for praise as United close in on a ninth Premiership title. He said: Â“There is no doubt in my mind Cristiano Ronaldo is one of the best players around.<br><br>Â“IÂ’m enjoying playing with all the United players, but in particular it is great to be on the pitch with Ryan Giggs.<br><br>Â“HeÂ’s been around a long time and seems able to maintain the highest standards.Â”</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I for one, agrees &amp; feels that the 2nd team of MUFC seems too slack...<br><br>In short, we need some new, motivated signings who wants first team action to galvanize the whole lot or younger, hungrier players who wants to stake their claims.<br><br>Contract should be performance based and that should kick some butts.<br><br>We need to really ensure scoring against MUFC is really difficult if we want to snatch back the title.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Agree with it<br><br>They should somehow have attitude like Evra. Evra knows that he is not good when he comes into EPL, he was not on the first team. He trains hard, plays well so that he can get into the first team often like what he is now.</div>

Not saying till the 90th min but maybe the last half hr. This season they seem to be playing such that to win the game early on. I've been rather surprised by how more of Man Utd's goals seem to be coming within the first half hr this season.<br><br>I think probably it's just a strategy that the team isn't fully used to playing yet. Ferguson probably started trying to win early is because of the pressure by Chelsea who tend not to leave it late.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>slackers.Yes.1 big time slacker i think is mikael silvestre.richardson also.<br>But if u say clear them out,who r we going to replace with,somemore with ppl content to be squad players and manU doesn't has the kind of $ chelsea or pool has.The only way to solve the problem lies on fergie..motivation and some hair dryer treatment</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>and u juz compare with manu's slackers with arsenal's bunch of youngsters who gave chelsea a run of their $ in the carling cup final...Juz makes me worry...arsenal may form another invincible team again...<br>arsena;'s future is bright...but united..i'm quite worried though we r 70% sure of winning the title..<br>giggs scholes neville r old,reliable replacements not found yet.<br>And there's ronaldo,no end of rumours..we muz be prepared that he will leave any time.<br>the striking department need stregthening too.I have no idea if smith will ever have a string of 1st team appearances for united again coz he has always been a bit part fringe player in the team,not spectacular juz hardworking.Solskjaer's been great this season,his finishing i muz say is even better than our 1st choice rooney and saha..but he's 34?..<br><br>The midfield needs a revamp in the coming yrs.2 wingers.1amc.1dmc needed</div>
