              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson insists United have operated well on two levels in this summer's transfer market - in terms of the new faces and the funds used to sign them.<br><br></strong>Speaking at the unveiling of his three acquisitions, the boss declared the Reds had got "good value" in a difficult summer for player transfer fees while importing a classic United blend of youth and experience in Gabriel Obertan and Antonio Valencia (aged 20 and 23) and "old codger" Michael Owen (29).<br><br>"Everywhere in England and in Europe the players' values have shot sky high," said Sir Alex, commenting on market conditions.<br><br>"I don't think any of the transfers that you see happening are realistic but for some reason it seems to have caught fire this summer. It is a very unusual summer and difficult to get value because of that.<br><br>"It's always been the case that at Manchester United, we have to pay a bit extra. But this summer we were not prepared to do that because you have got to understand we have got some very good young players.<br><br>"There didn't need to be a kneejerk reaction to losing Cristiano Ronaldo because we did very well to keep him for six years and it was his moment to leave, and we allowed him to do that.<br><br>"We shouldn't panic because of one player leaving. I think we have a very, very good squad with some good young players in all positions."<br><br>Sir Alex added that no further arrivals are likely at United this summer, declaring, "It's the end of our business, so forget all these stories about who we are supposed to be getting."</p>
