              Ahead of Arsenal's clash at Manchester United on Saturday, Arsene Wenger feels Sir Alex Ferguson's "real hunger" for success will never die.
              
              The Gunners boss takes his side to Old Trafford on Saturday for what could well be a Premier League title party should United secure a point. 
              
              It would be a record-equalling 18th championship for United, and a an impressive 11th under the guidance of Ferguson. 
              
              Wenger's once fiery relationship with his old adversary is now much more civil than when their two sides went directly head-to-head for the game's top honours. 
              
              The Arsenal manager believes whenever the 67-year-old Scot finally does decide to call it a day - with the end of next season mooted as a possibility having originally announced his plan to retire in 2002 - he will remain a winner. 
              
              "I believe until the last day of your life, the real hunger never goes," said Wenger, whose side have not won silverware since the 2005 FA Cup. 
              
              "That is nothing to do with the number of trophies you have won or the amount of money you have made. 
              
              "You either want to win in life, or you do not want to win in life. It is as simple as that. 
              
              "It is only difficult to accept for people who do not have that drive. 
              
              "People who do have that drive, understand that the only thing which matters at the end of the day is how much you want to be successful." 
              
              Much like Arsenal, United went through a barren spell from 2003 to 2006 when they failed to land the domestic championship. 
              
              Now, United are on course for a third successive title, and last season claimed the Champions League for a second time under Ferguson, while also being crowned FIFA Club World Cup winners in December 2008. 
              
              Wenger noted: "United bounced back very well, and credit to them. 
              
              "They have bought very well and invested very well. Today, they look the best team in England - and they are. 
              
              "That is credit to Ferguson as well, but it also shows that nothing is definite, it can all turn very quickly." 
              
              Things have certainly taken a different path over the past few season for the once all-conquering Gunners, who claimed the league title with victory at Old Trafford back in May 2002, as the trophy cabinet at the impressive Emirates Stadium remains void of fresh silverware. 
              
              Wenger said: "I believe we play now more for our future because of the way we finish the season and for our pride as well because we want to give them a top class game." 
              
              Arsenal may have come up again short this season, but Wenger - who remained defiant when grilled by shareholders at a forum last night - insists there are plenty of reasons to be positive. 
              
              "I believe the group has come forward since November," said Wenger, his team now secure in fourth place. 
              
              "We have had a long unbeaten run in the Premier League, but not mature enough to win the FA Cup or the Champions League. 
              
              "There are no regrets with my commitment, certainly not. I worked harder than ever this year. 
              
              "We do with our resources as well as we can. 
              
              "If we add people, they will be with experience." 
              
              Wenger added: "I am here to produce what I can. If it is not good enough, it is not good enough. 
              
              "At the end of the day you can give as much as you can and it is down to other people to assess the situation." 
              
              Arsenal are now led by 22-year-old Cesc Fabregas. 
              
              The Spaniard spent some three months on the sidelines earlier this season, but Wenger remains confident his best is yet to come. 
              
              "He is a player who cares about results and nobody comes back 100%. You will see the real Cesc Fabregas next season," the Arsenal manager said. 
              
              "Cesc has been very strong mentally and resolute and determined, has given as much as he can. 
              
              "At the start it [captaincy] is a burden, but can he absorb it and do that job."
