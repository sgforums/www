              <p>its time wenger quit while still on top.  he'll remain the
                      best manager of arsenal.  but obviously he's losing touch and
                      leading arsenal nowhere.</p>

              <p>i thk he is still the man for them.. at least for another 2 seasons. Many factors contributed to the scoreline yesterday.. I am happy with the win but not overly excited.. the back 4 were all noobs and it seems like there is only one midfielder shielding the def.. the rest are either half hearted or not interested. then it went fubar when wenger decides to remove the dm.</p>
              <p>arsenal will be ok when all their players come back/learn not to earn red cards haha.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Even as a man utd fan, I feel sick for AW. It felt great when we were 4-1 up. But it was really painful beyond that seeing the emptiness in AW's eyes whenever the next ball went in. They couldn't even muster a decent fight back. It almost feel like we were tearing off pieces of flesh from a helpless puppy. I think deep inside SAF's heart he too wish for lesser damage for his respected rival....</div>

              <p>There were a few moments that exposed United... Everyone was so attacking minded that they left the defence open at times... Only the poor finishing of Arsenal's strikers didn't see the scoreline for them higher... Evans is still a little to easy to get panic kind... Evra left his position open too often... Jones made one mistake which is like a cardinal sin for defenders... Never head the ball back across your own goal mouth! Fergie must drill this into his head as it could be a costly mistake in future...</p>
              <p>Overall, United didn't play with a defensive midfielder so it's understandable as everyone wanted goals... Nani lost the ball on a few occasions where had he chose to pass would have been a better option... Rooney look very upset with him on those occasions... There seem to be something going on there between them...</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Also, Hernandez doesn't look like the player he was last season when he came on... I never thought I would say this, Now we are going to miss Welbeck...</span></p>
              <p>On the positive, Rooney is in red hot form... Ashley Young has become United's 2nd most dangerous player after Roon... Jones was very lucky he didn't got a serious injury as Arshavin's tackled could have damage his leg badly, A good thing he is young and able to take that blow, an older player might have been injured from the looks of that challenged by Arshavin. Also, Anderson is looking like the creative midfielder we need...</p>
              <p>Finally, back to De Gea again... Now someone here calls it "The De Gea moment" which is very true... Looks like he can't finish one match without making a mistakes kind... That Arsenal first goal was so soft I don't understand why he didn't used his hands to try and save it cos from the looks of it, that was savable... Once again, the goals scored bail him out... Let's hope they can keep bailing him out until he cuts out all these silly mistakes from his game...</p>

              <p>rooney vs nani, it seems earlier in the game, when rooney could have played nani thru, he didn't and then it seems to go downhill.</p>
              <p>defensively, our MF seems empty. Anderson/Clevery had too easy a game.. vs Pool will be the real test given how they have reinforced that area so well.</p>
              <p>it is sad to see Arsenal losing their key players so easily. And then the mad rush to get players who may/not fit into their game or upset the whole team.. last straws..</p>
