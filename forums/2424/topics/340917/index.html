              <h1>Manchester United 'agree to sell' Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid in the summer<br></h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/12/17/article-1096557-02B9CA0B000005DC-471_306x430.jpg" alt="Cristiano Ronaldo" width="306" height="430"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span></a><strong> and Real Madrid reportedly have a gentleman's agreement to transfer Cristiano Ronaldo to the Bernabeu. The two team's agreed in principle to the deal at the end of a bitter tug-of-war for the Portugal star in the summer - but pledged a vow of silence, according to reports in Spain.</strong></p>
              <p>However, a leak of the supposed agreement threatens to reopen the feud between the clubs and scupper Ronaldo's dream of moving to the Spanish champions. The information comes from Real Madrid director Pedro Trapote, who is said to be very close to president Ramon Calderon. And respected Madrid-based newspaper <span style="font-style: italic;">El Mundo</span> reports that at least two other senior members of the Bernabeu hierarchy are leaking similar information.</p>
              <p>The paper quotes a conversation between Trapote and a confidant in which the director says that the deal is 'already done for the summer'. He adds: 'It's better not say anything now because there are some clauses that prevent us from announcing it. For us it would be the right time, but we shouldn't do it.'</p>
              <p>Ronaldo agitated for a move to Spain last summer after winning the League and European Cup Double with Manchester United and scoring more than 40 goals. There were suggestions that he was seeking a new challenge after achieving everything he felt possible in England. His mother, Dolores Aveiro, has also said it would be her dream to see the 23-year-old play for Real.</p>
              <p>United managed to hold on to the newly crowned Ballon d'Or winner despite a very public courtship by Real. The battle seemed to be over when Ronaldo spoke publicly on August 6 insist he would be staying at United for the time being. But the suggestion in Spain is that the former Sporting Lisbon winger only agreed to make the pledge after making a pact with Sir Alex Ferguson that this would be his last season at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Real are struggling in the Spanish league, sitting in sixth and 12 points behind table-toppers Barcelona after a 2-0 defeat to their great rivals at the Nou Camp on Saturday. That was Juande Ramos's first League match in charge since taking over from Bernd Schuster, who was sacked last week.</p>
              <p>The suggestion is that Real are leaking the agreement over Ronaldo in a bid to bring some joy to the fans during such a time of crisis. The club are on the verge of completing a £22million deal to sign <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/portsmouth.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Portsmouth </span></a>holding midfielder Lassana Diarra and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar arrives in January.</p>
              <p>But the club are still short of a winger, with both <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/aston-villa.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Aston Villa</span></a>'s Ashley Young and <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/tottenham-hotspur.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Tottenham</span></a>'s Aaron Lennon in their sights. But a box-office move for the player widely accepted as the best in the world would eclipse moves for either of the England men.</p>
              <p>No transfer fee has been suggested, but it would almost certainly be bigger than the world-record £47m paid by Real to Juventus for France star Zinedine Zidane in 2001.</p>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic;">El Mundo</span> has a reputation in Spain for leaning towards former Real Madrid president Florentino Perez who is rumoured to be considering standing for election again at the end of the season. It has been suggested that current president Ramon Calderon is simply being set-up for another fall by the claims.</p>
              <p>The story appeared with the United hierarchy tied up at the Club World Cup in Japan and with Champions League draw in Friday, that could pair United with Real.<br></p>

              <h1>Ramon Calderon: I'm Tired Of Real Madrid-Ronaldo Rumours</h1>
              <p>Real Madrid president Ramon Calderon has made his first comments on
              Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson's inflammatory statement that
              he would never allow Ronaldo to leave for the Real Madrid 'mob' and
              that he wouldn't sell them "a virus", let alone a player.<br><br>Calderon
              was surprisingly restrained in his response, though he did make sure to
              take some thinly-veiled barbs at their increasingly bitter European
              rivals. <br><br>"It is absolutely false that there exists any
              agreement with Manchester United about this business, of which I am
              tired. The matter is totally dead and as such I don't want to talk
              about it anymore," he said reacting to the fresh rumours that the
              Portuguese phenom has already reached an agreement with the Spanish
              capital club.<br><br>Specifically on Ferguson's comments he said: "Our
              club's code of conduct does not include insults, contempt, or a lack of
              respect to our opponents. Maybe for this reason Real Madrid are
              respected in all corners of the world.<br><br>"It is sad that a
              professional with the career of Mr Ferguson can make declarations like
              these, in addition to some of the other unfortunate things he has said
              in the last few months.<br><br>"Despite that, Real Madrid will never
              respond with a lack of respect to Manchester United, to any of their
              directors, nor of course to their fans, for whom everyone has the
              greatest of respect."</p>
