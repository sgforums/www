            <div class='col-md body'>Sir Alex Ferguson says Ryan Giggs is sorely missed after suffering a hamstring injury against Celtic.<br><br>The Welshman has been in incredible form so far this season, but the lack of his presence in the 1-0 defeat to Arsenal clearly showed. However, Reds boss Sir Alex hopes to have the most experienced outfield member of his squad back in action soon.<br><br>Â“It was absolute agony to lose Ryan Giggs,Â” Sir Alex told Manchester United Radio. Â“He has been the leader of the team in many ways. To lose him so early is a blow to us. His form has been absolutely outstanding since the start of the season.Â”<br><br>Giggs was plagued with hamstring injuries earlier in his career, but the problem had seemingly been solved in recent years, notably with the Welshman taking up yoga to aid his flexibility. But, Sir Alex says the injury the 32-year-old suffered against Celtic was not a recurrence of an old problem.<br><br>Â“Interestingly, itÂ’s the first time he has ever suffered a hamstring injury in his right leg. So, weÂ’re hoping it wonÂ’t take too long to heal.Â”<br><br>Another player missing from UnitedÂ’s ranks is Ji-sung Park, who last week underwent surgery on an ankle ligament injury. The RedsÂ’ boss says his absence is a bitter blow.<br>Â“Ji-sung Park is a big loss too,Â” he added. Â“He had a successful operation last week, so hopefully he will be back fit and well.Â”<br><br>The Korean midfielder has been given the prognosis of three months out. But, as Sir Alex explains, that is only a guide timeline.<br><br>Â“We always put a conservative figure on injuries. We should have him back at least in training after three months. But, if the rehabilitation is a success and he shows good recovery, he may be back playing in that time.<br><br>"ItÂ’s difficult to tell because we donÂ’t have experience of his recovery from injuries. If he is a good healer, as some players are, then he could be back playing after three months. We hope that is the case.Â”<br><br><a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=364180" rel="nofollow">http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&amp;newsid=364180</a></div>
