              <p><em>John with big bro Wayne.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">JOHN ROONEY will pocket his usual £300 this week and live the dream that one day he will be in the same league as big brother Wayne.</h2>
              <p class="article">He will need a miracle to match the £37million England superstar Wayne is reported to be worth or ever get the £5m a year Manchester United pay their ace striker.</p>
              <p class="article">But view the 30-yard screamer John fired in Macclesfield's midweek defeat at Carlisle and you sense he's at least on the way.</p>
              <p class="article">A great first touch, quick glance up and bang... a cracking right-footer not unlike another Rooney belter back in 2002 that established Wayne as the then Premier League's youngest scorer with an Everton goal against Arsenal just five days after his 17th birthday.</p>
              <p class="article">John is 18 and playing in League Two with a club averaging just 2,212 for home matches.</p>
              <p class="article">While Wayne is in Kiev today looking for his 26th England goal, John will be looking to give new Lincoln manager Chris Sutton a thing or two to worry about.</p>
              <p class="article">Macc boss Keith Alexander insists his Rooney, who likes to play just behind the front line, does bear a canny resemblance to Wayne in both style and attitude, and that enough scouts visit Moss Rose to suggest John may not be there for much longer.</p>
              <p class="article">Alexander said: "He's an angry young man, I'll tell you that, and I suppose you could argue that it's a family trait.</p>
              <p class="article">"But that's not such a bad thing. Just like Wayne, John is never afraid to have a go at those around him and that's because he is a winner.</p>
              <p class="article">"It's difficult for the lad given his name, but he copes very well.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">"He used to live with Wayne when he first came here but has since moved out and is moving his career forward, too.</p>
              <p class="article">"Basically, he is a very good footballer. I had to protect him last season. I left him out of the side because we just weren't good enough.</p>
              <p class="article">"That wasn't his fault. But he's come in now and against Lincoln he'll be one of about six under 20-year-olds in my team.</p>
              <p class="article">"That's what life is like here - a long way from Wayne's world. But in the future I think John will become a very good player in a very good team.</p>
              <p class="article">"Wayne has been to watch him a few times but stays in the shadows as much as he can. John is much the same - a very shy lad."</p>
              <p class="article">At the tiny Moss Rose ground, players enjoy a pre-match meal and will travel overnight to, say, Torquay, but generally speaking it's a case of throw your boots over your shoulder and turn up at the ground an hour or two before the game.</p>
              <p class="article">Wayne could give up five weeks' pay to keep Macclesfield going for 12 months.</p>
              <p class="article">And while it will be a package deal for John next summer, his brother will be putting heart and soul into winning the World Cup in South Africa.</p>
              <p class="article">That's something else John is unlikely ever to do. For although he is obviously English by birth he is also eligible to represent the Republic of Ireland at international level and has expressed a desire to do so.</p>
              <p class="article">So, one way or the other, he could yet end up walking on to the same pitch as mega rich Wayne.</p>
