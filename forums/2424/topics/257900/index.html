            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Silvestre: I'm staying<br><br>United defender Mikael Silvestre has reiterated his desire to remain at Old Trafford, despite media speculation linking him with moves to a number of clubs, including Tottenham and French champions Lyon</strong><br><br>A shoulder injury sustained in March and the impressive form of fellow left backs Patrice Evra and Gabriel Heinze limited the 29-year-old to just 14 league appearances in 2006/07.<br><br>But the French international, who's played for the Reds 355 times since joining United from Inter Milan in 1999, hopes to add to that tally next season.<br><br>"I'd never say never about moving back to France, but it's not something I'm thinking about at the moment," Silvestre revealed in a recent web chat with fans at UEFA.com.<br><br>"I think my future is bright. I have two years left on my contract and I'm looking forward to it. There's enough room [at Old Trafford] for me to express myself next season."<br><br>Countryman Patrice Evra was particularly impressive at left back last season and Silvestre was quick to praise the young defender's contribution to United's ninth Premiership title.<br><br>"This season he has really improved. Everyone has, but especially Patrice. He has played a big part this season and he has never given up. Since last pre-season he has been playing very well."<br><br>And although Silvestre refused to label the current defence the best he's seen at United Â– if only because he felt it important to recognise the "amazing" contribution of past stars like Jaap Stam and Denis Irwin Â– he didn't hesitate naming Sir Alex Ferguson as the most influential boss he's worked under.<br><br>"Sir Alex has been the best over the years," he confirmed. "What he has achieved is not far from perfection and our results have been tremendous."<br><br>He also echoed other United players' comments about this season's European campaign, which came to an end at the semi-final stage at the hands of eventual winners AC Milan.<br><br>"The Champions League is nice, but the Premiership medal means much more. Winning the Premiership shows you have achieved so much over the course of 38 games."</div>
