            <div class='col-md body'>Sir Alex Ferguson says United's seventh straight Premiership win is due to the patience of his players and Wayne Rooney's ability to deliver under pressure.<br><br><strong>Tough opposition</strong><br>"Sheffield United set up a system to make sure it was going to be difficult for us and they proved that. I think the important thing is that we kept our patience, we kept probing, we made some good chances in the match. I was hoping we'd get a goal before half-time, because I felt that if we'd gone in 1-0 down, it was going to be a long road back. I think they would have been more entrenched. I think the equaliser gave us a bit of patience to wait and wait and eventually we got there."<br><br><strong>Waiting game</strong><br>"You always hope that by being patient and using the skill we have - I thought that Scholes and Carrick totally controlled that area of the field and kept the probing going - there was always a possibility that we'd make the chance that mattered. The goal came from an unusual source really, a long ball to the back post is not the way we'd normally score a goal, but we're grateful for it. It was a marvellous finish from Wayne Rooney."<br><br><strong>Missed opportunities</strong><br>"We're winning matches. We can always look back and say we were maybe a bit careless with our finishing at times but it's more important to win these difficult away games."<br><br><strong>Ronaldo's 5-yard miss</strong><br>"He'll not miss that again! It's an unusual miss, maybe it just bounced up a bit, or he could've taken a touch maybe, but who's to say. At the end of the day we'll just put it behind us."<br><br><strong>Rooney's goals</strong><br>"They were marvellous finishes. The first one he took across a defender and caught him on the hop, good finish. With the second, you've got to remember that creating that kind of finish with fifteen minutes to go isn't easy. You're under pressure, you need to win, but that's the reason he's special."<br><br><strong>Former player scores against United</strong><br>"It's happened to a few times over the years, I remember Norman Whiteside and Peter Davenport. We've had former players score against us before and it'll happen again, you have to accept these things. It was good for the boy, he was good for us, we never had a problem with Keith."<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">United</span> vs <span style="color: blue;">Chelsea</span></strong><br>"I think it's going to be a fantastic game, I think everyone's looking forward to it, the whole world will be watching it. You saw the controversy coming from down there with the referee. Let's hope it's not decided by a refereeing decision next week."<br><br><strong>Team news for Celtic</strong><br>"I'll make a couple of changes for Tuesday (to freshen things up)."<br><br><a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA%2D9A47%2D47BC%2DB069%2D3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=380530" rel="nofollow">http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA%2D9A47%2D47BC%2DB069%2D3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=380530</a></div>
