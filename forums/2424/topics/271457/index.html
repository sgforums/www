            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Mancini relishing OT debut<br><br>Despite a career played out at the highest level, Wednesday's trip to Manchester is full of firsts for Inter Milan coach Roberto Mancini.</strong><br><br>"I've never played in Old Trafford, nor against United," revealed the one-time Azzurri international. "So I'm delighted to come to a venue which has played a such an important part in the history of football."<br><br>And he's relishing a clash between the Serie A and Premier League champions. "It should be very exciting. United had a very good season last year and this game is very tough."<br><br>This is the third successive year the Nerazzurri have pitched up in England pre-season. "I love coming here," said Mancini, who ended his playing career at Leicester City. "All the games, even though theyÂ’re friendlies, have a proper football atmosphere, with big crowds and full stadiums."<br><br>The timing suits the Italians perfectly too: "English clubs always start their pre-season training earlier than we do, so itÂ’s good to play against teams who are further ahead in their preparation. We need to get some real games in our legs, as we say in Italy."<br><br>This season could be the toughest of ManciniÂ’s managerial career, up against city rivals AC Milan fresh from claiming the Champions League title, and with Juventus back in the mix after their match fixing-related relegation in May 2006.<br><br>"In Serie A this year there will be teams with a strong and proud tradition,Â” he said. Â“We have to show that we are Inter in every match.Â” In Europe, Inter have faltered at the semi-final stage of the Champions League twice in recent years, but this season Mancini is aiming for success across the board.<br><br>Â“We're working to win everything,Â” he states boldly. Â“There will be 32 strong teams in the Champions League. We will do our utmost to reach the final and win it.Â” United will hopefully have something to say about that, but it's not inconceivable these teams could meet in the season's finale as well as before it begins.</div>
