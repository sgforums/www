              <h2>The decision of Manchester United defender John O'Shea to stay and
              fight for a first-team place at Old Trafford could boost Sunderland's
              bid to keep United starlet Jonny Evans on loan for next season.</h2>
              <p>Before Gerard Pique left United for Barcelona, the thinking was that
              Evans would definitely be at Old Trafford next season, because he and
              Pique had been identified as the two young defenders who would shadow
              Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic for first-team places.<br> <br> Now Pique has gone, but that does not necessarily mean Sunderland can't continue toborrow Evans.<br> <br> Wes Brown has resolved his future with United by signing a long-term
              contract, while Irish utility player John O'Shea has now pledged to
              fight for a first-team place.<br> <br> That could pave the way for Evans to continue his development with a third loan spell at the Stadium of Light.<br> <br> O'Shea, currently on duty with the Republic of Ireland, told reporters
              he is determined to earn a regular place in United's starting line-up;
              half of his appearances to date have been made as a substitute.<br> <br> The Irishman revealed he would have been in line to start the Champions
              League final against Chelsea if any of United's injured stars had not
              recovered in time.<br> <br> He said: "You just have to get on with it. The club has so many players
              and in the build up to the final, the manager had every player fit.<br> <br> "He said it was funny how this happens and said he wished we could play European Cup finals every week!<br> <br> "Leaving has crossed my mind a lot of the time, but then I think 'where do you go when you leave a team like that?'<br> <br> "That's an even bigger question. For the time being, I will stay where I am and fight for my place."</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would like O Shea to stay although its sad to note that he will never be a first teamer.  The midfield is already packed and with SAF wanting to bring in Micah Richards and Daniel Alves....no more chance for him liao...somemore, heagraves can also play right back like Fletcher.</div>
