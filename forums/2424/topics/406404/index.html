              <p><strong>United's tricky winger, Nani, was afforded his first chance to work his magic this season in the Reds' 2-1 loss to Kansas City Wizards.<br><br></strong>The game - the third on United's pre-season tour - came just seven weeks after a collarbone injury forced the 23-year-old out of the summer's World Cup.<br><br>Nani played 68 minutes at the newly-renovated Arrowhead Stadium, but the scorching Missouri heat took its toll on the winger, who admits he was left yearning for some old-fashioned Manchester weather.<br><br>"It was hard for me to play in this weather," he told <strong>MUTV</strong>. "But it was good to come back and play my first game this season. Of course I still have a lot of work to do but it's a great feeling to come back and play with the team.<br><br>"When we are in England we cry because it's always raining and it's very cold, but now we miss the English weather!"<br><br>Temperatures will only rise as United's Americas trek moves on to Houston and Guadalajara for games against an MLS All-Stars XI and Mexican giants Chivas, respectively. <br><br>Nani will be itching to see more action in those matches as he continues to work towards full fitness.<br><br>"When I missed the World Cup it was a very bad time. But I was thinking, 'I can't wait for the season again so I can play and score goals and feel the crowd behind me again'. <br><br>"Now I'm so happy to be back and I hope to get fit as quickly as posisble because I want to play well this season."</p>

              <p><strong>United winger Nani has joined the chorus of praise for Javier 'Chicharito' Hernandez, after making way for the Mexican's first Reds appearance.<br><br></strong>The Portuguese star, capable of scoring crackers himself, looked on in admiration as the sub who replaced him netted the team's fabulous fifth goal against MLS All-Stars in Houston.<br><br>Nani told <strong>ManUtd.com</strong>, "Chicharito is a fantastic player and he did very well in his first game for United. He scored a beautiful goal and I hope it's the first of many to come. I think he has the potential to be a really great player at this club."<br><br>The 5-2 win ensured a successful end to the pre-season tour of North America, prior to the Reds' one-off match in Mexico against Chicharito's former club Chivas. Nani certainly rated the Houston performance, on both an individual and team basis.<br><br>"It was a great game for us. We played some nice football and showed our quality and scored a few goals. I'm so happy to be part of a team performance like this one because we did very well. We will continue to work hard every day to keep improving.</p>
              <p>"Personally I feel good. It was my second pre-season match and I enjoyed it. I know I still have a lot of hard work to do, but I'm happy with how my fitness is progressing."</p>

              <p><img src="http://images.sportinglife.com/10/05/330/Darren-Fletcher-Manchester-United-Premier-Lea_2451502.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="248"></p>
              <p>Darren Fletcher is pointing to the arrival of Javier Hernandez as proof Sir Alex Ferguson knows exactly what he is doing in the transfer market.</p>
              <p>Once again Ferguson has had a relatively quiet summer.</p>
              <p>Citing a lack of value, the Manchester United boss has restricted himself to just a couple of purchases, both of which were concluded before last season finished.</p>
              <p>Defender Chris Smalling agreed to move north from Fulham during the last transfer window, while Hernandez was a total unknown when Ferguson paid a relatively modest £7million for his services at the beginning of May.</p>
              <p>Yet Hernandez in particular is looking like a bargain.</p>
              <p>The Mexico forward turned in some eye-catching performances at the World Cup to raise his profile and on his return has scored three times in as many games - once against his new club as he turned out for old side Chivas - form which has persuaded Ferguson to release the highly-rated Danny Welbeck and Mame Biram Diouf on loan.</p>
              <p>So, while United's critics continue to insist the lack of spending is due to restrictions imposed by the club's huge debt, something Ferguson has strenuously denied, Fletcher feels the manager is doing exactly the right thing.</p>
              <p>"The manager knows what is best for Manchester United," said the Scotland skipper.</p>
              <p>"He knows what this club is capable of and what the players can do.</p>
              <p>"Younger players are a year older. The ones we brought in last season have the experience of being around for a season.</p>
              <p>"Hopefully that, coupled with the disappointments of last year, will push us forward to greater success this season."</p>
              <p>For Hernandez, the future looks very bright.</p>
              <p>What needs to be avoided is the Diego Forlan syndrome.</p>
              <p>Forlan's performances since leaving United, culminating in him picking up the Golden Ball as the outstanding player at the World Cup this summer, have shown the Uruguayan to be a striker of outstanding talent.</p>
              <p>But, signed for roughly the same fee as Hernandez, Forlan became the subject of ridicule when he took eight months and 27 games to score his first goal, wrecking any chance he had of establishing himself as a regular member of Ferguson's starting line-up.</p>
              <p>So, a goal for Hernandez in tomorrow's Community Shield tussle with double winners Chelsea at Wembley would be perfect for the Mexican to relieve the possibility of external pressure.</p>
              <p>"Javier is a lovely lad," reflected Fletcher.</p>
              <p>"He has come in and settled really well. He speaks great English and gives us another option up front.</p>
              <p>"But strikers thrive on goals. You see the confidence they get from them. Javier will be no different.</p>
              <p>"Hopefully he can get off to a flying start and won't look back."</p>
              <p>After surrendering the title to Carlo Ancelotti's men last term, an early piece of silverware would be welcomed at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Ferguson accepts the most important aspect is to build some match fitness into his squad.</p>
              <p>Half a dozen players - including Wayne Rooney and Nemanja Vidic - only have one game under their belts and, with international fixtures filling next week, the United boss needs to gauge which players are at the right level for the Premier League opener against Newcastle on August 16.</p>
              <p>"Pre-season is all about minutes on the clock," said Fletcher.</p>
              <p>"You want to win games and get your goals and ideally we can get some silverware on the board straightaway because the Community Shield is a big test for us.</p>
              <p>"But the most important thing is getting the match sharpness back and making sure we are all ready for what is to follow."</p>
              <p>Michael Carrick could feature in tomorrow's Community Shield after all.</p>
              <p>Yesterday, Sir Alex Ferguson claimed the Manchester United midfielder would definitely miss the Wembley showpiece after picking up an ankle injury in Dublin on Wednesday and was ruled out for a couple of weeks.</p>
              <p>But Carrick was fit enough to complete an open training session at Old Trafford on Saturday morning and there appeared no obvious reason why he should not play some part against Chelsea.</p>
              <p>Ferguson also stated Wayne Rooney, Michael Owen and Nemanja Vidic would get at least 45 minutes against the double winners and all three were present on Saturday morning.</p>
              <p>Strangely for a public session held in aid of the Manchester United Foundation Ferguson himself was not present, as he will be watching Werder Bremen, including reported transfer target Mesut Ozil, play Fulham in a friendly at Craven Cottage this afternoon.</p>
              <p>It was left to assistant Mike Phelan to stress how much the Red Devils are looking forward to the new season.</p>
