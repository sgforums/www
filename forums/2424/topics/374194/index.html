              <p>DIMITAR Berbatov has the reputation of being one of the most cultured
              members of Manchester United's squad - but there are tricks some of his
              team-mates do that he would not even try.<br> <br>The Bulgarian
              forward knew he would be taking a step up in class when he joined
              United in one of the jaw-dropping late transfer deals on deadline-day
              12 months ago.<br> <br>At a club record £30.75million, Berbatov
              was obvious. Yet it was only when he arrived at Old Trafford that the
              Tottenham star realised how good his new team-mates were.<br> <br>"We have so much talent at United," he said.<br> <br>"They do stuff that sometimes I honestly cannot do - and I don't even try because I would look like a fool.<br> <br>"You see people doing it and ask them about it. You learn from each other. To develop, you have to."<br> <br>Clearly, United's main trickster has gone following Cristiano Ronaldo's £80million move to Real Madrid.<br> <br>However,
              there is still plenty of talent remaining in Sir Alex Ferguson's squad;
              enough to keep Berbatov on the bench until the latter stages of
              Saturday's victory over Arsenal.<br> <br>Not that Berbatov is giving any indication of throwing his toys out of the pram after a difficult first season at United.<br> <br> <strong>Rooney<br> </strong> <br>He knows Michael Owen is in the same boat, while in Wayne Rooney, he has a stellar talent to be compared with.<br> <br>"What can you say about Wayne?" he said.<br> <br>"He has been here for so many years, playing top football. It is amazing he is only 23.<br> <br>"When he reaches around 28 he will be even better.<br> <br>"We see in training, and you can see in games, the unbelievable passion he has got for football."<br> <br>Berbatov
              is also aware his own contribution could result in United winning a
              major honour, just as they did last term when he picked up his first
              Premier League title.<br> <br>It has been suggested more than once that, without Ronaldo and Carlos Tevez, United cannot be the same force.<br> <br>Berbatov does not agree. He looks around the Red Devils dressing room and believes United can challenge once more.<br> <br>"We are going for everything there is to win," he said.<br> <br>"We
              have a good squad. I don't need to introduce anybody. Everybody knows
              what Manchester United's players are capable of - and we are ready to
              go again."</p>
