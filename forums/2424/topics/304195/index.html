            <div class='col-md body'>Rio Ferdinand says the talent in UnitedÂ’s squad means he was always confident the Reds would strike the killer blow against Reading.<br><br>United missed a glut of chances at the Madejski Stadium, and it took until the 77th minute for Wayne Rooney to put the Reds in front.<br><br>Rio and his defensive team-mates managed to pick up an 18th clean sheet of the season, but he insists his faith in UnitedÂ’s forwards never wavered.<br><br>Â“You start wondering [whether youÂ’ll score], but in the last fifteen minutes we always knew weÂ’d get three or four more chances,Â” he told MUTV.<br><br>Â“With the talent weÂ’ve got, you keep thinking Â‘weÂ’ll score the next oneÂ’. Rooney and Ronaldo, who have been doing so well for us lately, managed to put the ball in the back of the net.<br><br>Â“Getting a clean sheet is important, because if we do that then we know weÂ’re going to have the chance to win the game. That was one of the main things for us today, keeping a clean sheet.<br><br>Â“We had a lot of opportunities in the first half, but we didnÂ’t put them away. In the second half it followed a similar pattern, but we managed to get two goals later in the game.<br><br>Â“We were lucky that we got that today, but I think we created enough to chances [to deserve it].Â”<br><br>Reading certainly made United work for the victory, and it took a moment of class to undo Steve CoppellÂ’s side.<br><br>Â“That was probably the hardest game weÂ’ve had all season,Â” Rio added. Reading worked us very hard. They pushed us all over the pitch and we had to battle for our three points today.<br><br>Â“For WayneÂ’s goal, the ball in from Carlos was exquisite. He picked out Wazza, and he stretched his leg out and managed to guide it past the keeper. I think he took the keeper by surprise with how early he hit it, it was a great goal.Â”<br><br>UnitedÂ’s title rivals Chelsea and Arsenal also earned hard-fought away wins on Saturday. Chelsea beat Birmingham 1-0, while Arsenal defeated Fulham 3-0.<br><br>Â“All three of us could have dropped points,Â” said Rio, Â“but weÂ’ve all won. WeÂ’re just pleased with our result. WeÂ’ve not conceded a goal and weÂ’ve won the game.Â”<br><br></div>
