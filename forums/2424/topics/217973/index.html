            <div class='col-md body'>The Irish utility man has helped United to make an excellent start to the season, including five wins out of six games at Old Trafford. He's determined to help the Reds maintain this home run, especially as November brings two top four sides to Manchester...<br><br><strong>How important was it to win the October home games against Newcastle and Liverpool?</strong><br><br>Very important. We improved our home form last season but if we're going to be champions we'll have to improve it again. It's certainly achievable and that's what we're all striving for - to go on a long winning run at home.<br><br><strong>How disappointing was the only home game you haven't won so far... Arsenal in September?</strong><br><br>It was a good wake-up call for us. We'd been comfortable and played well in the four league games leading up to the match and we thought we could go out against Arsenal and do the same. But against the teams at the higher end of the league you really have to be focused and perhaps we weren't as focused as we have been in years gone by. We know we can win the big games, there's no doubt in our minds about that, we just have to ensure we're 100 per cent focused in future.<br><br><strong>Sir Alex believes the results between the main four teams will determine where the title ends up this season. Do the players expect a clash like Chelsea on 26 November to be a real six-pointer?</strong><br><br>Yes and no, because at the same time you need to make sure you pick up points in every game, not just the big ones. The top four teams are all going to take points off each other, so it's important you're doing well and winning the tricky games in between. Those are the ones that really win you titles.<br><br><strong>You made your debut in the League Cup seven years ago - and it remains an important competition for United's young players. Like Giuseppe Rossi, for example, who scored in it last week for Newcastle...</strong><br><br>Yes, and it'll be great for us if he comes back full of confidence on the back of scoring goals. I know for a fact that if he's given a run in the team he'll do that. I'm just glad he didn't play against us in the Premiership<br><br><strong>What are your personal aims for the campaign?</strong><br><br>My main aim is to help the team do well and play as many games as possible. The manager said to all of us before the season started that he's got a tough job on his hands to pick the team for each match, but he stressed the fact that we're going to need everyone in it together if we're to have a chance of winning titles.<br></div>
