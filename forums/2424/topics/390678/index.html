            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong>Darren Fletcher isn’t surprised by the number of own goals teams have conceded against United this season. After all, he says, good crosses are notoriously difficult to defend.<br><br></strong>“It comes from putting teams under pressure,” he explained after Wednesday night’s 1-1 draw with Aston Villa. <br><br>The Reds’ goal arrived courtesy of Aston Villa defender James Collins and was the ninth time this season United have benefitted from the opposition’s generosity.<br><br>“If you put the ball into the right area it’s difficult to defend. If you can whip the ball in between the goalkeeper and the defence there’s a chance one of your players can get onto the end of it. If not, it also causes problems for defenders and fortunately they’ve been knocking them into their own net.<br><br>“But if you look at the own goals this season there’s always a United player coming in behind who can easily tap into the net.”<br><br>United went to Villa Park to win but Fletcher admitted the Reds were “happy with a point” after playing 60 minutes with 10 men.<br><br>“Overall it was a good point and in the second half we had the majority of the ball. We felt comfortable with 10 men. <br><br>“The lads at the back defended well, we kept our shape in midfield and made it difficult for Villa to break us down. Then, when we did get the opportunity to go forward, we tried to play some football and get it up to Wayne. <br><br>“Giggsy was playing some good passes and Valencia was a real problem and a great out-ball for us. We created enough half chances [to win it] but ultimately we’re happy with a point.<br><br>“Before the game if you’d said the gap at the top would be one point you would have taken it. We’d have liked to have won but overall it’s been a really good night for us.”</p></div>
