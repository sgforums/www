              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Manchester United fans can
              breathe a little easier after Cristiano Ronaldo admitted he sees
              himself staying at Old Trafford next season.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>The 23-year-old was at the
              centre of this summer's longest-running transfer saga as Spanish giants
              Real Madrid sought to prise the Portugal superstar away from United.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo revealed at the time that he was keen to play for
              Madrid, but ultimately announced he was going to stay with United for
              "another year at least".</p>
              <p>Few expected that to be the final word on the matter though,
              with the assumption that Madrid - and possibly other clubs - would make
              a renewed bid for Ronaldo next summer.</p>
              <p>However, the likelihood of the former Sporting
              Lisbon player leaving Old Trafford in the next 12 months appears to
              have become a little more remote following comments Ronaldo made in an
              interview with Spanish newspaper Marca.</p>
              <p>When asked where he was going to play next season, Ronaldo
              said: "Only God knows the future. I insist that I am a Manchester
              United player and now I think that next year I will continue here."</p>
              <p>Ronaldo admitted United manager Sir Alex Ferguson played a huge
              part in his decision to commit his immediate future to the Red Devils
              following this summer's transfer speculation.</p>
              <p>"He has been a key person. I respect him a lot, because it was
              him who signed me and he has played a very important part in all that I
              have won," said Ronaldo, who met with Ferguson in July in Portugal to
              discuss his future.</p>
              <p>"In Lisbon I reached an agreement with him and it was decided that the best thing for all was to continue.</p>
              <p>"He listened to my arguments and I listened to his. Now I
              understand that it was the correct decision. I am with Manchester
              United body and soul."</p>
              <p>The Madeira-born player's comments, which appeared in the
              second part of a lengthy interview with Marca on Sunday, were published
              just two days after Madrid president Ramon Calderon insisted his club's
              pursuit of Ronaldo was officially over.</p>
              <p>When asked to comment on the possibility of one day down the
              line playing for Madrid, Ronaldo added: "I'm a Manchester United
              player. I want to respect this club, my team-mates and the fans, and I
              prefer not to talk of other teams at this moment."</p>
              <p>Calderon reiterated his club's stance on BBC Radio Five Live
              Sportsweek programme on Sunday morning that the saga is in the past.</p>
              <p>"He is playing in Manchester," he said. "It's something</p>
              <p>that's been closed. Manchester didn't want to sell the player - we can't do anything.</p>
              <p>"It's not our intention to get in trouble with any club.
              Manchester is one of the biggest clubs in the world and we want to have
              a good relationship. In fact I have a good relationship with (United
              chief executive) David Gill. We will not do anything against them.</p>
              <p>"I don't see any way of doing it even at the end of the season.
              We tried in a friendly way last summer but Manchester was very clear.
              They didn't want to sell the player and that's all. For us it's
              something that's over now.</p>
              <p>"You never know what life is going to say in the future but
              it's not our intention. I have to say very clearly that Real Madrid
              wants to have a very good relationship with Manchester - to not disturb
              them with signings that Manchester do not want to accept."</p>
              <p>Madrid were not the only club to be linked with a move for
              Ronaldo this summer, with United's neighbours Manchester City
              reportedly weighing up a mega-money bid for the winger.</p>
              <p>However, Ronaldo cannot see himself swapping the red of United
              for the blue of City, saying: "No, it hasn't crossed my mind. I can't
              imagine one day leaving United to go to City."</p>
