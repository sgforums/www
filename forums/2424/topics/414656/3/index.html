              <p>Cahill is 30 yrs old man. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> and he's definitely not in the same mould as Scholes.</p>
              <p>Sneijder's signed a long term contract and Kaka, i believe, would prefer a move back to Milan.</p>

              <p>I think Fletcher made a mistake that all footballer made (and what Gomes did last week), that is to play by the whistle. Fletcher thinks he has earned a freekick so he did not move when Wolves break into a counter.</p>
              <p>It's nice to watch when United attack in such intense especially during the last few minutes of the match. Wolves are so desperate to defend, they just throw their body around whenever a United player takes a shot.</p>
              <p>if only they can maintain this for 90 mins for the rest of the season. Sigh..</p>

              <p>Seeing how United performed today, i can understand fans frustration. I myself dont like what i am seeing now on the pitch. Gone are the days when u see players like Ronaldo taking to the field and wondering how many goals is he going to score, how will he torment the opposition, how the midfield will dominate.</p>
              <p>Now its a case of hoping the opposition doesnt play well and make United drop points. Even when Rooney return, i dont see a change in fortunes.</p>
              <p>Players like Giggs and Scholes cannot be old, United need them for an eternity <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Only when players like them, plus Nani and Valencia back can we expect a more width attacking play.</p>
              <p>Base on what i have seen so far this season, United should thank lucky star if they can finish 2nd in the EPL and reach at least the quarter finals of the champions league. A carling cup win is almost a must considering many big teams are out of it. </p>

              <p>he's a gamble, really. This carlos queiroz has ucovered gems in ronaldo and nani. And this bebe chap came straight from a lower division of play....i remember how nani sucked when he tried too hard but with confidence, he's a different player today. the man utd staff keep saying he's a raw diamond and it may not be untrue. He controlled a very long high pass from dunno who and instinctively, he controlled it very well with the outside of his right boot.</p>
              <p>i hope they get their act together too and let's wait and see tomorrow big clash :)</p>

              <p>People seem to have too high of an expectation sometimes and forget who was playing... With Valencia and Nani out, it was left to the younsters like <span lang="EN-GB">Obertan, Bebe, Macheda and <span lang="EN-GB">Hernandez to provide the firepower... Clearly these guys are still very young and hardly played much yet... I think what mattered most was the team still manage to win at the end last night. Don't compare these guys to the Ronaldos or the Rooneys or the Tevezs... Cos they are not, simple as that... The combine sum of the 4 of them probably cost around $18m whereas the other 3 probably around $150m...</span></span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB"><span lang="EN-GB">So, man for man, they are not... But if they are not given chances to gain important experienced in such matches, then when are they going to get some league experience? Just like Nani or Fletcher, they took almost 3 yrs to come good but in the past, whenever we saw their names on the team line-up, we would go like aiyo, gone already, gone already kind...</span></span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB"><span lang="EN-GB">Bebe didn't had a good match on the right wing, though I thought he played ok, but his crossing let him down... But with the experienced he has gain, I am sure it would go a long way to making him a better player... But he need to learn the language fast too otherwise it would be very difficult to communicate with team mates on the pitch...</span></span></p>

              <p>Park has been very bad from the start of the season until I was thinking, it's almost time to ship him out if there are new players coming in Jan or next season... Then finally, he showed some of the old Park again... And I thought last night's match was Park's best match this season so far...</p>
              <p>And did anyone saw the 4th referee's reaction after United scored the injury time goal and Mick McCarthy turned around and like kick something on the ground and the 4th referee like went, take cover reaction... lol. I thought his actions was damn funny... The goal scored already happy then got to see a comical moment too... lol.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Wolves got lots of chances, compared to Man U in 1st half. Man U started to gain back their possession after squandering their lead, thanks to Wolves 'never-say-die' spirit. Admire Wolves determination. When the score was 0-0, they got many chances to get the shock lead. After coming back from 1-0 back, they were trying the best to overturn a derelict but this was undone by Park's solo effort. If not, I think Wolves could get either 3 points or 1 point yesterday against Berbatovless Man U.</p></div>

              <p>united already misses out on adam johnson, who if he joins man united, will be giggs long term replacement and can play on the right as well, versatile.</p>
