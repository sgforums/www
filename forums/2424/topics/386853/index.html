              <p><strong>DEEPLY religious Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini has scored an own goal 
                  after discovering his new priest is a footie-mad Red Devil.<span style="font-weight: normal;"> </span></strong></p>
              <p>The Italian raised eyebrows after he slipped into St John's Roman Catholic 
                  Church, Chorlton, to attend Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve. </p>
              <p>But 'Ave It can reveal Father Paddy McMahon often seeks divine intervention 
                  for his beloved Man United - and is a big pal of rival Sir Alex Ferguson. </p>
              <p>Fr McMahon said: "I told the congregation we had a famous visitor in the 
                  shape of Roberto Mancini but I've told him that there is no chance of me 
                  swapping sides. I've been a United fan all my life. Fergie often pops in to 
                  pray." </p>
              <p>Worshippers flock to hear the footie-laced sermons, which often finish with a 
                  round-up of the scores. But it seems even City's billions can't tempt a member 
                  of the God Squad!</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">ALEX FERGUSON had better start praying - because Roberto Mancini's career has been fully endorsed by the big guy upstairs. And before you ask, we do not mean Manchester City's mega-rich owner Sheikh Mansour!</h2>
              <p class="article">As the two Manchester bosses prepare to go head to head for the first time in tonight's Carling Cup semi-final at Eastlands, SunSport can reveal that City chief Mancini's career has received divine inspiration from a much higher source.</p>
              <p class="article">The regulars at St John's Church in Chorlton, south Manchester, were stunned by the new addition to their congregation when the suave Eastlands manager joined them for Mass on Christmas Eve.</p>
              <p class="article">But they should not have been too surprised as our pilgrimage to Roman Catholic Mancini's birthplace showed his religious and footballing beliefs have been gloriously entwined from the moment he learnt to kick a ball.</p>
              <p class="article">The man who has restored City's faith was born and bred in Jesi, a small town 20 miles inland from the city of Ancona on the Adriatic coast.</p>
              <p class="article">He is its most famous native since the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II, who was frequently at war with the Papal States.</p>
              <p class="article">Mancini's early battles were fought out on the grass and concrete football pitches of the Aurora Calcio boys' club, overlooked by the modest second-floor apartment where his mum and dad still live today.</p>
              <p class="article">The club was founded in 1955 by the church of San Sebastian next door, where Mancini honed his skills as an altar boy - and striker - under the guidance of a priest who is still in residence despite heading into his late 80s.</p>
              <p class="article">Mancini's father Aldo, a sprightly 74, said: "Like most boys in this area, Roberto's life revolved around football and religion.</p>
              <p class="article">"He was always playing football at the Aurora Calcio.</p>
              <p class="article">"As soon as he came home from school he would be over there, kicking a ball with his friends.</p>
              <p class="article">"There was no stopping him. It was always football, football, football. He used to sleep with his football.</p>
              <p class="article">"The only time he didn't have a football with him was when he was carrying out his duties as an altar boy. But then as soon as he was finished at church on Sunday morning, he would change into his football kit and go to the pitch next door to play a match."</p>
              <p class="article">But there was one occasion when fixtures famously clashed - as an eight-year-old Mancini was forced to attend his First Holy Communion.</p>
              <p class="article">His father recalled: "Roberto was a little bit upset because it meant he would have to miss a match.</p>
              <p class="article">"He didn't like it but the First Holy Communion is a big event and all the family came to church to celebrate.</p>
              <p class="article">"It started well but halfway through the ceremony we could not spot Roberto, he was nowhere to be seen. I knew he had sneaked off to the football match and I was very angry.</p>
              <p class="article">"So, at the end of the service, I went over to the priest and apologised for my son leaving.</p>
              <p class="article">"But the priest told me not to worry as he'd asked Roberto to go and play because the team were losing!"</p>
              <p class="article">The priest, Father Don Roberto Vigo, 86, used to coach the kids and referee games when he was not officiating on holy matters.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: "I had heard that our team was 2-0 down at half-time. So when I conducted Roberto's Communion, I asked him quietly if he had his football kit and boots with him.</p>
              <p class="article">"Roberto said they were in the changing rooms so I told him to sneak out of the side door and put them on because his team needed him.</p>
              <p class="article">"I do not remember the final score but I am sure we didn't lose.</p>
              <p class="article">"Roberto was a lively boy but a good boy and a very gifted footballer.</p>
              <p class="article">"I was the first person to coach him and I knew very quickly that he could be something special. He just had something different."</p>
              <p class="article">After being snapped up by Bologna at the age of 14, he went on to make his name in a 15-year spell with Sampdoria. Capped 36 times by Italy, he also played for Lazio and had a brief spell at Leicester before going into management with Fiorentina, Lazio, Inter and now City.</p>
              <p class="article">As he brought success back to Inter, leading them to three successive Serie A titles, he never forgot his roots, somehow finding the time to launch his own football academy in Jesi. Today, it teaches the beautiful game to 360 local kids aged five to 16.</p>
              <p class="article">His dad, who still works as a furniture maker and is president of the excellent facility, said: "Roberto always wanted to return to the Premier League one day and he loves life in Manchester, although he misses his mother's pasta."</p>
              <p class="article">Mum Marianna is a former nurse far too dignified to tell us her age. Legend has it that when her son was a player she would sneak off duty with the Italian newspapers and call any journalist who dared to criticise his displays in print.</p>
              <p class="article">She said: "I miss Roberto but I like the fact he is managing in England. In Italy, people are too critical when it comes to football and after every game there is a tribunal on TV.</p>
              <p class="article">"In England, the fans and media seem to look forward more and I know Roberto likes that."</p>
              <p class="article">The Mancinis are backing their boy to beat United tonight - and believe the omens are on their side. Papa Aldo said: "Sven Goran Eriksson invited Roberto and me to the Manchester derby at Old Trafford when he was manager. I brought City good luck because they won 2-1.</p>
              <p class="article">"I hope I can bring Roberto the same luck when I watch this game on TV. I will be cheering on City like I do every time I watch them on the television. If they get to the final, I will cheer them on at Wembley."</p>
              <p class="article">Marianna is also backing her boy to end City's trophy drought.</p>
              <p class="article">She added: "He has been a success wherever he has managed - it's no coincidence. Inter had not won the title for 16 years before he went there. I hear Manchester City have gone even longer without a trophy.</p>
              <p class="article">"But I am sure that will not be the case for much longer."</p>
              <p class="article">Maybe Fergie is not the only rival manager who should get on his knees.</p>

              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson had a simple message for his players after the Reds' 2-1 Carling Cup semi-final, first leg defeat at Manchester City: Forget the events of Eastlands, just win at Old Trafford.</strong></p>
              <p>Ryan Giggs' early opener was overturned by a controversial double from Blues striker Carlos Tevez, but the United manager was far from perturbed ahead of next Wednesday's return in M16.</p>
              <p>"I think we dominated the game, we just let it slip for two minutes in the first half," Sir Alex told <strong>MUTV</strong>. "We had a mad two minutes where we lost a bit of our composure and they got in the game.</p>
              <p>"I think the important thing is to go and win the match (at Old Trafford). Forget about the scoreline today, win your match and we have a great chance."</p>
              <p>The Blues seemed devoid of inspiration before they were awarded a hotly-contested penalty for a tug by Rafael on Craig Bellamy. In the second half, the Brazilian was incorrectly adjudged to have conceded a corner. Tevez was on hand to profit from both decisions. Nevertheless, Sir Alex refused to criticise referee Mike Dean.</p>
              <p>"Of course, it happens that way," he said. "Sometimes you get them for you, sometimes you don't. You just have to take it, bite the bullet and get on with it.</p>
              <p>"They got a decision for them to get them back in the game, but after that you can lose a game anyway," he said. "And set-pieces are a part of the game today and you have to handle them well.</p>
              <div class="newsStory">
              <p>"Was it a corner kick? I don't know, I'd leave that to the experts, but we didn't defend it well. After that we dominated but couldn't get the ball to go in. There was some good football, I was pleased. The performance level was good."</p>

              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson praised Wayne Rooney for inspiring United’s victory over Hull City, describing the Reds forward as being in “excellent goalscoring form” after taking his tally to 20 goals for the season.<br><br></strong>Rooney’s four-goal haul extends his lead in the Premier League’s top scorer stakes. He now has 19 league goals, four more than the next highest scorers, Darren Bent, Jermain Defoe and Didier Drogba, all with 14.<br><br>“[Wayne Rooney] was the undoubted highlight of the match,” Sir Alex told <strong>MUTV</strong>. “It’s the first time that he’s scored four goals for us. That is very pleasing and he is in excellent goalscoring form at the moment.<br><br>“He’ll beat his previous best tally of 23 goals, I’m sure of that. He’s in excellent form. It’s only encouraging for Wayne because he’s wanted to develop himself as a scorer.”<br><br>Sir Alex feels Rooney’s form is more due to his growing maturity and developing game rather than him stepping to the fore following the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo.<br><br>“I don’t think that comes into it at all,” he said. “He’s always a main man. He’s very seldom left out and he’s always been a main player for us. I thought he did well today alongside Michael Owen. There was good movement and hunger. They did well.”</p>
