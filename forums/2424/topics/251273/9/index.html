            <div class='col-md body'>Well, considering how the match went... Milan deserve to be in the final. Man u's defence were very poor... Vidic lack of match fitness, Brown wasn't cool... Milan like Pool, their season is mainly for CL football... They could rest most of their players for this... Whereas Man u like chelsea, had to use almost every player they had in every game even in the EPL... I guess it eventually caught up with them.<br><br>The man u of last night was totally a jaded team... no running, no aggression in their play... In the end, the 2 teams that didn't have their domestic title to go for were the fresher team.<br><br>Man u have to be real careful for this weekend, with only 2 1/2 days rest... its not going to be easy against Man city... Man u need to pick themselves up for it and win the title most of us wanted since the start of the season... The EPL Title.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it hurts so bad but we gotta move on.. we are devils.. we lose in humility.. we take it in our stride.. we definitely lost to a much better team.. Milan was UNSTOPPABLE.. class all over the field.. well almost.. gattuso is number 1 all time.. from the way it looks now, i got to wish liverpool luck cos they would need it to face milan.. liverpool would have to be on their bestest form to defeat milan or just play for penalties where they have their strengths at.. good season.. man u need to upgrade more to be more convincing... luck dont come always..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I said before in 1st league liao.. no gattuso den ManU can play.. last nite he clean all the trash for Milan. Nbz.. ManU like a bunch of headless chickens running in the rain. Waste my time to wake up to watch.. only have one worthy short on goal by giggs.<br><br>Kaka outpaced the def. Seedorf, not ronaldo, toyed the defence with his trickery. Milan's patient short passing were exquisite, stringed by kaka, seedorf, pirlo and the WB's oddo and jankulaskis.<br><br>If not bcoz of VDS, ManU could have been Roma the 2nd.<br><br>ManU passing was terrible. Milan players close down only kan chiong spider, pass like crap. No industry, creativity and hunger. U know how casual ManU can pass at times, esply guilty Rooney.<br><br>Thru out this season, assuming no injuries, ManU usually cant handle teams which swamp the midfield and actively closedown on the pitch.<br><br>We miss a midfield marshal/hardman like Keane. Carrick of course no way. Hargreaves is not even tt level. Gattuso has shown he is. He's not called the Bull for nothing. Does the dirty work and pushing ronaldo to the sides while seedork n kaka confidently wreck havoc in front.<br><br>Last nite's performance, Man U dun deserve to win. They better wake up their idea. Dun screw up the other titles.</div>
