The tactics level and the crowd.<br>Milan definitely had the better defence, and to me, that was what won the game for them.<br><br>U can say that kaka and seedorf did well but it was still their defence that won them the match because our strike force could do the same.<br><br>There was a good spell in the 2nd game for us, and i truly believed that if we scored. we would go on to the final.<br><br>Oh look at seedorf. How old is he again? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>its such pity the national coach see no value in him.<br><br>SAF lost terribly to his counterpart.

We were focused and mow I'm drunk.<br>Let me just notice that we will play again in Athen, where we won the Champion's vs. Barcelona, whilst the whole Europe was 100% sure they would crush us (final score 4-0).<br>Anyway, let's see. It's a dream just to have the chance of a rematch after 2005 (personal note: I was in Istambul that night... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> ). I'm not say we'll surely win: Milan is technically very far from Liverpool (if KakÃ  plays again like this, he is simply the best player), but Liverpool has strength and courage and a great coach, so the chances are more or less even (this is football).<br><br>Anyway, GRAZIE, MILAN!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, the better team won, and by a big margain.<br><br>the last time we played Milan, it was a learning lesson, this time, it was a gap of how far we are.<br><br>the key was Midfield and MUFC were desperately short.<br><br>With two ball-winners, Milan was able to stop any MUFC's break effectively and therefore seal off Ronaldo's runs. If MUFC has one gattuso or Seedorf, I bet Kaka would have been restricted.<br><br>Carrick or Scholes just did not cut it.<br><br>Playing Vidic was a risk and it did not work out, he was short of pace, and match fitness. It reminds me of him when he first came to EPL and was a poor reflection of his quality.<br><br>The biggest disappointment for me was the man with the armband, our CAPTAIN.<br>Giggs. He was sluggish and uncreative. In a similiar situation, our ex-captain took the game and single-handled brought MUFC to Nou Camp. So what if he can't play in the finals, his determination won the day, and he is none-other than Roy KEANO, a roll-royce engine. How we missed his drive, and how he missed his iron-will.<br><br>To see Gattuso, chopping MUFC's attack to pieces, showing his delight, was so disturbing that I now wish Gerrard to put some punishment back.<br><br>SAF, the message is clear, we NEED a ball-winner.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A very disappointing performance from Utd indeed. Ronaldo was almost reduced to a whimper. He always lose the ball from right under his nose. sigh..<br><br>Now can only look ahead and hope we win the remaining 2 cups. The EPL is not over yet!<br><br>Yes, Liverpool please take revenge for us! Milan has avenged Roma already. Now is the final showdown btw the English and Italians! Way to go Gerrard!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
