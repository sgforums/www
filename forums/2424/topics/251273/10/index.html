Even more damning, they have won only three knockout-stage ties since 1999 Â— two of them this season.<br><br>Had any other manager of a top European side had this on his<br><br>CV he would have been sacked long ago.<br><br>ItÂ’s all very well producing sides that are cavalier and score bundles of goals on their own ground but they have to be far more tactically astute in more challenging settings.<br><br>Milan boss Carlo Ancelotti hit the nail on the head when he said before the game at Old Trafford: Â“No disrespect to United Â— but everyone knows the way they play.Â”<br><br>With United, there is no plan B.<br><br>And if it is going to be all-singing, all-dancing, all-out attack then United need both a holding midfield player and some imposing central defenders.<br><br>Their last accomplished pairing was Jaap Stam and Ronny Johnsen and even that was limited to when Johnsen was fit.<br><br>Then Ferguson suddenly offloaded Stam.<br><br>A variety of reasons was given but the Dutchman was still good enough to be playing for AC Milan in the Champions League final four seasons later.<br><br>Since then there have been a variety of players filling in Â— Laurent Blanc, David May, Wes Brown, Henning Berg and John OÂ’Shea among them.<br><br>Now United feel they have found the perfect combination in Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic.<br><br>In the Premiership, perhaps. In Europe, the jury is still very much out.<br><br>PAIN IN THE RAIN ... United's Rooney is dejected at the San Siro<br>PAIN IN THE RAIN ... United's Rooney is dejected at the San Siro<br>While Milan can still produce their most impressive result of the season without Paolo Maldini, United have lost at FC Copenhagen (with Ferdinand/Silvestre), Celtic (Ferdinand/Vidic), Roma (Ferdinand/Brown) and now AC (Vidic/Brown).<br><br>In previous years, United were at their best when Nicky Butt was shoring things up in front of the back four and Roy Keane charging forward. It wasnÂ’t faultless but<br><br>it still allowed the touch players to perform.<br><br>ButtÂ’s record post-99 was P17, W8, D4, L5 Â— with three of those defeats coming in the quarter-finals.<br><br>Now, though, United are losing at places you could never imagine in the old days Â— Lille and Copenhagen chief among them.<br><br>So the likely arrival of Owen Hargreaves in the summer will be a welcome addition to the staff.<br><br>Ferguson often claims that UnitedÂ’s European defeats have been down to Â“fractionsÂ”. Not on Wednesday, though.<br><br>On drawing Milan for the second time in three seasons, he made a big point of saying both Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo were not ready for it two years ago.<br><br>This week, sadly, they looked further away than ever. That goes for the manager as well.<br><br>And it illustrates my point perfectly.</div>

That type of experience can't be dismissed. We have to keep the team together and grow the team like Milan have done," insisted the United boss.<br><br>United have not been convincing away from home for several years in Europe now. You have to go back to the Ryan Giggs-inspired win in Juventus four years ago for the last time United really impressed away from Old Trafford in the competition.<br><br>That isn't good enough and at least the signs of improvement have been present this season, though Cristiano Ronaldo in particular was below par against Milan.<br><br>Ryan Giggs<br>A tired Giggs was not able to inspire United in difficult conditions<br>What United do need is more depth to their squad and Ferguson needs to halt the recent slump in form of defender Gabriel Heinze who was all at sea in the San Siro.<br><br>Challenging on more than two fronts has cost United and Chelsea dear this week.<br><br>Ferguson is unhappy with the lack of help from the Premier League but he refused to blame their exit entirely on their busy schedule.<br><br>He added: "We have a very tough league in England and we have been using the same set of players over and over again in the last few weeks, but I can't be categoric about whether that's the reason for the defeat.<br><br>"We should be coping better. We cut our own throats and I have no complaints."<br><br>United must overcome these growing pains quickly if they are to reward Ferguson with a second European Cup before he steps down from the Old Trafford hot seat.<br><br>Perhaps the expected introduction of Owen Hargreaves next season will give United more nous and solidity when they most need it.</div>
