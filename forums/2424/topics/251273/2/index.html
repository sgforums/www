If he stays on his feet and tackles properly, he won't have a problem.<br><br>"In Europe, they just don't accept sliding in. That is where he gets all his bookings.<br><br>"We accept it in our country when he slides in but they don't look at it the same way in Europe. It is not filthy or violent conduct, it is all about interpretation."<br><br>Ferguson does not feel Milan's players will look to get Scholes booked.<br><br>"The second leg would be in progress and one of us would be going to the final, so I do not see any benefit for them in that," he added.<br><br>"But Milan don't seem like that kind of side to me anyway. There was nothing like that in the last game we played against them and on Tuesday there was nothing like that either.<br><br>"If anyone deserves to play in a final it is Paul and we are all hoping that is the case.<br><br>"If he keeps his calm about the game I am sure he will be all right."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">Scholes puts the team first</span></strong><br><br>Paul Scholes will not let the possibility of missing a second Champions League final cloud his approach to WednesdayÂ’s semi final second leg clash with AC Milan at the San Siro.<br><br>The 32-year-old midfielder missed 1999Â’s European final in Barcelona through suspension. Now, one booking away from a heartbreaking repeat of that scenario, everyone is hoping that, should United overcome Milan, Scholes will be available to take on either Liverpool or Chelsea in Athens.<br><br>But, for the straight-talking Salfordian, it is not an issue and he is solely focused on getting United there above all else.<br><br>"I won't let the bookings situation bother me,Â” he said. Â“ItÂ’s just another game and another chance to get to a Champions League final."<br><br>There is seemingly no time to be mawkish about his predicament. "I don't think of it being more important to get through because of what happened to me last time,Â” he adds.<br><br>"It is a major tournament, one that every team in Europe wants to be involved in. It still feels the same as the semi-final was in 1999. We all want to get there and we all want to win it if we do."<br><br>The tolerance for ScholesÂ’ self-confessed inability to slide-tackle is met with distinctly different responses from referees at home and abroad, which is why Reds boss Sir Alex Ferguson has specifically told Scholes not to dive in to challenges.<br><br>Â“The advice to him is not to slide in, thatÂ’s where he gets all his bookings,Â” said the Reds boss. Â“In Europe, they donÂ’t accept it. If he stays on his feet heÂ’ll be OK. If anyone deserves it, itÂ’s him. WeÂ’re all hoping that is the case.Â”<br><br>Scholes, though, is focused on team duties rather than personal interests.<br><br>"It will help having been there before," he said. "We know what we are facing. What happened a couple of years ago in Milan was a big disappointment. But the likes of Ronaldo and Rooney are a couple of years older now.<br><br>"The goal we scored in the last minute of the first game certainly gave us a boost and I suppose there is a possibility it might have disheartened Milan a little bit.<br><br>"I can't really see that, though. It is going to be a very tough game. I just hope we can do a bit better than we did last time."</div>

With Patrice Evra suspended, the return of Vidic would allow Gabriel Heinze to switch into his favoured left-back role.<br><br>Louis Saha could be on the bench despite his recent hamstring problems, although the absence of Gary Neville will only fuel speculation that the United skipper's ankle injury will rule him out for the season.<br><br>Milan could be without their captain and centre-back Paolo Maldini. Kakha Kaladze, available again after suspension, is the obvious replacement if Maldini fails to recover from the knee injury he sustained at Old Trafford and has prevented him from training normally since.<br><br>The Milan manager Carlo Ancelotti admits that the 38-year-old skipper, who made his first-team debut for the Rossoneri in 1985 as a 16-year-old, has only a slim chance of playing. Another of the walking wounded from the first leg, the snarling midfielder Gennaro Gattuso, is available after recovering from a foot injury and the Milan coach has all his regulars available barring the cup-tied Ronaldo and possibly Maldini. Ancelotti has indicated Filippo Inzaghi rather than Alberto Gilardino will play up front.<br><br></div>
