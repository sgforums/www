              <p>Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher today rejected a plea from Scotland boss George Burley to sit out Sunday's Community Shield match against Chelsea.</p>
              <p>Burley was desperate to secure the early release of Fletcher for next Wednesday's crucial World Cup qualifier in Norway.</p>
              <p>The Scotland boss had been in discussions with the player and United boss Sir Alex Ferguson over the issue, but Press Association Sport understands Fletcher did not want to jeopardise his place in the pecking order at Old Trafford.Â </p>
              <p>After naming his 23-man squad for the Group Nine clash in Oslo, Burley confirmed Fletcher would be his captain in the absence of Celtic's Stephen McManus.</p>
              <p>He will now be praying the 25-year-old steers clear of injury at Wembley this weekend, having already lost a number of midfielders for next week's showdown.</p>
              <p>Fletcher will fly to Scotland to link up with the squad shortly after Sunday's game.</p>
              <p>The majority of the party will convene on Thursday, but the seven Coca-Cola Championship players selected will be on club duty this weekend and will join their international team-mates on Sunday.</p>
              <p>(reopens) Burley insisted he had no doubt about Fletcher's commitment to the Scotland cause.</p>
              <p>"There's nobody more committed to his country than Darren Fletcher," he said.</p>
              <p>"He's obviously been faced with a difficult situation, the chance to play at Wembley in a team where competition for places is fierce.</p>
              <p>"I'm sure many other players would have taken the same decision.</p>
              <p>"He'll join us up at the team hotel on Sunday and he'll captain us as we look to get the three points we all want so much in Norway."</p>

              <p>Darren Fletcher is standing by his decision to reject Scotland boss George Burley's plea to miss Manchester United's Community Shield defeat against Chelsea.</p>
              <p>Burley was desperate for the midfielder to sit out Sunday's match at Wembley in order to keep him fresh for Wednesday's crucial World Cup qualifier in Norway.</p>
              <p>But Fletcher - who will captain his country in Oslo - feared losing his place in the United pecking order if he complied.</p>
              <p>The 25-year-old, who started the game and came off with 15 minutes remaining, insisted he is fit and ready to help Scotland in arguably their most important match for two years.</p>
              <p>He said in the Daily Record: "I'm feeling good. The Scotland manager obviously asked me about not playing but I want to play as many games as I can.</p>
              <p>"I've got to try to win a place in the United team and there is a lot of competition around the squad.</p>
              <p>"I don't want to be skipping United games but I was always going to be available for Scotland. That was always going to be the case.</p>
              <p>"There was never any doubt. But I've also always got to concentrate on my club career and they both go hand in hand."</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Rangers goalkeeper Neil Alexander has played down his own chances of starting Wednesday's Group Nine showdown by claiming David Marshall "deserves" the nod.</p>
              <p>Alexander had been considered the front-runner to replace the injured Craig Gordon in Oslo but he appears to be willing to stand aside for his rival.</p>
              <p>Cardiff keeper Marshall has bided his time as number three behind Gordon and Allan McGregor while they battled it out for the number one jersey.</p>
              <p>But with both now unavailble - the latter due to a lifetime suspension - Alexander believes Marshall should be handed his big chance.</p>
              <p>He said: "I must admit I think David Marshall will play and deservedly so.</p>
              <p>"I know what it's like to be in the squad for years and be overlooked."</p>
              <p>Alexander added: "David's been through a lot because of circumstances and he probably thinks he deserves to play. I can't really disagree with that. He's been in the squad a long time as the number three.</p>
              <p>"Having been behind Allan McGregor, he now find himself in the number two position. With Craig out, he keeps going up the ladder and maybe thinks he's entitled to play. That's fair enough. I can fully understand that, but that's the manager's decision. I've been drafted in as cover because Craig's missing. I'm just enjoying it and not looking too far ahead."</p>
