            <div class='col-md body'>I think it was more of compensation for the earlier Larsson's foul.<br><br>Also, the way Ronaldo went down is not his "typical" dive. So I believe there was contact.<br><br></div>

The goalkeeper who does only two things with crosses - wearing them around his neck and dropping them.<br><br>That Robinson is fast sinking to that level should send shivers down any Spurs fan's spines.<br><br>This season, Robinson has been taken down by more long range shots than US soldiers have had to face in Iraq.<br><br>Where has all his famed shot-stopping abilities gone? To his ever-increasing waistline?<br><br>At the back, Pascal Chimbonda is still doing all right, but on the left, Benoit Assou-Ekotto's form has sunk faster than the Titanic after showing promise to be the best left-back in the Premiership at the start of the season.<br><br>So much so that he lost his place to Lee Young Pyo, the South Korean who has the amazing ability to imitate Ronaldo's stepovers - in slow-motion.<br><br>Michael Dawson, another future England star, has been looking nervous without King by his side, which isn't surprising considering that he's had to partner the equally nervous Anthony Gardner and Peter Crouch impersonator, Calum Davenport (now thankfully a West Ham player), in King's absence.<br><br>There is the new signing Ricardo Rocha, whose major contribution in his second appearance in a Spurs shirt was to gift Jeremie Aliadiere with a goal in that Carling Cup second-leg tie in extra-time.<br><br>In midfield, Spurs have been so poor that fans even welcomed the return of Jermaine Jenas from injury.<br><br>This, of course, is the same Jenas that, not so long ago, fans were calling for his head to be put on a pike.<br><br>It's not surprising, however, since Jol keeps insisting on playing Hossam Ghaly in midfield.<br><br>Ghaly's ability to get past players is only second to the tea lady who cleans my office, who has the amazing skill to brush past me to clear my dustbin despite me being at my desk and blocking her path.<br><br>Thank goodness for Tom Huddlestone's emergence as the best midfielder Spurs have had since, erm, Michael Carrick.<br><br>Up front, without Berbatov, Spurs have had to rely on Mido being the big man in Jol's favourite big man-small man combination. Mido has gone from being the next Eric Cantona when he first joined Spurs to the next Emile Heskey.<br><br>Jol's inability to decide between Jermaine Defoe and Robbie Keane has ensured that neither of them has enough of a run to consistently find their scoring boots.<br><br>It's not Jol's fault though, since neither Defoe nor Keane can hold on to the ball longer than the lifespan of an amoeba.<br><br>For all these reasons, it surely seems likes there's no chance Spurs can engineer their first Premiership victory over Man U since 2000.<br><br>Then again, they beat Chelsea and I was pretty sure then that the Russian EPL side would wipe the floor with Spurs.<br><br>As for the punting of this game then, I'd recommend a draw and prayers.</div>
