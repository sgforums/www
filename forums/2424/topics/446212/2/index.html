              <p>Dalgish made the right move in playing Carroll up front cause United have struggled against power center forwards like Yakubu, Demba Ba and Dzeko...</p>
              <p>It wasn't quite showing in the first half, but once Bellamy got on, Carroll somehow found a spring in his step.</p>
              <p>I don't know if Fergie wants to buy, he is quite adamant that the injured players will come back like new signings. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="icon_neutral.gif"></p>

              <p>as a fan, it hurts to lose to your rival, even if cup competition like the fa cup.</p>
              <p>liverpool has knocked out both the manchester clubs in league and fa cup. maybe they will go on and win both cup but wont qualify for the CL, so consolation for them perhaps?</p>

              <p>Actually from the start when i saw the line-up without Rooney and Nani, i thought we would lose already and even worse, get beaten badly as afterall, we were at Anfield and Pool are known to raise their game against bigger clubs.</p>
              <p>But what i saw kind of surprised me. I always thought Giggs and Scholes shouldn't be playing together for the last 2, 3 years already and i still do as a 37 and a 38 yrs old together will naturally slow down the team a lot and cannot keep up with opponent midfielders... So I was very surprise when Scholes actually outplayed Gerrard and controlled the midfield with United having 60+ position in the first half.</p>
              <p>To be fair, i didn't thought United could have won it even at 1-1 as Pool was in defensive mode and United couldn't get a shot on target despite their possession in the 2nd half. It looks like it was heading for a draw and i hope it wouldn't. So i wasn't too upset as this was afterall a cup match. Pool got a little luck with heir Wimbledon style of goal which can happen to anybody and also with the referee. But i thought De Gea though didn't do too badly and pull of a few good saves, could have done a little better on both goals.</p>
              <p>Overall, i think United played better and i was quite pleased to watch them perform more than i had expected at Anfield. The league match at OT is less than 2 weeks away and it's more important not to lose that.</p>

              <p>well, even the great Dane has problems when he first started.. I think all keepers suffered the great expectations on their shoulders once they signed on the dotted line. Ask Bosnich, Howard, even EDS..</p>
              <p>the key to great keepers is confidence. For DDG, he is the future. He is young, has the ability as seen in recent matches. Just not adapted to the EPL physical game yet.  But I believe with SAF on his side, he will grow in statue and confidence. Imagine, he is only 20+, and accordingly, most keepers can play into the late 30+.. MUFC already have made good ROI, and can plough the $$ into other areas.. (if the owners can spare some greenbacks)..</p>
