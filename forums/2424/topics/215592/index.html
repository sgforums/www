            <div class='col-md body'>Manchester United announces that its Finance Director Nick Humby and its Commercial Director, Andy Anson, have resigned and are to leave the Club in February 2007 to take up new positions.<br><br>Announcing their departures, Chief Executive David Gill said: "I am very disappointed to lose Nick and Andy. Nick has been an excellent Finance Director at the Club for the last five years, getting involved in all areas of the business. His final major project has been to successfully manage the stadium expansion - delivering the best corporate facilities in football today - in time for the start of the new season.<br><br>"In his three years with the Club, Andy has set a new commercial strategy for the Club on which he has delivered excellently. He has played a lead role in our record shirt deal with AIG, as well as the negotiations to restructure our platinum partnerships and media businesses.<br><br>"Everyone at Old Trafford will join with me in thanking them for everything they have contributed and achieved and wishing them the very best for the future."<br><br>Nick Humby said: "It has been an honour to work for this Club, with its rich heritage and amazing record of success and growth. The last five years have presented many challenges and it has been a pleasure to work with David Gill and my finance and venue teams to grow the business.<br><br>"The opening of the new Quadrants on time and with record attendances was the result of another great team effort. I wish the whole club continued success and thank everyone for the support they have given me. I will be in a position in a few weeks to announce my new challenge back in the media industry that I have previously worked in."<br><br>Andy Anson said: Â“It has been a huge privilege to work for the Club I have followed since I was a boy.  With the help of an exceptional commercial and support team, we have met and surpassed every challenge in front of us.<br><br>"However, I now have an excellent opportunity in the entertainment sector.  I will remain as I always have been, a loyal supporter of the Club and look forward to coming back to Old Trafford regularly in the stands as a fan.  I thank my fellow directors and David Gill in particular for their help and encouragement and my team for their hard work and talent.Â”<br><br>The Club has started the process of appointing their successors and further announcements will be made in due course.<br><br></div>
