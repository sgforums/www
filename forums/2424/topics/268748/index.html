For now. But whatever happened to Lee Sims? And Phil Picken? We take a good gander...</strong><br><br>Luke Steele: Goalkeeper bought from Peterborough for Â£500,000 in 2002 at the tender age of 17 but went on to make a grand total of zero appearances for ManYoo before leaving for West Brom for nothing in 2006. Needless to say, he couldn't get a game for them either. In fact, the only club Steele has played for in the last five years has been Coventry.<br><br>Lee Sims: We confess we have absolutely no idea where this (presumably) right-back is today. Unless of course he is the man behind Lee Sims Chocolates or plays piano with the Platte River Band.<br><br>Phil Bardsley: Still at ManYoo. Just about. Has started three Premiership games with United in the last four years and ended last season being underwhelming at Aston Villa, who pointedly did not want to make the move permanent.<br><br>Paul McShane: Moved to the Baggies in the summer of 2006 with Steele but has fared rather better - becoming a regular in the West Brom side and earning a call-up to the full Irish squad. Still to play in the Premiership - the furthest he got at ManYoo was being assigned a squad number.<br><br>Lee Lawrence: Left-back released to join Scottish side Livingston after a loan spell with Shrewsbury Town. Since disappeared from the game - though his 'very best of' is available from Amazon.<br><br>Chris Eagles: The only player from this list (barring Kieran) to feature in the Premiership with ManYoo last season; he scored his first goal against Everton in April after returning from a loan spell with NEC Nijmegen, where he was usually used from the bench. With the wealth of midfielders at Old Trafford, expect him to be heading out on loan again some time soon.<br><br>Kieran Richardson: England international (!) who has joined Sunderland for Â£5.5m (!), proving beyond doubt that Roy Keane is still a massive, massive fan of ManYoo.<br><br>David Jones: Captain of this Youth Cup-winning side, but never made a Premiership appearance for ManYoo, though impressive loan spells at Preston and Derby did mean that he commanded a Â£1m fee when he joined the Rams in January. A genuinely good box-to-box midfielder, he'll be back at Old Trafford in Derby colours this season.<br><br>Ben Collett: Midfielder currently conducting a court case against Middlesbrough and their former player Gary Smith after a double fracture of his leg sustained during a bad challenge. Released by ManYoo, last seen playing for AGOVV in Holland after a spell with the NZ Knights.<br><br>Eddie Johnson: Striker given a free transfer in 2006 after making the grand total of one substitute appearance for ManYoo in the Carling Cup. Joined Bradford, who he helped into League Two with his meagre total of three league goals.<br><br>Sylvan Ebanks-Blake: Striker who joined Plymouth for Â£200,000 last season after two Carling Cup appearances for ManYoo (he has a 'one in two' scoring record). Has done okay at Argyle with ten league goals in his first season. Interestingly, he's a Liverpool fan.<br><br>THE SUBS<br><br>Mark Howard: Defender now on the books of Danish side Brondby.<br><br>David Poole: Midfielder who recently joined Stockport from Yeovil for Â£100,000.<br><br>Ramon Calliste: Remarkably on the books of both ManYoo and Liverpool but has recently been released by Scu<strong></strong>nthorpe United.<br><br>Tom Heaton: Goalkeeper still on ManYoo's books but yet to play.<br><br>Phil Picken: Defender/midfielder on the books of Chesterfield. </blockquote></div>
