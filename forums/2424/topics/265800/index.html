            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Northern Ireland and Man Utd defender Jonny Evans has said he is "very proud" of his younger brother Corry, who is to join him as a professional footballer at United at the end of next month.</strong><br><br><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/42435000/jpg/_42435440__evans203.jpg"><br><br>Corry, a member of the United academy side, has been told he will be given a professional contract when he turns 17 on 30 July.<br><br>His 19-year-old brother Jonny is back at the club after a successful loan spell with Roy Keane's Sunderland.<br><br>The Glengormley man said it would be fantastic if the brothers could play in the same United first team in the future.<br><br>"It would be nice for the family if that ever happened," Jonny said.<br><br>"But you don't know how things will work out obviously, football's really hard, even making it at United.<br><br>"But it's nice even when we get to train together - I've been training with his team this week, sometimes we're in opposite teams and we always try and get one over on each other."<br><br>The highly-rated brothers have been compared in some quarters to Gary and Phil Neville, the last pair of siblings to appear in the Utd first team together.<br><br>However, Jonny warned those comparisons were premature.<br><br>"I don't think we're at that level yet, Phil and Gary Neville have gone on to make great careers for themselves.<br><br><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/40417000/jpg/_40417949_philandgary_203152.jpg"><br><br>"It would be nice to compare to them but we've got a lot of work to do," he said.<br><br>The Evans family has moved to the Manchester area from Glengormley, with the two brothers living with their parents and sister.<br><br>Jonny said while he tries to impart the occasional piece of advice to his brother, he's conscious that Corry, a midfielder, has his own decisions to make.<br><br>"I wouldn't want him to try and follow my footsteps, he's his own man he's a totally different player from me - a different position - I'd just tell him to go and give his all," he said.<br><br>"If I tried to give him too much advice he might think 'what's he telling me for, I'm only his brother'."<br><br>Jonny, who has been playing left back for Northern Ireland but is a central defender for his club, said a successful season for him would be being a part of a Man Utd team which wins more trophies.<br><br>"My aim obviously is to try and play as many games as I can. I don't know how many games (manager Alex Ferguson) has in mind for me," he said.<br><br>"You just never know, through injuries and stuff, I might get a chance and it's up to me to take it."<br><br>And what of the prospect of the two Evans boys playing together in the green shirt of Northern Ireland in the future?<br><br>"That would be really nice. I definitely think Corry's got the ability to play for Northern Ireland," Jonny said.<br><br>"I think that would be one of the best achievements, both playing for your country - it would be a really nice feeling."</div>

So they'll probably be able to come only when they turn 18 which is in 2009.<br><br>Fabio plays at the left. Rafael at the right. Both are attacking wing backs.<br><br>Heard that Fabio is better. He's also the captain of the U-17 Brazil squad.<br><br>Quoted from fifa.com....At the recent U-17 world cup,<br><strong>"Captain Fabio was arguably the most valuable player of the tournament. The attack-minded left-back stole the show from playmaker Lulinha, as he showed remarkable talent on the ball and a range of accurate passes. He also scored the opening goal in Brazil's first game against the hosts and added another in the final."</strong></div>
