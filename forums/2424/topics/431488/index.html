              <p><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Sir Alex Ferguson" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/sir-alex-ferguson"><span style="color: #005689;">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></a>, who is reeling from what he said was the worst "hiding" he had suffered as <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester United" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united"><span style="color: #005689;">Manchester United</span></a>'s manager, is planning to stay at Old Trafford long enough to oversee an overhaul of personnel, aimed at dismantling <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Barcelona" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/barcelona"><span style="color: #005689;">Barcelona</span></a>'s European dynasty.</p>
              <p>Ferguson, who will be 70 this year, is approaching the 25th anniversary of his appointment. But the most successful manager in the game still sees himself as being in the job on a long-term basis and has told United that only his health will prevent him from working.</p>
              <p>Instead the manager is going to break up his squad in what promises to be a summer of change at Old Trafford, with up to 10 players on their way out. The Glazer family have told Ferguson that he will be given substantial funds with which to purchase replacements.</p>
              <p>It is nearly 10 years since Ferguson announced a plan to retire, only to change his mind and talk of nearly having made "the biggest mistake of my life". His spending this summer will be designed to close the gap on a Barcelona side whose masterclass of passing at Wembley strengthened their claim to be recognised as the greatest club side ever.</p>
              <p>The task will be a significant one but Ferguson sees himself working at Old Trafford for at least three years, according to one of his closest allies in the game. The aim in that time will be to catch and overhaul Barcelona. Ferguson may be encouraged that <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Pep Guardiola" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/pep-guardiola"><span style="color: #005689;">Pep Guardiola</span></a>, the Barcelona manager, indicated after his team's 3-1 win on Saturday that he would stay at the Camp Nou for one more season. Guardiola, the youngest manager to win the European Cup twice, is being seen at Old Trafford as a candidate to manage United but that time seems far away. Ferguson's attitude to his career could be sensed in a recent conversation with an associate, in which he said that "once the brain stops working, you are on the road to death".</p>
              <p>United's rebuilding was a necessity before the <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Champions League" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/championsleague"><span style="color: #005689;">Champions League</span></a> final, with Edwin van der Sar joining Gary Neville in retirement and Owen Hargreaves being released from his contract.</p>
              <p>Ferguson must establish whether Paul Scholes is to end his playing career and if, as is increasingly expected, that is the case, one idea is for the former England midfielder to take control of the reserve team.</p>
              <p>Even if Scholes can be persuaded to continue, however, Ferguson is aware of the need to bring in a top central midfielder. United admire Wesley Sneijder but are not certain an agreement with Internazionale will materialise. Luka Modric of Tottenham Hotspur has also been discussed at length.</p>
              <p>A £17m deal has been put in place for David de Gea, Atlético Madrid's Spain Under-21 goalkeeper, and talks are at an advanced stage with Lens about an £8m move for the 18-year-old centre-half Raphaël Varane. Ferguson also believes that Jack Rodwell has the necessary attributes to flourish at Old Trafford, if he can be lured away from Everton.</p>
              <p>Ashley Young of Aston Villa is another target. United made inquiries about signing Young in the January transfer window and are now competing with Liverpool for his signature.</p>
              <p>Ferguson must also decide whether to offer Michael Owen a new contract. Dimitar Berbatov presents a different problem. The Bulgarian finished as the Premier League's joint top scorer with 20 goals but he did not make the squad against Barcelona. Berbatov did not sit with the other players who were not in Ferguson's 18-man squad and he is thought to have watched the match in the changing room.</p>
              <p>Asked about reports that Berbatov had left Wembley early, the striker's agent, Emil Danchev, said: "It's nonsense. Mitko [Berbatov] was at Wembley and watched the game. There is nothing to say. Let us take a few days."</p>
              <p>United are encouraged by the development of their FA Youth Cup-winning side, particularly Ravel Morrison, Ryan Tunnicliffe and Paul Pogba. Senior players who could leave include Tomasz Kuszczak, Wes Brown, Gabriel Obertan, Bébé and Darron Gibson.</p>
              <p>Nani, the club's player of the year, said after the Champions League final that he would be at Old Trafford next season but the winger is known to be open-minded about the possibility of a transfer.</p>

              <p>No matter what players they buy, they will wont achieve what Barcelona players can do with the ball - literally pass the ball without looking; its like their natural instinct. No amount of money can do that.</p>
              <p>This is coming from a United fan.</p>

              <p>It's evident that when utd played.....there was a lack of technique as compared to barca. They couldn't hold on to the ball at all. Players like scholes, giggs, nani and valencia were losing their balls all the time. The english style is such.....can never match up to the brazilians and spanish.</p>
              <p>When you play against a team like barca and the best you can offer in midfield is carrick or even fletcher, then the team seriously needs a revamp to compete at the top.</p>
              <p>When barca played real madrid at the bernabeu a few weeks back, they were getting like 70% possession. When that happens, the opposing team's creativity is stifled.....and ronaldo was so frustrated at one point that he just stopped playing in the middle of the pitch. This european final result is kind of expected because even real madrid had problems containing them.....what more man utd? lol.</p>

              <p>i think different strategy can works against barcelona, as shown in how a "lousier" team like inter won or real madrid won against barcelona... they play super rough (but have drawbacks like red card) and thus make sure barcelona cannot play passing football (how to pass when ur player on the ground every now and then), it's ugly but it could be effective, like how chelsea the last time outplayed barcelona but lost due to 1 shot 1 goal in the final minute by barcelona...</p>

              <p>True, they are the weakest in a long time I would even say perhaps more than the last 10 yrs... Edwin van der Sar and Gary Neville are already into retirement, same could be said for Paul Scholes and Owen Hargreaves... Giggs, well... he should have too but he is squeezing one last year out of it and he has shown he can still work it though I don't think at the highest level anymore... Then there is the likes of Michael Owen, Wes Brown, Darron Gibson, Kuszczak, Gabriel Obertan... These may have to be look into as well...</p>
              <p>Despite what is said, they still manage to win the Premier league title with some comfort... It's only in the CL.</p>
              <p>Personally, I don't think they are all that bad. It's just Barcelona's style of play that they are not good at combating... They don't like or perhaps not used to chasing and closing down opponents. Or perhaps they just don't have the right players as well... Scholes, Giggs, Carrick tells you that they don't do alot of running... Nevertheless, it's not to say they couldn't win the CL with this team either, it's just who the opponent and their style of play I belief... If it was Real Madrid, it could be totally different. Barcelona has a good team with a handful of great players... But they are not unbeatable like how Inter showed last season despite playing with 10 men against a 11 Barce side, or how Chelsea were very close or should have beaten them in the semis the year before had they been given their penalties... Even this season, in the semi against Real, had Pepe not been unfairly sent-off, things might be different too...</p>
              <p>Anyway, the United side will need to be changed regardless what happens in the CL. Cos an unusual amount of players are retiring at the same time or leaving due to the coming of age and losing their top level abilities...</p>
              <p>So this would be an interesting period for United as 3 to 5 new arrivals could come to Old Trafford during this transfer window...</p>

              <p>saying what you all said, I am quite surprised when MUFC declared they are prepared, and even played against a mock barca. and after that, it just southwards.. need a radical change.</p>
              <p>but the concern is, they play one way, in EPL, another in UCL.. and when really needed in UCL, they collapse.</p>
