              <p>Very difficult to play 4-4-2 against a strong side because we lack a strong midfield.</p>
              <p>To play 4-4-2, you need the following components -</p>
              <p>a) 2 strong pacy wingers with the ability to track back and help the full-back to prevent pocket of space forming in United's own half. United doesn't have any left winger capable of doing so. We cannot expect Ryan Giggs to be running up and down.</p>
              <p>b) A hardman defensive midfielder who is also capable of spraying passes to distribute the ball. Essentially this is a Flecther + Carrick job. Owen Hargreaves is capable but he is injured.</p>
              <p>c) An attacking midfielder playing behind the strikers with excellent vision. He also needs to perforn defensive duties or else the midfield will get over-whelmed. Paul Scholes, at age 35, can no longer be expected to this. He needs a fellow midfielder to help him out hence a 3 man midfield.</p>
              <p>Essentially we play 4-5-1 in order to carry our old-man Giggs and Scholes and shore up our weak defence. If we had Fabregas and Hargreaves = 4-4-2 will work well. United midfield isn't as strong as many may think it is. I think we have the weakest central midfield in terms of talent among the Big 4. We are lucky that our 3 CMs complement each other really well.</p>

              <p>but the most special point about man utd this 10, 20 yrs is actually playing with no fixed formation... that is when they are most dangerous.... so even when playing 4-4-2... that can inter change alot....... everyone one is attacking and defencing...it's when they stick to 1 formation then they usually will lose...... the best defence is attack... who can win man utd they are attacking like no body business??</p>

              <p>4-5-1 at its best. People will be talking highly of Rooney and Nani but most will forget that it is the central midfield that makes 4-5-1 works as opposed to 4-4-2 which depends on a AM and 2 pacy wingers.</p>
              <p>Paul Scholes should be the MOM in my opinion. His passing was exquisite and I noticed United form dipped after he left. Carrick passing was excellent and mostly due to his vision in spotting spaces in Arsenal defences. Flecther hindered Fabregas. As I have always said, United may not have 3 world class CM (besides Paul Scholes) but they complement each other very well.</p>

              <p>Nani opened the scoring in the 33rd minute when his chip across goal was palmed in by Arsenal goalkeeper Manuel Almunia, before in-form England striker Wayne Rooney swept home a second following a quick counter attack.</p>
              <p>A third on the break from Ji-sung Park at the start of the second half effectively ended the contest, although defender Thomas Vermaelen netted a consolation for the out-muscled Gunners.</p>
              <p>Nani described the match as his best performance since joining United from Sporting Lisbon in 2007.</p>
              <p>'I think that was my best game,' said the Portugal international. 'I played well, scoring and getting an assist.</p>
              <p>'It was a fantastic performance from the team and I was so happy to help. I'm working hard every day to be fit for the team.</p>
              <p>'I want to help the team play well. I can feel the confidence of my team-mates, the fans and the manager. I'm so happy and want to continue this good form.</p>
              <p>'We had a very good game (against Manchester City) last Wednesday and that gave everyone confidence for this match.</p>
              <p>'The manager said we had to have the same attitude today if we want to be champions.'</p>
              <p>Arsenal, who had started the match five points behind Chelsea ahead of their trip to Stamford Bridge next weekend, began well as Andrey Arshavin got away down the left, before cutting inside and trying to curl the ball past Edwin van der Sar from a tight angle, but his shot drifted wide.</p>

              <p><br><br></p>
              <p><strong>United, though, were quick to regain possession and then cut down any space for the home side. Nani and Darren Fletcher combined as they almost played in Rooney, but William Gallas made an important blocking tackle in the six-yard box.</strong></p>
              <p>Alex Song - back from the African Nations Cup - then had to hack the ball clear at the far post as United again got clear down the right far too easily.</p>
              <p>When Arshavin - who was ineligible for last season's Champions League semi-final clash between the sides - burst away again, he lacked any support in the middle.</p>
              <p>The Russian, though, remained Arsenal's most potent attacking threat.</p>
              <p>In the 13th minute he skipped away down the left, cut back inside Wes Brown and curled another effort goalwards, which this time was only just wide of the far post.</p>
              <p>Arsenal captain Cesc Fabregas suddenly burst into life with a surging run down the middle, before slipping in Arshavin, but the Russian lost his footing at the key moment and United cleared.</p>
              <p>United - who have played a match more than Chelsea - slowly started to gain the upper hand and Gallas needed to make another timely tackle in the penalty area as Paul Scholes shaped to shot.</p>
              <p>Nani drilled the ball wide as Arsenal were again exposed in the right channel, before playing a key part in the goal which gave United the lead.</p>
              <p>The winger skipped easily in between two defenders then chipping the ball back across goal. Almunia pushed it inside his far post, with Park Ji-Sung ready to tap the ball into the net.</p>

              <p><strong>Fabregas' shot following a corner was blocked - and four minutes later United were 2-0 ahead. Again Nani was the provider, dashing clear after picking the ball up from Rooney before squaring it for the England striker to sweep home his 22nd goal of the season, low into the corner.</strong></p>
              <p>The Gunners faced an uphill battle to get back into the match, with Arshavin firing wide from just inside the box - as manager Arsene Wenger was left to scratch his head and looked to the heavens for inspiration.</p>
              <p>It could have been worse on 41 minutes, but Nani blazed his shot wide after more good work from Rooney down the left.</p>
              <p>There was a hold-up at the start of the second half as Rooney received treatment following a knock on the knee in a challenge with Bacary Sagna.</p>
              <p>The England forward, though, was soon back in the action, and tested Almunia with a fierce angled drive after cutting in from the left.</p>
              <p>It was game over on 52 minutes, when United scored a third following another simple counter.</p>
              <p>This time is was Park who broke clear, sprinting onto Fletcher's chip into the Arsenal half and then slotting past Almunia from just inside the box.</p>

              <p><strong>The Gunners were also well beaten here 3-0 by Chelsea at the end of November, before a run of seven wins from nine hauled them back into title contention.</strong></p>
              <p>Fabregas, continued to drive his young team on, firing over and then just too close to van der Sar, then Song volleyed wide.</p>
              <p>Theo Walcott came on as substitute - and Arsenal pulled a goal back with 11 minutes to go when Vermaelen's volley took a deflection off Jonny Evans to wrong-foot van der Sar.</p>
              <p>However, there was to be no grand finale as Wenger's youngsters were again found wanting when it mattered most.</p>

              <p>4-5-1 at its best. People will be talking highly of Rooney and
              Nani but most will forget that it is the central midfield that
              makes 4-5-1 works as opposed to 4-4-2 which depends on a AM and 2
              pacy wingers.</p>
              <p>Paul Scholes should be the MOM in my opinion. His passing was
              exquisite and I noticed United form dipped after he left. Carrick
              passing was excellent and mostly due to his vision in spotting
              spaces in Arsenal defences. Flecther hindered Fabregas. As I have
              always said, United may not have 3 world class CM (besides Paul
              Scholes) but they complement each other very well.</p>

              <p>Actually, it's 4-3-3 with Nani and Park supporting Rooney on the wings. it's the formation Chelsea has been using during Mourinho's Era. And interestingly, the 3 goals is scored/created by the 3 upfront - Rooney, Nani and Park.</p>
              <p>I'm really impress with Nani more and more, althoughi admit i was disgusted with him just last month and wanted him out. He's really stunning on the right wing for the past 2 matches. Confidence really helps and in my opinion, Ronaldo couldn't dribble as elegantly as Nani did for the first goal. it's really something out of nothing. I do hope Fergie give him more chances to impress as Nani certainly did his hope of staying no harm by orchestrating the 2 recent victories.</p>
              <p>Rooney is the heart and engine of United, in other words, he's simply irreplaceable. He has been running the show for United but i must say, he has matured alot and has gain enough experience to deem whether to close the ball down, to spread the ball around like Scholes did. Last season, he's just a kid running around aimlessly but this season, he uses his experience well and got into the right position. Make him the captain already!</p>
              <p>Berba is used as a late substitute to wind down the clock. Did nothing much but almost presented Rooney to score his 2nd.</p>
              <p>Park, Fletcher and Carrick produced yet another fine all-round tireless contributions. Park with his industrial and mazy runs, Fletcher is always snapping at Arsenal's heels, while Carrick is spraying balls all around the pitch and providing excellent shield for the back 4.</p>
              <p>Scholes is getting blunt and almost got into trouble again with his trademark mistimed tackle. Giggs look lost and mis-dribbled on a couple of occasions. Valencia did well after coming on and almost provided an excellent opportunity for goal number 4.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, United defence were just lucky not to have concede more. It'll be a different story should Arshavin, Fabregas, Walcott or Song taken their chances.</p>
              <p>It's a throughoutly enjoying match if you're watching as a neutral fan. An end-to-end open match which United won.</p>
              <p>Glory Glory Man United.</p>

              <p>well, don't fix it if it ain't broken.. so I think Nani will stick to right and given he is so hot..</p>
              <p>perhaps maybe when he is up against a tough defender, he will switch and then valenica can be introduced.</p>
