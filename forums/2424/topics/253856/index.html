            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Roy keen to keep Reds' duo<br><br>Sunderland boss Roy Keane is hoping United pair Jonny Evans and Danny Simpson will be part of his Premiership plans next season.</strong><br><br>The defensive duo have sparkled during their loan spell at the Stadium of Light as the Black Cats sealed the Championship title and promotion to English football's top flight.<br><br>Both players will now return to Old Trafford and at present Keane is unsure whether or not he'll be able to call on them come August.<br><br>"I have to say they are two top lads and it would be fantastic if we could get them next season," insisted Keane. "But ultimately they are Manchester United players and there is no getting away from that, we knew that when we took them.<br><br>"It is has been a win-win situation for everybody. It has been a great experience for the two lads to come here as I am not sure they would have played many first-team games at United.<br><br>"They have come to Sunderland, they have played regular first-team football, they have got used to playing in front of big crowds, and our fans are very demanding.<br><br>"If they make it at United, they will find exactly the same, so it has been a fantastic deal for both clubs and for both players. Jonny and Danny have been absolutely fantastic and a credit to themselves," added the former Reds' skipper.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think these lads deserved first-team experience outside of United.<br>Remember Jonathon Greening and Mark Wilson? They are also in United's reserve a few years back but when McClaren signed as Boro's Manager, the first thing he did was to sign these 2 fellows.<br><br>Greening was doing reasonably well back den at United and he had fine spells with Boro and West Brom but he's off the radar now. Wilson never make it big and disappeared as well.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>It's better to cash in than lose them for nothing. You know what i mean.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Cheers.<br>CK</div>
