              If Manchester United secure their 18th league title on Saturday it won't be long before they start looking to win number 19, says Paul Scholes.
              
              Although he already has eight Premier League championship medals in his collection, Scholes is pretty eager to get his hands on a ninth. 
              
              Just a draw, against Arsenal at Old Trafford or, failing that, at Hull on May 24, will be enough for the Red Devils to finish top of the pile once more, denying Liverpool the chance to end a drought dating back to 1990. 
              
              But, as ever with United, attention will quickly shift. First to a Champions League final date with Barcelona in Rome on May 27 and then to becoming the first team in English football history to win four titles on the trot. 
              
              "I never think about the wider picture," said Scholes. "I just think about what I am involved in at the minute. Whatever has happened before has gone. 
              
              "I am sure if we manage to win the league tomorrow a few days later we will be thinking about next year." 
              
              Plenty of water has flowed under the bridge since Scholes helped disprove Alan Hansen's theory of winning nothing with kids by claiming the double in 1996. 
              
              In fairness to the Liverpool legend and Match of the Day pundit, Ferguson knew his kids were pretty special, with Gary Neville and Ryan Giggs also in the squad to face Arsenal tomorrow, while David Beckham, Nicky Butt and Phil Neville send best wishes from elsewhere. 
              
              All six were involved in some pretty spectacular comebacks down the years, a trait that continues to this day. 
              
              After the late smash and grab raid on Aston Villa at the beginning of last month and the sensational five-goal second-half against Tottenham three weeks' later, Wednesday's comeback at Wigan was rather routine. 
              
              But Scholes admits the confidence that courses through the Red Devils camp ensures no-one will ever accept being beaten while there is still a ball left to be kicked. 
              
              "Every lad here is quite confident in their ability and confident that if they are in a sticky situation they can get out of it," said the former England star. 
              
              "Whatever situation has been put in front of them, they always come up with the answers. 
              
              "Against Villa it looked like we were going to get beaten and we won it. Tottenham were 2-0 up but as soon as we get a goal and start to come back at teams, we feel we can get three or four." 
              
              Such self-belief is the major reason why few expect United to fail on Saturday, even though Arsenal victories at Old Trafford are not exactly unheard of. 
              
              Indeed, it is only just over a year since Arsene Wenger's men had high hopes of landing the title again themselves, only to falter in the final weeks of the campaign. 
              
              "Arsenal were quite close to us last season but there is quite a big gap now," admitted Michael Carrick. "They have some great players at the club and for whatever reason, this season has not quite worked for them. 
              
              "At the moment there are four teams who believe they can win this league each season and you have to include Arsenal in that because they were so close last year. But it does not take a lot to slip away. 
              
              "We know how tough it has become and that is why it would be even more satisfying if we can pull it off."
