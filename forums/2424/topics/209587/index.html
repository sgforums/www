But, after the early September international break, United drew with Manchester City and Liverpool, and then lost to Blackburn in September.<br><br>Sir Alex was determined not to suffer the same fate this time around, saying: Â“We are very pleased with the victory, particularly after the internationals.Â”<br><br>Liverpool and Arsenal both dropped points earlier on Saturday, and Sir Alex says post-international fixtures are a perilous time for the top clubs.<br><br>Â“You see the other results today, and it tells you that teams at the top can find it hard after the international matches,Â” he said. Â“The players are away for 14 days and you donÂ’t see them or have time to prepare properly for your next game. The players do come back with a difference to them and you need to get them going.Â”<br><br>One player who needed no such nudge was Ryan Giggs, who scored his second winning goal in as many matches following his strike against Watford last time out.<br><br>Â“Ryan will go down as one of the greatest players of all time,Â” Sir Alex said. Â“The ability has always been there, I think now he is using his experience and maturity. ThatÂ’s pleasing for me because we need players that can do that.Â”<br><br>The likes of Giggs will again be crucial for United in midweek, when Celtic visit Old Trafford in the opening Champions League fixture of the season.<br><br>Sir Alex has called for Â– and is confident of receiving Â– an improved performance on last season, which saw the Reds crash out earlier than expected in the group stages.<br><br>Â“European football beckons again and we want to improve on last year, we will improve,Â” the Reds boss added. Â“It will be a much more mature team this season, and I think you saw that in the final stages of the match against Tottenham.<br><br>Â“We held on for the win and showed good composure and saw the game out. YouÂ’re seeing an increasing maturity about these players.Â”<br><br></div>
