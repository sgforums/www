              manager Sir Alex Ferguson admits he 'fears' the idea of retirement, but
              concedes he is at the penalty shoot-out stage of his career.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://www.setanta.com/Global/Images/sport/football/2008-2009/premier_league/man-utd/fergie_alex_worried480.jpg"><img src="http://www.setanta.com/Global/Images/sport/football/2008-2009/premier_league/man-utd/fergie_alex_worried480.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="169"></a></p>
              <p><span class="main-content">
              </span></p><p>Ferguson had previously announced his intention to
              retire at the end of the 2001/02 season before performing a U-turn to
              continue his association with the Red Devils.</p>
              <p>He has subsequently
              added a string of further honours to the Old Trafford trophy cabinet
              and has enjoyed over 22 years at the United helm.</p>
              <p>Speculation
              persists as to when the 67-year-old will eventually decide to
              relinquish the reins of the Premier League leaders and he acknowledged
              he assesses the situation on an annual basis.</p>
              <p>However, the Scot
              also revealed the three factors which will determine when is the right
              time to step down, despite outlining his concerns about retiring.</p>
              <p><span class="main-content">
              </span></p><p>"When I reached 60, I asked myself the question," Ferguson told <em>L'Equipe Magazine</em>. "I almost left.</p>
              <p>"But I quickly realised, with my family, that it was a mistake. Today, I fear the idea of retiring.</p>
              <p>"I have been on the train for so long that when I get off I fear my system will collapse.</p>
              <p>"I have decided not to ask myself the question any more.</p>
              <p>"Three
              things can make me stop. 1. My health. 2. If I don't take pleasure any
              more. 3. If I don't have the strength for new challenges any more.</p>
              <p>"Each summer, I have a look at those three things. I go to my doctor first. I had a pacemaker set up four or five years ago.</p>
              <p>"Today, I am playing the penalty shoot-out of my managerial career. I know that. The rest is decided between me and me.</p>
              <p>"I
              see my doctor every summer. He says 'boss, you are 67. You will have
              more and more back pains. Getting up in the morning sometimes won't be
              easy'.</p>
              <p>"This is the penalty shoot-out."</p>

              <p>Excuses. Just pack your bags and call it a day. Man U have contacted me and said I am the guy for your job after you call it quits. From what I have written in another thread;</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>Once SAF steps down, Man U will hire me as their manager. Then I will release all the first team players and sign Alam Shah, Indra Shadan, Daniel Bennett, Aide Iskander, S. Subramani, Lionel Lewis, Peres De Oliveria, John Wilkinson, Ahmad Latiff, Kenji Arai, Toh Guo'An, Therdsak Chaiman, Mustafiq Fahrudin and so on. They will be my first team squad and compete in England and Europe. I will also build a state-of-the-art stadium with a seating capacity of 2500, thats right, 2500! Old Trafford will be demolished immediately after the stadium is built. All tickets will cost only 5 pounds, extremely cheap for a Premiership team! With every 5 pounds ticket bought, we will give one 375ml bottle of Johnny Walker Black Label and free potato crisps. There will also be a lucky draw which will choose one lucky winner to drive away with a Jaguar worth at least 120,000 pounds. The second price will be a holiday package to either Japan, S.Korea or Taiwan for 2 for 8 days and 20,000 pounds spending cash for each person. Worth around 55,000 pounds. The 3rd price will be 10 years season ticket to Man U's home ground and 15,000 pounds spending cash. Rest of the prizes up to the 20th winner will be 6 years season ticket and 3000 pounds spending cash for each. Every home game we try to make the 2500 fans happy! Also I will sack all the coaching, scouting, medical staff and hire those from Singapore Armed Forces, Home United, Tampines, <span style="color: #000000;">Wycombe Wanderers and Barnet! Yes some of them are in England League 2 and they are really good! Are you excited? Yes, Man U will continue their domination in British and European football under me! <img src="http://sgforums.com/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></span></p>
