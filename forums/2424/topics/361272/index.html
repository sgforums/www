              Ryan Giggs has hailed Sir Alex Ferguson as the biggest influence on his career and admitted he has picked up the manager's infectious thirst for success.  
              
              With an 11th league title secured, Giggs has cemented his status as the most decorated player in British football history, and believes the boss has been the key to his success.
              
              Ryan said: "I think he's been the biggest influence in my career. He's watched me play since I was 13 so it's been over 20 years.
              
              "I watch him closely- the hunger and desire to keep improving and not just settle for a couple of trophies. Each season he takes up the challenge and wants to win more."
              
              Sir Alex has a fearsome reputation but Giggs revealed that the famous hairdryer treatment appears less frequently these days. 
              
              "Heâ€™s a lot more relaxed and calm now," Ryan added. "When I first came to the club as a 13-year-old Iâ€™d never seen anything like it- the team talks.
              
              "Even with the youth team he would have a go at us at half-time. But I think he enjoys watching this team play and watching this team develop."
              
              And with a third Champions League final appearance imminent, Giggs admitted his desire to win the trophy remains as strong as it was back in 1999. "Winning the Champions League was such a great achievement but when you've tasted it you want to do it again, to get that feeling again."
