            <div class='col-md body'>Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho insists the title race is far from over despite United possessing a commanding lead at the top of the Premiership.<br><br>The Reds moved nine points clear with a 3-1 win over Manchester City on Saturday, and when Chelsea drew 1-1 with Arsenal - one of two games in hand on United - the gap was reduced to eight points.<br><br>But Mourinho, ever bullish about his team's chances, gave a word of warning that the Reds would do well not to be lulled into a false sense of security.<br><br>"Ferguson must be happy now because we can say we dropped two points but if he thinks it's over he's in trouble because it's not," he told BBC Sport.<br><br>"We are here for the fight and I enjoy the fight. It is better to be in front but let's chase them - we can do it."<br><br>Chelsea could reduce the deficit to just two points by the time United take on West Ham at Upton Park on Sunday. The Blues face Newcastle on Wednesday at Stamford Bridge and Everton at Goodison Park hours before the Reds kick off at the Boleyn Ground.<br><br>But the fact that the Reds are in a position to test ChelseaÂ’s resolve when under pressure puts the Blues in unprecedented territory under Mourinho. How they cope remains to be seen.<br><br><img src="http://img240.imageshack.us/img240/2660/picsrvmanutdew2.jpg"><br><br><strong>Title Rivals Compared</strong><br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>United</strong></span><br>Won: 14<br>Drawn: 2<br>Lost: 1<br>Scored: 38<br>Conceded: 9<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Chelsea</strong></span><br>Won: 11<br>Drawn: 3<br>Lost: 2<br>Scored: 26<br>Conceded: 9<br></div>

What you have said may sound reasonable but in a reasonable world, people invest money to make money... don't you agree?<br><br>Chelsea's situation we should put it as "Special" did the players won the title fair and square from the funds provided? How were they assembled in the first place that is questionable agree? ... For example take Newcastle, they are one of the profitable club in England but now that they have quite a number of injuries can they go out and buy another team? Well, no but chelsea can and have. They have bought a player for one position... 6 months, 1 yr he doesn't do well, they go out and buy another... Many clubs would not be able to re-finance another big money player for that same position and will have to make do with what they had... But Chelsea can... So, it bring us to the question again... was the titles won fair and square? Well, Lars-Christer Olsson, chief executive of European football's governing body doesn't seem to think so.<br><br>Cos no genuine investor would continue to put in that kind of money without expecting a return on their investments... And as you have said, "if other teams have the same financial ability, will they not use capitalise on it too."  Well, i am not too sure about that cos people go in to make money and not lose money... that is for sure. But one thing i do know and that is... No other teams have that financial ability as of now.<br><br>I belief even the Pool takeover would not spend money like that base on DIC's track record that they invest to make money and not to lose it...<br><br>So... this itself should qualify as buying titles when history remembers the chelsea years...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>
