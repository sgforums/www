            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.teamtalk.com//Images/81433.jpg"><br><br><strong>Manchester United full-back Phil Bardsley is set to join Aston Villa on loan for the rest of the season. </strong><br><br>Bardsley is ready to become Villa manager Martin O'Neill's first capture of the January transfer window on Monday - the day after the FA Cup third round clash between the sides at Old Trafford. The 21-year-old was on loan at Rangers for the first half of the campaign but became surplus to requirements at Ibrox.<br><br>O'Neill is keen to strengthen his back four and right-back Bardsley's arrival would allow former skipper Olof Mellberg to revert to his preferred role in the centre of defence. But it could put a question mark over the future of Northern Ireland skipper Aaron Hughes, who has struggled to regain his place after recovering from injury.<br><br>O'Neill is aware he has to bring in new blood to freshen up a squad which he admits has been pushed to the limit during the opening half of the campaign. In an ideal world he would like to sign quality players on long-term contracts who can help Villa to re-emerge as a potent force after years in the doldrums. But if that is not possible then O'Neill is looking at short-term captures and Bardsley would fit the bill.<br><br>O'Neill said: "We have been tested to the limit and the players have done remarkably well. Even if we wanted to try and rotate a bit we haven't had the ability to do so. "We could do with a little bit of help. The same group of players have gone through all the games and I would imagine we would have had less chance to rotate than most.<br><br>"That is not to evoke a lot of sympathy. That's our position and we are trying to put it right. "We might get players in during January and might still have the same problem in February and that's the way the season goes, but we would be better off having a bigger squad."<br><br></div>
