              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">MANCHESTER UNITED misfit Anderson last night admitted: I'm not fit to wear the 
              shirt.</h2>
              <p class="article">But the burly Brazilian is vowing to return to the lean, mean figure that 
              wowed fans at Porto before his move to Old Trafford in 2007.</p>
              <p class="article">Anderson has failed to deliver a goal threat from midfield with just one 
              strike in 96 appearances - in United's 3-1 victory at Spurs earlier this 
              season.</p>
              <p class="article">He admitted: "I'd be lying if I said I wasn't disappointed in my goal 
              performance at United. In fact it makes me sad.</p>
              <p class="article">"And one of my first objectives is to get back to the condition I was in at 
              Porto, then start scoring goals which decide matches because that's vital 
              for any player's career.</p>
              <p class="article">"I know that a footballer of my ability, who is accustomed to playing an 
              attacking role and is used to scoring goals regularly, must be sad to only 
              score a goal every six months.</p>
              <p class="article">"But I must not let myself feel dispirited. I need a run of games where I'm 
              doing well."</p>
              <p class="article">Anderson, 21, knows he could struggle to stay in the first team unless he 
              produces some explosive form soon - especially after United's shock 1-0 FA 
              Cup defeat by Leeds.</p>
              <p class="article">And the midfielder, who came to England in a £35million joint deal with Porto 
              team-mate Nani, is well aware bigger names than him have tried and failed to 
              make the grade at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p class="article">He added: "Some great players haven't managed to do well at United because 
              it's such a demanding club.</p>
              <p class="article">"I know you must have a big heart. It's what the guys who have been here the 
              longest pass on to us. We are trying to get into football's history books - 
              that's part of what makes United the way it is."</p>
              <p class="article">Anderson faces a battle to win over Alex Ferguson and the United faithful once 
              and for all. But he is used to tackling challenges head-on.</p>
              <p class="article">He revealed: "I grew up on Rubem Berta in Porto Alegre, which is a very tough 
              place.</p>
              <p class="article">"Very few manage to live a good life unless they take up the drugs trade, are 
              good students or play football.</p>
              <p class="article">"I wasn't a great student and drugs weren't for me because I didn't want to 
              die young. I just preferred to play football.</p>
              <p class="article">"At 13, I was already part of the Brazil youth team. By then I was really 
              street-smart and knew what I wanted."</p>
              <p class="article">Anderson also revealed the part former United star Cristiano Ronaldo played in 
              persuading him to come to Old Trafford.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: "Ronaldo was always telling me 'Come over here because you are the 
              type of player for Manchester United'.</p>
              <p class="article">"I was having a great season for Porto, playing really well and we were about 
              to play Chelsea in the Champions League when I broke my leg.</p>
              <p class="article">"That was the most difficult moment of my life. Then five games after my 
              return, I moved to United. It was out of this world."</p>
              <p class="article">United face Birmingham tonight and boss Ferguson has accused Brum's former 
              owners David Sullivan and David Gold of holding the club back.</p>
              <p class="article">They ran the show at St Andrew's until they sold to Carson Yeung in September.</p>
              <p class="article">Fergie said: "The old regime were set in their ways about financing the team.</p>
              <p class="article">"There never seemed to be any understanding how big Birmingham could be."</p>

              <p>Please stay Anderson. You are just 22 and will have plenty of time to fulfill your potential. An attacking midfielder role is one of the hardest position to fill and most players are usually very matured (25yr old) and well experienced. Anderson didn't have a run of games over the past 2 years nor was he played in his usual position. Most of the time, he was played as a holding midfielder or used as Scholes legs in a 3 man midfield.</p>
              <p>Honestly, he is the only CM we have with the potential to be world class.</p>
              <p>Scholes - Legend and England finest midfielder of his generation. But he no longer has the legs</p>
              <p>Carrick - Wonderful passer of the ball. An EPL Class player but certainly not world class</p>
              <p>Flecther - Good holding midfielder. Excellent squad player</p>
              <p>Owen Hargreaves - World class holding midfield on ability alone. But injury has ruined his career in United</p>
              <p>Anderson - One of Europe most exciting AM prospects being forced to play as a holding midfielder. Has great potential.</p>
              <p>Our CM is our weakest link. If you take away Scholes and OH, you are left with a very brittle core. Carrick and Flecther are players we can assure you a Top 2 Finish but certainly not a CL title. Barcelona taught us a good lesson last year in the CM. It speaks volume when United has to play CM against Birmingham 2 CM. It shows that even Fergie knows that we no longer have the strength to repel or launch attacks in the midfield.</p>
              <p>A world class AM CM is a must buy.</p>

              <p>Excellent Buy: Evra, Vidic, Valencia, Larsson (loan), Tevez (loan), Ronaldo, Rooney, Rafael</p>
              <p>Flops: Nani, Berbatov, Foster, Tosic - buys for first XI but flopped</p>
              <p>Average Buys: Park, Carrick, Anderson - I see average buys as the purchase of squad players or players with immense potential.</p>
              <p>SAF did have a pretty good transfer record. The question is whether can we count on transfers to save us when we lack $$$ to buy quality.</p>

              <p>Nani is from Sporting Lisbon. Anderson was signed because they share the same agent. The news sound bogus leh. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Anyway, if this is really his confession, he'd better buck up, put in more effort than others and learn from the master of pass and shot - Paul Scholes.</p>
