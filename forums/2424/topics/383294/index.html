              <p>“Ledley will not be fit,” said Redknapp. “We want to make sure he’s alright, Woody’s had an injection in his groin and Luka was moving much, much better in training.</p>
              <p>“We are looking forward to going to Old Trafford. I can change a few players around, players who have trained hard and showed a good attitude around the club.</p>
              <p>“There’s a whole group who have been with me and the chance to make a few changes and see what we can do is there.</p>
              <p>“We want to get to Wembley if we can, it’s a great day out. But it’s a tough week and gives me the chance to look at one or two players.”</p>
              <p>Ferguson serves another touchline ban for his comments about referee Alan Wiley, but Redknapp does not believe it will make a difference.</p>
              <p>“I don’t think it will affect the team,” added Redknapp. “All the shouting and the screaming in the world makes no difference. Him being on the touchline won’t make a difference. It didn’t make a difference at Portsmouth on Saturday.”</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson said recently that he is finding it increasingly difficult to keep young Darron Gibson happy. It will be considerably more difficult from now on.</strong></p>
              <p>The Republic of Ireland midfielder has impressed his manager so often on the training field in recent weeks that Ferguson has become a little uncomfortable that he can not offer him much Premier League football.</p>
              <p>After seeing the 22-year-old score two sumptuous goals from distance to ease United into the last four of the Carling Cup, Ferguson now has reason to be grateful, especially after the question marks that were left hanging over his young players in the wake of last week's home defeat to Besiktas.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">He also has more reason to try - somehow - to keep Gibson satisfied. How he does it is hard to say. Last night's match-winner has five internationals ahead of him in the pecking order.</p>
              </div>
              <p>Shifting Darren Fletcher, Michael Carrick, Paul Scholes, Anderson and Owen Hargreaves from their place in the queue already looks an impossible task.</p>

              </div>
              <p><strong>Nevertheless, the contribution from a central midfielder who has a habit of scoring spectacular goals won this game for </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>United</strong></span><strong>.</strong></p>
              <p>Gibson played reasonably well for an hour or so against Besiktas last week before fading rapidly. His work in the first half against <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/tottenham-hotspur.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Tottenham </span></a>was certainly very effective.</p>
              <p>United had actually been on the back foot for the opening part of the game as a strong Spurs team endeavoured to notch their first victory at Old Trafford since 1989. But a moment of pure quality from Gibson swung the game United's way and it turned out to be a definitive change of direction.</p>
              <p>United's Brazilian midfielder Anderson did well to keep possession down the left-hand side and then he funnelled the ball infield to Gibson, who drove a perfect shot along the ground and away from Tottenham goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes into the far corner.</p>
              <p>Gibson is 6ft 2in and powerfully built, something that manifests itself in his shooting. He delivered a telling strike in an FA Cup tie against Southampton last season and another goal from outside the penalty area to decide the final game of United's league season at Hull - the only Premier League match he has started for his club.</p>
              <p>His second goal last night was perhaps the pick of his early career at Old Trafford. This time it was 19-year-old centre forward Danny Welbeck who provided the set-up with a lay-off on the edge of the area. Once again Gibson used his right instep and the ball curled away from Gomes high into the goal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/12/01/article-1232416-076D0222000005DC-907_468x320.jpg" alt="Darron Gibson (right) scores" width="468" height="320">
              <p class="imageCaption">Master blaster: Gibson (right) smashes in the first goal of the quarter-final</p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>Ferguson said: 'I thought Gibson and Anderson were the stars of the show. Gibson is now one of the players who can really shoot from outside the area. His second goal in particular was excellent.</strong></p>
              <p>'I actually thought we were a little fortunate in the first half. I thought Tottenham were the better team before we scored.'</p>
              <p>Ferguson's assessment was correct. Tottenham looked strong on paper and started purposefully, with Gareth Bale worrying Gary Neville with his advances from left back and Jermain Defoe and Robbie Keane looking the quick-thinking footballers they are.</p>
              <p>They did find chances hard to come by, however. The 21-year-old Belgian defender, Ritchie de Laet, blocked one Defoe shot after Bale found the England striker with a terrific cross to the far post and then central defender Nemanja Vidic showed how valuable he is to Ferguson's team by shepherding Keane away from goal when Defoe found his strike partner with a pass from deep.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>Much of Tottenham's football was ambitious and progressive but many of their attacks tended to break down when they reached the penalty box. Indeed, not until Bale found David Bentley 12 yards out on the hour-mark did Tomasz Kuszczak have to make a save of note. He did on that occasion with both hands.</strong></p>
              <p>Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp professed to be disappointed and suggested that his players did not rise to the occasion. 'It was like a practice match,' he said. 'There was no atmosphere in the stadium or in the game. There were no tackles and we never seemed to get going.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><a class="lightboxPopupLink" href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/12/01/article-1232416-076D5B9F000005DC-850_468x246_popup.jpg"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/12/01/article-1232416-076D5B9F000005DC-850_468x246.jpg" alt="young ones" width="468" height="246"> </a></div>
              <p><em>'This was a cup quarter-final and I expected it to be an occasion but it wasn't. I don't really know what to say. I'm very disappointed.'</em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p><strong>For Tottenham, a route towards Wembley - where they lost last season's final to United - has been blocked and Redknapp must work on a way to beat the bigger teams. They have lost to United (twice), Chelsea and Arsenal this season.</strong></p>
              <p>United, meanwhile, are again dangerously close to the final of a competition they don't take too seriously. Ferguson will continue to field his young players in the last four, even if they are drawn against neighbours Manchester City, who host Arsenal tonight.</p>
              <p>Last night Gibson, Welbeck, De Laet and Co proved themselves more than capable. And if Ferguson cares to examine last week's newspapers closely he will find that precious few people actually suggested they were not in the first place.</p>

              <p>well, this will bore well for SAF if he ever want to bring in any more youths cause he showed that he is willing to blood this youngers be it a UCL or a carling cup, and importantly, he protects them even when they did not get a win, and lose the unbeaten home records. that's key.</p>
              <p>It boosts the youngsters' belief in SAF, and even want to return his affection for them.</p>
              <p>A win win for the team/manager/youngsters.</p>
              <p>btw, I hope Gibson can take over Scholes, given his ability to hit these rockets.</p>
