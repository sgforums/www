              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>But who is the teen wonder?</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>1)</strong> Federico Macheda was born in Rome on 22 August 1991, making him just 17 on his Premier League debut.</p>
              <p><strong>2) </strong>His team mates know him as Kiko</p>
              <p><strong>3)</strong> He started out in Lazio’s youth system but joined Manchester United in 2007. He signed professional forms last August.</p>
              <p><strong>4)</strong> Kiko started out in the U18s, scoring on his debut against Barnsley. He ended last season as top scorer with 12 goals, including this strike against Everton.</p>
              <p><strong>5)</strong> Macheda was part of United’s 2008 Milk Cup-winning team, scoring in the final </p>
              <p><strong>6)</strong> After making his reserve team debut in February 2008, he has appeared more often this season. Stepping up to the reserves has suited him – 10 goals making him top scorer in the Barclays Premier Reserve League (North), including a hat trick against Newcastle on Monday which helped push him into Sir Alex Ferguson’s thinking for the Villa match.</p>
              <p><strong>7)</strong> Perhaps we shouldn’t be surprised Macheda turned into a supersub – the reserves are managed by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.</p>
              <p><strong>8)</strong> Macheda was added to United’s 30 man Champions League squad at the start of February</p>
              <p><strong>9)</strong> At the final whistle on Sunday he had 640 fans on Facebook.</p>
              <p><strong>10)</strong> His impressive goal against Villa was no fluke – enjoy some more of his silky skills here…</p>

              <h1 class="sIFR-ignore">Lazio chief: We couldn't keep Macheda</h1>
              <p><img src="http://www.setanta.com/Global/Images/sport/football/2008-2009/premier_league/man-utd/macheda-train.jpg" alt="" width="479" height="270"></p>
              <p><strong>In the wake of Federico Macheda’s remarkable debut display for
              Manchester United on Sunday, Lazio president Claudio Lotito has called
              for Italian clubs to be afforded more protection regarding their young
              talents. </strong></p>
              <p>Macheda inscribed his name into the national consciousness with a
              wonderful winning goal in injury time of the five-goal thriller against
              Aston Villa, taking just 30 minutes of professional football to open
              his account for United.</p>
              <p>While his crucial input into United’s title challenge has made
              unexpected headlines in England, the Lazio staff are well aware of the
              player’s potential having seen him lured away from their youth setup
              aged just 16 in September 2007.</p>
              <p>The manner of Macheda’s departure is hardly novel – United and their
              Premier League rivals have frequently exploited contractual laws across
              the continent to recruit the finest young talents available and indeed
              Sir Alex Ferguson signed another young Italian, David Petrucci, from
              Lazio’s great rivals Roma in June.</p>
              <p>Now Lotito is adamant that changes must be made to the current
              system that affords Premier League clubs the opportunity to sign
              players from abroad at the age of 16.</p>
              <p>"We tried in every way to stop Manchester United from taking away
              our player but the present Italian regulations don't give you any type
              of defence," said Lotito.</p>
              <p>"In reality we find ourselves in front of a proper cattle market.</p>
              <p>"I talked repeatedly with Macheda's parents, we established a dialogue, but it was not possible to do anything.</p>
              <p>“We could not compete with United's offer. That is not right, we
              have to be provided with more reliable and concrete rules than those
              which govern Italian clubs."</p>
              <p>Uefa president Michel Platini has declared his strong opposition to
              players moving abroad at such a young age and previously instructed the
              European Commission to address the matter.</p>

              <p><strong>Federico Macheda's father reckons his son can become the new Marco van Basten after his stunning debut on Sunday. </strong></p>
              <p>The Manchester United rookie was thrown on against Aston Villa
              as Sir Alex Ferguson gambled on the untried 17-year-old to add punch to
              his attack.</p>
              <p>Macheda impressed and came up trumps in stoppage time with an
              exquisite turn and curling shot beyond the despairing reach of Brad
              Friedel to spark wild scenes of celebration at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>After running to hug his dad Pasquale, which earned him a
              yellow card, Macheda will have to be content with a place on the bench
              for Tuesday's Champions League clash with Porto.</p>
              <p>However, the praise is ringing in his ears after his crucial strike took United back to the top of the table.</p>
              <p>"Ever since he was a young boy, I have watched my boy and thought of Marco van Basten," Pasquale told The Sun.</p>
              <p>"In the past 18 months, he's developed enormously, physically and technically at United.</p>
              <p>"They have done a fantastic job.</p>
              <p>"He looked like he had been playing for years - even alongside Cristiano Ronaldo, he did not look like a rookie."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lol, okay this might be too big a praise already.</p>

              I think Rooney is better than him at the same age.
              
              Rooney scored on his debut against Everton in 2002 season, he also scored for england on his 17 years debut too. Rooney scored a hattrick for Man Utd in the CL in 2004/2005 season.
              
              But i rate him better than wellbeck or gibson. He is one for the future.
