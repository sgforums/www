Precisely that I know they are capable of better football that I'm pissed off at the way they played yesterday.. It is really ridiculous to have that kind of attitude to play at a Champions League QF match like that.. Roy Keane would probably be pissed too.. There really wasn't desire to pressure the Roma players.. 28(10) shots as compared to Man U's 9(4) (courtesy of soccernet).. I don't have to come out with the stats to say that Roma was having a shooting training session last night.. Really its very exhaustive and no point I flame them, not as if they can hear me.. But I hope that each and everyone who played realised that they had one helluva shietty game.. Only worth the praise I felt was the goal. Brilliant counter..
