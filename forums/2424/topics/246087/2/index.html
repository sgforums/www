            <div class='col-md body'>I think to be fair, United dug deep and only lost by a goal cushion. It could have been more as they played majority of the match 1 man down.<br><br>Scholes has been famed for his mis-timed tackles and those 2 that we seen this morning cost him a place in the return leg.<br><br>Like i've mentioned in many threads, O'Shea is at most, a good benched Utility player. He's far too slow, not very agile and gives the ball away too cheaply. But United is lacking defensive players at the moment and Scholes' departure last nite certainly caused alot of problems for the backline.<br><br>Howver on the other note, despite this morning's disappointing result, United has 2 positive factors to look forward to: 1. It's only a goal lead by Roma and United grabbed an important away goal. 2. The retun of Saha, a boost in the striker department.<br><br>Let's move on and look forward to the retun leg at the Theatre of Dreams.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Cheers.<br>CK</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I didnt watch the match but was tracking the score - 2-1 with 10 men is quite heroic i must say - considering fact that they are down 10 men for most part of the match &amp; must be desperately defending for their lives.<br><br>I think to win 1-0 at OT is not a problem but the main worry is, they shldn't let Roma score at OT.  But Man U this season has always make things difficult for themselves - during the group stage, they were 1-0 down at OT before rallying for that must-win to get through.<br><br>Against Blackburn, they are 1-0 down before rallying back.  Think back, its just like their season in 1999 where they win the treble.  They were twice down against the italians before coming back to overturn the score.  In the finals, they are down with minutes to go before scoring twice....similarities huh?  Its their season again?<br><br>Actually looking at the other result between chelsea and valencia - chelsea is more stressed.  They conceded an away goal, and have to go Valencia needing to win.<br><br>Now, the only team thru is Liverpool.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In a way its not such a bad thing actually... If it was a draw match, united's way of doing things would be to defend in the 2nd leg and hope to score on the break but this would also allow Roma to play their game. But now that Roma are leading, they may start the game by defending most of the first half and not try to attack too much.<br><br>It could still be good for united as this result could actually fire up united as they need a result or at least the first goal... This way, they may actually start the match playing to their own style rather than hold back most of the time... And should they manage to get that 1st goal, Roma would be very nervous and have to come out more.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think SAF must have sensed that they could win the return leg - they needed only 1-0 to win.  Its a difficult match and although reading TNP, the reporters did not have good thing to say abt the team's peformance.<br><br>i din watch the match, hence I cannot comment on their performance but as I said earlier - getting 2-1 (in fact scoring a goal) with one man down is remarkable.  The valuable thing is, we have an away goal.<br><br>I think Man U is having lady luck with them this season, almost seemingly dead against Liverpool, Liverpool cannot score and O'shea can score to win.  Down against blackburn can come back to win 4-1.  So, lets see Roma, what we have install for them....</div>
