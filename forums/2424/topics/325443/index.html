              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Sir Alex Ferguson saw his Manchester United side
              lift the Vodacom Challenge trophy thanks to a 4-0 win over Kaizer
              Chiefs in Pretoria.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Ryan Giggs and Wayne Rooney both found the target at the Loftus Versfeld Stadium as did Tom Cleverley and Fraizer Campbell.</p>
              <p>United manager Ferguson used the showpiece match in South Africa
              to mix his side up with a game against Portsmouth to come in Nigeria on
              Sunday.</p>
              <p>Apart from 18-year-old Cleverley, two other promising teenagers, Craig Cathcart and Rodrigo Possebon were also given run-outs.</p>
              <p>It was a comfortable victory for United as the opposition looked weary after defeating Orlando Pirates on Thursday.</p>
              <p>Chiefs had defeated United two years ago on penalties but they were outplayed this time around.</p>
              <p>They could not cope with Rooney's intelligence and movement, no
              matter how hard they tried. He was targeted several times in the game
              but he managed to keep his temper in check.</p>
              <p>Not only did he cap a hard shift by scoring, he also set up Cleverley's goal.</p>
              <p>United were never really troubled and could have made the
              breakthrough as early as the fourth minute when Giggs released Rooney
              but he sent his chip marginally over the bar.</p>
              <p>Rooney carved out another opening in the 16th minute but Itumeleng Khune made a comfortable save.</p>
              <p>Rooney was looking lively and got away from Jonathan Quartey in the 20th minute only for Khune to kick it clear.</p>
              <p>Siphiwe Tshabalala went close with a free-kick before Giggs made
              the breakthrough in the 40th minute with a shot high into the net
              following a cross from Lee Martin.</p>
              <p>Rooney was caught by Quartey a minute into the second half as he tried to take advantage of the defender's short back pass.</p>
              <p>The England striker was unhappy at being targeted every time he had possession but got on with the job in hand.</p>
              <p>Giggs almost added a second in the 47th minute but Khune made a good block and Rooney sent the rebound into the side-netting.</p>
              <p>Cathcart then got clear at the back post when Giggs floated the ball in but headed wide.</p>
              <p>United's pressure paid off in the 57th minute when they went 2-0
              ahead after Rooney slipped the ball past Khune after being set up by
              Danny Simpson.</p>
              <p>United scored a third five minutes later and it was a moment to savour for Cleverley, who had replaced Possebon at half-time.</p>
              <p>Brought up in Basingstoke, he clipped the ball home at the near post after Rooney had headed on a cross from Simpson.</p>
              <p>The United players raced to congratulate Cleverley, who looked slightly embarrassed by all the fuss.</p>
              <p>He had only arrived in South Africa on Thursday along with
              Cathcart and Possebon after Ferguson decided he could do with some
              reinforcements with two games in two days.</p>
              <p>Substitute Campbell almost added a fourth in the 82nd minute
              only for Chiefs captain Jimmy Tau to clear off the line just as he was
              about to celebrate.</p>
              <p>Campbell, who scored 15 goals on loan at Hull last season, made
              no mistake four minutes later to put the seal on an emphatic win.</p>

              <h1>United Youngster 'Speechless' Over Debut</h1>
              <h2>One of the latest products of the Manchester United academy, Tom
              Cleverley, scored a goal in a friendly against Kaizer Chiefs, and wants
              to build on his experience in the first team.</h2>
              <p>Tom Cleverley made a second half substitute appearance for the Red
              Devils in South Africa and within 15 minutes he converted a Rooney
              knockdown to complete a scoring debut.<br><br>Speaking to the club's official channel <em>MUTV</em>, Cleverley said: "It's been an unbelievable day and I am speechless." <br><br>"I
              came on and did quite well and got a goal - I feel very proud. I've
              done well in my first match, but I want to stay there and carry it on
              into the season." <br><br>On the subject of his team-mates, the
              youngster added: "I'm just a down to earth lad from Bradford. To see
              Scholesy come on to play next to me was unbelievable; you have to pinch
              yourself.<br><br>"It's great to play with Tevez and Rooney - it helps you to raise your game. Hopefully I can continue to do that."<br><br>Cleverley
              will be hoping to see some first-team action this season in the Carling
              Cup, along with Craig Cathcart and Rodrigo Possebon.</p>
