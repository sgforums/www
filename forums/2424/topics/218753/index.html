"It's amazing, 20 years, I don't know where the years have gone! One thing I know is there have been some exciting times and I can reflect on them.<br><br>"I think at the end of the day we've got to look forward, the club's always done that and the team has to do it too. The good thing today is that we didn't let it become a carnival or a circus.<br><br>"We played with great professionalism, which is great to see. It's just what I wanted."<br><br>Despite the midweek blip against FC Copenhagen, United's win over Pompey was a fifth straight Premiership win and a ninth from the opening 11 games of the season.<br><br>And the Boss was delighted with the manner of the victory as goals from Louis Saha, Cristiano Ronaldo and Nemanja Vidic accounted for Harry Redknapp's side.<br><br>"It was excellent," he said. "I think the form has been good. We played some good stuff last week (against Bolton) and we've continued with another great performance today.<br><br>"In the first half in particular some of our penetration football was good, we could've scored a lot of goals first and second half. Their goalkeeper has been inspired, he's made three or four fantastic saves and we could have scored more.<br><br>"Gary (Neville) could have scored a hat-trick. I know that's asking the impossible but he could've had one! Nontheless there was some good stuff, it was great."<br><br><a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=376429" rel="nofollow">http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&amp;newsid=376429</a></div>
