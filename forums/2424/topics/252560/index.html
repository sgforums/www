            <div class='col-md body'>MIKEL JOHN OBI has taunted Manchester United by claiming: You donÂ’t deserve the title.<br><br>The Â£16million Chelsea star, who snubbed a move to Old Trafford after a bitter row, insists the Blues have been the better side.<br><br>The Nigerian said: Â“We deserve to win the title because of our hard work, determination, the injury crisis and everything.<br><br>Â“I think United have been lucky at some points this season while weÂ’ve had a long list of injuries to cope with. Overall, weÂ’ve been the better team.<br><br>Â“On the strength of our performances we would be worthy champions, because we gave it our all.Â”<br><br>Chelsea, who are at Arsenal tomorrow, are five points adrift of United, who face local rivals City today.<br><br>But Mikel, 20, insists the title race is not yet over. He said: Â“WeÂ’ve played more games than any club in England and still we are showing our ability to win games under any circumstance.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s only a few days to go but I am confident the title will remain at Stamford Bridge. We deserve it.Â”<br><br>United would need to lose at City for Chelsea to have a chance of staging an upset when the two sides clash at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday.<br><br>Mikel added: Â“There is a possibility they could slip up.<br><br>Â“Football is certainly an unpredictable game and anything could still happen.Â”<br><br>Mikel joined Chelsea after a huge transfer wrangle, with United getting Â£12m compensation after he initially signed for the Reds.<br><br>He added: Â“This is where I wanted to be and the manager is someone I adore.Â”<br><br>His boss is already plotting for next season with the help of skipper John Terry and vice-captain Frank Lampard.<br><br>Mourinho said: Â“We are having our meetings and I have been speaking with players.<br><br>Â“I have been trying to explain the vision of the future. We have already the pre-season plans on the walls of the dressing room.Â”<br><br>But Mourinho added: Â“This season is not over. We have four matches to play, four matches where we can win two trophies. We can win one, or we can win none.Â”<br><br><a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2002390000-2007200794,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2002390000-2007200794,00.html</a><br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Right...our defence is so godly a few weeks ago man...And if im not wrong he taunted Liverpool ahead of their UCl clash too...</div>

Ferguson's offer came in much too low for PSV's and/or Robben's liking; Eindhoven chairman Harry van Raaij told Manchester United the most that their Â€7 million offer would buy them was a shirt with Robben's autograph. Almost immediately, Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich offered Â€ 18 million (Â£ 12.1 million), and PSV accepted.[9] The rest of his season with PSV was disappointing. He injured his hamstring twice and missed several games.[10][11] By the end of the season, Robben scored five times in 23 Eredivisie matches.</blockquote></span></div>

It really is a dilema to choose IF Robben was in Manu at that time. Depending on the time 'supposedly' Robben went to Manu before Ronaldo then maybe Ronaldo may not be on the fast rise as of now. IF 'supposedly' Robben went to Manu after Ronaldo joined, then its a battle for both of them.<br><br>In any case, its also considered good that Robben and Ronaldo are not in the same team (in this case Manu or Chelsea) for both of them have ample space and time to prove themselves.<br><br>For the case of Robben, he should strengthen himself and learn how to take care of himself so as not to injure himself so easily. I really miss his mazy runs and trickeries. He is the livewire of Chelsea besides Joe Cole.<br><br>Missed the 4-1-2-2-1 formation with both of them on the flanks.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
