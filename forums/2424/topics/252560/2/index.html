            <div class='col-md body'>Your capy-tan begs to differ:<br><br><strong>Trry: Reds worthy winners</strong><br><br>Chelsea captain John Terry has confirmed his side will form a respectful guard of honour when United travel to Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night.<br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson's side saluted the Blues in identical style after their first Premiership title triumph in 2005, and Terry is ready to return the salutatory gesture.<br><br>"The Manager has said already they will get the guard of honour which they did to us," said the England skipper. "Looking at some faces, it could not have been nice.<br><br>"We have to go through that and we fully respect them as players and individuals. We'll do it holding our heads up high."<br><br>Jose Mourinho's side had looked set to push United all the way in the Premiership, but dropping points against Bolton and Arsenal in their last two games ended their hopes of a third straight title.<br><br>Terry concedes that nobody at Stamford Bridge foresaw such a climax to the season, having expected United to come a cropper at Everton or Manchester City.<br><br>"They are champions, and congratulations to them for that," he said. "They have been very good this year.<br><br>"You look at Man Utd, and their games - Everton away, Man City away - and expected them maybe to slip up in one of those games, but the one they did was against Middlesbrough at home the week before.<br><br>"It was similar with us, against Bolton at home - we were expected to win and then have a difficult game at Arsenal, which we did.<br><br>"The games we thought we would win and the ones we thought Man Utd would win, did not go that way. There was a little bit of a twist at the end but unfortunately we are not there."<br><br>The Chelsea skipper is already looking ahead to next season, but admits that United are worthy champions this term.<br><br>"I am sure they will sign players and strengthen again, a lot of teams will, but we will certainly push them all the way again," he said.<br><br>"We will get the season over and then can fully assess it. No-one can take anything away from Man Utd.<br><br>"They have been awesome and some of their players have been fantastic this year. But from our point of view it was all very disappointing."<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Despite the bitter rivalry between Jose Mourinho and Alex Ferguson, England ace Cole maintains United will be given some respect when they walk out on to the pitch.</strong><br><br>The Blues midfielder said: Â“They clapped us out when we won the league and that took a lot of dignity. I am sure we will repay the favour. Â“There is a good rivalry between the two clubs. We have a lot of respect for them. Â“They won the league and fair play to them. We are going to come back next year stronger.<br><br>Â“Sometimes in defeat you have to be graceful and say that, over the course, maybe United did deserve it. No one is going to feel sorry for us because we have a big squad and now we will pick ourselves up.<br><br>Â“We will crack on, we still have the FA Cup to go for. It just makes me love Chelsea even more.Â” Cole, 25, reckons his stunning goal in last seasonÂ’s 3-0 win over Alex FergusonÂ’s side Â— the day Chelsea wrapped up their second title Â— is his happiest footballing moment.<br><br>A year later and United have got their own back. Cole added: Â“That goal was my best moment. Â“It was a special day for me. We proved we were no flash in the pan by winning our second consecutive title.Â” The Blues ace is now determined to ruin UnitedÂ’s Double hopes when the two teams meet again in the first FA Cup final at the new Wembley.
