              <h2>Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson has launched an
              astonishing attack on Real Madrid, claiming that the Spanish champions
              only signed Gabriel Heinze in the hope of luring his good friend
              Cristiano Ronaldo to the Bernabeu.</h2>
              <p>According to Sir Alex, Madrid only pursued the signing of the
              Argentinean defender in the hope of eventually convincing Cristiano
              Ronaldo to join him in Spain. <br><br>Ferguson claims that Madrid were
              interested in signing Ronaldo as far back as 2007, when Heinze made his
              highly publicised transfer. <br><br>In December's issue of GQ,
              reprinted in the Times, Ferguson denounces his Spanish rivals as
              'General Franco's club', and claimed that the Spanish champions acted
              as they pleased in the transfer market. <br><br>He said: “When we sold Gabriel Heinze to Real Madrid we knew it was going to happen, because Ronaldo was very close to Heinze.<br><br>“I
              knew what they were doing. I don’t believe they were interested in
              Heinze - good player though he is. The end-game was to get Ronaldo.<br><br>“What
              made it really obscene was that Madrid, as General Franco’s club, had a
              history of being able to get whoever and whatever they wanted, before
              democracy came to Spain.”</p>

              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1081364" rel="1081364_3" href="/sport/football/article-1081364/EXCLUSIVE-Fergies-talking-rubbish--Heinze-fury-Ronaldo-claim.html"></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson was last night accused of talking 'absolute fiction' by former </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span><strong> star Gabriel Heinze in a row over Cristiano Ronaldo.</strong></p>
              <p>United boss Ferguson suggested this week that Real Madrid signed Heinze last year simply to use his friendship with Ronaldo as a way of luring the winger to the Spanish club. But last night Heinze rubbished his former boss's theory — and insisted the newly- crowned world player of the year would become an even better player if he swapped Old Trafford for the Bernabeu.</p>
              <p>Heinze said: ‘This theory of Ferguson about me going to Real in order to persuade Cristiano to come the following summer is a work of absolute fiction. I am a very good friend of Cristiano Ronaldo. This is true, but he always decides his own future. Cristiano is a clever person and he decides himself what is best for his own life.</p>
              <p>'If he asks me a question about Real then, of course, I will answer, but I'm not a bad influence on him. Ferguson has spoken about me in the last months and I don’t understand this. I thought he had forgotten me. 'He’s the boss at United and any person who protests about anything is marginalised. This was my problem at times when I was there. Ferguson cannot stop my quotes because I’m not now at United.</p>
              <p>'I'm actually convinced Cristiano would offer Madrid even bigger performances than he has at United. That is my opinion and it is normal that I have wanted him to come and play with us here in La Liga.'</p>
              <p>The United manager and Argentina star Heinze parted on bad terms in August last year when the defender joined Real after Fergie had refused to allow the 30-year-old to move to North West rivals Liverpool.</p>
              <p>Yet Ferguson’s suggestion in an interview in <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">GQ</span> magazine that Real signed Heinze — he has played 22 times for the Spaniards — for reasons other than his football ability, have come as a shock. Asked about the Ronaldo saga which dominated United’s summer, Ferguson said: 'It was different for me because I knew it was coming. So I wasn’t surprised.</p>
              <p>'When we sold Heinze to Real Madrid, we knew what was going to happen, because Ronaldo was very close to him. 'I knew what they were doing. I don’t believe they were interested in Heinze — good player though he is. The end-game was to get Ronaldo.'</p>
              <p>The comments of Ferguson, whose side face West Ham tonight, will only add to the tension between United and Real in the wake of the scrap for Ronaldo's services.</p>
