              <p>Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson admits some of his squad involved at the World Cup will miss the start of the new season.</p>
              <p>United's World Cup contingent are not due to report back for training until July 28, leaving them with little time to work on their fitness ahead of their first Premier League game on August 16.</p>
              <p>The Old Trafford outfit have travelled to Chicago for their pre-season US tour without their World Cup players and Ferguson concedes not all the players who represented their countries in South Africa will be ready for the opener against Newcastle.</p>
              <p>"Winning is part of what we have to do here," Ferguson told <em>Sky Sports News</em> about their trip to America.</p>
              <p>"But the main object is to get everyone game time and come back ready, fit to start the season.</p>
              <p>"Even the Community Shield does not come into the agenda in terms of a need to win game.</p>
              <p>"It's always been used at this club as the final part of our preparation.</p>
              <p>"It's on August 8 and then they have internationals during that week, and then we have our first game the following Monday against Newcastle.</p>
              <p>"By that time, after we've surveyed the fitness of the ones who've been in the World Cup because they don't come back until July 28, we'll really know whether any or all of them should play in the opening game.</p>
              <p>"I have a feeling that we'll probably not play them all, but maybe one or two will play."</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong>World Cup players to miss season start</strong><br>United are ready to start their bid to reclaim the Premier League title without any of their World Cup men. United boss Sir Alex Ferguson is considering writing off the six stars on duty in South Africa for at least the first week of the season to ensure they get a rest after a long summer. That means the likes of Wayne Rooney, Patrice Evra and Nemanja Vidic could be absent from the team that face Newcastle in United’s league opener on August 16. Michael Carrick, Park Ji-Sung and new Mexican signing Javier Hernandez are the other players who have been told they do not have to report for pre- season training until July 28.<br><em>Bill Thornton, Daily Star<br><br></em><strong>Ryan Giggs</strong> has an American dream according to <em>The Sun -</em> but while the Welshman talks about "the great lifestyle, good for raising a family" in the States, he is also quoted as saying "I still have a year left. After that maybe I'll be too old" [to end his career in MLS].<br><br>Another United player on Tour 2010, <strong>Mame Biram Diouf</strong>, is linked with a loan move to French club Sochaux in the <em>Daily Mail</em>.</p></div>
