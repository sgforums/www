              <p><strong>It is understood that Sanchez’s representatives met with City officials on Friday to thrash out personal terms for the Chilean international. But in an unexpected twist that will cause alarm at Eastlands, it is believed the agents then had a further meeting, this time with United, yesterday morning. </strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p>Indeed, it is thought that the 22 year-old’s representatives have now indicated that their client would prefer to join United if a deal can be agreed, even though it appeared that a deal was well advanced with their City rivals.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="thirdPar">
              <p>Neither club has yet to agree terms with Udinese, although the Italian club have accepted that Sanchez can leave this summer and is free to discuss a move. Personal terms are not an issue for either Premier League club.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fourthPar">
              <p>It had been thought Udinese would hold out for up to £35.4 million for Sanchez, who can play as a winger or central striker, but it is now accepted that a fee of between £18 million and £26.5 million is more realistic.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fifthPar">
              <p>If United have gazumped City — and it is believed that Sir Alex Ferguson personally intervened in the hope of doing so, having also followed the player for some time — then it will be a severe blow to City, who regarded Sanchez as their key summer signing.</p>
              <div class="body">
              <p>They have tracked Sanchez for months, with officials, including football administrator Brian Marwood, travelling to Italy to monitor his progress.</p>
              <p>Further talks were held with his representatives three weeks ago and since then the club have been confident that a deal was on the verge of being completed.</p>
              <p>Despite City’s vast spending power they will not want to get into a tug-of-war with United over the player. United still have a greater global appeal than City when it comes to signings, even if the latter also qualify for the Champions League next season.</p>
              <p>Concern at Eastlands will have been compounded by manager Roberto Mancini’s admission last night that club captain Carlos Tévez is likely to leave this summer.</p>
              <p>It is understood that City would be prepared to sell Tévez but only if a buying club meet their valuation, believed to be £50 million.</p>
              <p>When asked if he would fight to keep Tévez at the club, Mancini said: “I will fight for every player who wants to stay here but – and this is not just Carlos but others too – it is difficult to keep a player if they don’t want to stay. It is very difficult. So I don’t know.”</p>
              <p>Tévez handed in a transfer request in December but withdrew it after a meeting with chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak.</p>
              <p>Asked whether it would help the team focus on their goals if Tévez clarified his situation publicly, Mancini said: “I don’t know this. Carlos has a contract but we should wait. But I don’t know what will happen with him.”</p>
              <p>There are few clubs that would be able to match City’s fee and Tévez’s wage demands.</p>
              <p>Real Madrid and Internazionale have been reported as interested in the player but, according to sources at City, both clubs have given no indication that they want to sign him.</p>
              <p>Chelsea also have a long-standing interest but are concerned about what the deal would cost.</p>

              <p><strong>Manchester United are going head-to-head with Manchester City in a £55m summer transfer tussle over Alexis Sanchez and Wesley Sneijder.</strong></p>
              <p>United have outlined an £18m offer to Udinese for Chilean winger Sanchez — just weeks after City underlined their desire to sign the player.</p>
              <p>The move comes with City also trying to gatecrash United’s bid for £35m-rated Sneijder, 26, and hoping his Dutch team-mate Nigel de Jong can exert some influence.</p>
              <p>Both deals are currently in United’s favour but City are working hard to persuade the players to come to Eastlands and know they have the greater financial muscle.</p>
              <p>Udinese want close to £32m for Sanchez, 22, who United have followed since he was a teenager at Chilean side Cobreloa. His performances in Serie A have drawn admirers and he impressed for Chile in the World Cup last summer.</p>
