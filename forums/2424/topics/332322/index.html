              <p>Dimitar Berbatov was in the midst of a mini goal draught following his
              high profile Â£30.75million transfer from lily white London side
              Tottenham Hotspur despite providing a delightful assist on his debut.<br> <br> The silky Bulgarian had gone three games without recording a goal and
              then two came at once in Manchester United's 3-0 victory over Aalborg
              in the Champions League.<br> <br> Despite sending the ball over the line on two occasions Berbatov
              struggled to even muster a smile, but he has now explained that he
              wasn't slipping into his old sulky Spurs ways, but ws simply ruing
              earlier opportunities that he had squandered.<br><br>"I did not
              celebrate the first goal because I was still angry with myself for
              missing the first chance," he told the Manchester Evening News.<br><br>"On
              that occasion, my shot was not right at all, in fact I was embarrassed
              by it. When you pay so much money for someone you should score chances
              like that... I was disappointed with the first one. Sometimes in a game
              you might only get one opportunity and I was trying to score.<br><br>"But
              I guess the most important thing was that we won," he added. "The
              pressure is [always] there to score. Hopefully I can deal with that and
              handle it in a positive way."<br><br>"I feel happy playing in this
              team. It is everything I thought it would be. Ryan Giggs has been here
              since the beginning and says he never wanted to go anywhere else. I
              don't want to go anywhere either," the 27-year old concluded.</p>
