            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong>While delighted to see United finally dispose of AC Milan at the fifth attempt on Wednesday night, Sir Alex Ferguson insists his players must not get carried away by their emphatic victory.</strong><br><br>Injuries to key players in the run-up to the second leg made Milan’s already uphill task all the more difficult at Old Trafford and two Wayne Rooney goals, early in each half, put paid to their chances of a Champions League comeback. Sir Alex hailed his side’s professional display, but reiterated the need for calm.<br><br>“Milan are the great example of European winners - they have a fantastic record in the competition and knocking out a team with that great history was important for us and it was certainly an emphatic result," the boss told reporters on Friday.<br><br>“But it’s important that we calm ourselves down a bit especially when you look at their team. They lost Nesta on the morning of the game and then lost Bonera at half-time and had to play Ambrosini at centre-back which was difficult for them. It was like when we played Fulham at the end of last year with no centre-backs. It's not easy.<br><br>“Our performance level was good. The minute we scored the second goal it became better and in fairness I think that goal knocked the stuffing out of them and there wasn’t really a way back after that.<br><br>“So, of course, it was a fantastic result for us, but as I said we need to calm ourselves down a little bit.<br><br>"I’m glad we’re through to the next stages," added the boss. "And it doesn’t matter who you get now though because every game is difficult."</p></div>

              <p>Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson knows his team have the chance to create history and eclipse rivals Liverpool this season.</p>
              <p>United are level with their Merseyside foes on 18 league titles but the Red Devils chief is desperate for his side to claim their 19th and be the first club to win four in a row.</p>
              <p>Ferguson told <em>The Sun</em>: "Winning this 19th league title is very much in my soul.</p>
              <p>"We are chasing four titles in a row - that would be fantastic.</p>
              <p>"And if we get the 19th it would be the most in the league's history. We've got a chance."</p>
