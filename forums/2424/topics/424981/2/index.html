              <p>It's not worth it for Cahill to join Utd only to serve as a backup.</p>
              <p>If the transfer rumours are true, it'd be better for his career to join Arsenal.</p>
              <p>If Utd truely want him, they've gotta gurantee him a first-team spot.</p>

              <p>Loan Smalling out? That is a first I have heard of it...</p>
              <p>Smalling is easily the better of the 3 back-up this season... (Brown, Evans and himself)</p>
              <p>Smalling also add to the 8 quota needed should Brown is let go, Gibson is sold, Scholes leave, Hargreaves hang up his boots, Owen don't get his contract renew and etc... So loaning Smalling out I don't think it will happen after his performance this season... And don't forget, Neville's retirement also means 1 lesser for the quota...</p>
              <p>Of course Cahill can always come in as a ready made but he will know he has to fight for his place like everyone else... He may be good, but we have yet to see him play in the highest pressure moments... So coming in and learning from Rio and Vidic would be a real good lesson for his future.</p>
              <p>Anyway, the Arsenal rumour is just about that, a rumour. Since when have Wenger paid $20m for a player let alone a defender? And Wenger don't like English remember... lol.</p>
              <p>And it seems Fergie never guarantee anyone first team... If the likes of Tevez and Berbatov can be drop, why not Cahill?</p>
              <p>The guy would probably jump at the chance if a top 4 side came in for him... Chance to win title, play in Europe's CL, double his salary...</p>

              <p>Knowing Fergie, he likes to say something then spring a suprise later... Then the rest of the players can suddenly feel extra confident or motivated by the news... I just belief he don't want Rio to be pick for England thats all... lol.</p>
              <p>If Rio retire from England, it would make him even happier... lol.</p>
              <p>Suddenly Rio return and play against Chelsea in the CL... lol.</p>
