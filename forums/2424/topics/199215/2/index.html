Of course when your team is dominating the title for a period of time, anyone would be proud and boast about their team's achievements. Now looks like Chelsea is dominating, their fans are becoming the arrogant ones and Man U fans are not so arrogant it seems. Who knows if Liverpool were to dominate, dare you not say the fans would not be snobbish and mock their rivals?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
