            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Dimitar Berbatov has been at <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchesterunited">Manchester United</a> for only three months but that is already long enough for the club's
              supporters to recognise that he can prick a variety of different
              emotions. There are times when he will beguile his audience and leave
              them longing for the ball to be played to him carelessly just so he can
              jab out a leg and demonstrate that Velcro touch. But then there are the
              days when he pulls on those black gloves, greases back his hair and
              does so little that it is difficult for fans to comprehend how he can
              force Carlos Tevez out of the side.</p>
              <p>"I'd rather wash Berba's kit
              than Edwin van der Sar's," was the title of one website rant after
              United had beaten Sunderland 1-0 last Saturday in a match so one-sided
              the home goalkeeper did not have a single shot to save. The allegation
              was, in essence, a neglect of duty, that Berbatov had not covered a
              tennis court's worth of grass, that he was work-shy and needed to bring
              himself in line with the rest of the team. The roar when Tevez came off
              the bench had told another story.</p>
              <p>These are still the embryonic
              stages of Berbatov's time in Manchester and, lest it be forgotten, the
              striker has already given us one moment of theatre that is about as
              good as it ever gets in professional sport. Nobody who was at Old
              Trafford on October 29 and saw, in real time, the way in which he set
              up Cristiano Ronaldo's second goal against West Ham United will ever
              tire of wanting to see it replayed. It was one of those rare moments in
              football that seemed to defy gravity.</p>
              <p>Yet it is also undeniably
              true that the state of the Bulgaria forward's fitness will matter more
              to the Tottenham Hotspur supporters than it does those of United ahead
              of his return to White Hart Lane tomorrow afternoon. If Berbatov's sore
              achilles prevents him facing his old club, the average Spurs fan will
              breathe a sigh of relief. And as for United's supporters? They will
              simply shrug their shoulders and look forward to seeing Tevez play.</p>
              <p>That
              may sound harsh but, when it comes to judging Berbatov's impact since
              his Â£30.5m transfer between the clubs in September, the jury is still
              out among most United fans. They desperately want to adore him but,
              right now, they remain in the process of eyeing him up, wondering where
              the relationship is going. Berbatov is an unorthodox player and it
              takes time to get used to a footballer with his idiosyncrasies.</p>
              <p>"The
              problem is that the fans want effort," explains Paddy Crerand, a member
              of United's 1968 European Cup-winning team and a regular at Old
              Trafford. "Fans respond to effort. But some players can do more with
              one pass or piece of skill than another can do in 90 minutes of running
              around dementedly."</p>
              <p>Crerand has seen all of Berbatov's matches
              this season and is surprised that such an extravagantly gifted
              footballer should ever come under scrutiny from the club's fans. "I
              think it's unfair," he continued. "I've heard all the grumbles but the
              supporters need to realise that not everyone runs around like Cristiano
              Ronaldo or George Best. Berbatov suffers by comparison. But that
              doesn't mean it's right. I think he's a wonderful player. He might have
              scored only a couple of goals but how many has he created? To my mind,
              if you make a goal, it's as good as scoring one."</p>
              <p>Berbatov has
              actually scored six in all competitions, in 14 starts and one
              substitute's appearance, though only two have come in the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague">Premier League</a>.
              Even this has become a figure of debate among United's fans. On the one
              hand it is a healthy ratio of almost one goal in two games. On the
              other his goals have come exclusively in easy wins against moderate
              opposition - two each in 3-0 wins against Celtic and Aalborg in the
              Champions League, while he scored one in the 4-0 defeat of West
              Bromwich Albion and another in the 5-0 thrashing of Stoke City.</p>
              <p>The
              most damaging allegation, perhaps, is that Berbatov has adversely
              affected the balance of the team. Sir Alex Ferguson's thinking was that
              his arrival would bring a "new and exciting dimension" to their attack.
              Instead he has been forced to admit it has taken time for the players
              "to understand Berba's qualities".</p>
              <p>The United manager likes his
              four most advanced players, in a 4-2-3-1 system, to be fluid and
              interchange positions, making it as difficult as possible for opponents
              to pick them up. Berbatov can be wonderfully elusive but he does not
              stretch defences in the way that Tevez does. Wayne Rooney, meanwhile,
              has been playing well but not markedly better than in previous seasons
              and Ferguson has become exasperated about the number of chances his
              strikers have missed.</p>
              <p>In hindsight there is an argument that
              Ferguson should have gone for an opportunist rather than someone who
              will decorate, but not dominate, matches. Or maybe Berbatov will remind
              Tottenham what they are missing tomorrow and, in the process,
              demonstrate why United's supporters really should not fret too much
              about his value to the team. "He's got different qualities but he will
              do well for this club, just wait and see," predicts Crerand.</p>

              <div class="newsubmit">12.12.08 | tribalfootball.com</div>
              <div class="content">
              <p>Manchester United legend Paddy Crerand is urging fans to give Dimitar Berbatov time to come good.</p>
              <p>Some United fans refer to him as 'Dimitar Veron' after some low-key
              early performances, a cruel reference to the club's most famous
              big-money failure, Juan Sebastian Veron, who cost United Â£28m.</p>
              <p>"That's totally unfair," said 1968 European Cup winner Crerand,
              now a pundit on United's TV station. "He has not scored many but he's
              created plenty. And that's just as valuable. I have heard the grumbles
              from the fans but it's too early for that. I think he's a wonderful
              player."</p>
              <p>Crerand also told the <em>Daily Mail</em>: "Some players can do with one pass what others can't do with 90 minutes of running around dementedly.</p>
              <p>"People have judged Berbatov against the industry of people like
              Tevez and that's unfair. They are different players. But Berbatov will
              come good. Just wait and see."</p>

              <p>well, I do believe Berba has impressive seasons with Spurs. I rem reading that he and Rooney were the top 2 in goals/assists ratio.Â  Both of them were like scoring 20+ goals and with more than 10+ assists per season.</p>
              <p>In all fairness, Berba did come into the squad late and this come impact the needed time to develop understanding.Â  And also, I do see him running more in red jersey than a spurs one.</p>
              <p>He won't be a "cantona".. but I do think he needs to put more goals in to stop the rumblings..</p>
