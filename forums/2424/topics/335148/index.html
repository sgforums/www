              <p class="first"><strong>Manchester United and Portugal star Cristiano Ronaldo has been named FifPro World Footballer of the Year, beating 54 other top players on the shortlist.</strong></p>
              <p>The honour, voted for by professional footballers from all over the world, was widely expected after Ronaldo scored 42 goals for United last season.</p>
              <p>"To be recognised by my fellow players is amazing," said the 23-year-old. </p>
              <p>"I would like to thank my team-mates and coaches and everyone involved at United and the national team, as well as my family and friends for their support."</p>
              <p>Liverpool's Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres and Chelsea and England captain John Terry also made the team, along with AC Milan midfielder Kaka and Barcelona star Lionel Messi.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo, who was the driving force behind United's Premier League and Champions League double last season, is also a strong contender to win the Fifa World Player of the Year award and the Ballon d'Or.</p>
              <p>FifPro is the worldwide representative organisation for professional football players, with more than 57,500 members.</p>

              <h1>Fergie sets Ron revised goal target</h1>
              <p><img src="http://images.teamtalk.com/08/10/330/SirAlexFergusonCristiano_1415318.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="248"></p>
              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Sir Alex Ferguson has set Manchester United ace Cristiano Ronaldo a revised target of 25 goals from his injury-hit season.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Ronaldo scooped what is
              expected to be the first of a series of individual honours when he was
              named FIFPro player of the year on Monday.</p>
              <p>On the back of his 42 goals in United's double-winning season
              it was hardly an unexpected choice, and as the man who persuaded
              Ronaldo to remain at Manchester United it was fitting Ferguson should
              hand over the prize.</p>
              <p>But the Red Devils chief prefers to look forward rather than back, and while he</p>
              <p>accepts there is no way Ronaldo could reach last season's tally,
              feels it is perfectly possible for the 23-year-old to make another
              significant contribution.</p>
              <p>"I still think he will beat 25," Ferguson said. "It is going to
              be difficult because he has had a stop-start beginning to the season.</p>
              <p>"He had the operation on his ankle so he has missed a few games and he is just getting his rhythm back.</p>
              <p>"The number of goals he scored last year was absolutely phenomenal. You cannot describe it any other way.</p>
              <p>"But I hope he can be equally as good this year in terms of his contribution to the team."</p>
              <p>Ferguson has seen Ronaldo's startling progress at close quarters since he signed the raw teenager from Sporting<a class="iAs" style="border-bottom: 0.075em solid darkgreen ! important; font-weight: normal ! important; font-size: 100% ! important; text-decoration: underline ! important; padding-bottom: 1px ! important; color: darkgreen ! important; background-color: transparent ! important;" href="http://www.teamtalk.com/football/story/0,16368,2483_4413799,00.html#"></a> Lisbon in 2003.</p>
              <p>At the time, few had heard of Ronaldo, but the United players
              who had been so staggered at a pre-season performance in the Portuguese
              capital implored Ferguson to sign him.</p>
              <p>It did not take long for the winger to make a far bigger
              audience sit up and take notice. His Premier League debut as a
              substitute against Bolton at Old Trafford was enough.</p>
              <p>"We were struggling at the time but it ended up 4-0," Ferguson added.</p>
              <p>"The first thing he did, after winning a free-kick, was stand
              next to a team-mate, Mikael Silvestre I think it was, and demand the
              ball.</p>
              <p>"It was as if he wanted to immediately let everyone know, 'I am here'. That was him making his mark.</p>
              <p>"At first we said that he wouldn't play every week. We
              originally intended to play him every third week. It turned out that he
              took part more or less all season.</p>
              <p>"We just felt we had something special."</p>
              <p>Ferguson highlights footwork and courage as Ronaldo's major
              qualities. He has also had to develop a fairly thick skin following the
              controversy with Wayne Rooney at the World Cup two years ago and last
              summer's transfer saga with Real Madrid.</p>
              <p>"It's in the past now," said Ferguson. "It happened and you get on with life."</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, Ronaldo is now scrutinised in a way most men of his age would find stifling.</p>
              <p>Only last week his lack of a goal celebration against Celtic was analysed and cited as evidence he would prefer to be in Spain.</p>
              <p>"I don't know if it bothers Cristiano but it doesn't bother me," said Ferguson.</p>
              <p>"There is so much sensationalism today because of the pressure
              people are under to deliver headline stories. It is very difficult to
              get yourself annoyed about it."</p>
              <p>Amid the frenzied atmosphere of the Premier League, it is hard to imagine anyone actually enjoying a game or performance.</p>
              <p>Yet Ferguson feels that way about Ronaldo. As the tricks have
              slowly given way to effective ways of beating opponents, so the
              23-year-old's talent has become more useful.</p>
              <p>And, like most fans, Ferguson still gets a shudder of excitement when he sees the Portugal star take possession.</p>
              <p>"I really enjoy watching him play," said Ferguson. "It is fantastic."</p>
