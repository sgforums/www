            <div class='col-md body'>Giuseppe Rossi will decide his United future after the UEFA Under-21 Championships as he continues to attract interest from across Europe.<br><br>FC Porto are the latest side to be linked with a move for the 20-year-old striker, who arrived at Old Trafford in 2004 from Parma, where he enjoyed a successful loan spell last season.<br><br>Nine goals in 19 games helped stave off relegation from Serie A, but it also alerted several clubs in Italy to his undoubted ability.<br><br>As yet the question of where he plays his football next season, publicly at least, remains unanswered. But, for now, Rossi is concentrating on helping the Azzurrini succeed in Holland.<br><br>"Giuseppe will go and play in the Netherlands and we will then assess things when he returns," his agent Federico Pastorello told Sky Sports.<br><br>Pastorello also denied contact with Porto, or any other club for that matter. "Obviously I have read such things in the newspapers, but we have not talked with Porto or any club," he said.<br><br>"We are not thinking about that at the moment, Giuseppe did very well with Parma and he is now going to play for Italy. Things will be discussed at United in July."<br><br>That meeting with Sir Alex Ferguson next month could shape Rossi's career, but he may well still be recalled to Old Trafford as the United boss is a known admirer of the American-born Italy U21 international, once describing him as one of the best finishers at the club.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I hope Rossi stays and establishes himself as a regular starter next season. He seems ready for the challenge, and with him and Pique seeming the most experienced of the youngsters, the future looks bright for United</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sad to say, although he's a proven striker, I think he's not physically built for EPL. He's by far, too short and small in size. Defenders like Campbell and Primus need minimal body contact to nudge Rossi off the ball.<br><br>Yes, he did score lots of goals during his loan spell at Parma but Serie A is more on technical plays and not physical ones like the EPL. He did not enjoy a good spell at Newcastle. This proves that Rossi is technically gifted but not well suited for rough treatment of EPL.<br><br>Unless he works on his upper body strength, otherwise i see no future for him at United.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Cheers.<br>CK</div>
