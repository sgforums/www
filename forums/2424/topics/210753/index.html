Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson considered travelling to Oslo to visit Mikel, but decided against this after Mikel was reported to have left the country.[5] Staying in a London hotel, Mikel stated on Sky Sports News that he had been pressurised into signing the contract with United.[6] He also claimed that he had asked the clubs for a week to think about it, but that this request was refused and the clubs pressured him into signing without his advisors being present. Mikel told the British media that Chelsea were the club he genuinely wanted to sign for. In response to these events, United made an official complaint to FIFA about the handling of the affair by Mikel's agents and Chelsea.[7] FIFA replied to this complaint in August 2005 stating there was no evidence to support a case against Chelsea FC. However, from this complaint FIFA did open an investigation against Manchester United and Lyn Oslo. Both these cases were settled when Chelsea FC intervened by volunteering to settle through arbitration with Lyn Oslo and Manchester United.[8]<br><br>Full Story : <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Obi_Mikel#Controversy_regarding_transfer_to_England" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Obi_Mikel#Controversy_regarding_transfer_to_England</a><br><br>and Man Utd was not smilling @ all they were upset that the player had such negative comment on the club and they were not able to sign this talented youngster</span></div>
