              Things couldn't have gone much better for Michael Carrick since joining United in the summer of 2006.
              
              He has developed into one of the finest midfielders in the country and become an integral part of Sir Alex's trophy-winning Red machine, he's the proud owner of three Barclays Premier League titles, as well as Champions League and Club World Cup winners' medals.
              
              And ahead of European football's showpiece final meeting with Barcelona on Wednesday, the 27-year-old tells ManUtd.com he's determined to further boost his and United's trophy haul...
              
              In your opinion is this a final between the two best teams in world football?
              Yes, probably. The fact weâ€™ve both won our respective leagues certainly puts us up there as the best two sides in Europe. Itâ€™s going to be a huge game and itâ€™s one weâ€™re all looking forward to.
              
              What kind of match are you expecting?
              Iâ€™m not sure. We thought it would be very open and attacking when we played them last season and in the end there was only one goal over two legs. They can score and create chances at any time, but we believe we can defend well and attack them. There could be a bagful of goals or just one could be the difference - anything could happen, but thatâ€™s what makes it such an interesting game.
              
              People talk about the threat of Messi, but the manager has highlighted the dangers posed by Iniestaâ€¦
              Heâ€™s definitely a big player for them. Heâ€™s had a great season and scored a few goals, none more important than the one against Chelsea in the semi-final which put them through to the final. I know heâ€™s had a bit of an injury recently, but Iâ€™m sure heâ€™ll be fit for Rome and itâ€™ll be a big test to play against him because heâ€™s a really top player.
              
              United can make history by becoming the first side to retain the trophy â€“ is that something you think about as players?
              Itâ€™s a strange one really because you try not to think about things too much, but at the back of your mind you know how special it could be if we could do it. Weâ€™re determined to repeat the feeling we had last season, it was something Iâ€™d never experienced before in my life and it really was an unbelievable feeling. To do that again would be incredible.
              
              How big a boost is it to be going into the final as champions of England?
              Itâ€™s a great boost. Just knowing that youâ€™ve been consistent over a long period of time and have been good enough to finish on top of the pile gives you a lot of belief. Weâ€™ve hit good form at the right time and itâ€™s important to reproduce that form on Wednesday.
              
              Darren Fletcher obviously misss the game through suspension â€“ how much do the players want to win it for him?
              Weâ€™d love to. Weâ€™re all still devastated for Fletch, but hopefully we can win it and go some way to making him a bit happier about the situation.
