After 20 years in charge at Manchester United, Fergie's era is almost over. With just a couple of seasons left, the great Scot is preparing for the future. And with the signings of this talented duo United have pulled off a real coup.<br><br>Before the deals were announced on Wednesday evening, Anderson and Nani were linked with the biggest names in the European game. Real Madrid, Barcelona, Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool, Inter and AC Milan were all interested in the pair. By winning the race to their signatures United have fired a warning shot to their Champions League rivals. But Fergie's masterstroke is not just the capture of these talented players. In Nani and Anderson, United have ready-made replacements for ageing star duo Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes.</strong><br><br>Nani is a natural winger who can also play as a striker. In this way he is very similar to Cristiano Ronaldo. Nani, like his Portuguese team-mate, has great pace and trickery but he is still a raw talent and will need nurturing if he is to reach Ronaldo's level. But the bonus for United is that he can play on the left side. When Giggs retires, the 20-year-old will have had time in the United squad and will naturally fill the void left by the Welshman's exit.<br><br>Anderson can play two roles for United. Before his switch to Europe, Anderson played in an attacking left-sided role similar to that of Ronaldinho at Barcelona - hence the comparisons. But the Brazilian has prospered playing a central midfield role for Porto and it is this position where he could become a key player for United. Paul Scholes' forward thrust from midfield has been vital in United's success over the years. And once he retires it will be important that Anderson makes that position his own. The 19-year-old is quick-footed - like Nani and Ronaldo - but his strength on the ball is what sets him apart from other talents his age. This will be key in the English game against defensive midfield opponents such as Gilberto, Claude Makelele and Javier Mascherano.<br><br>Both players should prosper under the stewardship of Fergie. But it will be the Scot's replacement who will really benefit from these high-profile transfers. We are still yet to find out who that lucky manager will be, but Wednesday's deals could be a good indicator. Fergie's Portuguese assistant Carlos Queiroz was present during negotiations for both players. He also played a major role in bringing Ronaldo to Old Trafford.<br><br>That suggests United are already preparing for the future without Fergie, Giggs and Scholes - the men who have made them so great in the last 20 years. But United fans should not worry. If QueirozÂ’s first three acquisitions, Ronaldo, Anderson and Nani, are anything to go by the future is bright for the Red Devils.<br></div>

Old Trafford assistant coach Queiroz was in Portugal on Wednesday as the Premiership champions agreed deals reputedly worth a combined Â£35million to sign Porto midfielder Anderson and Sporting winger Nani. And he believes the pair will combine with the club's already blossoming youngsters to form the basis of the Red Devils' future generation.</strong><br><br>"It is a significant investment in Manchester United's prospects for the next 10 years," Queiroz told TVI television channel. "It's worth imagining a forward line with Rooney, Ronaldo, Anderson and Nani, these are players with enormous creativity. "It's an attraction being able to develop their abilities. I have worked with young players many times and their potential is impressive.<br><br>"These signings mean the end of a long observation process.

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Who are Anderson &amp; Nani?</strong></span><br><br>Manchester United have moved fast in the transfer market this summer, with Anderson and Nani set to be the latest arrivals at Old Trafford. Sir Alex Ferguson's assistant Carlos Queiroz is credited for a big role in securing the services of Porto's Brazilian midfielder Anderson and Sporting flyer Nani, who are tipped for the top.<br><br>"They're both top players and among the top five in Portugal with Simao Sabrosa, Joao Moutinho and Ricardo Quaresma," Portuguese football journalist Miguel Padayda told BBC Sport. But what more do we know about them? BBC Sport gives the lowdown on United's latest signings.<br><br><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/42991000/jpg/_42991977_anderson205.jpg"><br><br><strong>Full name: Anderson Luis De Abreu Oliveira<br>Nationality: Brazilian<br>Age: 19 (Born: 13 April 1988 )<br>Position Attacking midfielder<br>Fee: Reports vary between Â£15m and Â£20m </strong><br><br>Still a teenager, the dreadlocked Brazilian has made a huge impact, is already in Brazil's national squad and is considered the heir apparent to Ronaldinho as his country's star player. Born in the same town as Barcelona's buck-toothed wonder, Porte Alegre, Anderson also started his career at Gremio where he is held in high regard after scoring the goal that sent them back into the top flight in a brutal match against Nautico in 2005.<br><br>He moved to Europe later that year and made his Porto debut a little over 12 months ago in March 2006, helping the club land the Portuguese double. This season his progress has been hampered by a fractured leg in October, but he returned to action to help Porto successfully defend their title.<br><br>BBC Sport columnist and south American football pundit Tim Vickery has described the strong, left-footed midfielder as having the acceleration of the Millennium Falcon. And Manchester United have stolen a march on suitors such as Real Madrid and Chelsea to land a player many have already labelled as the long-term replacement for Old Trafford stalwart Paul Scholes.<br><br><strong>Padayda's verdict:</strong> "He is very young, very skilled in the pass, very intelligent and very fast. Unfortunately, this season he had an injury that allowed him to play only half of the season, but he was still a very important figure at Porto. He could definitely go straight into the United first XI."<br><br><strong>Anderson says:</strong> "I could not imagine I would ever get to work with a manager like Sir Alex Ferguson but it has happened. It is a dream the size of the world."<br><br><strong>They say:</strong> "New players will show they deserve a chance to represent Brazil and we'll all see that as it happens. Anderson, like many other Brazilian players, is a valuable player and will get his chance in future for sure."<br>Brazil head coach Dunga<br><br><strong>You say:</strong> "Anderson has the potential to be something special. When he's worth Â£30m on his own in two years this deal will look like a bargain."<br>EdWindchester on the 606 messageboards<br><br><strong>Did you know? </strong><br>He was named player of the tournament at the 2005 Under-17 World Cup. Previous winners of the award include Arsenal's Cesc Fabregas and former Liverpool striker Florent Sinama-Pongolle.<br><br><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/42991000/jpg/_42991985_nani205.jpg"><br><br>Full name: Luis Carlos Almeida da Cunha<br>Nationality: Portuguese<br>Age: 20 (Born: 17 April 1986)<br>Position Attacking midfielder<br>Fee: Anything between Â£11.5m and Â£17m say the reports<br><br>Nani has long been linked with a move to Manchester United ever since he stated it would be a "dream" to play with Cristiano Ronaldo. However, Quieroz needed to move quickly when it became clear Tottenham were also stepping up their interest in the predominantly wide player.<br><br>Born on the Cape Verde Islands off the west coast of Africa, he came through the Sporting Academy, a route previously taken by Ronaldo and Luis Figo, once his family had upped sticks for Lisbon. Having made his debut as an 18-year-old, Nani became a part of the first-team squad at the start of the 2005/06 season and soon got his chance to impress.<br><br>Since then the fleet-footed livewire, who celebrates goals with a back flip, has gone from strength to strength with club and country. He scored on his first appearance for Portugal against Denmark in September and also caught the eye with a wonderful effort in the Champions League against Spartak Moscow this season.<br><br><strong>Padayda's verdict:</strong> "He plays more or less in the same position of the pitch as Ronaldo does but he is not as fast. He had some problems this year at Sporting because he thought he was underpaid and wanted more money, but now he has a big contract. He will have to adapt to the English game and will need to wait a few months until he gets his chance."<br><br><strong>Nani says:</strong> "The Premier League is one of the best leagues in the world and it will be a big challenge. I am prepared to go to England because I believe I will progress there."<br><br><strong>They say: </strong>"He's one of the most gifted young players in Europe, and what's more, he's stronger than I thought he was."<br>Former Bayern Munich manager Felix Magath<br><br><strong>You say:</strong> "Bringing Nani into the team will definitely give us more width across the pitch and in time will be a suitable replacement for Ryan Giggs."<br>wolverine001 on the 606 messageboards<br><br><strong>Did you know: </strong><br><br>Everton midfielder Manuel Fernandes is a friend since childhood and the pair used to kick a ball about together on the streets of Lisbon.<br><br></div>

The attacking line will now include Nani and 'Neo' for more attacking speed, options and flair.<br><br>Remember, not all the time they may play attacking football. Different opponents require different approach to confront them.<br><br>I believe the setup is like this <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"><br><br>GK: van der Sar<br><br>RB: Neville<br>CD: Vidic<br>CD Ferdinand<br>LB: Evra<br><br>(Supporting them will be Silvestre, Brown, O'Shea and Heinze if he still remains.)<br><br>RM: C Ron<br>CM: Hargreaves<br>CM: Scholes<br>LM: Giggs<br><br>(This setup is more or less to see Hargreaves' role in a new midfield setup. Depending on situations, Carrick, Anderson, and Nani will replace any one of the 4. Supporting them will be Fletcher, Park, Eagles and Richardson.)<br><br>ST: Rooney<br>ST: Saha<br><br>(I can see Rooney is a mainstay here, so depending on the formation itself, we may see Rooney as a sole striker for Â½ of the next season as SAF will experiment on a new formation to fit the most powerful attacking lineup with sufficient defence. Supporting them will be Smith, Solskaer and Dong.)<br><br>In the end, this is what I THINK will be the most used formation and line up <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"><br><br>4-2-3-1<br><br>With the back line still the same, Hargreaves and Carrick will be used more often than Scholes In the central midfield. C Ron, Nani and 'Neo' will be used most often to support Rooney or lead the attack. Giggs will provide experience and intelligent play while Park is used for morale boosting purposes. Eagles will be used more often to gain experience and Fletcher will be on rotation basis as well. The strikers may suffer from lack of games.<br><br>My major concern for this setup is the exploitation of the defence. Particularly in speed down the flanks when Neville or Evra is out. Brown, Silvestre and O'shea are more than capable to provide cover, but they lack the REAL speed. They may have to use guile, anticipation and hard play to contain the flanks. Of course I did not factor in Hargreaves' role to cover defence in the flanks.<br><br>If SAF buy another capable full back, then most likely it will be solved.</div>

League matches are totally another thing, its a 90 mins game and whatever happens, it will end on the 90. So no need to worry about players fitness in case there is extra-time.</div>

The United No 2 convinced Alex Ferguson to splash out a whopping Â£31million to snatch the whizkids from Portugal. And Portuguese coach Queiroz cannot wait to set loose Nani, 20, and Anderson, 19, on the Premiership Â— and create a formidable Three Ronnies attacking partnership alongside Cristiano Ronaldo.</strong><br><br>The duo come from the same background in Portuguese football that convinced Fergie to sign Ronaldo. Brazilian Anderson was a star at Porto, while Portugal ace Nani filled RonaldoÂ’s boots at Sporting Lisbon after his Â£12.2m move to United in August 2003. Queiroz said: Â“IÂ’m looking forward to working with them and moulding and releasing their talents. Â“They are players with a lot of magic and great creativity. Â“It makes it worthwhile just to imagine Wayne Rooney, Cristiano, Nani and Anderson in the same side. Â“ItÂ’s always appetizing to work with players during the periods when they have great potential.Â”<br><br>Nani cost Â£14m, while Anderson will arrive with a Â£17m price-tag. And FergieÂ’s summer spending spree will reach close to Â£50m when England star Owen Hargreaves joins from Bayern Munich on July 1. But Queiroz insists United have done their homework to make sure the investment pays off. He added: Â“These signings come after the culmination of a long and systematic process of observation. Â“We see them as two players who correspond to our intentions as theyÂ’re young with a lot of talent.Â”<br><br>Old TraffordÂ’s latest whizkids have battled heartache and hardship. Winger Nani lived in poverty after his family emigrated to Portugal from the Cape Verde Islands off the west coast of Africa. And Anderson was just 14 when his dad died, leaving him to support his mum, sister and two brothers. He used to send home his entire Â£90 monthly youth-team allowance from his club Gremio to support them.<br><br>When he joined Porto for Â£4m in July 2005 the first thing he did was buy his mum a mansion in Brazil and a house in Portugal. Gremio first-team boss Cuca said: Â“One day I saw this kid with two mobile phones so I asked him why he needed them both? Â“He replied Â‘WhatÂ’s it to you, you donÂ’t pay the bills!Â’. I asked around who he was, but he came up to me and said Â‘Ask me who I amÂ’. Â“He said Â‘IÂ’m Anderson, IÂ’ve played for Brazil and scored over 40 goalsÂ’. Â“I decided there and then to promote him to the first-team. I canÂ’t explain why, it was just a hunch.Â”<br><br>Former United star Mickey Thomas is licking his lips at the prospect of seeing the Three Ronnies in action. The Welshman, 52, insisted: Â“They are fantastic signings. I canÂ’t wait to see Nani and Anderson in a red shirt. Â“LetÂ’s be honest, the main reason United won the title was because of the form and maturity of Ronaldo.Â”<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Next season will not just be the Rooney and Ronaldo show anymore...

            <div class='col-md body'>I still feel that the team is lacking a centre foward. If Anderson were to be pushed up as the link between midfield and attack, he will be playing in virtually the same role as Rooney, the one that Totti is famous for, the <span style="font-style: italic;">trequartista</span>.<br><br>While you need players to do that, you do need some one up front, to either compress the defence, creating space for the trequartista(s) or making darting runs off the shoulders of defenders or just as an added attacking dimension in passing and finishing off moves. the danger is that with so many creative players, we might end up like arsenal, great at passing but always forgetting to shoot.<br><br>Ronaldo has shown his willingness to shoot and Rooney always likes a crack at goal, it remains to be seen if the two new boys are the same.<br><br>Rossi and Dong don't quite cut it as centre fowards, you need someone big, tall and strong for the presence. Huntelaar would have been nice, but i feel that Afonso Alves is more likely to come.<br><br>A foward seems quite likely to be on the cards as Smith doesn't quite cut it and Saha isn't really there. Solskjaer is too old to lead the attack so someone is defintely needed.</div>
