            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Othello_Red:</div><div class="quote_body">I still feel that the team is lacking a centre foward. If Anderson were to be pushed up as the link between midfield and attack, he will be playing in virtually the same role as Rooney, the one that Totti is famous for, the <span style="font-style: italic;">trequartista</span>.<br><br>While you need players to do that, you do need some one up front, to either compress the defence, creating space for the trequartista(s) or making darting runs off the shoulders of defenders or just as an added attacking dimension in passing and finishing off moves. the danger is that with so many creative players, we might end up like arsenal, great at passing but always forgetting to shoot.<br><br>Ronaldo has shown his willingness to shoot and Rooney always likes a crack at goal, it remains to be seen if the two new boys are the same.<br><br>Rossi and Dong don't quite cut it as centre fowards, you need someone big, tall and strong for the presence. Huntelaar would have been nice, but i feel that Afonso Alves is more likely to come.<br><br>A foward seems quite likely to be on the cards as Smith doesn't quite cut it and Saha isn't really there. Solskjaer is too old to lead the attack so someone is defintely needed. </div></blockquote>Yea gotta agree that we need a strong forward.<br><br>Not sure about Afonso Alves, havent heard of him until recently. But reports on him seem pretty good.<br><br>Alves, who rates his technique and movement as the strongest parts of his game, says he has learned to become a team player at Heerenveen and believes he has benefited from playing in an "extremely competitive environment after all this time in Europe".<br><br>Gert Verbeek, coach of Heerenveen, says: "Afonso has phenomenal qualities. The way he scores from free-kicks is not something you see every day. He can decide a match with an individual action."<br><br>Alves admits: "My dream is to play in the English Premier League or the Spanish Premier Division. I have had those dreams since I was young.<br><br>"My favourite clubs in Spain are Barcelona and Real Madrid. In England I like <strong>Manchester United</strong>, Liverpool and Chelsea. They are all interesting for me.<br><br>Source: <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/sport/football.html?in_article_id=458867&amp;in_page_id=1779" rel="nofollow">The 'lazy' Brazilian who says he'll catch England napping</a><br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrsE-4BA6ow" rel="nofollow">Compilation of his Goals</a><br><br>He looks quite fast for someone who's 186 cm tall.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Alves is supposedly a late bloomer. Seeing his compliation vids, his movement does seem to be very good. BUt he's very right footed. we'll see if he does come to United</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess the thing is, this season United was too predictable... the players that would be playing can easily be guess by the opponents... and even what position they will be playing is also easily known... I can also name to 1st team line-ups... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>VDS<br><br>Neville/Brown - Rio / Vidic - Evra/Heinze<br><br>Ronaldo / Scholes / Carrick / Giggs<br><br>Rooney / Saha<br><br>So with the new players, who are also able to play in a number of positions... It won't be that easy to guess who will be playing and where they could be playing cos almost anyone of the "Fab 4" can interchange their positions...<br><br>Rooney - Main Striker, 2 Striker &amp; Left winger...<br><br>Ronaldo - Right-Winger, Left-Winger &amp; 2 Striker...<br><br>Nani - Right-Winger, Left-Winger &amp; 2 Striker...<br><br>Anderson - Attacking Midfielder, Left-Winger &amp; 2 Striker...<br><br>So it will be alittle harder to guess who and where they could be playing... They can even change positions with each other while the match is still in play...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>And with the arrival of Hargreaves, United also don't have to depend on Brown anymore in the Right-Back position should Neville gets injure again...<br><br>Interesting...</div>

Park under Hiddink played in that sort of system because Hiddink, being Dutch, loves it that way.<br><br>However, I have the feeling that with United, it will only be the attacking quartet swapping around. It's already happening to a certain extent now, it might just be that with better communication, and more freedom, it might be more spontaneous rather than planned.</div>
