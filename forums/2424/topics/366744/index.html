              <p><em>Here's a transcript of Michael Owen's exclusive interview with MUTV's Mandy Henry...<br><br></em><strong>How does it feel to have signed for Manchester United?<br><br></strong>It feels great. I never even had it in my wildest dreams really but then I got the call from the manager to come and meet him. It was a shock but I’m obviously really happy and things have moved quickly since then.<br><br><strong>Players probably don’t need much persuasion to move to a club like United but what did the manager have to say to you?<br><br></strong>We just discussed football really and the pros and cons of signing myself. Thankfully there were more pros than cons. So we talked about football and left David Gill and my agent to talk about the rest. From my point of view, I just wanted to talk about football. Then it was a case of show me the paperwork and where I have to sign. I’m delighted to have signed.<br><br><strong>I presume at the end of last season you didn’t think you’d be playing for Manchester United this season?</strong></p>
              <p>No, but I’ve been here in the past. I came here a couple of times as a kid, and I played in a tournament up north for Man United. I knew Brian Kidd quite well, I met the manager and even in the last few years, you speak to players and other people, I had an idea that the manager still thought I had something. So I clung to the hope that he would come and ask me to play for him one day. I probably had a poor spell up at Newcastle but prior to that, my career was very good and I’m sure a top club like this can reignite my career. Hopefully I can score a few goals and help the team to more success.<br><br><strong>The fans will be desperate to know how your fitness is because you’ve obviously had a torrid time with injuries in the past few years...<br><br></strong>I’d like to think that everyone was quite surprised at how (good) my medical was. I knew I would pass my medical, I’ve obviously passed them before. My fitness is fine. A lot is made of it and probably a lot will come out in the coming months and years but I certainly don’t feel like I’m injury prone. I’ve had a lot of injuries since I was at Newcastle - but anybody would get injured if someone jumped on their foot. I can name loads of players, and probably half a dozen here, who’ve broken a metatarsal. That almost set me on my way to having a couple of injuries subsequently because I didn’t get that first one right. I’m 29, I’ve played off the top of my head 500-plus games at the highest level. For me to play that many games, I think everyone would agree you can’t be on the treatment table all the time. But it is my plan to improve on my injury record. I know the medical staff here are really highly thought of so hopefully I can work with them and make sure I’m available for every game.<br><br><strong>You obviously know Wayne Rooney from the England set-up but how much are you looking forward to teaming up with him and Dimitar Berbatov?<br><br></strong>I am, and there are so many top players here obviously, so it’s a very exciting time for me. You get the call that United want to speak to you, and then you sign, and everything happens so quickly. As soon as you sign, you think, I’m going to start playing football soon with the players you spoke about then. There are fantastic players throughout the squad and that’s why they’ve all won so much in their careers so far. Hopefully I can jump on the bandwagon, help score a few goals and obviously help us to achieve further success.<br><br><strong>What do you hope to achieve here, Michael?<br><br></strong>It’s early days but when you think about United, you automatically think about winning trophies, the stadium, the massive fanbase. Until you sign, you don’t let yourself get carried away. I literally signed about ten minutes ago so no doubt I’ll drive home in my car now and I won’t sleep tonight thinking about all the top players I’m going to play alongside, about the manager, the fans, the atmosphere at Old Trafford and everything else. So there’s a lot to think about and a lot to get excited about.<br><br><strong>You’ve obviously played at Old Trafford before but how much are you looking forward to seeing those fans get behind you?<br><br></strong>It will be lovely obviously but I’m not silly, I know there will be a few people saying the manager shouldn’t have signed me and things like that. But that gradually goes away over time and then as soon as the first game kicks off, then I can obviously do my talking on the pitch. I’m really looking forward to pre-season. That’ll be good if I can get a full pre-season under my belt as that will stand me in good stead for the rest of the season. Obviously I’d like to start the season with a bang as that will help me settle into my new career and life.</p>

Here's what some had to say...<br><br></strong>I believe the signing of Owen is a good bit of business. He is a proven goalscorer and we've missed that since Ruud left. I know he struggles with injuries these days but let's give the guy a chance - as they say 'the talent never leaves you.' We create chances galore and Owen is a good old fashioned goal sniffer. Rooney and Berba are always going be first choice but Owen has a big part to play. He's more than capable of outscoring most current Premier League strikers.<br><strong>- chicktamonie<br><br></strong>Personally I think this is a brilliant move and one we should have made last year. To get a player of his calibre on a free transfer is fantastic and I think he'll score a good few goals for us.<br><strong>- United Till I Die!!!<br><br></strong>I think Owen is a great signing especially as we've got him on a free transfer. I don't expect him to play every week but he can be a real super sub for us.<br><strong>- Shivam Utd<br><br></strong>Despite the injuries, Owen still managed 10 goals for Newcastle last season. Given the right service and a run of games, he's still capable of scoring a lot of goals - he's not lost that lethal finisher's instinct in the box.<br><strong>- rohitspk<br><br></strong>If Owen can stay fit he is a great finisher and could get us at least 10-15 goals. A great signing by Fergie.<br><strong>- ballyduff20<br><br></strong>I would love to see him score the winning goal too against the Scousers.<br><strong>- Matthew Towlson</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think this could turn out to be one of the shrewdest pieces of business Sir Alex has ever done.<br><strong>- ooi1977<br><br></strong>This could be a great signing. Yes, he played for Liverpool but that would make it all the sweeter if he can hit form for United.<br><strong>- Andrew Dickinson</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is a master stroke by fergie once again, free transfer, a proven goal scorer for club and country, Owen will score lots of goals for Utd this season and the next.</p>

              <p>"large"... haha.. a lot of youngsters la.</p>
              <p>I think Owen can maybe sharpen welbeck and kiko and those aspiring youngsters.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He my has lose some pace, but I think his predatory instinct still there. and SAF is banging on that.  I don't think he will last 90 mins, but who knows.</p>
              <p>At least, MU signed him and not have a complex loan thingy again like Tevez.</p>
