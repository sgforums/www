              <p>I visited Pool forum just now and realized something very funny going on there...</p>
              <p>Apparently, there is this guy by the name of Jeffdevil doing some crazy things over there... He seems to be antagonizing the Pool fans on purpose but more so Poolman cos he looks like the only main one I think to have bite the bait...</p>
              <p>But more importantly, I hope Poolman will not drag the United fan base in here into a flaming war... Cos he has afterall, been here a long time, head of the Pool forum and well regarded by the football community here and the Pool members... But of late, himself has retaliated with needless threads or comments regards to United cos of this Jeffdevil... There is no point saying "no offense to MU fans" when the thread was intended as a sarcasm...</p>
              <p>I feel that he should see carefully how obvious what this Jeffdevil agenda is all about... To be honest, I am not sure if he just wants to pin this fellow's actions onto other United fans in a generalizing manner or is really oblivious to it... But I do hope its the latter...</p>
              <p>I believe most of us can tell that this Jeffdevil is not a United fan at all... From the beginning we can already tell from his extreme comments... But if some Pool fans still want to insist he is, and continue to bash the other United fans in here then I am afraid he has unfortunately fallen for the trick of this Jeffdevil guy... I have quoted another long time member in here who we all know is no United fan but an independent member with a mind of his own when it comes to commenting on other clubs... He easily saw what was going on and commented to Jeffdevil...</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>I hope Poolman and the others can see the point I am making... Creating threads specially for him probably gives him more pleasure than ignoring him totally... And this problem won't go away until someone stops it as there is a new kid in town going by the name of "mycockbiggerthanyourcock"... And Poolman seemed to be giving him more attention than ever... Creating a thread specially for him now... lol...</p>
              <p>If I am being honest, my opinion is this guy is a Chelsea fan... Unhappy with Liverpool club cos of the yrs of CL matches... And they will be playing each other in the CL again, Pool ended their proud home record, fighting for the title and also possible 2nd place spot... But dislike United just as much... So wishes to create a flaming war between them then go away laughing at those who bite the bait... Just my personal opinion lah cos he appear around this time... no need to take it too seriously... </p>
              <p>I have seen some Pool member asking why he even bother to pollute the liverpool forum with that kind of rubbish... And I totally agree with the question... I mean, why degrade the forum just for some meaningless ratings? Is it really worth it Poolman?</p>
              <p>As I said earlier, as Poolman is the head of the Pool forum, I hope he won't make it more difficult by continuing to engage with this fellow... Cos United and Pool have the most members in here and if not check, he could unwittingly lead more Pool members into a flaming war with United's members... We should keep an eye on those new members and those who joint years ago but have very few posts to their names... They are signs to look out for...</p>
              <p>But if Poolman wishes to continue his mud slinging game with this guy, its his choice and we have to respect it but I hope he leave United out of it totally... As for the United guys... I hope we can restrain the next time we see something that was intended for Jeffdevil but has unwittingly hit us... I would suggest we try our best not to get involve and just take it as a sort of funny entertainment... or sadly, it could create a lot of problems...</p>
              <p>To Poolman, Jeffdevil and mycockbiggerthanyourcock don't = United...</p>

              <p><br>Err... I think we have to look at the big picture here because he is Poolman, leader of the Pools... Just by your participation here already made my point... I understand you would like to defend a friend, or maybe he is not even a close friend to you but because he is Poolman, most Pool members would naturally support him like what you are doing right now...</p>
              <p>If we are being honest, YNWA forum was really quiet before this Jeffdevil came about... Perhaps there might have been some non-clone users once in a while but were there many United users creating trouble over there before this?</p>
              <p>If you were to carefully look back, it takes almost 2 and a half months for it to cover 2 pages of postings... So, were there really so many troublemakers posting utter thrash over there on a daily basis? It can't be too often or it wouldn't take almost 2 and a half months for it to cover 2 pages of postings... </p>
              <p>Actually I don't think Poolman mind others posting either and I belief he welcomes everyone there... And I think if we know its not from a clone user, then everything should be all right even if they don't agree or accept the direction of the discussion... Afterall, it's a forum isn't it...</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Over here we have a YNWA mod (chrisbenoit) who comes in very frequently, sometimes even more than one of our own mod...lol. He posted some weird stuff also, at least thats how I find it lah... But do we ever stop him? We don't cos we know he is not a clone account... But with clone account, they are only out to create trouble. Attacking and insulting the club to get to him would just be falling for his tricks... Thats what he wants... But real supporters may pick up on it and get upset... Then it could end up as what started by a clone gets out of hand and becomes a full blooded flaming war... </span></p>
              <p>Though I am not sure what or who you were referring too, but if you say there are other non-clone users posting utter thrash in YNWA forum too then assuming you are referring to United's fans... can we say they could be a few who may have got upset by the unpleasant posts from a senior Pool member so decided to take things in their own hands? But of course if you were not referring to the United fans... Then forget this whole paragraph lah... lol. But I want to say thats how a flame war starts... first one or two, then a few... then very soon, more will join in...</p>
              <p>No offence lah bro, you are also an old friend of mine in here... I just don't wish to see a flame war happen between Pool and United users thats why i mentioned it... But I think Poolman has stop and change tactics already... By editing his posts...</p>
              <p>Good luck to him and hope it works... lol</p>
