            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/hargreaveswc.jpg"><br><br><strong>MANCHESTER UNITED last night stepped up their bid to finally land Owen Hargreaves.</strong><br><br>Old Trafford officials made fresh contact with Bayern Munich and are poised to confirm their Â£15million bid for the fit-again England midfielder. SunSport revealed on New YearÂ’s Day the two clubs have already held meetings over a deal. And UnitedÂ’s chief executive David Gill admitted: Â“I think we all know the area in which we want to strengthen.Â”<br><br>But Hargreaves, 25, looks likely to be the only transfer window addition to Alex FergusonÂ’s squad. Gill added: Â“The money is there but traditionally we do most of our big spending in the summer and I think that will continue.<br><br>Â“Things may change. If thereÂ’s an area in which we want to do something then weÂ’ll do it. But, at the moment, we donÂ’t plan to do a great deal. Â“WeÂ’ve already brought in Henrik Larsson while a number of the players who have been on loan are back at the club.Â”<br><br>Ferguson missed out on Hargreaves in the summer after the Canadian-born star was one of EnglandÂ’s few successes at the World Cup. United did all they could to get their man in what turned into a war of words with Munich.<br><br>Hargreaves publicly declared his desire to make the move. But that only infuriated BayernÂ’s bosses who had only recently given him a new contract keeping him in Germany until 2010.<br><br>The Germans dug in their heels the more United pushed to get their man. But Hargreaves has hardly played this season after breaking a leg in September.<br><br>He is now well on the road to recovery and boss Ferguson believes a medical will reveal if United are taking any sort of gamble. Fergie said: Â“The broken leg issue is there with Hargreaves but you can still sign a player if he comes through a medical. Â“Other than that I cannot say anything more because I do not want to upset those poor Germans again.Â”<br><br>Hargreaves will be cup-tied for the Champions League. But Ferguson is keen to beef up his squad for an assault on three trophies. And HargreavesÂ’ versatility, which allows him to fill in at full-back, also appeals to the United boss.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Manchester United are preparing to test Bayern Munich's resolve with a first official bid for Owen Hargreaves, thought to be in the region of Â£17m, but the Premiership leaders will not be getting involved in any other transfers until the summer.<br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson has already stated he is only "looking at one thing" and yesterday it was the chief executive David Gill's turn to play down suggestions that the club may seek to strengthen other areas. United have already added Henrik Larsson to their playing staff, albeit on a seven-week loan arrangement with Helsingborgs, and Gill said that it is unlikely they would bring in anyone else.<br><br>"The money is there but traditionally we do most of our big spending in the summer and I think that will continue," he said. "Things may change. If there's an area in which we want to do something then we'll do it. But we don't plan to do a great deal. We've brought in Larsson, while a number of the players who have been out on loan are back."<br><br>United's priority is Hargreaves and they have been increasingly encouraged by some of the noises coming out of Munich. The Bundesliga champions do not want to lose one of their key players but they are aware that there are pitfalls in keeping a player who is keen to leave. Hargreaves, close to fitness after recovering from a broken leg, has made that clear he wants to leave, even being fined on one occasion, and United believe they have a 50-50 chance. "I think we all know the area in which we want to strengthen," Gill said. "But I'm not going to comment on that."<br><br>Looking further ahead, United have been alerted to the news that Marseille are willing to sell the France international Franck Ribery for around Â£17m.<br><br></div>
