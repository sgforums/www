            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://images.teamtalk.com/06/09/190/Park_161738.jpg"><br><br><strong>Manchester United midfielder Park Ji-Sung is determined to stay fit this season and help the Red Devils "win as many trophies as possible."</strong><br><br>The South Korean star was restricted to a place on the bench on Friday as United defeated K-League outfit FC Seoul 4-0 in the second game of their Far East tour.<br><br>Park was desperate to be involved but knows he will be sidelined until January after suffering cruciate ligament damage at the end of last season.<br><br>So, while the 25-year-old realises his presence at Old Trafford is one of the major factors in United's phenomenal popularity in Korea, he wants to make more of an impact in the chase for honours.<br><br>"I wasn't able to do as much for the team as I would have liked last season because of injuries," he told United's website.<br><br>"This time when I'm back from injury I hope to stay fit and play more games.<br><br>"I hope the team can be successful again - we won the title but weren't able to win the Champions League and the FA Cup so I'd like to win them. Really, I just want to win as many trophies as possible."<br><br>Park's presence on the United bench on Friday was greeted with unbridled enthusiasm from a 64,000 crowd, whose devotion to the Red Devils cause appears to be on a par with any supporter hailing from Stretford or Salford.<br><br>All the goals, from Cristiano Ronaldo, Chris Eagles, Wayne Rooney and Patrice Evra, brought massive cheers from all corners of the stadium, further enhancing the reputation of Korean fans.<br><br>A veteran of five Far East visits in his two-decade stint as United boss, this was nevertheless Sir Alex Ferguson's first visit to Seoul.<br><br>Yet he assured a country which boasts an incredible 750,000 United visa card holders, the Red Devils will be back.<br><br>"This is Manchester United's first visit to Korea - and I am sure we will be coming back," he said.<br><br>"The reception we have received here has been absolutely excellent. Everything about the trip has been first class.<br><br>"I used to think when we went to Thailand it was almost impossible because we had thousands inside and outside the hotel all night. We have experienced the same thing here.<br><br>"It doesn't surprise me. It is just one of these phenomenons we can create in certain parts of the world."<br><br>It is a phenomenon that has no chance of abating as long as Park remains a United player. The departure of the team bus an hour after the final whistle was greeted with the kind of noise which used to be reserved for Beatles concerts.<br><br>The reaction may present United's commercial team with a problem given the club had earmarked the United States as a destination for their next major, non-tournament-year tour.<br><br>While chasing the American dollar has its attractions, even with David Beckham now based in Los Angeles, it is difficult to see how any football club can make as deep an impact on the US-sports psyche as United have on the affluent Asian market.<br><br>"We consider ourselves a major global brand," said Ferguson.<br><br>"The club is prepared to travel anywhere to promote its image and the game.<br><br>"Even North Korea would not be a problem for us, should the right conditions apply.<br><br>"I understand from a survey that was carried out recently that we have an enormous number of fans in Vietnam, so maybe that is somewhere that we might look to visit in the future.<br><br>"It just seems like the whole of the Far East has a lot of respect and affection for our club and we have to serve that as best we can."</div>
