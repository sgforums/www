            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">Ben Foster was forced out of action at the end of the 2006/07 season and subsequently went under the knife to repair a damaged cruciate ligament in his right knee. Here he tells of his long road to recovery and his hopes for the rest of the season.</span><br><br>I've been injured since May and when you can't do what you're paid to do it's massively frustrating.<br><br>I had a lot of expectations surrounding this season and what it might hold for me but I have to put those aside for now. When you're told you're going to be out for eight months and no sooner you just have to knuckle down and get on with it.<br><br>I've been spending a lot of time in the gym, working on all the static cardio-vascular machines. I've been on the exercise bike, the cross-trainer, the treadmillÂ… all the machines that aren't going to put too much pressure on my knee but will help me to keep my stamina up. There have also been lots of leg weights and upper body weights.<br><br>After all that, my knee is getting stronger. I've recently stepped up my training and I've had no pain in it whatsoever. The next step will be doing some more goalkeeping work. Earlier this month, I started doing a few things Â– just having someone hit volleys into my hands. But I'll start doing some proper sessions soon with the goalkeeper coach and that will push the knee a bit further. The aim at the moment is to be doing full training and getting involved with the lads sometime after Christmas Â– probably early February.<br><br>I can't wait until I'm playing again. I guess that might be around March next year. It's something to look forward to and something to aim for. Whether it's at United in the Reserves or somewhere else on loan, I'm not bothered Â– I'll take anything!<br><br>Speaking of loans, I spent two seasons at Watford and they were good years. We got promoted and then relegated but it was a massive test for me and I gained some invaluable experience. At Watford, I tended to have quite a lot of work to do, which was good, but we didn't pass it out from the back a lot, which is what United are all about. So while I'm out I've been watching Edwin van der Sar closely. That way, when my turn comes around I know what's expected of me.<br><br>I come to all our games at Old Trafford and I watch the away games on television. To be honest, it's incredibly frustrating and I'm not a good spectator because I would much rather be out there. But these things can't be helped and I'm determined to remain positive.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Foster or Kuschack? Still think none of them is nowhere near Van Der Sar... Van Der Sar is like Schemeichs clone.. I think Friedel and James are not bad currently.. But still old also.. Hmm..</div>
