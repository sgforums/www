              <p><strong>Fulham failed to make their chances count as Hull stole a late,
              late 1-0 win at Craven Cottage when Manucho scored his first goal in
              English football. </strong></p>
              <p>Roy Hodgson’s side had much the better of both halves, but a strong
              showing from Hull keeper Matt Duke kept his side in it until on-loan
              Manchester United striker Manucho turned home an injury-time winner to
              hand Fulham a first home defeat in nine games.</p>

              <h1 class="sIFR-ignore">Brown tips Manucho to shine</h1>
              <p><img src="http://www.setanta.com/Global/Images/sport/football/2008-2009/premier_league/hull-city/manucho_celebration.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="270"></p>
              <p><strong>Hull boss Phil Brown has tipped on-loan Manchester United striker
              Manucho to get better and better after scoring his first goal in
              English football. </strong></p>
              <p>The 25-year-old Angola international, who spent time on loan at
              Panathinaikos last season, scored in injury time after coming on as a
              late substitute during Hull’s 1-0 win at Fulham on Wednesday night for
              his first Premier League goal.</p>
              <p>And while Manucho has struggled to break into the first-team at
              Hull since he joined on loan in January, Brown is confident that he
              will soon show his potential.</p>
              <p>"There's more to come from Manucho," he said.</p>
              <p>"He wasn't getting games at Old Trafford, so Sir Alex wanted to loan him out to find his feet at this level if possible.</p>
              <p>"We've been impressed with his attitude in training and at not
              being selected, which is key if you are a substitute and you do come
              on.</p>
              <p>"His mentality was right at Fulham. Their defender Brede
              Hangeland is a handful but when Manucho came on it was a different ball
              game."</p>

              <h1 class="sIFR-ignore">Manucho out to impress</h1>
              <p><strong>Manucho is determined to make the most of his loan spell at Hull
              City in order to impress Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson.</strong></p>
              <p>The 25-year-old Angola striker moved to The KC Stadium in the
              January transfer window and despite struggling to tie down a starting
              role he came on to score a crucial late winner at Fulham in midweek.</p>
              <p>After a short spell at Greek side Panathinaikos last year as he
              waited for a work permit, the forward is now hopeful he can make his
              mark at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>"I just want to do the best I can for Hull and see what happens after that," said Manucho in the Daily Mirror.</p>
              <p>"If I can score some more goals it will be good for everyone. The plan is to go back and take it from there.</p>
              <p>"If I can make the most of this chance at Hull, then who knows?"</p>
              <p>The Angola striker has made three appearances for United but is yet to open his goal-scoring account.</p>
