            <div class='col-md body'>Sir Alex Ferguson has called upon Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho to apologise for the second time in 72 hours after Manchester United ensured they would be top of the Barclays Premiership at Christmas.<br><br>Ferguson believes Mourinho should say sorry after failing to live up to his claims that Chelsea would be at the head of the table on December 25. Two goals from Cristiano Ronaldo and a wonderful strike from Paul Scholes ensured United earned a comfortable 3-0 victory at Aston Villa.<br><br>Ferguson said: "Perhaps it shows that we shouldn't believe Jose Mourinho. He said Chelsea would be top at Christmas and they are not. He has to apologise after lying about an Everton player this week. Perhaps he should be apologising again."<br><br>Ferguson was pleased with the form of his side after the shock setback at West Ham, and in particular Ronaldo - who tormented the Villa defence.<br><br>The Scot believes the Portuguese winger is "as good as anyone in the country" in his current form and he now has eight league goals to his credit.<br><br>Ferguson said: "It is a big result after last week's disappointment when we controlled the game, we should have won. The nature of football is that those things happen.<br><br>"A new manager comes in (Alan Curbishley) and it is almost like fate at what happens. But the players got to grips with the game, played some great football and we've also great determination because Villa are a handful.<br><br>"There wasn't much in it in the first half but after the break we turned it around and Ronaldo was unbelievable. He is in great form. He shows great courage and strength and he was a revelation. He is as good as anyone in the country."He has got eight goals now and he could get us 15 this season. He is capable of doing that."<br></div>
