            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Rampant Reds Too Hot For Hornets</strong><br><br>Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo combined with devastating effect to sink Watford 4-1 and book Manchester United a place in the FA Cup final, keeping their quest for the three major trophies firmly on course.<br><br>Rooney put United in front in the seventh minute, with Hameur Bouazza scoring a surprise 26th-minute equaliser for the visitors before Cristiano Ronaldo restored the Red Devils' lead just two minutes later.<br><br>The England striker's second goal in the 66th minute, and a fourth from substitute Kieran Richardson eight minutes from full-time, sealed United's presence in the first final at the new Wembley Stadium, and their dream of a repeat of 1999 - when Sir Alex Ferguson's men won the Premiership, the FA Cup and the Champions League - is still alive.<br><br>After the game Ferguson claimed his side's performance was as good as their 7-1 thrashing of Roma in the Champions League last Tuesday.<br><br>He said: "It was a fantastic performance; it was as good as Tuesday in terms of the endurance of the team, the courage, accepting the disappointment with Ferdinand being injured when we had to change the team.<br><br>"It was absolutely magnificent, I was so proud."<br><br>On Rio Ferdinand, who had to be replaced by Darren Fletcher in the first half, Ferguson added: "Hopefully it's not too serious. He'll have a scan tomorrow. It's a groin injury. Hopefully he won't be out for too long.<br><br>"We'll know tomorrow evening. He'll have a scan in the morning and we'll get the results in the afternoon."<br><br>The attacking trio of Ronaldo, Rooney and Alan Smith were particularly impressive.<br><br>Ferguson said of Ronaldo: "It was his 21st goal today and he could go on to score 25, the form he is in.<br><br>"Wayne Rooney had his best game of the season today, he was absolutely fantastic. And Alan Smith has brought a breath of fresh life to the team. He is doing fantastically for us."</div>

The Manchester United skipper has been missing since suffering an ankle injury in the Premiership win against Bolton last month. </strong><br><br>Neville had hoped to make his return in Tuesday's Premiership encounter with Sheffield United at Old Trafford. However, Sir Alex Ferguson has confirmed Neville will not face the Blades as United look to stretch their lead over Chelsea to six points.<br><br>Neville is also doubtful for Saturday's televised encounter with Middlesbrough, although Ferguson is optimistic the long-serving England defender will be available for the first leg of United's Champions League semi-final with AC Milan on April 24.<br><br>"Gary has a slight chance for the Middlesbrough game but a good chance for the AC Milan game," he said.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rooney: It was tough<br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson claimed Wayne Rooney's performance against Watford was the striker's best of the season, but the Reds' No.8 refused to dwell on his own form in United's convincing 4-1 win.<br><br>Rooney struck twice to send the Reds to Wembley and proved too hot for the Hornets' defence to handle.<br><br>"It was a big game today and Watford made it tough for us," Rooney said. "We were looking to have a quick start and we managed that with the early goal [Rooney's first, on seven minutes]. I scored a few goals playing from out wide so I'm sure that's where I'll probably play in the next game."<br><br>The Reds scored 11 goals in just two games this week but Rooney was quick to point out Saturday's FA Cup victory wasn't as easy as it looked.<br><br>"They're a physical team and we knew at some point in the game we'd have to defend. I think up until 1-1 and just after half-time we had to battle and we did that well.<br><br>"Watford put us under pressure with some long balls and long throw-ins, so we were delighted to get the second goal and go into half-time 2-1 up. [My second goal] killed the game off. Alan Smith played a great ball into me and I couldn't miss from there."<br><br>Kieran Richardson's late strike sealed the win and booked United a spot at this season's FA Cup final.<br><br>"That's what you play for, to be in cup finals and to win trophies," Rooney, who was on the losing team when the Reds fell to Arsenal in 2005, said. "We're delighted we're into one cup final. Hopefully we can go far in the other competitions. We're scoring freely at the minute and we're looking to continue that."</div>
