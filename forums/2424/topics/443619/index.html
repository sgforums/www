              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Manchester United are set to lose one of their most promising youngsters with Paul Pogba ready to turn his back on the Old Trafford club. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">The 18-year-old Frenchman is out of contract in the summer and is poised to open contract talks with Inter Milan. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">According to the <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Daily Mirror</span>, the Italian club are keen to land Pogba, who is held in high regard by United boss Sir Alex Ferguson. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Ferguson wants Pogba to sign a new deal, but the midfielder, who only joined United in 2009, when the Red Devils were accused of 'poaching' the player by his former club Le Havre, has failed to agree terms. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Pogba impressed after coming off the bench in United's otherwise poor Carling Cup quarter-final defeat to Crystal Palace earlier this month, and is available to speak to clubs from January. </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Manchester City and Arsenal are also said to be interested in the youngster, but it's Inter Milan who look likeliest to land his signature. </span></p>
              <p><span>The news will come as a blow to Ferguson who faces the second half of the season without Darren Fletcher, who is suffering with a career-threatening health problem while fellow midfielder Anderson is sidelined until February with a knee injury. <br></span></p>

              <p>one thing, players are tagged with a price tag, true, but when MUFC comes along, there are conditions.. whether they are rivals in UCL, some players don't like the EPL, the Manchester weather, they prefer london, etc etc.</p>
              <p>I think while SA may be gold, but it would be better to develop given the big debt over MUFC's head. We won't want to see an implosion like Leeds United, right?</p>
              <p>Till date, SAF has to a certain extent, being moderately successfully in introducing youths at the right time of their careers. so let's wait and see.</p>
              <p>if this fella is really like a ronaldo-type-quality, that can't wait to explode on the EPL, he will play, but given the long wait, maybe, he is just not ready.</p>
              <p>And sometimes, players are tagged to a famous star, and the added pressure just squeeze and magnify every error and just ruin the confidence.</p>

              <p><span>And while Morrison's off-field problems have remained a distraction, his performances on the pitch have impressed the club sufficiently to persist with the 18-year-old.</span></p>
              <p><span>Although both would be deemed 'free' moves, United would be entitled to compensation for development costs because both players are under 24.</span></p>

              <p>Midfielder Pogba, 18, has been linked with a number of clubs including Italian giants Juventus.</p>
              <p>But he was handed his Premier League debut in last night's victory over Stoke.</p>
              <p>And Fergie is keen to ensure the Frenchman does not <span style="color: #000000;">follow fellow starlet Ravel Morrison out of the Old Trafford exit door</span><span style="color: #000000;">. </span></p>
              <p>The United boss said: "Pogba did very well.</p>
              <p>"The boy has great talent and tremendous physique for an 18-year-old. You can't believe it.</p>
              <p>"We are negotiating his contract at the moment.</p>
              <p>"It is a bit complicated at the moment because he has changed his agent a couple of times.</p>
              <p>"But the boy wants to stay, that is obvious. Hopefully we can get it done soon."</p>

              <p><span>The 18-year-old was introduced for his Barclays Premier League debut in United's win over Stoke late last month as Sir Alex Ferguson opted to give him some valuable experience. </span></p>

              <p><br>Sometimes it's not just about the money to the player, his agent may have something else line-up in mind and will try his best to move him on no matter what... Kickbacks to agents isn't an unknown thing.</p>
              <p>Anyway, for Morrison, 30k is too much for someone who isn't even in the first team. 5 yrs is a very long time to be tie down to a huge contract on a player whose potential is still unknown. The club must be prudent, there are many potential youngsters every year, if you are going to give in to one's demand now, what are the chances the rest of the so called potential youngsters will take this as a green light to ask for the same?</p>
              <p>Rafael and Fabio were on really low wages when they first arrived. I kind of recalled they were on thousand plus a week and when they improve and made it to the first team, they were offered new deals at 6k per week... Today perhaps a little higher but still under $30k. Of course they are from S America so maybe a little cheaper but $30k + 5 yrs for an unproven youngster is too much. Whether he turns out good or not is no longer our problem. What we know is during his time with us, he still wasn't good enough to warrant that sum. But playing with average players week in, week out won't do his career any good in my opinion.</p>
              <p>And my personally view on both players, Pogba may be a loss, Morrison isn't... But we still are not sure what Pogba's agent is demanding though...</p>

              <p><span><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson, a keen admirer of the Frenchman, is prepared to give the highly-rated midfielder a raise if he commits to the Premier League champions. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span>But according to the Daily Mirror, Pogba is demanding a one-off figure in the region of £3million to secure his signature, with Chelsea ready to pay the fee. </span></p>
              <p><span>Speaking on Tuesday, the 18-year-old believes he is improving all the time at United.</span></p>
              <p><span>'It's very good,' he told MUTV. 'Just to train with the talented players, top-class players, and improve and get more experience. </span></p>
              <p><span>'When I'm on the bench, I just watch and want to play with them and get involved. Like against Liverpool, it was a great chance for me to be on the bench. </span></p>
