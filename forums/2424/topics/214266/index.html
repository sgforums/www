            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://img181.imageshack.us/img181/3107/picsrvmanutdpn0.jpg"><br><br><strong>Have you found it easy to watch the games when theyÂ’ve been on?</strong><br>Yeah, because thatÂ’s what IÂ’ve been working towards. IÂ’ve got to be tuned in, IÂ’ve got to be positive t make sure when the time comes IÂ’m ready.<br><br><strong>Ole Solskjaer has spoken of watching games and picking things up from the stands that you may not notice on the pitchÂ…</strong><br>Yeah, Roy Keane said the same thing to me, he told me that when he did his cruciate he learnt a lot about the game just by watching. I always thought If you can be there, then be at the game, but itÂ’s good that so many games are televised these days, so that keeps you involved as well. If the lads are talking about a game and you say, Â“I havenÂ’t seen it,Â” I think thatÂ’s showing a lack of respect to them. It was nice to watch them when I could.<br><br><strong>The manager has said that this season he sees you as a centre-forward.</strong><br>Yes, thatÂ’ll be nice! I signed for this club as a centre-forward and I believe I can be as good a centre-forward as I want to be. I can do a job in midfield but IÂ’m never going to be a world-class midfield player. When the game is rough and tumble I can get involved and give as good as I get. But when teams drop off and you have to be the catalyst and keep moving the ball, that's when I find it more difficult.<br><br><strong>Have you learnt from playing in that midfield role last season?</strong><br>Definitely. There were some games when I surprised myself with what I did! I learnt how disciplined that role makes you, itÂ’s a lot more difficult than some people think. I think Makelele does an unbelievable job for Chelsea because itÂ’s so difficult to just hold your position and not get caught out.<br><br><strong>How do you compare your style as a striker to the other forwards at the club?</strong><br>IÂ’m totally different from Wayne Rooney, Louis Saha or Ole Gunnar Solskajer. Whoever plays, we all complement each other. It's a great blend.<br><br><strong>Are you looking forward to playing with new signing Michael Carrick?</strong><br>Yeah, IÂ’ve known Michael since I was, like, 10 years old. We used to play together in the North-East so IÂ’ve known him a long time. HeÂ’s an intelligent player, his weight of pass and distribution is quality, and heÂ’s a good young signing. HeÂ’ll add something different and hopefully he can feed the wide players and forwards, and create ample opportunities for us. WeÂ’ve got a lot of good young players coming through as well. The gafferÂ’s always said that if youÂ’re good enough at this club youÂ’ll get a chance, and thatÂ’s been proven again. MichaelÂ’s been a good addition. WeÂ’ve not made many signings but I donÂ’t think the gaffer has wanted to rush into any signings that wouldnÂ’t be good for the future.<br><br><strong>And with everyone fit, this squad is as good as anyoneÂ’s. </strong><br>Undoubtedly. When you look around thereÂ’s world class players everywhere. That just fills you with confidence.<br><br><strong>Finally, can you imagine what itÂ’s going to be like running out at Old Trafford again?</strong><br>Erm, not really! Someone wrote me a letter that said, Â“Just think about the reception youÂ’ll get. If times are hard and youÂ’re finding it difficult, just think about that first game.Â” And IÂ’m thinking about it!<br><br><a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA%2D9A47%2D47BC%2DB069%2D3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=368383" rel="nofollow">http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA%2D9A47%2D47BC%2DB069%2D3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=368383</a></div>
