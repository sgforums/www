              <p>Honestly, for once, I see Berba's contribution. On a wet night, where control is hardest, he did fairly well. He was the link player for much of first half and even the 2nd. His runs off the ball, left a hole infront of Wigan's defence which allows MU MF to come in..</p>
              <p>I am quite surprised at how MU players were slipping, given that Manchester weather is mostly wet.. I just hope that the conditions will not be similiar in Rome. Cause all had a torrid time on the surface. Ronaldo's free kicks barely reach the chest height of Wigan's wall. </p>
              <p>Ronaldo seems to showcase his talent in selected timing but Tevez was the key. Mu will be mad to let him go given that he is a change agent..</p>
              <p>I am unsure about Valencia, he has pace, but no trickery.. Perhaps some of U saw some skill??</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson last night watched Manchester United move within a point of another Barclays Premier League title after a dramatic victory at Wigan, then offered renewed hope that striker Carlos Tevez can be persuaded to stay at Old Trafford.</strong></p>
              <p>'He knows I want him to stay,' said the United manager last night, much to the delight of the club's fans.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">The reigning champions need only a draw at home to Arsenal on Saturday or away at Hull on the season's final day to retain their title and match rivals Liverpool's record haul of 18 Championships.</p>
              </div>
              <p>Trailing 1-0 at half time at the JJB Stadium last night, United recovered in spectacular style to equalise through Tevez then clinch three points with a Michael Carrick winner four minutes from the end of normal time.</p>
              <p>Tevez's goal was his second in four days, even though he vowed to leave the club on Sunday due to his failure to nail down a regular place.</p>
              <p>United manager Ferguson said last night: 'The situation has not affected Carlos at all. He knows I want him to stay. 'I had another chat with him about it today and our chief executive, David Gill, had other meetings as well. I'm sure it has progressed further.</p>
              <p>'The terms we have offered Carlos are good, so we will see.' However, a spokesman for Tevez's adviser Kia Joorabchian said last night: 'It is true David Gill came to see Mr Joorabchian and they had a cordial meeting.</p>
              <p>'It is categorically untrue that Manchester United made an offer to try and persuade Carlos Tevez to stay at the club. In 2007 they agreed a two-year loan for Carlos and at the same time agreed the terms that would make the transfer permanent. They have not taken up that option.</p>

              <p>valencia was definitely pacy.. could see vidic struggling to catch him.. nope no trickery thats the first thing that caught my attention when i was looking at youtube videos of him, so i was wondering why the hell would fergie wanna buy him..</p>
              <p>de slippery pitch was a joke hahas man utd players were slipping like nobody's business.. ronaldo was a joke. whiny ass who shld have converted when it matters. rooney was as usual brilliant down the wings. i used to think whats the big hoohaa abt rooney but now i seen his plays as a winger, i think he is in his top form.. berba slows down the attack whereas tevez brings energy and threats in attack.. 2 different types of striker but i would prefer tevez.. and wth scholes.. he shld just retire oredi.. slows down de damn game, cant hold up to wigan's trio midfield..</p>
              <p>credit given to wigan.. i thot they played well.. trio midfield did well to contain man utd.. cattermole easily one of the best upcoming DM around.. berba dulan wit him hahaha.. and the rodallego dude is not bad.. predict a big move for him in future..</p>

              <p>valencia was definitely pacy.. could see vidic struggling to
              catch him.. nope no trickery thats the first thing that caught my
              attention when i was looking at youtube videos of him, so i was
              wondering why the hell would fergie wanna buy him..</p>
              <p>de slippery pitch was a joke hahas man utd players were slipping
              like nobody's business.. ronaldo was a joke. whiny ass who shld
              have converted when it matters. rooney was as usual brilliant down
              the wings. i used to think whats the big hoohaa abt rooney but now
              i seen his plays as a winger, i think he is in his top form.. berba
              slows down the attack whereas tevez brings energy and threats in
              attack.. 2 different types of striker but i would prefer tevez..
              and wth scholes.. he shld just retire oredi.. slows down de damn
              game, cant hold up to wigan's trio midfield..</p>
              <p>credit given to wigan.. i thot they played well.. trio midfield
              did well to contain man utd.. cattermole easily one of the best
              upcoming DM around.. berba dulan wit him hahaha.. and the rodallego
              dude is not bad.. predict a big move for him in future..</p>

              <p>yep.. if he were any better, he would have scored the goal.. instead he lost his balance when it matters..</p>
              <p>well, berba did slow down the attack but he is more a continental player, he protects the ball. Instead of break neck speed, he keeps it and that's his contribution. No team can hurt you without the ball, and I think that's his philosophy.</p>
              <p>It is really sad to see evans slipping here, even vidic needs a boot change...</p>
