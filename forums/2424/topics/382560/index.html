              <p>well, do note, EDS was not around for a while too. and injury is a major part/concern.</p>
              <p>IMHO, defence is a team thingy, the whole team has to pitch in and get their hands dirty. Not just the GK or defenders. Yes, it is their primary jobs, but the MFs need to get in too.</p>
              <p>Last season, we have the tevez who was harassing, then the MFs and the defence all pitching in, thus pushing the whole team higher on the field, hence teams struggle to break MU down. Also they fear the pace of Ronaldo, Rooney, and the counters. This season, MU has not fully get in gear with Valencia, Giggs, and their counter is not as feared/fast. So teams are eager to push MU and hence we see the ball coming more into MU halves and less clean sheets.</p>
              <p>IMHO.</p>

              <p>well to be fair to Evans/Brown, no doubt, they are not as glamous as Rio/Vidic, I felt they did well against Chelsea.</p>
