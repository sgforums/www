            <div class='col-md body'>Manchester United captain Gary Neville has called for agents to be removed from the game.<br><br>The England international full-back feels money is being taken away from the game and has called on players to become more responsible for their own actions.<br><br>Neville feels The Professional Footballers' Association is a strong enough body to represent the players and wants them to initiate a change in thinking.<br><br>"The PFA need to continue to do a lot of the good work they are doing," Neville told Sky Sports News.<br><br>"There are a number of things I personally would like to see. I would like to see the removal of agents in the game.<br><br>"When we have a union as strong as we have, I think the union could help with the correct education of players and make those young players not so reliant on other people who are going to take money off them.<br><br>"The PFA does not want to take money, it wants to give and that would be one of the positives along with all the other good work they do."<br><br>Asked if he felt there were any good agents in the game, Neville added: "I don't know many.<br><br>"There is a concern for me and there always has been. How a guy can go in and ask for your wage and expect to be given hundreds of thousands of pounds and sometimes millions in this day and age, I can't see it.<br><br>"That money is going out of the game. The clubs should keep that money. The players if they are due it should keep it and certainly not agents.<br><br>"It won't change until the players become more responsible for their own actions. The problem is that a lot of players believe they need them and it is not the case.<br><br>"You need good accountants and good advice, but you don't need to be paying hundreds of thousands of pounds."</div>
