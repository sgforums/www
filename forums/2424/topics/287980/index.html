The manager knows I am there if he needs me and I am chuffed to bits at the fact he is using me.<br><br>"I can't quite believe what is happening at the moment. I just seem to be walking around with a big smile on my face all the time."<br><br>And Simpson insists the defeat to the Sky Blues provided excellent experience of how to handle disappointments at the highest level.<br><br>He said: "After the Coventry game, I was worried and disappointed just like everyone else.<br><br>"I did have a chat with the manager but he has shown a lot of faith in me, which is a big boost for my confidence.<br><br>"Everyone suffers disappointments. It is part of football. The best thing to do was get over it quickly, keep working hard and then see what develops from there.<br><br>"You have to forget about these things. If you dwell on them, it just means your next performance will probably be poor as well, which is the last thing you need.<br><br>"It is better to get it out of your system, so the day after the game was the last day I spent worrying about it."</div>
