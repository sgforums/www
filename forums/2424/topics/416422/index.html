              <p><img src="http://images.teamtalk.com/10/11/402x210/Nani_2535106.jpg" alt="" width="438" height="223"></p>
              <p class="art-txt-first">TEAMtalk's Jon Holmes believes Nani can inspire a season of success for Manchester United - if he stays on his best behaviour.</p>
              <p>Nani would hardly be considered one of the Premier League's 'bad boys' - in fact, it's hard to imagine him in a fight, even if his love of Capoeira suggests he might be pretty handy at martial arts.</p>
              <p>But there is a less attractive side to the Portuguese winger's style, and it manifests itself in the kind of episode which blotted his copybook in Manchester United's recent 2-0 win over Tottenham at Old Trafford. Call it gamesmanship or blatant cheating: no one who truly loves football could encourage the kind of antics which Nani is sometimes guilty of. Yes, many players try to push the limits and see what they can get away with - but Nani often appears a repeat offender.</p>
              <p>Yet when he is fully focused on the job in hand - dismantling full-backs with his speed of mind and body, taking part in slick interplay passing which bamboozles opponents or firing home fierce strikes across helpless goalkeepers - you have to just sit back and admire the Cape Verde native.</p>
              <p>And Nani looked at the peak of his powers against Blackburn on Saturday, reducing Pascal Chimbonda to such a wreck that the defender must have wished he could have whipped a transfer request out of his sock again so he could escape any further embarrassment.</p>
              <p>So let's not allow Nani's hat-trick of assists to be completely overshadowed by Dimitar Berbatov's five-goal haul. He now has nine contributions to United goals in the league so far this season, which shows he is emerging from a tough 12 months in which he was expected to fill compatriot Cristiano Ronaldo's boots - a task that came too soon, but which may not yet be completely beyond him.</p>
              <p>Although Ronaldo is firmly in the 'world class' category, Nani - who recently turned 24 - should be setting his sights on joining the Real Madrid superstar among the game's elite. Secure at United on a deal which ties him to the club until 2014, he now represents good value at the Â£17.3million Sir Alex Ferguson paid Sporting Lisbon for him just over three years ago.</p>
              <p>Nani's talent has never been in question - only his application of that ability, and the mentality which makes a skilful player into a genuine inspiration for his team-mates. He's not there yet - but his performance for United on Saturday suggests he can warm the hearts of Red Devils fans this winter, and provide the spark for silverware in spring.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I hope he continue to improve. improve on his crossing, fk, decision making and most importantly, his goals ratio. if he can score 15 goals a season, and assists 15 a season, that would be remarkable improvement.</p></div>
