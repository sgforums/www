              <p><span><strong>Manchester United have touched down in Shanghai as their globetrotting pre-season exploits continue.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Rio Ferdinand was a prominent figure at the airport in a red baseball cap which featured his Manchester United number on the front. </span></p>
              <p><span>The defender referred to his self-styled #5 cap on Twitter earlier in July, saying: 'Started making my own #5Caps as I won't be getting any more with England!'</span></p>
              <div class="artSplitter">
              <p><span>He was obviously still smarting about his omission from Roy Hodgson's Euro 2012 squad, and indeed, the future does look bleak for Ferdinand at international level.</span></p>
              <p><span>But United legend Bryan Robson, on tour with the side, paid tribute to the centre-back, who signed from Leeds United ten years ago.</span></p>
              <p><span>'He has had a great career with the club,' Robson told the club website. 'There’s no reason why he shouldn’t last a lot longer.</span></p>

              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson hailed Shinji Kagawa as his first Manchester United goal saw them wrap up the first part of their pre-season tour with a win.</strong></p>
              <p>Kagawa was United's most influential player and served notice of the impact he can have at United following his £12million move from German champions Borussia Dortmund.</p>
              <p>"Kagawa was man of the match and I thought he deserved that," said Ferguson.</p>
              <p>"He has settled in really well and is going to be a really good player for us. I was really impressed with him tonight.</p>
              <p>"One of the features of our game over the years now has been the speed of our counter-attacking. Antonio Valencia is good at that, but Kagawa adds to that.</p>
              <p>"But more than that, I think his awareness of receiving the ball and speed of turning defenders, I think that's going to be an asset for us."</p>
              <p>The Japan international, playing in the hole just off lone striker Federico Macheda, scored a deserved goal in the 68th minute.</p>
              <p>Substitute Bebe beat his man on the left before squaring for Kagawa, whose dipping shot from 10 yards out took a deflection before settling in the net.</p>
              <p>Ferguson sees Kagawa as a key man for United this season and it was easy to see why as the 23-year-old, making only his second start, played with impressive guile and industry.</p>
              <p>Fellow new signing Nick Powell, making his first start since his £4million move from Crewe, looked lively but squandered a great chance to put United ahead in the 23rd minute.</p>
              <p>Spotting Powell's run, young midfielder Davide Petrucci chipped an exquisite ball over the top to his intended target, who took the ball down with one touch.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: #ffffff; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/07/25/article-2178779-1435F2D7000005DC-857_634x429.jpg" alt="Scrap: Davide Petrucci (left) fights for the ball with Wang Lin of Shanghai Shenhua " width="634" height="429">
              <p class="imageCaption">Scrap: Davide Petrucci (left) fights for the ball with Wang Lin of Shanghai Shenhua</p>
              <br></div>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>But Powell, perhaps fearing he had less time than he did, snatched at the chance and screwed a quickly-taken left-foot shot wide of the target.</strong></p>
              <p>Powell had earlier been lucky to come away unscathed from a reckless challenge, when Shanghai's Shouting Wang clattered into him with a studs-first tackle.</p>
              <p>It was enough to get furious United boss Ferguson off his seat in the dug-out in protest, Shanghai midfielder Wang somehow escaping a booking for the dangerous lunge.</p>
              <p>Thereafter United controlled possession without causing their hosts any real problems.</p>
              <p>But the visitors themselves were almost caught out on the counter-attack three minutes before the break.</p>
              <p>Shanghai midfielder Joel Griffiths managed to get in behind Rio Ferdinand, leaving him one-on-one with United keeper Anders Lindegaard.</p>
              <p>Lindegaard, <span style="color: #000000;">who has already declared his intention to depose David De Gea as United's first-choice keeper this season,</span><span style="color: #000000;"> made a superb save to divert the shot. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">With no Didier Drogba or Nicolas Anelka</span> in their squad, the hosts lacked the requisite quality to trouble United, despite being tidy in possession in the first-half, after which they tired.</p>
              <p>At half-time Lindegaard, Powell and Petrucci made way for Sam Johnstone, Ryan Tunnicliffe and Bebe, as Ferguson sought to give his young players as much game-time as possible.</p>
              <p>Kagawa set up Macheda in the 55th minute, but his weak angled shot was diverted, while Bebe, scorer of United's late equaliser in Cape Town, struck a shot straight at keeper Xiong Fei.</p>
              <p>But the goal came 22 minutes from time, allowing Ferguson to make another glut of substitutions before the final whistle, with Paul Scholes among those making a late cameo.</p>
              <p>United, who return to Manchester tomorrow, play Valernega in Olso on August 5, before taking on Barcelona in Gothenburg three days late.</p>
              <p>The final warm-up game for Ferguson's men, before their Premier League opener at Everton on August 20, is away to Hannover on August 11.</p>

              <p><strong>Step aside Naomi Campbell, Elle Macpherson and Twiggy; there's a new king of the catwalk in town.</strong></p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson took to the runway in Shanghai during Manchester United's pre-season tour of China as part of charity dinner and fashion show event in aid of the Manchester United Foundation, organised by Swiss watch makers Hublot.</p>
              <p>The 70-year-old Scot is more used to walking the technical area at the side of a football pitch but swapped the touchline for the catwalk and waved to to photographers at the event.</p>
              <p>He was joined on stage by members of the United squad including new signing Shinji Kagawa, defender Rio Ferdinand and striker Javier Hernandez.</p>

              <p><strong>Step aside Naomi Campbell, Elle Macpherson and Twiggy; there's a new king of the catwalk in town.</strong></p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson took to the runway in Shanghai during Manchester United's pre-season tour of China as part of charity dinner and fashion show event in aid of the Manchester United Foundation, organised by Swiss watch makers Hublot.</p>
              <p>The 70-year-old Scot is more used to walking the technical area at the side of a football pitch but swapped the touchline for the catwalk and waved to to photographers at the event.</p>
              <p>He was joined on stage by members of the United squad including new signing Shinji Kagawa, defender Rio Ferdinand and striker Javier Hernandez.</p>
