              <p><strong>Wesley Sneijder WILL become a Manchester United player this week... if he accepts a restructured pay-deal to move to the Premier League.</strong></p>
              <p>The Dutch midfielder's club, Inter Milan, have paved the way for a £30million-plus transfer by accepting, in principle, a formal offer United made at the weekend.</p>
              <p>They are ready to grant Sneijder permission to speak to officials from Old Trafford, and the Mirror understands those talks will take place later this week.</p>
              <p>The only stumbling block to what would surely be world football's deal of the summer is the player's wage demands, given the tax-favourable status he enjoys while playing in Italy.</p>
              </div>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">
              <p>Sneijder doesn't want to take a pay-cut on a salary that would earn him the equivalent of almost £190,000 a week in the Premier League - which is way outside United's pay structure.</p>
              <p>The English champions though, are prepared to talk about a sliding pay scale that will see a large basic wage topped up with generous bonuses as well as signing-on fees that will be spread over the length of the contract.</p>
              <p>That would almost match his contract with Inter, and, given that United players can earn large sums through image rights - which are less effective at other European clubs - it would appear a compromise could be reached.</p>
              <p>Both clubs were cagey about the situation yesterday, with Inter officials confirming there <em>had</em> been a formal bid from England, and United boss Sir Alex Ferguson suggesting the player had to think about his club's offer.</p>
              <p>Ferguson held talks with United chief executive David Gill about the prospect of an improved salary package for Sneijder that would not break the club's wage structure, and there was optimism a deal could be struck.</p>
              <p>The player's agent is expected to fly into London before the weekend, and United are hoping to have the Holland international training with the squad in time for the start of the Premier League season a week on Saturday.</p>
              <p>Inter had considered a part exchange deal, with Dimitar Berbatov moving the other way, but while they haven't ruled that out completely they have indicated they would prefer the cash up front, with an option to negotiate on striker Berbatov separately.</p>

              <p><strong><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Manchester United were trying to rescue their £35million bid for Wesley Sneijder last night – with United club sponsors Nike believed to be involved in negotiations.</span></strong><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The sticking point is still Sneijder’s wage and image-rights deal, thought to total around £250,000 a week.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>United have a team of tax, finance and legal experts working to find a solution – and Nike have emerged as possible major players in the move for the Inter Milan star.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The Manchester United manager will have been encouraged by Inter Milan’s unusual statement on their official website that their Holland midfielder had pulled out of training for ‘personal reasons’. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>They also stated he would not be available for Sunday’s prestige home friendly against Olympiakos. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The 27-year-old has been Sir Alex’s main transfer target all summer as he seeks a replacement for the retired Paul Scholes.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Any move seemed dead when Sir Alex said he felt a big midfield signing might impede the development of Tom Cleverley and the highly promising Paul Pogba.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>However, there might be a rethink after Inter’s statement yesterday as well as talk from those close to Sneijder that he would be willing to drop his pay needs to closer to United’s wage ceiling. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>He has also been touted as an alternative target for Manchester City and Chelsea should their respective approaches for Samir Nasri and Luka Modric prove fruitless.</span></p>

              <p><strong>Wesley Sneijder has told friends that his failed move to Manchester United could still happen in the New Year.</strong></p>
              <p>Sunday Mirror Sport understands that United pulled out of a deal for the Dutch international midfielder when the scale of his demands became too rich.</p>
              <p>The Premier League champions had agreed a £30million fee with Inter Milan, only for Sneijder to up the ante by ­asking United to lay on a ­private jet and buy his house in Italy. That prompted United boss Sir Alex Ferguson to call time on his summer-long chase for the 27-year-old.</p>
              <p>But Sneidjer has told people close to him that a move to Old Trafford could be resurrected in January. A source said: “Wesley wanted to go to United and was in negotiations until quite late. They couldn’t agree terms but he is still saying he will end up at United.”</p>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">
              <p>Inter were so desperate to get Sneijder off the payroll that they also offered him to United’s rivals City. But it was made clear to both clubs that it would take a pay deal worth close to £250,000-a-week. City boss Roberto Mancini told his Etihad Stadium bosses that he was not interested in linking up again with Sneijder.</p>
              <p>And when Inter enquired for a third and final time last month with an offer to use Sneijder as a makeweight in a deal for Carlos Tevez, they were once again rebuffed.</p>

              <p>Bottomline was money... Had United been willing to pay, he would
              have come liao... Don't blame Mourinho for this kind of things

              <p>Anyway, I honestly belief it's his loss rather than United's...
              Cos Inter is on a decline and he now have to stay there for the
              rest of the season...</p>

              <p><br>Not blaming Mourinho of course, but it was a factor apparently according to Sneijder lol. We'll see in January, or next season. But it's really really unlikely.</p>
