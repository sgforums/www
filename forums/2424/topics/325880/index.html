              <p>Real Madrid
              have been on red alert ever since the Portuguese international spoke of his
              ambition to join them.
              Madrid President Ramon Calderon has even boasted of how he would splash out €100m on the United
              man, only for the English club to refute all offers and shackle the player.
              <br><br>It now seems as if the English club has no choice but to sell,
              as Ronaldo has issued an ultimatum as he attempts to cut and run from
              Sir Alex Ferguson’s
              side.
              <br><br>Ronaldo is currently in Portugal
              where he is recovering from injury but he admits that he will return to
              England next week to confront his club and tell them that he is joining
              Real.<br><br>"Everything
              is fine. Next week I will return to England and tell them [Manchester
              United] that my only desire is to play for Real Madrid and that I will
              not negotiate," Ronaldo told AS.<br><br>According to reports in Spain,
              the winger will hold a meeting next Tuesday with Ferguson and the
              club's owners to tell them that he has had enough.<br><br>It's not what
              United fans want to hear but it seems as if the Ronaldo saga is finally
              coming to an end and no doubt Calderon will be dancing to the tune of
              Ronaldo's words.<br><em><strong><br></strong></em></p>

              <h1><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cristiano Ronaldo set to return as Man Utd dismiss latest Real Madrid talk</span></h1>
              <h2>Manchester United are preparing to welcome Cristiano Ronaldo back to the club's Carrington training ground next Tuesday, despite renewed speculation in Spain that the Portuguese forward remains determined to force through a transfer to Real Madrid.</h2>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/00784/cristiano_ronaldo13_784041c.jpg" alt="Cristiano Ronaldo - Cristiano Ronaldo prepares for Manchester United return next week" width="460" height="288"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Having undergone ankle surgery in Amsterdam on July 7, Ronaldo is due back in the Netherlands on Monday in order to have his recovery assessed by the surgeon, Niek van Dijk. From the Dutch capital, it is anticipated that Ronaldo will then fly into Manchester ahead of his return to United for the first time since helping the club lift the European Cup on May 21.</strong></p>
              <p>Reports in Spain, however, suggest that Ronaldo has informed Madrid, via his agent Jorge Mendes, that he will confront Sir Alex Ferguson, who he met for face-to-face talks in Lisbon earlier in July, with his intention to leave United for the Bernabeu.</p>
              <p>In an unattributed passage in the Spanish newspaper AS, it was reported that, 'The exact phrase that Cristiano wants to convey to (Real president Ramon) Calderon and (sporting director Predrag) Mijatovic, so that they don't need to worry is: "It's OK. Next week, I'll fix everything. I'll go to Manchester and tell them (United) my only desire is to play for Real Madrid and that the decision is non-negotiable."</p>
              <p>Although United declined to comment on the latest apparent movement in the Ronaldo saga, club officials have developed an air of indifference to the 'mischief-making' emanating from the Spanish capital and view the daily bulletins as little more than desperation on the part of Real to chip away at United's determination not to sell.</p>

              <p><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/44037000/jpg/_44037402_tevez203x152.jpg" border="0" alt="Carlos Tevez" width="203" height="152"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Comments attributed to Carlos Tevez by AS last week, in which he called for United to honour Ronaldo's wishes, were dismissed as a fabrication by Ferguson and the latest reports relating to Ronaldo have been treated with similar contempt at Old Trafford.</p>

              <p>im no manchester fan but im really cannot take this arrogant prick treating his club like that. you know, he was so fucking useless in all the seasons before last. but the club persevered with him. he regularly becomes useless in important matches, but the club perseveres with him. for example, in the champions league, he missed the penalty kick, that would have lost the game, had terry not also missed. he also did some retarded actions (wink, DIVING) that earned him the dislike of supporters, but the club perseveres with him.</p>
              <p>and now he like that. nv liked the player, now i don't even like the person.</p>
              <p>sucks now he's the immoral person getting all the things mentioned in the carton</p>
