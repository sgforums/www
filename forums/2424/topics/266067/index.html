United have taken their summer spending past the Â£75m-mark by agreeing a deal for 23-year-old Tevez with his owner, businessman Kia Joorabchian. </strong><br><br>Last night Tevez said: "For me, Manchester United will be a sensational destination and to be a member of Sir Alex Ferguson's squad will be absolutely spectacular. "My dream is to be an idol in English football and I can achieve this now." But it is also understood the Premier League will not sanction the deal unless West Ham can prove they have been compensated for a player they claim to have under contract.<br><br>In April, West Ham were given the go-ahead to continue playing Tevez only when they told the Premier League they had torn up a dual-ownership deal they had with Joorabchian in relation to the player. It is now understood the Premier League will allow this transfer to go through only if the paperwork shows that deal is between West Ham and United, or that West Ham are at least receiving part of the fee agreed between United and Joorabchian.<br><br>A Premier League spokesman said: "Any potential deal for the transfer of Carlos Tevez would have to be struck with West Ham." United are happy that the transaction has been done correctly and hope to announce its completion today. It is understood West Ham will agree to take a cut of the fee. Speaking from the Copa America in Venezuela, Tevez said: "I am a player who thrives on challenges. I went to England to triumph in the Premiership and with West Ham I have achieved the first stage.<br><br>"Now I'm ready to move on to the next stage. I remember with emotion the last match with West Ham at Old Trafford. I scored and the response of the people was amazing. To be there as a member of United would be spectacular. I've had options in Italy but they were difficult." <span style="color: red;">United will pay Â£3m-a-year to loan him for two years and can then pay Â£10m to buy him outright. Tevez will earn about Â£90,000-a-week so the outlay will be more than Â£25m.</span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It seems that this deal if it goes through, Tevez will only cost Man u $3m this year and another $3m from next season's budget and perhaps another $10m from the 2009/10 season's budget to buy him outright...<br><br>If this is really the way it works out, i say its a very good deal. $3m for a striker of Tevez class is very good business... and he is only 23 yrs old. Buying Anelka or Owen would have cost anything from $9 to $12m  outright and they are what... 27, 28 yrs old already... Tho i would have like to see Anelka in united's colours...<br><br>And to think Inter Milan offer to buy him outright for almost $30m but came with a deadline that he must make up his mind fast... And Real Madrid also wanted him not to mention West Ham still wants him and offer $100,000 a week salary to try to keep him... Good thing he was a Man U fan... He once turn up at an official press conference wearing a Manchester United shirt while still playing for Brazil's Corinthians... He was later fined. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.espacioblog.com/myfiles/labeba/tevez.jpg"><br><br>From the telegragh:<br><br><blockquote>Tevez, at the relatively young age of 23, arrives as something approaching the finished article. On top of that, there would appear to be a place ready and waiting in United's attack. With Louis Saha injury prone, with Alan Smith coming up short, Wayne Rooney would benefit immensely from a regular partner.<br><br>In making his move, Ferguson is going for a combination that could prove absolutely lethal. Admittedly, these two diminutive powerhouses might not win too many headers but they will certainly pack a punch, of that you can be sure.<br><br>For a start, the new boy's style and movement should complement Rooney's wont for dropping off deeper. While Tevez does like to roam, he also works the areas behind defenders, using his pace, close control and eye for the main chance. Witness his goal at Old Trafford on the last day of last season that not only helped keep West Ham up but also might have made up some minds on the home bench.<br><br>Tevez is a natural, an aggressive competitor who responds to the big stage. That is, of course, a prerequisite at United, where character is as important as ability. More encouraging still for Ferguson and his coaching staff, Tevez has shown great hunger and desire since turning up out of the blue in east London last year. The little fella never stops trying. He is desperate to do well. That appetite can only increase in the face of this move. His arrival will have a positive effect in the dressing room, coming so soon after the other signings. There'll be a buzz about the place during pre-season, with the old heads looking on with interest to see what they've got.<br><br>Any club would benefit from that atmosphere, particularly one who have just enjoyed some success. A few new faces tend to keep everyone on their toes, banishing thoughts of complacency. So the gauntlet, you might say, has been thrown down in style. Keep up if you can - it's a challenge, I suspect, not many will meet.</blockquote></div>
