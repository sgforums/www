              boss Sir Alex Ferguson claims the emergence of Federico Macheda is the
              reason he has not spent big on a striker this summer.</p>
              <p>The 17-year-old burst onto the scene last season,
              snatching a couple of vital goals during the run-in to help the Red
              Devils land the Premier League title.</p>
              <p>His maturity has impressed many, with the Italian starlet tipped to have a bright future in the game.</p>
              <p>He is expected to continue his impressive progress throughout the 2009/10 campaign, and has looked bright during pre-season.</p>
              <p>He
              was on target for United as they overcame a Malaysian XI 2-0 on Monday
              and his manager has backed him to help ease the disappointment of

              <p>"We
              have big hopes for Macheda. He is one of the reasons we didn't go into
              the market. He is strong, athletic and a good finisher.</p>
              <p>"He played his part last season but he is just a young lad learning his game."</p>
              <h4>Contribution</h4>
              <p>Owen,
              who grabbed the other goal against the Malaysian XI, has also impressed
              Ferguson since arriving at Old Trafford as a free agent.</p>
              <p>"The goal was typical Michael Owen," he added.</p>
              <p>"He
              was the first person to react in the penalty box. And the second
              (chance) was a perfect situation for him. He was quick with his run and
              got in front of the defender.</p>
              <p>"He was unlucky it came off the post. Overall I was pleased with his contribution. It was good. He has done well tonight."</p>

              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson claims departed star <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=22774"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cristiano Ronaldo</span></a> is "streets ahead" of Kaka and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=45843"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lionel Messi</span></a> as the best player in the world - but is confident teenage star <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=123651"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Federico Macheda</span></a> will eventually receive the same adulation.</p>
              <p>Describing Ronaldo's exit as "a massive loss", the United manager paid a glowing tribute to the Portuguese forward. "Cristiano is a massive loss," Ferguson told <em>PA Sport</em>.Â </p>
              <p>"I have nothing but praise for the boy. He is easily the best player in the world. He is better than Kaka and better than Messi. He is streets ahead of them all.</p>
              <p>"His contribution as a goal threat is unbelievable. His stats are incredible. Strikes at goal, attempts on goal, raids into the penalty box, headers. It is all there. Absolutely astounding."</p>
              <p>Ferguson intimated that he had always expected that Ronaldo would leave Old Trafford sooner rather than later.</p>
              <p>"Three years ago I had a conversation with (then assistant) Carlos Queiroz," recalled Ferguson. "We thought we would be doing well to keep him for another two, so overall, we have done well to keep him for six years.</p>
              <p>"He is a great player. And if he gets the right training regime, as he had at United, he will develop and get even better."</p>
              <p>Yet, as he hands over Ronaldo's number seven shirt to <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=7930"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Michael Owen</span></a>, Ferguson is already looking at his next star of the future.</p>
              <p>Federico Macheda burst onto the scene last spring when he followed up a sensational injury-time winner against Aston Villa by securing another victory against Sunderland a week later. The Italian youngster scored in United's 3-2 friendly win over a Malaysia XI and looks likely to be United's fourth-choice striker this season behind Owen, <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=12724"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dimitar Berbatov</span></a> and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=21046"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Wayne Rooney</span></a>.</p>
              <p>"Macheda is top drawer, a hero in the making, just as Cristiano was," said Ferguson. "It is hard to believe he is just 17. We probably need to check his birth certificate because I reckon he is at least 28."</p>
              <p>"Federico has plenty of confidence," admitted Ferguson. "When he came on the other night he dropped into midfield and ran down their left-side.</p>
              <p>"He is a player all right - and tough as old boots. He can look after himself.</p>
              <p>"He does not have the lightning reactions of Ronaldo but he is quick around the box and he has an eye for goal.</p>
              <p>"He was way in front of everyone with his finishing the other day - and I mean everyone. It was magnificent to see."</p>
