You guys are so biased that my heart's broken.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>I think Fergie should at least get a solid defender. Silvestre's not great, Wes Brown and John O'Shea while good do not have enough quality. Pique is still young, and seems to want a move away. </div></blockquote>Haha, your nick sound more guy-ish.<br><br>Anyway Welcome!!<br>please invite more of your female MUFC fan friends here pls  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>A good defence is a strong offence, maybe.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yep. I did not think that Man Utd needed to get a new striker because they have Rossi! The backline is very important though and I do agree with the inexperience of the young defenders, which is a point I had made earlier too.<br><br>But Pique is probably ready. Anymore loaning and he will probably be wanting to get out of Man Utd for serious.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Anyone remember how many times Man Utd conceited crucial goals in the last minutes? The defense line can just break down like that so suddenly. Like that match against Arsenal... Man Utd did well until the last few minutes when WHAM! I don't really want to see those things happen again. It's really awful. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the key to those last minutes goals are  concentration..<br><br>that's why it was mentioned that for GK like Foster, it is hard to zone out when nothing is happening, and zone in, when opposing teams do a sudden attack..<br><br>I think MUFC is doing well with Vidic cause he is pretty focus.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the ridiculous last minute goals that i rmb we conceded were all because of <strong>SILVESTRE</strong>. i think it was during the christmas period where we played wigan and reading.<br><br>that bloody sod cant defend sh!t. his concentration is so poor. he's not cut out to be a central defender. but keeps insisting that thats his best position.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br></div>
