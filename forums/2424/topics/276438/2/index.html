Ole will remain at the Club in a coaching capacity and will represent Manchester United as an official Ambassador.<br><br>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said: "I would like to thank the Manager, the coaching and medical staff and most of all the supporters, who have supported me through my career. They have been fantastic and were a real inspiration to me when I was out injured.<br><br>"The support the fans and the staff showed me during that time was the main motivation for me making my comeback. I feel proud to have represented Manchester United for 11 years and have some very special memories.Â”<br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson said: Â“Ending your playing career is a sad day for anyone, in the case of Ole, he has 11 fantastic years he can look back on.<br><br>"Ole has achieved everything a player could ever wish to achieve. He has been a great servant to the Club and has always remained a model professional in his responsibility as a player, in his demeanour and his manners have always been exemplary. Ole will hopefully go on to be a good coach.Â”<br><br>David Gill said: Â“Ole has provided us all with some exceptional memories during his time here at the Club. Nobody will ever forget his dramatic winner in Barcelona, but much more than that his dedication and professionalism make him one of the great role models in football. Ole will be dearly missed as a player, but will go on to serve the Club as an Ambassador and a valuable coach.Â”<br><br></div>
