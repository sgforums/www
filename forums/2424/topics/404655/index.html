              <p><strong>The Reds kicked off pre-season training at Carrington this week, so we caught up with Sir Alex's right-hand man Mike Phelan to find out about the Reds' preparations for the new season...</strong><br><br><strong>Ultimately it was a disappointing end to last season, but is everyone ready to go again with renewed determination after having a break?</strong><br>It’s early doors yet, we’re talking now on the third day back – and not everyone is here, the World Cup lads are still missing. But on the whole the mood is very good. The players look refreshed. They know what pre-season is about! I think they’ve just got to focus on getting themselves fit and ready for when they have to perform.<br><br><strong>How much planning from the coaches’ and management’s perspective goes into pre-season?</strong><br>There’s a lot of planning. There’s also repetition from previous years, good work which we try to repeat, but you also have to introduce new elements so the players aren’t getting bored. Pre-season is difficult, especially now, as for some players it’s the longest break they’ve had in many years. Their concentration has dropped, so it’s important they get their heads round what we’re asking them to do and move on quickly. We’re going on tour relatively early this year, so our preparations are split between Carrington and what we’re doing in America.<br><br><strong>How do you manage it with some players back now, the World Cup lads returning later and others recovering from injury?</strong><br>Well, we’re Manchester United and we have the facilities, the staff and experience to cater for every eventuality. We concentrate now on the group that is with us and when the others come back they will be taken care of by other members of staff. So the plan will be that every member of staff has a priority, then we bring it all together in the final week before we start the season. That’s the aim. Obviously the World Cup players will be a little bit behind, but that sharpness will come. Players are sensible these days anyway, they look after themselves a lot better than they ever did before.<br><br><strong>Different from your playing days?</strong><br>[Laughs] Yeah! And it changes all the time. Players’ attitudes change, besides the stakes are probably higher now than they’ve ever been. You have more players to work with, too. So, you can structure things differently. Each player has a different preparation period and something to aim for. We try to coordinate that as best we can. We’re here for the players to try and get them as fit as they can be for the start of the season. Once we’ve done that job we move on to try and win some trophies together.<br><br><strong>Talk us through the general process for the coaches and medical staff when the players return for pre-season…</strong><br>We look at their physical and mental condition through a series of tests early on. We get feedback from our different departments in terms of what we should be doing, what we shouldn’t; how far to go from start to finish. Then we look at how we build up that programme over the course of a four- or five-week period. That comes from experience and having good staff and good information. We’ve got that here. That provides all the ingredients for the players to be ready for the new season.<br><br><strong>Players often mention how important it is to have the foundation of a good pre-season. Why is it so important?</strong><br>Every day is important in pre-season, you’re building vital stamina and speed. So when the competition starts, you’re able to compete in three games a week, and you’re sharp enough to perform at a high level. If you miss days in pre-</p>
              <p>take the player out of the scene altogether. You’re chasing that base of fitness whilst you’re playing. It’s always difficult to do that because when you’re playing you’re in a state of play-recovery-play-recovery. To regain your sharpness and physical fitness can be difficult. That’s why pre-season is very important.<br><br><strong>So, for a coach, this must be one of the key periods in the calendar?</strong><br>Well, it’s a key period for the players, so that makes it important for the coach. The players must be prepared for competition. We have an idea of where we want the players to be in terms of fitness. There may be hiccups along the way, but we’re confident we can get the players ready for that first game.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong>After an extended summer break, United's players are relieved to be back preparing for a new campaign at Carrington.<br><br></strong>With the exception of those involved at the World Cup, the Reds have been afforded an eight week break - an extra two and a half weeks compared to the previous campaign.<br><br>"Eight weeks is a long time," Wes Brown told MUTV. "I've been on holiday for most of it, and when I've been back around the last couple of weeks I've wanted to get back in. It's been nice and we've had a good rest and we're all excited now to get ready for the season."<br><br>Darren Fletcher admits being consigned to armchair involvement in the World Cup has only stoked his desire to get back in action.<br><br>"I am glad to be back," says the Scottish midfielder. "The last few weeks I've been itching to get back. Watching the World Cup makes you wish you were there and makes you want to play football again, just like a kid really.</p></div>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">WAYNE ROONEY could miss the start of the season with Alex Ferguson ready to give his World Cup players an extended rest.</h2>
              <p>Rooney was one of six Manchester United stars representing their countries in South Africa.</p>
              <p>They are not due back in training until July 28 and Fergie is not ready to rush them all into the season opener against Newcastle on August 16.</p>
              <p>Ferguson is in Chicago at the start of United's tour of the Americas.</p>
              <p>He said: "Winning is part of what we have to do here - but the main object is to get everyone game time and come back ready, fit to start the season.</p>
              <p>"Even the Community Shield does not come into it in terms of a need-to-win game. It's the final part of our preparation.</p>
              <p>"It's on August 8 and then they have internationals that week, and then we have our first game the following Monday against Newcastle.</p>
              <p>"By that time, after we've surveyed the fitness of the ones who've been in the World Cup because they don't come back until July 28, we'll know whether any or all should play in the opening game.</p>
              <p>"I have a feeling we'll probably not play them all."</p>
              <p>Ferguson will keep an eye on Rooney in particular after his troubled World Cup.</p>
              <p>He went into it with high expectations despite injury wrecking the end of his season. But he failed to score or have one good game as England flopped to a second-round exit.</p>
              <p>Ferguson is aware of possible burn-out with his younger stars but finds it more difficult to give Rooney, 24, a rest as the club's top scorer from last season is always so desperate to play.</p>
              <p>Rooney hit 34 goals and scooped the PFA and Football Writers' Player of the Year awards.</p>
              <p>But on the field he ended with only the Carling Cup.Another player Ferguson will have to assess closely when he returns from tour is France's Patrice Evra who was at the centre of a players' strike.</p>
              <p>The French refused to train one day after Nicolas Anelka was sent home for swearing at coach Raymond Domenech and there were calls for Evra to be stripped of the captaincy and suspended.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ji-Sung Park of South Korea, Serbian Nemanja Vidic and new boy Javier Hernandez, of Mexico, also represented United at the finals though one player who will not need assessing is England's Michael Carrick who did not play. Fergie also has injury problems which could deprive him of five more first-team players for the big kick-off. Gary Neville (calf), Rio Ferdinand (knee) and Michael Owen (hamstring), are doubtful while Owen Hargreaves and Anderson are definitely out with knee problems.</p>
              <p>But two players raring to go are new signings Hernandez and Chris Smalling.</p>
              <p>Hernandez, 22, was a star for the Mexicans while Smalling, 20, is a relatively unknown defensive signing from Fulham.</p>
              <p>United midfielder Darren Fletcher, 26, is excited by the two new arrivals. He said: "Chris has been training and he's a big, strong, tall lad. I think he's got great potential for the future. He's going to be some athlete and when he learns what Manchester United is about he'll be a top player."</p>
              <p>Hernandez starred as Mexico made it to the last 16. He will join at the end of the tour at Guadalajara where United play his former club Chivas.</p>
              <p>Fletcher added: "He's young, sharp and looks really hungry. He scored a couple of great goals at the World Cup and I think he'll be a good addition."</p>
              <p>Another young arrival could be Inter Milan's Mario Balotelli, 19. United have made a £28million offer for the striker and hope to have him by the weekend.</p>
              <p>Midfielder Fletcher will be a senior player on tour and is determined the trip forms a foundation for United's bid to regain the league title from Chelsea.</p>
              <p>He said: "It runs through your head all summer. Losing out in the Premier League and the Champions League, you think about what you could have done better.</p>
              <p>"You have to try and switch off, and I managed to do that at times but you've got to be always thinking about how you can improve yourself."</p>
              <p>United will play Celtic, Philadelphia Union, Kansas City Wizards and the MLS All-Stars. The tour ends with the trip to Guadalajara.</p>

              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson has earmarked <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester United" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united"><span style="color: #005689;">Manchester United</span></a>'s friendly in Dublin next month as the comeback date for Wayne Rooney and most of the rest of club's World Cup contingent.</p>
              <p>Rooney, Nemanja Vidic, Michael Carrick, Park Ji-sung and Patrice Evra were given 28 days to recover from their extended seasons in South Africa, regardless of their playing time in the tournament.</p>
              <p>They have been told their first appearances of the summer will come against an Airtricity League XI in Dublin on Wednesday 4 August to celebrate the opening of the Aviva Stadium, the rebuilt Lansdowne Road ground.</p>
              <p>Javier Hernández, who impressed with two goals during Mexico's World Cup campaign, will join United's tour of north America in Houston next week before facing his former club, Guadalajara, in Mexico in a game arranged as part of his £7m transfer.</p>
