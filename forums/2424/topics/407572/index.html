              <p>Nemanja Vidic believes Manchester United showed the hunger they need to be champions as they beat Chelsea 3-1 in the Community Shield.</p>
              <p>United took the lead shortly before the break on Sunday as Antonio Valencia turned home from close range, and new signing Javier Hernandez doubled their advantage on 76 minutes despite a miskick.</p>
              <p>Salomon Kalou threatened to spark a Chelsea comeback when he made it 2-1 with seven minutes remaining, but Dimitar Berbatov rounded off the scoring in style in injury time.</p>
              <p>Vidic suggested there will be far more important tests to come this season, but he feels United showed they are ready to win silverware this season.</p>
              <p>"It's important to me," he told <em>Sky Sports</em>. "This is the last game before the season and I think we did well today. Obviously a few players didn't play a lot in pre-season and they had the chance today to build up their fitness and they did well.</p>
              <p>"I believe there will be more (trophies). This is just the beginning. I think we have a good squad and we showed we have the energy and we showed some hunger as well and this is very important to be the champions.</p>
              <p>Vidic also said United's players had been desperate to see Berbatov open his account for the season.</p>
              <p>"It's important for him to score the goal," he told <em>Sky Sports</em>. "He has a lot of pressure. I hope he will score more goals, but we tried to help him to keep going - to do what he did today."</p>

              <p><strong>Nemanja Vidic fully expects to lay his hands on more silverware during the course of the 2010/11 season.</strong></p>
              <p>The Serbian skippered United to victory over Chelsea in Sunday’s Community Shield at Wembley, and feels the Reds have laid down a marker for the coming campaign.</p>
              <p>“I believe there will be more, this is just the beginning,” Vidic told <em>Sky Sports</em>. “I think we have a good squad. We showed today we have the energy, we showed the hunger as well and these are very important for winning trophies.”</p>
              <p>While delighted to quickly get back in the winning habit against Carlo Ancelotti’s side, Vidic conceded that the Wembley win was just as important for providing a timely fitness boost ahead of the Reds’ Premier League opener against Newcastle.</p>
              <p>“It’s important to win,” he conceded. “It’s our last game before the season and I think we did well today. For a few players who didn’t play a lot in pre-season, they had a chance today to build up their fitness and they did well.</p>
              <p>“Some players needed games before the start of the season, like a few players who arrived later for pre-season. They did well and that’s most important.”</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>"We are delighted Nemanja has committed his future to the club," he said. "This kills all the silly speculation over the past few months. Nemanja has developed into one of the best centre-halves in Europe and we are pleased he will be here for many years to come."</p>
              <p>Vidic arrived from Spartak Moscow in a £7.2million deal on Christmas Day 2005.

              <p><strong>Although Vidic never gave any impression of knowing where the stories about his apparent discontent in Manchester had come from, they never went away and both AC Milan and Real Madrid were said to be showing an interest in the 28-year-old after the World Cup this summer.</strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p>However, United chief executive David Gill sprung a surprise during the club's pre-season tour of North America when he confirmed that Vidic, who was not present, had agreed outline terms on a new contract.</p>
              <p>The finishing touches have now been made, leaving Ferguson glad to have Vidic around until 2014.</p>
              <p>"We are delighted Nemanja has committed his future to the club," he said. "This kills all the silly speculation over the past few months.</p>
              <p>"Nemanja has developed into one of the best centre-halves in Europe and we are pleased he will be here for many years to come."</p>
              <p>Vidic holds a notable place in United's history because his arrival from Spartak Moscow in a £7.2million deal was announced on Christmas Day 2005.</p>
              <p>Although he endured a difficult transition to the Premier League, Vidic eventually found his feet and has gone on to become one of the best defenders in the world.</p>
              <p>Famed for his strength and no-nonsense approach to keeping forwards at bay, the only opponent he has consistently had trouble against is Liverpool's Fernando Torres.</p>
              <p>Vidic was a central figure in each of United's three successive title wins and their Champions League triumph over Chelsea in 2008.</p>
              <p>With Rio Ferdinand and Gary Neville missing and Ryan Giggs starting on the substitutes' bench, Vidic has skippered United this term and led the Old Trafford outfit to their Community Shield triumph over Chelsea at Wembley earlier this month.</p>
