              <p><strong>Sir Alex Fegruson  will ask Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs and Gary Neville to stay at </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span></a><strong> as coaches once their playing days are over.</strong></p>
              <p>All three have signed one-year deals that take them to the end of next season but Ferguson is convinced the trio can inspire the next generation of local talent.</p>
              <p>'They are the living proof for young players that the United system allows players to succeed,' said Ferguson. 'When they stop playing, they will stay. All three are taking their coaching diplomas. I don't think the club will pass up that much experience.'</p>
              <p>Ferguson is already planning for a future without Rio Ferdinand and Wes Brown, which is why he spent £10million on 20-year-old Chris Smalling from Fulham. His recruitment policy looks to  the long term.</p>
              <p>'I am always thinking one or two seasons ahead,' he said. 'I anticipate over time the departures of the souls of the club, and the likes of Rio Ferdinand and Wes Brown, who are over 30. Nemanja Vidic has had some physical problems.</p>
              <p>'Chris Smalling has huge potential as a centre-half, and he's only 20. In two or three years' time he'll be at the top. As for Mame Biram Diouf, you have to watch hundreds of strikers before you find one who can win matches. When you find him, you sign him.'</p>
              <p>In an interview with French newspaper L'Equipe, Ferguson earmarked Patrice Evra, John O'Shea and Darren Fletcher as team leaders of the future.</p>
              <p>'Evra is a powerful force as a leader of the dressing room,' he said. He also shrugged off concerns about United's £700m debt, insisting the sporting health of the club was in good shape.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">'Protesting has become a reflex action these days,' he said. 'There are fans protesting against (club owners) the Glazers, which doesn't bother me because it doesn't interfere with the team. The fans love their club here and they are worried. I don't share their worry. I have a talented squad, a superb training complex, a magnificent stadium. We're fighting for the biggest titles every season. So it's easy for me to keep my distance from all these issues.'</p>
              </div>
              <p>Ferguson, 68, also put talk of retirement firmly on the backburner, and revealed that he passed his most recent six-monthly health check with flying colours. 'Everything's fine,' he added.</p>
