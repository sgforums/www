            <div class='col-md body'>Cristiano Ronaldo may have earned all the plaudits after United's 1-0 FA Cup win over Middlesbrough, but it was Alan Smith who left Old Trafford sporting the biggest grin of the evening.<br><br>The Reds' striker made his first start of the season at Old Trafford since recovering from a broken leg and dislocated ankle sustained just over 13 months ago and impressed throughout his 70-minute run-out.<br><br>The 26-year-old forward says he is delighted to be back playing again in the first-team, and after the game paid tribute to Sir Alex Ferguson, who has been influential in his recovery.<br><br>"It's always been my aim to get back to the Alan Smith I was before my injury and the gaffer has been brilliant by giving me time to do that," he told MUTV.<br><br>"I think I would have been forced back into action early at other clubs and made to suffer in front of everyone who would be expecting my performances to be up to previous standards.<br><br>"It's been refreshing to be given time and the Boro game was a great occasion for me. It's what I've been working towards."<br><br>Smith admitted to feeling nervous before the quarter final replay against Gareth Southgate's side, in what was his first start at Old Trafford since December 2005.<br><br>"I had a few extra butterflies when I was walking down the tunnel, but I also had a big smile on my face too! Sometimes when you've been out it's difficult to get into the flow of games, but the lads told me to just go for it. I wear my heart on my sleeve and I want to show that to everyone<br><br>"Playing games for the best teams with the best players is what being a footballer is all about," he added. "And I know that at Manchester United I've got the opportunity to do that.<br><br>"There has been a lot of speculation recently over my future but that's never been in doubt between me and the club. I'm proud to play for this football club<br>and hopefully my performances will show that."<br><br>The victory over Gareth Southgate's side mean United will still be fighting on three fronts when the players return from international duty next week. Smith is relishing the challenges that lie ahead and is hopeful of helping United secure at least one trophy between now and May.<br><br>"To be part of a team like ours who have a great chance of winning some silverware is fantastic," he beamed. "That's what I've worked so hard for. Hopefully when the difficult times come I can be one of those players who can come in and do a job for the team.<br><br>"There is a great spirit amongst the squad and all the lads want to win. This club sets very high standards and hopefully we can reach those standards."<br><br></div>

It would be a shame if his ambition is just to seat and soak.. that would be the role of someone in a blue jersey.</div>
