            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">If Premiership titles are won by grinding out results without playing well then this could just be Manchester United's year as they escaped from Anfield with a three point haul, courtesy of a 1-0 victory over a Liverpool side that bossed the whole of the second half.<br><br>The most intriguing aspects of a game that was more mediocre than magnificent all occurred in the final few minutes, as United cemented a 12 point advantage over Chelsea thanks to substitute John O'Shea's winner in injury-time.<br><br>It was another substitute, this time Liverpool's Peter Crouch that just moments before was denied by a world class save, as Edwin Van der Sar sprawled across his goal to produce a title winning intervention.<br><br>United's afternoon was tempered somewhat when with five minutes remaining Paul Scholes lost his head in swinging but missing with an air punch in the direction of Xabi Alonso, that culminated in not quite a knock-out but a red card nevertheless.<br><br>The first half was a game of chess, albeit of a more robust variety than which Mr Kasparov is accustomed, with both sides nip and tuck in the opening sparring that only sporadically showed genuine quality.<br><br>As is so often the case in the North West's most fiercely contested derby chances were at a premium, at least in comparison with tackles, as Patrice Evra set the tone in just the second minute in going through the back of Steven Gerrard.<br><br>With temperatures raised Craig Bellamy had the first sniff of goal moments later but Van der Sar was alive to the scent and was out smartly to defend with his feet.<br><br>Daniel Agger's jackhammer of a left foot sent a drive from a full 35-yards searing over the top, before on the counter, Cristiano Ronaldo dragged his snapshot wide on the turn. As United began to settle into a semi-rhythm Ronaldo again was presented with a sight at goal from Henrik Larsson's sumptuous flick but it was a similar outcome as the Portuguese shot over.<br><br>Liverpool's main avenue in an attacking sense came through moving Nemanja Vidic from the centre, where he excels, to out wide, where he looked cumbersome against Craig Bellamy's lively forays down the right.<br><br>It was from one such raid that Bellamy disposed a ponderous Vidic before from the by-line delivering a ball across goal that was just too heavy for Dirk Kuyt. While it was United that perhaps used possession more intelligently, it was Liverpool that continued to go closest to opening the scoring as John Arne Riise hit a free-kick just wide, despite the presence of a wall that broke all records in terms of proximity to the ball without being penalised.<br><br>The final action of the half saw Jamie Carragher demonstrate a remarkable determination with a fine piece of defending that denied first Ronaldo and then a subdued Wayne Rooney in quick succession.<br><br>Whatever was said in the home side's dressing room clearly had a galvanising effect for it was Liverpool that came out the bolder and more inventive in their play. Barely had a minute passed when Steven Gerrard hurriedly controlled and volleyed high when he could have struck first time and then Bellamy spurned a presentable opening.<br><br>Kuyt's beautifully disguised pass was perfectly weighted into the path of his partner, but the Welshman's touch was heavy, meaning his second was off-balance as Van der Sar was forced into a comfortable stop.<br><br>Bellamy's next contribution was more assured as he put the ball into United's net, only to have his celebrations curtailed by a sharp sighted linesman who made the correct call.<br><br>United's own attacking efforts looked positively limp in comparison as first Larsson, making his last Premiership appearance being seemingly heading back to Helsingborgs, was replaced by Louis Saha and then more worrying was the sight of Rooney leaving the field with a badly gashed knee, courtesy of Carragher's high challenge.<br><br>Prior to this and Riise again showed the full venom of his left foot with a drive from distance that dipped just over, as United toiled manfully but showed little of the chutzpah that has propelled them to the summit.<br><br>Saha called for a penalty as he tumbled in the box as Agger took his standing foot but it would have been cruel on a Liverpool side that were the brighter throughout the second 45 minutes.<br><br>Liverpool's effort were, though, to prove all in vain as the final stages brought the most dramatic of climaxes as O'Shea inscribed his name in derby day folklore.<br><br>Ronaldo's fizzing free-kick brought only an unconvincing parry from an unsighted Jose Reina and from the rebound the Irishman secured certainly the three points; and most likely the title.</span></div>
