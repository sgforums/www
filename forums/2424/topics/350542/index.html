              <p><strong>Ji-sung Park was delighted to play his part in the Reds' 2-1
              victory at Newcastle after setting up Dimitar Berbatov to fire the
              winner</strong>.<br><br>The Korean winger intercepted an attempt from
              Ryan Taylor to chest the ball back to Magpies stopper Steve Harper,
              before poking the ball to Berbatov to tap home from close range.<br><br>"I
              saw what the defender was trying to do, but he didn't get it right and
              I was able to keep the ball moving," recalled Park in an interview with
              <strong>MUTV</strong>.<br><br>"I knew I couldn't score because the
              keeper was quite close to me so, but then I saw Berba. I wasn't sure if
              the ball would get to him, but I was delighted when I saw he'd put it
              in the net."<br><br>Having seen Liverpool and Chelsea temporarily close
              the gap on United 24 hours earlier, Park says it was vital the Reds
              left St. James' Park with all three points and maintained their healthy
              advantage at the top of the table.<br><br>"It was a great win for us.
              Our rivals had won the night before so it was important we increased
              the distance between us and them," he insisted.<br><br>"We experienced
              how it feels to be chased last season, but we enjoy the challenge of
              every game. There was a bit of pressure on us, but I think that can be
              a good thing because it means you are fully concentrated on the game.<br><br>"It's nice to be seven points ahead and we also have a game in hand on our rivals," added the 28-year-old.<br><br>"But
              we're not taking anything for granted, we want to keep our performances
              going and concentrate on every game. By doing that, we hope the title
              will be ours at the end of the season."</p>
