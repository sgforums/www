              <p>Michael Carrick has been pleased with his own performances this season, but he accepts that it won’t earn him a permanent place in the team.<br><br>The 26-year-old midfielder’s passing and vision has been a real asset to United in recent weeks.<br><br>“I’m pleased with my own form,” he told <em><strong>MUTV</strong></em>. “As the season has gone on I feel I’ve got stronger and stronger and I’m happy with the way things are going. But now is the time where we need everyone to be in top form with important games coming up every week.”<br><br>In a midfield where competition for places is fierce, a good performance can often be followed by a space on the bench. But Carrick doesn’t see it as being dropped, and can suppress his disappointment with the thought that the policy is more likely to deliver trophies come the end of the season.<br><br>“You have to get used to it,” he explains. “It’s not a case of getting dropped, it’s about making the right decisions for the benefit of the team. <br><br>“You have to look at the bigger picture for the whole season. The boss has got all the experience in the world, he knows exactly what is required over the course of the campaign. You don’t want to be sat on the sidelines, but you can’t get</p>
              <p>too down. Your chance comes round pretty quickly.<br><br>“As the years go on it’s becoming more and more of a squad game. Every game is important. But everyone here is happy to miss the odd game if you can win trophies at the end of the season.”<br><br>The advantage of a large squad not only aids physical recovery, it enhances the options available to Sir Alex to counter opponents differing styles of play.<br><br>“There’s so much quality in our midfield, and the advantage of that is that you can adapt to different games, opposition or scenarios,” he adds. <br><br>“Each player has their own strengths, it’s not like we have five players who are all exactly the same. <br><br>“There is a good variety, and that gives the boss options. So far it’s worked pretty well. Players have come in and out, and it hasn’t seemed to affect us. It’s working really well.”</p>
