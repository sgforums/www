            <div class='col-md body'>Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes was his typical modest self after celebrating his 500th club appearance in the 2-0 win over Liverpool.<br><br>The 31-year-old was handed a commemorative plate prior to kick-off by Sir Bobby Charlton but was seen running straight off to ready himself for the game.<br><br>Scholes is delighted to have been given the chance to ply his trade at Old Trafford for his entire career but is adamant the only importance on the day was three points.<br><br>"It was quite special, playing for Manchester United is a big thing," he told Sky Sports. "I'm still enjoying it as much as ever, probably more than I have done.<br><br>"It's just another game we needed to win to stay at the top of the table. "People have milestones all the time and we were just concentrating on winning the game and that's what we managed to do."<br><br>The former England international appears to have once again found his goalscoring touch. "I hadn't scored for a while as you probably know," he said. "I got one in midweek and another one today but as long as the team win it doesn't really matter who scores."<br><br>Meanwhile, Scholes insists no-one inside the club is getting carried away by their start, knowing they face a battle all season to win the title back from Chelsea.<br><br>The latest win saw United return to the top and Scholes has urged his team-mates to continue performing. He added: "We're not going to get carried away. "We'll just keep plugging away, playing well week in week out creating chances, scoring goals and hopefully we can stay up there."<br><br><img src="http://images.skysports.com/images/playerpics06_07/Premiership/ManUtd/scholes_500games.jpg"></div>
