However i'm more afraid of how Lille would be playing at OT, would they be playing football? or would they be playing gladiators instead??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yes...Utd can usually score from those fast "run-down-the-flank" counter attacks. But I feel they are not aggressive enough in their tackles, usually waiting for the opponent to lose the ball and not try to get the ball back.<br><br>I noticed this with the Fulham match, and again with Pool on sat.

Rooney limped out of UnitedÂ’s 1-0 victory over Liverpool on Saturday with a knee injury. The club feared he would miss the second-round, second-leg clash with Lille at Old Trafford tomorrow night. But doctors yesterday gave Rooney the all clear to manager Alex FergusonÂ’s relief. </strong><br><br>UnitedÂ’s most decorated player, Ryan Giggs, insists the fear that each game might be his last spurs him on to continue winning. The Welsh winger played in his 700th competitive game for the Red Devils at Anfield and now has Bobby CharltonÂ’s club appearance record of 759 in his sights.<br><br>Giggs, 33, said: Â“Because you get older and are getting closer to the end, you try to enjoy it a lot more. Â“The aim is to win every game and every competition, because it might be the last FA Cup final you play in, it might be the last FA Cup game you play in. Â“You try and make the most of it, you try and win as much as you can.Â”<br><br>Giggs could pass CharltonÂ’s appearance landmark at some stage next season. But he insisted: Â“That is something which is getting talked about a lot more.<br><br>Â“However, itÂ’s something IÂ’ve not really taken any notice of. Â“If I did it would be great, it would be a tremendous achievement. Â“At the moment I just keep looking at the next step, the next game.Â”<br><br>Lille midfielders Mathieu Bodmer and Laurent Cabaye have been ruled out of tomorrowÂ’s match. Playmaker Bodmer has an ankle injury while Cabaye has not recovered from a stomach-muscle tear.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;"><span class="large"><strong>PREVIEW - Manchester United vs Lille </strong></span></span><br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson has warned his Manchester United players not to get sucked into a war with Lille at Old Trafford. The French side are still seething over Ryan Giggs' controversial late winner at the Stade Felix-Bollaert a fortnight ago.<br><br>Having had two claims against the goal turned down by UEFA, Lille's sense of injustice has only increased, with their camp openly questioning Giggs' integrity over the quickly-taken free-kick the Welshman insists he would convert again if he had the chance.<br><br>With the memories of Lille's last visit to Old Trafford - when Giggs sustained a fractured cheekbone following a dubious challenge from Efstathios Tavlaridis - still fresh in the mind, Ferguson has told his players not to let their minds get distracted from the task of protecting their narrow advantage and securing a quarter-final place.<br><br>The United boss said: ``Our focus is firmly on qualifying, nothing else. `It is hard to understand why they are still going on about it but there is no reason for us to get involved in grievances or any emotional attachment to the game.<br><br>`This is a big event for us. It is important we progress and do better than we have done in the previous few years.''<br><br>Ferguson did allow himself a little chortle when it was suggested United should again try the quick free-kick routine which led to Lille almost storming off the field, a move likely to be punished by UEFA at an independent hearing on March 22, which will also encompass the security problems which saw riot police fire tear gas into the visiting section of the ground.<br><br>However, the Scot grew much more serious when the specific allegations against Giggs were mentioned. Ferguson rebutted: ``I do not think we should try to defend Ryan Giggs given the career he has had. `His career does that for him. I won't get involved in that.''<br><br>It is 11 years since Ajax became the only side in Champions League history to overturn a first-leg deficit inflicted on home soil to advance in a knockout tie - Panathinaikos the hapless victims - so United would not appear to have too much to disturb them.<br><br>They may not have been at their best over the past couple of weeks but four successive away wins, culminating in Saturday's potentially pivotal Barclays Premiership victory at Liverpool, has emphasised the staying power of Ferguson's troops.<br><br>Yet, in failing on two occasions to beat their French opponents last season, and by losing to both Copenhagen and Celtic already this term, the Red Devils know little is certain in European football these days.<br><br>Ferguson continued: ``Europe is a test, it doesn't matter who you play.<br><br>``You cannot take anything for granted as it proved last year and against Celtic and Copenhagen, when we were very careless.<br><br>``But I trust the players because they are showing great expression in their game.<br><br>``We are approaching the game in a good mind and with a strong spirit, so we have a big chance.''<br><br>With Louis Saha injured and Patrice Evra doubtful, Henrik Larsson and Gabriel Heinze seem certain to start, while Alan Smith is virtually guaranteed a place on the bench even though he has not made a first-team appearance since the Carling Cup defeat at Southend in November.</div>

This makes football more entertaining'. So he biased against Manu or Lille oso can't be helped. He is held accountable for refereeing the match and reporting to the UEFA.<br><br>How many times have we spectators seen biasing and favouritsm in football matches? I've seen dat for more den a decade and life still go on. Lets juz hope no matter wat happened, it wun escalate to fightings or riots. Dat would be damaging...</div>
