            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://i133.photobucket.com/albums/q60/zocos/heinze-gabriel.jpg"><br><br><span class="large"><strong>Heinze out to shackle Keita</strong></span><br><br>Manchester United FC defender Gabriel Heinze has identified the returning Kader Keita as LOSC Lille MÃ©tropole's danger man going into the teams' return leg at Old Trafford.<br><br><strong>Likely starter</strong><br>With Patrice Evra struggling for fitness, Heinze is expected to start at left-back on Wednesday, when he will come up against the right-sided Ivorian attacker. The pacy, inventive Keita sat out the first leg of this UEFA Champions League first knockout round tie through suspension but struck twice in Lille's 4-0 weekend win over ES Troyes Aube Champagne. "It's true that he is a good player," said Heinze. "He has a lot of quality and he is a crucial player for Lille, but on our side, we will do the maximum to stop him."<br><br><strong>French reunion</strong><br>Heinze, who spent three years in French football with Paris Saint-Germain FC, added that he is anticipating a stern test of United's European ambitions, despite the 1-0 advantage they earned in France a fortnight ago. "Lille showed their quality when we went there. They are a top quality, compact, aggressive team with young players, and they're a difficult rival. For me, it's a difficult match but the most important thing is what Manchester United do."<br><br><strong>Squad system</strong><br>For the 28-year-old Argentinian international, this season has brought his own personal battle for the left-back berth with Evra - a place he lost when sidelined for much of last term with a cruciate ligament injury. Despite four UEFA Champions League appearances, he has played in only 13 of United's Premiership games but will be raring to contribute if called upon against Lille. "We're fighting on three fronts and we have a squad of 24, 25 players," he said. "It's important to be ready when the manager calls on you."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think their set-pieces especially freekicks could have killed us, not their long-shots though. Some of their players were quite rough and man-handled like there's no tomorrow!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> luckily there's little injury other then Silvestre..I think its a dislocated shoulder?

            <div class='col-md body'>draw should been a fair result but the luck they've been having its no surprise they won although it was a superb goal from an equally perfect cross.<br><br>i didnt like the idea of playing 3 in the middle and leave rooney on the wings. rooney needs a more central role to get involve.<br><br>lille were by far the aggressive team and the number of cards should explain that.<br><br>if their luck are going to continue, they might get roma or psv for the qfinal</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Had Ronaldo not fall down so theatrically, United should have been awarded a penalty. Yellow card for dive? Come on, he's not robben ya know?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Lille played relatively well. I was impressed with Jean Mokoun, supposedly a United's target but United settled for Carrick.<br><br>But i'm not so impress with Odemwingie. That balatant elbow to Vidic's face should have and probably would have had him yellow carded.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Overall not a convincing victory but wad the heck, United won! It's a nice parting gift from Larsson.
