            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Edwin still struggling</strong><br><br>Edwin van der Sar is still struggling with a calf strain and looks set to miss United's Premiership game with Bolton at Old Trafford on Saturday lunchtime.<br><br>The Dutch goalkeeper picked up the injury during the warm-up before United's FA Cup clash at Middlesbrough at the weekend.<br><br>Although a scan has shown there is no long term damage, van der Sar has been told to rest up for the rest of the week.<br><br>"The scan showed there was a little damage in my calf, but hopefully it won't take too long to heal," he told his personal Icons website.<br><br>"I don't think I will be back in time to face Bolton on Saturday - that would be pushing it. We will see but it certainly doesn't look that way at the moment.<br><br>"I suddenly didn't feel good in the warm-up, so I decided not to play. It's always better to rest, even if it's just a small strain, so that it doesn't get any worse.<br><br>"I didn't have to go for any treatment, so I stayed and watched the Boro game. I think we played okay in the first half, we had a few chances after the first goal and Boro did too. Tomas (Kuszczak) made a great save from Yakubu early on, so that was good for him.<br><br>"It definitely put us back a little bit to concede a goal straight before and straight after half time; it was a bit nail-biting for a while there," he added.<br><br>"But it was great for us to get a goal back with Ronaldo's penalty and get them back to Old Trafford. We could have done without it, but we have another chance to reach the semis and that will make it all worthwhile."<br></div>

A lot of luck.<br><br>You have to take your chances on the day and hope that a few of their team, actually the vast majority of them, have an off day. When facing United you have to be prepared for an onslaught from the very beginning. Earlier in the season I was suspended and had to watch from the stands as they beat us 4-0 at the Reebok Stadium. Wayne Rooney scored a hat-trick - scoring twice in the opening 16 minutes. They were absolute quality - for the first 30 minutes the football they played was of a standard I have rarely witnessed at the Reebok. </strong><br><br>Hence staying in the game is crucial - you must try to keep them in front of you as much as possible. Old Trafford would not be top of the list of venues you would choose to visit when your team is in the midst of a spell of poor form. But the wins have to start somewhere - and we believe it can happen at United?<br><br>El-Hadji Diouf scored twice against them playing for a Europe XI on Tuesday. I didn't see the goals and - amazingly - I didn't hear all about them from the man himself during training on Wednesday. Normally you hear him before you see him - but I think that he is letting his football do the talking at the moment.<br><br>Of course, United have injury and suspensions problems. Paul Scholes, for example, will be missing on Saturday and, as a midfielder, he is the sort of player I love to test myself against. Looking at it another way, United missing first-team regulars gives us a better chance, so I'm not too disappointed!<br><br>The fact that United will have players missing does not affect the way we prepare for the fixture - we know that they will still field a strong side.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Man Utd v Bolton: Preview</strong><br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson is backing Wayne Rooney to fire Manchester United towards Premiership glory.<br><br>With Henrik Larsson back in Sweden, Louis Saha and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer both on the injured list and Alan Smith still to make a league start this term, Rooney is the Red Devils' only fully fit striker for their Old Trafford encounter with Bolton.<br><br>A subdued force for much of the campaign, certainly in comparison to Cristiano Ronaldo, Rooney has recently showed encouraging signs of a return to top form.<br><br>The England star broke a seven-game barren sequence with his goal at Middlesbrough last weekend, then added another two in the UEFA charity game in midweek.<br><br>'Wayne is like everyone else who scores goals, he wants to score all the time,' said Ferguson.<br><br>'That is their mantra. They feel scoring is the most important thing. There is nothing wrong with that.<br><br>'He doesn't get down and he doesn't dwell on things because he is such a bubbly character. But I have seen his confidence coming back.<br><br>'He has been alive in training and I am sure he won't be worried about being our only striker.'<br><br>Ferguson knows he can rely on Rooney's willingness to play a full part, not just against Bolton, but the FA Cup quarter-final replay with Middlesbrough 48 hours later.<br><br>In fact, with so many men missing, the United boss has little alternative other than to stick with the same squad for both games.<br><br>Among the casualties, in addition to his forwards, are Edwin van der Sar, Darren Fletcher and Mikael Silvestre, while Paul Scholes is only one game into the three-match ban he picked up for his red card at Liverpool.<br><br>Happily, Patrice Evra is back from a calf problem while Ferguson confirmed reports claiming Rio Ferdinand is suffering from cracked ribs are wide of the mark.<br><br>'We have a few injuries at the moment but we coped when we had some at the start of the season and we will cope with it again,' said the Scot.<br><br>Although John O'Shea's injury-time winner at Liverpool took United 12 points clear, Chelsea have since halved the deficit by emerging victorious from their two games in hand.<br><br>The results appear to have given the back-to-back champions a momentum they have not enjoyed at any other stage during the campaign, even if nothing much has changed.<br><br>Ferguson said: 'People think Chelsea will go the whole way but why should we worry about them?<br><br>'We need to keep collecting the points and cutting the games off. Hopefully it will get us to where we want to go.<br><br>'Obviously, every game is a cup final-type situation but the players have shown they have the composure to handle it.<br><br>'They have the confidence in their game and, as we saw against Fulham and Liverpool, they have the guts and determination to see it through too.'<br><br>Ryan Giggs is expected to partner Rooney up front, with Ronaldo and Park Ji-sung occupying the wide slots in midfield against a Bolton side well placed to land a UEFA Cup slot and who are not unused to winning at Old Trafford.<br><br>Abdoulaye Meite insists he is not fazed by the possibility of taking on England striker Wayne Rooney in front of a full house at Old Trafford.<br><br>Bolton's Ivory Coast defender has grown in confidence after cementing a place in the team since arriving from Marseille in the summer.<br><br>Meite, 26, is expected to shake off a toe injury and return to the side against Manchester United following suspension.<br><br>He said: 'I will take in my stride playing at Old Trafford and facing Rooney.<br><br>'I have appeared at the Stade Velodrome in front of big crowds, so it is something I am used to and I am ready.<br><br>'One of the reasons I came to England was to play against the likes of Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea.'<br><br>Meite believes the Premiership is living up to its billing as the best in the world.<br><br>He said: 'In France you can pass the ball around at the back and take a five-minute breather. Here it is non-stop.<br><br>'I knew it would be a top standard of football. It is the best in the world.<br><br>'I am determined to succeed in this environment and Bolton are an ambitious club.'<br><br>Sam Allardyce will make a late decision on Kevin Davies' fitness.<br><br>The striker has returned to training following a six-match absence after suffering a chipped bone in his ankle. However, his lack of match practice is a concern for Allardyce ahead of the match.<br></div>
