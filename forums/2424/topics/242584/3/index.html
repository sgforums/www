He's not a starting 11 player - almost definitely because his assets are his strength and being at the right place at the right time. Other then that i guess he's practically a spectator.<br><br>I'm not being critical here but O'Shea is really clumsy and slow.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Cheers.<br>CK</div>

He is at the right place now.<br><br>"Real Madrid are a club in decline but at Manchester United Ronaldo is in a side that is developing and getting better and better.<br><br>Unstoppable<br><br>" United are unstoppable now. I think even if we had made it as difficult as we could against them they still would have beaten us the frame of mind they are in right now.<br><br>"They have shown with some recent results that they can be dogged and resilient as well as fluent, open and attacking. They have got all the components to win it.<br><br>"There's not much more can be thrown at United to try and dislodge them from their Treble bid."<br><br>Losing your mouthpiece, organiser and captain with a bad injury just seven minutes into a match against a side like Bolton is really testing the mettle.<br><br>But the medics would have just about got Gary Neville's boots and socks off to examine his ankle in the dressing room when Ronaldo's classic winger's byline run and cutback for Ji-sung Park to open the scoring and make up for the Korean's earlier three-yard miss that defied science.<br><br>United's second has to be a serious contender for Goal-of-the-Season as the Reds turned a Bolton throw yards from their own corner flag into a goal.<br><br>Rio Ferdinand headed clear and Ronaldo, rather than hoofing it clear, brought it under control played a one-two with Rooney then accelerated away on a 70-yard run.<br><br>Rooney did well to keep up with him and as his colleague slowed to third gear he sped past him in fourth and onto the perfect pass. The dinked finish was quality.<br><br>Ronaldo teased Kevin Nolan after 25 minutes before crashing in a shot that Jaaskelainen mishandled and Park again pounced.<br><br>Bolton were in total disarray and the gulf between the top of the Premiership and the side closest to challenging the Big Four and on the fringe of a Champions League place was colossal.<br><br>Wanderers rescued some pride as United sensibly eased off the gas with tonight's Middlesbrough FA Cup replay in mind.<br><br>But even the Reds slowing down couldn't stop Rooney unleashing a blistering fourth on a breakaway before Gary Speed hit home a consolation from a penalty award that would have had Old Trafford seething had it been a meaningful goal.<br></div>
