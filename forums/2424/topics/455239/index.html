              <p><strong>QPR are set to complete the marquee signing of Manchester United's Park Ji-sung, Press Association Sport understands.</strong></p>
              <p>The South Korea international will move to Loftus Road for a fee of £2million once the relevant paperwork has been completed.</p>
              <p>Park, who won four Premier League titles and a Champions League during his time at United, is understood to have been swayed to join QPR by their ambitious plans.</p>
              <p>The 31-year-old became one of Sir Alex Ferguson's most reliable players after joining the club in the summer of 2005.</p>
              <p>Park began his professional career with Japanese side Kyoto Purple Sanga aged 18 and impressed during Guus Hiddink-led Korea's successful run to the World Cup semi-finals in 2002.</p>
              <p>Such performances saw him follow the Dutchman to PSV Eindhoven, where he played for three years before joining United for £4million.</p>
              <p>The deal comes just days after <span style="color: #000000;">United loaned defender Fabio to QPR</span> for the duration of the upcoming season.</p>
              <p>Park will be useful to Rangers early in the season, because captain and central midfielder Joey Barton is banned for 12 games after being sent off in the final match of last season.</p>

              <p>Park would certainly help the Hoops achieve that aim after his success at United, not only on the field but commercially as well.</p>
              <p>Rumours of Park moving to the Rs have been around all day and earlier SkyBet even suspended betting on him leaving for Loftus Road.</p>

              <p>"My time at United will last in my heart for the rest of my life," he told the club's official website.</p>
              <p>"It’s been a great privilege to be part of such a great team, to have won so much and to have played with special teammates and for the greatest manager in the game.</p>

              <p>Park, who enjoyed cult status amongst the club's fans, also had kind words for the Old Trafford faithful upon his departure.</p>
              <p>“The fans have been fantastic to me and I will always remember them with great affection," he added.</p>
              <p>"Now, I’m looking forward to giving everything for a new challenge at QPR, where I will bring all my ambition and spirit I have gathered at United. [Those qualities] will be with me forever."</p>
