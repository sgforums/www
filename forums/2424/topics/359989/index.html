              John O'Shea felt United's grit and resolve came to the fore in overcoming the stern challenge of Wigan Athletic on Wednesday evening.
              
              Goals in the final half-hour from Carlos Tevez and Michael Carrick gave the Reds three precious points in the ongoing Premier League title race, and Sheasy believes United showed the hallmark of champions at the JJB Stadium.
              
              â€œI thought we showed our commitment and our courage to go and get the three points," Sheasy told MUTV. "Obviously a draw would not have been too bad either but you have to be proud of how we kept going and with the chances we created. I think we just about edged it.
              
              "We have done that a few times this season but that is what the club is all about, commitment and courage. The coaching staff as well, to believe in what we are doing is right and we are getting the rewards."
              
              With former Reds skipper Steve Bruce at the Latics' helm, O'Shea and his colleagues knew they would have to weather a storm at the JJB, before a patient plan paid dividends.
              
              â€œPeople start thinking that Steve Bruce is going to do the manager a favour but the way they played, they came at us like a steam train and maybe, could have been two nil up before we had a decent chance," he said.
              
              "We did miss quite a few good chances in the first half as well so we could have gone in level. So we felt at half-time that if we got one goal we would definitely go on to win the game.
              
              â€œThe way Wigan set out their team with five in midfield we knew that if we kept possession well eventually they would get tired and gaps would open up and that is exactly what happened for the winning goal. The gaps appeared and we took advantage of it."
              
              The come-from-behind victory - United's third in just under six weeks - brought the Premier League title to within a point of a third consecutive stint at Old Trafford, and O'Shea is relishing the chance to seal it against Arsenal this weekend.
              
              â€œWe are nearly there but Arsenal would like nothing more than trying to spoil our party," he said. "It would be nice to do it at Old Trafford in front of our fans.â€�
              
              "I thought we showed our commitment and our courage to go and get the three points. You have to be proud of how we kept going... That is what the club is all about, commitment and courage."
