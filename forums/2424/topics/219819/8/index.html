              <p> </p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Having seen that theory comprehensively undermined by an equally emphatic 3-1 defeat, Wenger last night took the highly unusual step of delivering a publicly scathing assessment of his team's performance.<span style="font-weight: normal;"> </span></strong></p>
              <p>"It's difficult to accept but easy to explain: we were poor defensively, offensively and cohesion-wise – we delivered an off-the-mark performance completely," said Wenger. "We were well beaten. We gave them too much room and were naïve. When you are completely off the mark, it's impossible to win the game. There were massive individual errors. I feel we never had any cohesion offensively or defensively." </p>
              <p>It is the sixth time since April that Arsenal have lost against Manchester United or Chelsea, leaving fresh question marks about their psychological strength. </p>
              <p>Wenger even pointed to "some mental reasons" but, having invested such faith in this young squad, he stressed the need for unity ahead of this Sunday's match against Chelsea. Defeat at Stamford Bridge, however, could leave Arsenal 11 points adrift of the Premier League leaders and realistically out of the title race for another year.</p>
              <p>"It's a massive blow," said Wenger. "We have to stick together and deliver a completely different performance next Sunday. </p>
              <p>"We need to do something special now to stay in the race. We were completely not at our level. Why? I believe there are some mental reasons." </p>
              <p>By restricting space for Arsenal's intricate passing and almost inviting them on to the edge of their penalty area before counter-attacking with devastating speed, United executed what seems to be the perfect game plan against Wenger's inexperienced team. </p>
              <p>"We conceded twice from our own corners," said Wenger. "I believe it was down to the intelligence of our positioning." </p>
              <p>With Arsenal lacking players to retain possession up front and so limit the threat of a counter-attack, there will be further calls for Wenger to sign a striker before today's 5pm deadline. Wenger, though, confirmed that Sol Campbell will be his only addition. "We are not doing any business," he said. </p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson insisted that Arsenal remained in the title race but there is no doubt which team he regards as United's greatest rivals. "We need Chelsea to drop points," he said. "I hope Arsenal go to Stamford Bridge next Sunday and batter them."</p>

              Manchester United at Wembley Stadium on Sunday Feb 28 2010.</h2>

              </p><h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">MANCHESTER UNITED lifted the first domestic trophy of the 
              season by downing Aston Villa at Wembley.</h2>
              <p></p>
              <p>Wayne Rooney made it 20 goals in 20 games as Manchester United defeated Aston Villa and retained the Carling Cup 
              in front of the Glazer family at Wembley.</p>
              <p>Wayne Rooney was the Carling Cup final head boy as Manchester United came from 
              behind to retain a knockout competition for the first time with a 2-1 victory 
              over Aston Villa.</p>
              <p>After starting as a substitute, Rooney was only on the pitch because of an 
              injury to Michael Owen, who had levelled James Milner's fourth-minute penalty.
              </p><p>He was not going to let that inconvenience stop him becoming the Wembley 
              match-winner against Villa though and 16 minutes from time, Rooney got on the 
              end of Antonio Valencia's cross and looped home yet another headed goal - his 
              fifth in a row - to take his goal tally for the season to 28 and allow United to 
              retain the trophy after a thrilling Wembley encounter Sir Alex Ferguson feared 
              was not possible.</p>
              <p>One of the more obvious reasons why Ferguson would choose to leave his best 
              player out of such a showpiece occasion was the surface, which has been claggy 
              every time the Red Devils have played at the rebuilt stadium.</p>
              <p>Fearing a draining match, plus extra-time, then an England game and a Premier 
              League trip to Wolves, when victory will take his side top, before that decisive 
              meeting with AC Milan on March 10, Ferguson presumably felt this was an outing 
              Rooney could do without.</p>
              <p>Yet any worries about the pitch were groundless. And Villa's flying start 
              meant there was no chance of either side being allowed to turn this into the 
              sterile affair many had predicted.</p>
              <p>At the time, Martin O'Neill questioned how Nemanja Vidic avoided a card of 
              any kind for his foul on Gabriel Agbonlahor. As the contest wore on, and an 
              increasing number of his own players ended up in Phil Dowd's notebook, the 
              criticism grew.</p>
              <p>If Agbonlahor had gone down when Vidic first grabbed his shirt, the card 
              should have been red. Instead, the Villa striker admirably attempted to stay on 
              his feet after outpacing the Serbian to reach Ashley Young's lofted pass beyond 
              the United defence. In the end, it was too much. Vidic stuck out a leg and 
              hauled Agbonlahor down. Milner kept his nerve, sending Tomasz Kuszczak the wrong 
              way to provide the contest with the start it craved.</p>
              <p>As tends to be the case when they fall behind, United's response was an 
              all-out attacking assault, which in turn provided Villa with space to counter. 
              The mixture produced a thrilling spectacle, made all the more absorbing because 
              Ferguson's team levelled so quickly.</p>
              <p>So solid all season, it was just Richard Dunne's luck his blunder should come 
              in Villa's biggest game of the year. The Irishman was robbed by Dimitar Berbatov 
              close to his own penalty area and though he made up the ground, in making his 
              despairing tackle, Dunne only succeeded in rolling the ball into Owen's path, 
              offering the kind of instinctive first-time finish he has made a career out of.</p>
              <p>That Owen's contribution - and Rooney's exile - came to an end three minutes 
              before the break was cause for regret, although the watching Fabio Capello has 
              long since deduced those dodgy hamstrings cannot be trusted through another 
              World Cup campaign.</p>
              <p>Capello was probably also reaching the conclusion Stephen Warnock should be 
              handed his problematic left-back berth against Egypt on Wednesday. But when 
              Warnock slipped just before half-time, man-of-the-match Valencia galloped past 
              him down the by-line, his cross eventually arriving at the feet of Park Ji-sung, 
              who slammed it onto the inside of a post, where it rocketed across goal for 
              Carlos Cuellar to hack clear.</p>
              <p>Friedel palmed away a magnificently constructed effort from Michael Carrick 
              after half-time, although Villa were United's equals and could easily have 
              levelled when Ashley Young sent a volley bouncing into the ground.</p>
              <p>The problem for Villa was knowing Rooney lurked. After falling victim to him 
              in midweek, Gianfranco Zola claimed England's superstar has the Midas touch. It 
              is more a Boy's Own story he is writing at the moment and having looped home yet 
              another header to put his side ahead, Rooney came agonisingly close to making it 
              number six when he crashed another onto the woodwork.</p>
              <p>Villa responded in kind, Vidic nudging Emile Heskey's header onto his own 
              bar. But that would have spoiled the story.</p>
              <p></p>

              </p><h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">ANTONIO VALENCIA is living the dream at Manchester United 
              - but don't call him the new Ronaldo. <span style="line-height: 20px; font-size: 16px;">The Ecuador star has come of age at Old Trafford and was voted 
              Man of the Match in last Sunday's Carling Cup triumph over Aston Villa.</span></h2>
              <p class="article">Succeeding in the right-wing spot held so famously by David 
              Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo is not easy. Not only is Valencia showing the form that persuaded Alex 
              Ferguson to pay Wigan £16million last summer but also beginning to surpass 
              expectations.</p>
              <p class="article">Wembley's scuffed pitch held no horrors for him. And he has kept his feet on the ground this week in readiness 
              to wreck Wolves at Molineux today.</p>
              <p class="article">He was bought to replace £80m Ronaldo so the comparisons will 
              never be far away. But Valencia, 24, said: "Cristiano is a superstar and I'm 
              Valencia, a footballer learning each day.</p>
              <p class="article">"I don't desire comparisons with him as we are different 
              players. "And while I'm happy with my work in the team, I know every day 
              I must fight for my place.</p>
              <p class="article">"It's not easy to get into the starting XI here - but this is 
              my challenge." That bid is tougher now Nani has served his three-match ban - 
              but Valencia is oozing confidence at the moment.</p>
              <p class="article">And he admitted: "I'm enjoying my best moments as a pro. I 
              always dreamed of being at a big club and to win titles. Now I can fulfil those 
              dreams at United.</p>
              <p class="article">"Sincerely, I didn't deserve to be Man of the Match in the 
              Carling Cup final as the success was down to all the team. But that day at 
              Wembley will always be in my head. I'm very happy.</p>
              <p class="article">"I'm here because of Mr Ferguson. The coach insisted he wanted 
              me and that really came as a surprise to me. "From the first moment I joined, he was clear with me. He 
              explained why United needed me.</p>
              <p class="article">"The key to my good form is I receive the coach's confidence. "From afar the image of Mr Ferguson appears different to the 
              one that actually exists. "Some people believe that he does not connect with the players 
              but, really, he is very open and gives you a chance."</p>
              <p class="article">The Carling Cup was the first trophy in United's bid to win a 
              hat-trick of silverware this season. And Valencia, who last year turned down a move to Real Madrid, 
              is convinced United can win the Premier League and Champions League.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: "At Wigan, I worked hard to fight relegations - at 
              United it's about winning titles!</p>
              <p class="article">"We have obtained the first title and talk of the treble is not 
              madness. The Premier League race is open and we have a good chance in the 
              Champions League. "If I add these in my first season at Old Trafford, it will be 
              a year never to be forgotten."</p>

              <div class="headerOne"> </div>
              <div class="headerOne">Darren Fletcher, industry personified, added a late fourth, fitting reward for a sweat-soaked shift in the boiler-room. Out wide, Antonio Valencia and Nani tortured Milan’s full-backs.</div>
              <div class="headerOne"> </div>
              <p class="headerOne">Paul Scholes entertained the crowd with an epic challenge on Mathieu Flamini, the United midfielder storming in off the type of lengthy run-up usually seen at the other Old Trafford. Perhaps remembering past encounters against United with Arsenal, Flamini wisely jumped out of the way.</p>
              <p class="headerOne">The English were too quick, too powerful, too mobile and too decisive in possession for Milan, whose ageing players ran into the perfect storm, a red-flecked tempest blowing through them as if they were mannequins. And to think people feared such a strong collective of players as Ferguson’s would be lost without Cristiano Ronaldo this season.</p>

              <p class="headerOne"><img src="http://i133.photobucket.com/albums/q60/zocos/football-022.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p class="headerOne"> </p>

              <p class="headerOne"> </p>
              <p class="headerOne"> </p>
              <p class="headerOne"><strong>On a night when United showed what a well-balanced force they are in Europe, Ronaldo and Real Madrid slumped out of the Champions League. The irony.</strong></p>
              <p class="headerOne">Ronaldo may head the European scoring lists with seven but Rooney hurtles upwards, all his four goals coming against Milan. If Juventus are La Vecchia Signora, Milan are the Old Man.</p>
              <p class="headerOne">However many anti-ageing miracles they perform in that famous Milan Lab, they cannot escape the reality that the team urgently need rejuvenating, looking towards the Pato generation not the Beckham.</p>
              <p class="headerOne">Pato, the promising Brazilian, was sadly injured, ensuring Milan’s attack had little bite, particularly with Klaas Jan Huntelaar desperately searching for form and Ronaldinho too sluggish.</p>
              <p class="headerOne">Unlike Rooney. The United forward’s first goal arrived after 13 minutes. When Ronaldinho failed to track back with Gary Neville, the full-back had time and space to lift over a magnificent cross, the ball dropping perfectly towards the penalty spot where Rooney was lurking with intent. Daniele Bonera had dozed off, gifting Rooney the freedom to make a twisting leap, powering an unstoppable header past Christian Abbiati.</p>
              <p class="headerOne">Once again, Rooney’s prolific success up top for United provided further food for thought for Fabio Capello, although the England manager is adamant that Rooney will play in the hole at the World Cup. Rooney is a threat wherever he is fielded but Ferguson clearly believes he is most effective as the front man.</p>
              <p class="headerOne">Rooney’s goal meant Milan required three, a mission impossible for younger legs, let alone these rusting limbs. Leonardo’s visitors might have scored before Rooney struck, Ronaldinho heading wide and then Huntelaar’s touch letting him down badly. United withstood these early scares, plumping up their cushion through Rooney, who added a second shortly half-time.</p>
              <p class="headerOne">Ferguson’s interval instruction to “keep the tempo up’’ was certainly heeded by his players. Nani showed his threat on the counter, racing away from Ignazio Abate and then playing a sublime ball with the outside of his right foot behind Milan’s defence. Rooney scarcely had to break stride to slide the ball past Abbiati.</p>
              <p class="headerOne">Milan, a great club needing a new direction, could have pulled one back but Huntelaar headed over from Abate’s cross, summing up their abject performance. United showed Milan how to finish just before the hour-mark, following a Valencia dart down the right. When he laid the ball back to Scholes, Milan’s defence was even more of a mess, ripe for the taking.</p>
              <p class="headerOne"> </p>
              <p class="headerOne"> </p>
              <p class="headerOne"><img src="http://i133.photobucket.com/albums/q60/zocos/football-027.jpg" alt=""></p>

              <p class="headerOne"> </p>
              <p class="headerOne"> </p>
              <p class="headerOne"><strong>Scholes rolled the ball through to Park, who promptly placed his shot from right to left past poor Abbiati.</strong></p>
              <p class="headerOne">The game then turned into a testimonial with the arrival of a moist-eyed Beckham, who was greeted with genuinely heartfelt cheers and chants from United fans and ironic shouts of “Fergie, Fergie sign him up’’.</p>
              <p class="headerOne">Beckham, his best years long gone, looked overwhelmed by the fans’ reaction. So did his mother sitting in the directors’ box.</p>
              <p class="headerOne">So used to creating chances for United in his pomp, Beckham inadvertently almost fashioned another for them. Underhitting a back-pass, Beckham allowed Nani a run at goal before Milan’s defenders managed to remember seemingly long-forgotten skills, re-organising to thwart Nani.</p>
              <p class="headerOne">Beckham then paraded his more positive side, unleashing a stinging volley that Edwin van der Sar pushed over.</p>
              <p class="headerOne">Alternating saluting Beckham and slaughtering Glazer, the Stretford End finished with the pleasure of Fletcher’s goal two-minutes from time, the Scot heading past Abbiati. As Beckham heads into the sunset, United head into the last eight.</p>

              <p><strong>Manchester United came from behind to clamber back to the Premier League summit, trampling on Liverpool's top-four hopes in the process. Park Ji-sung headed home the winner after an hour, securing the spoils after Wayne Rooney's 33rd goal of the season had controversially levelled Fernando Torres' fifth-minute opener.</strong> </p>
              <p>Although victory was not achieved without a nervy ending, during which Torres spurned a glorious chance to equalise, the result kept United's noses in front of Arsenal and Chelsea.</p>
              <p>For Liverpool though, fight was not enough. When they scored four times in the corresponding fixture last season, it appeared to open the door to that championship Holy Grail.</p>
              <p>Not only has that been proved fool's gold, a 10th defeat of the season leaves them requiring slip-ups from Tottenham and others just to finish in a Champions League spot.</p>
              <p>What Rafael Benitez claimed before Christmas was a guaranteed fourth-place finish could hardly be further away.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson once claimed that a game of tiddlywinks between what the majority still believe to be England's biggest clubs could trigger the deepest of passions.</p>

              <p><em>Full blooded: Wayne Rooney dives in on Steven Gerrard in the fiery affair</em></p>

              </div>
              <p><strong>Certainly there was no sense of inferiority from the visitors despite their present status, and with good reason. It was the Merseysiders who had won the last three meetings - each of which featured the dismissal of Nemanja Vidic, who it seems in Torres has found someone he simply cannot handle.</strong></p>
              <p>Such is the mystique surrounding that duel there was an audible gasp the first time Torres ran at the Serbian. Like so much of the opening period's final half-hour, it petered out disappointingly. The spark had been ignited long before that, although Torres was the one who flicked the switch.</p>
              <p>By his very demeanour, Torres gave the impression of being a man on a mission.</p>
              <p>Five minutes into the contest, he seized on the loose ball after Michael Carrick had lost possession, sending Steven Gerrard away at top speed with an inspired backheel.</p>

              <p>Opener: Fernando Torres (right) and Gerrard celebrate</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>As Gerrard found Dirk Kuyt to his right, Torres continued his own run, United's defence never set properly to ensure the Spaniard remained under their control.</strong></p>
              <p>By the time Kuyt dug out his cross, Torres was on his own. Park's wayward effort from a similar position later on proved the goal was anything but the routine effort it looked to be as the Spanish star guided the ball out of Edwin van der Sar's reach.</p>
              <p>Quite apart from falling behind against such fierce rivals, an increasingly enthralling title race demanded a United comeback. For Liverpool, the equaliser came far too quickly. The controversy was immediate too.</p>

              <p><em>Spot on: Rooney fires home his first-half penalty</em></p>

              <p> </p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>Benitez argued Javier Mascherano's attempt to haul back Antonio Valencia was outside the box, which, indeed, was where the infringement began. Ferguson countered the combative midfielder had prevented a clear goalscoring opportunity.</strong></p>
              <p>The managers - no friends these two - continued their finger-jabbing row long after Wayne Rooney had tucked home the rebound from a spot-kick awarded by Howard Webb and saved by Pepe Reina.</p>
              <p>That was it for the goal threat until the hour mark arrived. During his long career, Gary Neville has gone on plenty of unselfish runs down the right wing, knowing David Beckham or, more latterly, Cristiano Ronaldo were never going to give him the ball.</p>
              <p>Darren Fletcher is not quite of that attacking calibre but Neville must have sensed his run was purely to provide space for the Scot.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div><em><img src="http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u189/zomanu/Ferg.jpg" alt=""></em></div>
              <div><em>Hotting up: Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson clashes with Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez</em></div>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>So it proved. As Neville flew past on the overlap, Emiliano Insua edged to his right. In an instant, Fletcher had exploited the gap and curled over a cross.</strong></p>
              <p>As Rooney and Jamie Carragher tussled and tugged, Park arrived behind them, launching himself at the ball like a guided missile and powering the diving header into the corner of Reina's goal.</p>
              <p>Rooney had one more chance before the end, which he fired wide. Torres was on the end of a far better one when Steven Gerrard drilled over a low cross near the end.</p>
              <p>For once against United, the Spaniard miscued and Yossi Benayoun headed the loose ball straight at Edwin van der Sar.</p>
              <p>United could celebrate, Neville and Ferguson doing the cheerleading. Liverpool's money men are staring at a big black hole marked Champions League,<br>Benitez is failing on his guarantees.</p>

              <p><strong>A week on Saturday England will meet the USA in Rustenburg and Rooney will be the focal point of a nation’s hopes. There is a ‘Roo-stenburg’ headline waiting to be written.</strong></p>
              <p>A steady time in South Africa and Rooney will have cemented his reputation. But a prosperous time and he will be elevated again.</p>
              <p>As Rooney said 12 months ago: ‘Next season could be the one that transforms me from someone who could be a great player into someone who is a great player. That’s what I’m hoping.’ He is not alone.  </p>
              <p>There were no jumpers on the ground down on Armill Road, though. It was Monday lunchtime, suburban quiet, less than 24 hours after that ovation at Old Trafford and three days before the ceremony in London.</p>
              <p>Here, on a narrow, short strip of Liverpudlian land, there was nothing to suggest a connection to either event. Yet it was on this patch that the boy-man dubbed ‘the last of the street footballers’ emerged.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>Wayne Rooney, England’s No 10, Manchester United’s No 10, comes from Liverpool 11. It is on the No 14 bus route, the part of Croxteth in which the car-less Rooneys lived.</strong></p>
              <p>Some of the extended family are still here — Rooney’s uncle Ritchie runs the local boxing club and a football team called the Oyster Martyrs, in which Rooney’s brother Graeme was a full back — but the Rooneys left the house on Armill Road more than a decade ago.</p>
              <p>They moved around the corner, so the territory remains familiar to Rooney and his wife, Coleen, who also grew up in the area. ‘I’ll always be a Croxteth girl,’ is a Coleen statement.</p>
              <p>Her father, Tony, was an amateur boxer, as was Rooney’s father Wayne Snr, and the area has that old working-class reputation where sport is valued. It is known chirpily as ‘Crocky’.</p>
              <p>Off Armill Road, on Storrington Avenue, one house has the Everton club insignia on its front: Nil Satis Nisi Optimum — Nothing But The Best Is Good Enough. It is a reminder of that famous photograph of Rooney’s front window with its Everton pennants and car number plate.</p>
              <p>Few families can be as Toffee-blue Everton as the Rooneys. Wayne Snr wanted to call his first-born Adrian, after Adrian Heath, but Wayne Jnr it is.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/06/04/article-1284117-09E51FE1000005DC-244_468x286.jpg" alt="True blue: The iconic image of Rooney's bedroom window at his family home in Croxteth" width="468" height="286">

              </div>
              <p><strong>The Evertonian nature of brother Graeme’s Christian name is confirmed by one of his middle names, Sharp. Graeme Sharp and Adrian Heath were forwards in an Everton team that might have dominated Europe but for the Heysel ban.</strong></p>
              <p>By the time Wayne Jnr started supporting, his hero was Duncan Ferguson. It is a measure of Rooney’s devotion that he wrote two letters to Ferguson while the combustible, pigeon-fancying Everton centre forward was in Barlinnie Prison in 1995. Rooney was in primary school. Ferguson had never heard of him.</p>
              <p>At the top of Storrington Avenue is the Western Approaches pub, where Rooney occasionally re-appears when visiting his mates from his new base in footballer-belt Cheshire.</p>
              <p>Here there is another message from a window. It reveals another side to Croxteth, the one that made it infamous nationally, particularly for a few weeks back in 2007.</p>
              <p>It reads: ‘In Rhys’ Name, Get Guns Off Our Streets.’ Rhys Jones was 11 when he was shot dead in the car park of the nearby Fir Tree pub in Croxteth.</p>
              <p>Also an Everton fanatic, Jones was on his way back from football training. He was buried in a blue coffin with an Everton crest on it. Sean Mercer was charged with the murder. Mercer went to the local De La Salle secondary school. As did Wayne Rooney. It is coincidence.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/06/04/article-1284117-09E52006000005DC-265_468x468.jpg" alt="Loss: The murder of Rhys Jones shook Croxteth's former inhabitant, who left flowers for the murdered youngster" width="468" height="468">

              <p><strong>Another came in the Liverpool Echo last month. The guns have not left Croxteth’s streets, far from it — there is a turf/drug/gang war ongoing.</strong></p>
              <p>The manager of Western Approaches FC, Nicky Ayres, was murdered on April 29. A man with the nickname Pancake — referred to as a ‘city gangster’ in The Echo — was bailed.</p>
              <p>After another recent Croxteth shooting it was reported: ‘Bullet casings were recovered from the pavement outside the bar . . . as parents took their small children to church at Our Lady Queen of Martyrs just 50 yards away.’</p>
              <p>The coincidence this time comes in Coleen’s book, Welcome To My World. In it she writes of Rooney, who had just borrowed a videotape of the film Grease from her: ‘That’s when we first kissed, around the back of the local church, the Queen of Martyrs.’</p>
              <p>This is a reflection of Croxteth, Liverpool and modern urban England. Should he choose, Rooney could discuss street violence with England team-mate Jermain Defoe, whose half-brother Gavin was murdered in east London last year, or with Rio Ferdinand, who grew up close to where Damilola Taylor was murdered.</p>
              <p>Others such as John Terry will have their own street tales to tell, while it was said of Bobby Moore that in 1960s East End London ‘from time to time he had to shake hands with people you’d want to avoid’.</p>
              <p>Fifty years on, the car, disappearing playing fields, the academy system and children’s changing lifestyles are cited as reasons why it is believed Rooney is the last of the street footballers. There may be other reasons.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/06/04/article-1284117-09E51FD9000005DC-187_468x286.jpg" alt="Blues brothers: (From left) John, age 7, Graeme, age 10, and Wayne, age 12, were all snapped up by the Everton academy" width="468" height="286"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Blues brothers: (From left) John, age 7, Graeme, age 10, and Wayne, age 12, were all snapped up by the Everton academy</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Wayne Mark Rooney was born in Fazakerley Hospital in October 1985, when Everton were the champions of England. Wayne Snr was an often unemployed labourer, mother Jeanette worked as a dinner lady in her son’s De La Salle school.</strong></p>
              <p>Son Wayne’s primary school, St Swithin’s, did not play organised football, so his first ‘proper’ match came as a seven-year-old, for the Western Approaches under 11 team. Rooney went on as a sub for his debut, and scored. It was the beginning of a Rooney pattern: younger and better than the rest.</p>
              <p>Wayne Snr, being a season-ticket holder at Goodison Park, must have held his breath when his first-born was soon offered a trial by Liverpool before Everton. Fortunately for both Waynes, Everton scout Bob Pendleton followed quickly.</p>
              <p>Rooney was then playing for a team called Copplehouse. He was shortly in Everton’s centre of excellence and Rooney’s name was quickly going into the notebooks of men across the country who know about these things.</p>
              <p>Paul McGuinness, now Manchester United’s academy manager, recalled his first sighting. ‘Our under nines played Everton’s boys and they absolutely hammered us,’ he said. ‘Rooney scored a few (six), but there was one that stood out. 'It was basically the classic overhead kick, the perfect bicycle kick, which for a kid of eight or nine years old was really something special.’</p>
              <p>That was the 1995-96 season, when Rooney scored 114 goals in 29 games for Everton’s under 10s and 11s. (Another junior record of Rooney’s was broken last week by an 11-year-old from his old school called Gerard Garner).</p>
              <p>A few months later, in November 1996, shortly after Rooney’s 11th birthday, he was Everton’s mascot for the derby game against Liverpool at Anfield. In the warm-up Rooney chipped the ball over an unimpressed Neville Southall.</p>
              <p>Gary Speed has good reason to cherish that game. He scored the Everton equaliser in front of the Kop. What Speed also remembered was thinking: ‘Mmm, the mascot’s not bad.’</p>
              <p>All at Goodison knew that an exceptional talent was on his way. So did others — Everton had to fight off interest from Wolves, Liverpool and Tottenham — but they knew that until Rooney was 17 they could not sign him as a professional.</p>
              <p>There was relief then when two months after his 16th birthday, in 2001, Rooney signed a pre-contract. The significance can be seen in the venue for this event: Goodison Park, in front of 38,000, the day Everton faced Derby in a Premier League match.</p>
              <p>Presumably one of Everton’s substitutes will have taken wistful notice: Paul Gascoigne. Everton won but there was to be only one more league victory in the next four months. Manager Walter Smith was replaced by Moyes.</p>
              <p>Under Moyes the 16-year-old prodigy began to travel with the first team. And on the opening August day of a momentous 2002-03 season, Rooney was named in the Everton first XI. He had been given the squad number of a released player — No 18, Gascoigne. There was no dream debut goal but Rooney was still delighted. He celebrated with a kickabout in Croxteth that night.</p>
              <p>Finding himself replacing or being replaced by Niclas Alexandersson, there was no Rooney goal until the League Cup in October. That night Everton went to Wrexham, who had Sir Alex Ferguson’s son, Darren, in their team. Rooney came on for Tomasz Radzinski and scored twice.</p>
              <p>It was the start of Rooney’s month of arrival. Five days before his 17th birthday, on October 19, with Arsenal the visitors, the score 1-1 and the Gunners about to extend their unbeaten league run to 31 games, Rooney replaced Radzinski.</p>

              <p><strong>There were 10 minutes left. Arsenal were the champions, accustomed to seeing games out. In the 90th minute Thomas Gravesen clumped the ball forward. As it fell, it did so on to the soft toes of a 16-year-old most of the nation had not heard of. In the next two seconds that changed.</strong></p>
              <p>Rooney brought the ball down 30 yards from goal, swivelled, looked up and drilled an arcing shot past the gaze of Arsenal’s centre halves, Sol Campbell and Pascal Cygan. Behind them, the ball soared over England goalkeeper David Seaman.</p>
              <p>Cygan, 36, and now with Cartagena in Spain, remembers: ‘Before the game, Arsene Wenger told us about how dangerous Rooney was.’</p>
              <p>Wenger, as they say, knew. Afterwards he said: ‘Losing our record is a big disappointment, but at least we lost to a special goal from a special talent. He is the biggest English talent I’ve seen since I took over at Highbury.’</p>
              <p>There was no BBC Match of the Day then — ITV had won the rights. So it was on their watch when commentator Clive Tyldesley uttered: ‘Remember the name — Wayne Rooney!’</p>
              <p>The 16-year-old had invaded the nation’s living rooms. He has been part of the furniture ever since. </p>

              <h2>Nemanja Vidic has signed a four-year contract extension with Manchester United. The announcement puts an end to the intense debate surrounding the Serbian for over 18 months, with his future seemingly destined to be away from Old Trafford.</h2>

              <p><strong>United chief executive David Gill sprung a surprise during the club's pre-season tour of North America when he confirmed that Vidic, who was not present, had agreed outline terms on a new contract.</strong></p>

              <div class="secondPar">
              <p>The finishing touches have now been made, leaving Ferguson glad to have Vidic around until 2014.</p>
              <p>"We are delighted Nemanja has committed his future to the club," he said. "This kills all the silly speculation over the past few months.</p>
              <p>"Nemanja has developed into one of the best centre-halves in Europe and we are pleased he will be here for many years to come."</p>
              <p>Vidic holds a notable place in United's history because his arrival from Spartak Moscow in a £7.2million deal was announced on Christmas Day 2005.</p>
              <p>Although he endured a difficult transition to the Premier League, Vidic eventually found his feet and has gone on to become one of the best defenders in the world.</p>
              <p>Famed for his strength and no-nonsense approach to keeping forwards at bay, the only opponent he has consistently had trouble against is Liverpool's Fernando Torres.</p>
              <p>Vidic was a central figure in each of United's three successive title wins and their Champions League triumph over Chelsea in 2008.</p>
              <p>"I am very happy to sign this contract," he said. "I came to this club when I was young and have developed enormously with the help of the manager, coaching staff and my team-mates.</p>
              <p>"During my time here we have had a lot of success and I look forward to continuing that success in the coming seasons."</p>

              <p><strong>The 20 year-old arrives at Old Trafford from Portuguese club Vitória de Guimarães, with </strong><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>United</strong></span><strong> having agreed to pay the buyout clause to release Bébé from his five-year contract.</strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p>The player – a relative unknown outside his native country – only arrived at Guimarães in July, and it is a mark of Sir Alex Ferguson’s enthusiasm that he was prepared to spend that sort of sum on a player who has spent most of his career playing in the Portuguese third division.</p>
              </div>
              <p>Bébé was recommended to Ferguson by his former assistant, the Portugal manager Carlos Queiroz.</p>
              <p>Bebe, 20, who spent part of his childhood on the streets before being raised in an orphanage. The 6ft 2in hitman. </p>
              <p>Bebe - real name Tiago Manuel Dias Correia - will rubberstamp his switch to Old Trafford after a medical.</p>
              <p>His arrival takes United’s spending since the end of last season to £25 million. Ferguson has already added former Fulham defender Chris Smalling and Javier Hernández to his squad.</p>
              <p>Ferguson is reported to have met the player for the first time only on Tuesday, when he was in Portugal to be a witness for Queiroz in a disciplinary case with the Portuguese Football Federation.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">ALEX FERGUSON has revealed he broke the habit of a lifetime to complete Bebe's fairytale move to Manchester United.</h2>
              <p>The 20-year-old became Ferguson's third signing of the summer when he joined in a £7million deal from Vitoria Guimaraes. But it was the fact Bebe spent time on the streets as a youngster and used to play for a team organised by CAIS — the organisation responsible for Portugal's Homeless World Cup Team — which made headlines. He then ended up joining the Red Devils after spending only five weeks with Vitoria after impressing United's Portugal-based scout.</p>
              <p>Bebe was virtually unknown 12 months ago as he turned out for Portugal third division team Estrela Amadora. But with Real Madrid and a number of top clubs in Portugal starting to take a keen interest, Ferguson decided to make a move, even though he had never seen the striker play, even on video.</p>
              <p>The United boss said: "On this occasion I didn't watch him. It is the first time I have done it. "Normally I see plenty of video footage but our scouting department is very good and sometimes you have to go on instinct.</p>
              <p>"Our scout in Portugal was adamant we must do something quickly. "You look at the material. You look at their age and whether they're bringing pace, balance, desire to play. "You've got to trust your staff at times, so I sent David Gill down there to do the deal." </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Bebe will likely have to wait until a Carling Cup third-round clash next month before getting an opportunity to make his debut. And for a player whose previous biggest game was a cup-tie against Benfica, following the path so successfully navigated by Cristiano Ronaldo is not going to be easy.</strong></p>
              <p>But with fellow countryman Nani already at Old Trafford and another Portuguese speaker on hand in Anderson, the settling in process should be made simpler.</p>
              <p>When asked what his greatest strengths were, Bebe revealed: "I am fast, I kick well and I score a lot of goals."</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Defender Smalling joined Fulham in June 2008 after breaking through with Maidstone United, but was snapped up by Manchester United in a shock move in January 2010 after agreeing terms.</strong></p>
              <p>He first appeared on the bench for a Premier League game with Fulham at Manchester United in February 2009 and went on to make his debut and further appearances in the Europa League the following season. Tall and agile, he made his bow in the Premier League against Everton and impressed against Chelsea when given his first start.</p>
              <p>The defender attracted the attention of the league's elite with his performances and after Arsenal and Manchester United both made bids, he opted to join United at the start of the 2010-11 season, staying with Fulham until then. he made his debut for his new side, coming on for Fabio in the 2010 Community Shield against Chelsea.</p>
              <p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Hailed as an future successor to Rio Ferdiand, Smalling shares many of his qualities - including calmness on the ball, accurate distribution and solid aerial ability.</p>
              <p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Inexperience at the highest level is the main thing going against him, and it is unclear yet how he will handle the pressure of playing for United. His positional sense has also been called in to question at times.</p>
              <p><strong>Career High:</strong> Signing for Manchester United in January 2010 having only made nine appearances as a professional football.</p>
              <p><strong>Career Low:</strong> Losing to Chelsea on his Premier League debut for Fulham � made worse by the fact that it was Smalling's own goal that was the difference between the two teams.</p>
              <p><strong>Style:</strong> Tall and rangy, Smalling is a physically imposing centre-back who is equally adept in the air and with the balll at his feet.</p>
              <p><strong>Quotes:</strong> "He is potentially a wonderful player. He has great pace is calm on the ball and good in the air. What more do you need from a good centre-half? He'll be a great asset to his new club, and he won't look out of place." <em>Fulham midfielder Danny Murphy praises Smalling after hearing about his move to United.</em></p>
              <p><strong>Trivia:</strong> Smalling studied travel and tourism, media studies and business studies at A-level, as well as economics at AS-level.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>New boy: Manchester United raised eyebrows by plucking Bebe from obscurity - but those who know him say Reds fans are in for a treat</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1308178" rel="1308178|3| nofollow" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1308178/Revealed-The-incredible-rise-lost-street-kid--Manchester-Uniteds-new-Bebe.html"></a></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Manchester United’s new £7.5million forward Bebe flew from England to Lisbon with his Old Trafford team-mate Nani on Sunday morning, following his first call-up to the Portugal Under 21 squad. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Nani continued his journey north to meet up with his country’s full squad near Porto. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Bebe, however, took a taxi to the remote southern village of Santo Antao do Tojal and spent the night at the homeless shelter that was his home until just two months ago. Bebe, a man of 20, wanted to sleep among his friends at the Casa do Gaiato for one last time before his life changed forever. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘He came and had lunch here with me and my wife and children,’ the shelter’s director, Jose Joao, told <span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail </span>this week. ‘He shook hands with every single person here. He thanked them. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘He spent the night here and the next morning someone from the Football Federation picked him up. I think he wanted to say goodbye properly. He lived here with us for eight years. He knows that without this place he would have been just another lost kid.’ </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Owned and funded by the Catholic church for 62 years, Casa do Gaiato sits in generous, if rudimentary, grounds some 20 kilometres outside Lisbon. It is currently home to 80 young males between the ages of four and 25. It is here that Bebe learned to read and write. Here, on a dusty pitch, that he learned to play football. Others from the shelter have made good, too. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘We’ve had teachers, lawyers and businessmen emerge from here,’ smiled Joao. ‘We even had an actor. But this is the first one like Bebe.’ Bebe’s journey from the third division of Portuguese football to the Barclays Premier League  is one of the more remarkable sporting stories of recent years. Just as inspiring is the fact that he reached adulthood at all.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Abandoned as a young child by his father Francisco and his mother Deolinda, Bebe — christened Tiago Manuel Dias Correia — was being raised by his grandmother in a rough Lisbon suburb when a court order delivered him into the care of the church at the age of 12. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Joao explained: ‘He was in danger. Kids in that area were locked into street life. Bebe was about to enter oblivion. He came here and had virtually no schooling. But we have looked after him and raised him and now football has made him a man. <br></span></p>

              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘At the end of last season when Guimaraes [of Portugal’s Premier League] signed him he told me he did not want to go, to leave the shelter. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘I told him he had to go, that he had to make something of his life. Bebe cried and said: ‘‘You are trying to get rid of me’’. But I told him it was time to go, that it was time for his life to begin for real. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘Even in the summer, when he was at a pre-season training camp with Guimaraes, he would come here to sleep if he had a day off. It was 200km away but he came anyway.’ </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Given his background and his obvious dependency on his friends and mentors at the shelter, it is tempting to wonder just how Bebe will cope in Manchester. There will be no comforting trips ‘home’. His private bedroom — at one end of a 15-bed dormitory — was given to him a year ago as a sign of his seniority. Now, it belongs to somebody else.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘There are concerns but we feel he is going to the right club,’ said Joao. ‘In Manchester he will be OK. We think his grandmother may travel there to be with him. We hope so. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘We have heard about Sir Alex Ferguson. He is a leader and that is what Bebe needs. He is tall and strong now but he is just a kid. He needs to be loved.’ </span></p>

              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Bebe’s grandmother, Ilda Romana, has attempted to provide some stability over the course of his difficult young life. He has ‘senhorinha’ — little lady — tattooed on his arm. His mother lives in northern Portugal and has never been to see him play. His father has disappeared. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Recommended to the amateur club Loures, local to the shelter, four years ago, Bebe played there for two years before a 16,000 euros move to Estrela da Amadora in downtown Lisbon. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">After two seasons in the club’s junior teams, his form in Portugal’s semi-professional division three last season led him to Guimaraes and then — without playing a competitive game for them — to United. In England — on a wage of £12,000 a week — life will certainly be different. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Here in the hot, dusty Portuguese countryside, a daily routine of prayer, schoolwork and discipline has shaped him. He came here as an uneducated 12-year-old with poor prospects. He leaves with the chance to be the next  Manchester United superstar.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The car park of the Estadio Jose Gomes in the poor Reboleira suburb of Lisbon is littered with used condoms and drugs paraphernalia.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Inside the tiny, rundown ground, weeds poke through the tarmac. This is where, just four months ago, the young forward they call Bebe played his last competitive game of football for Estrela da Amadora. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">He walked out five games before the end of last season because the club — now about to go bankrupt — could not afford to pay his 300-euro weekly wage. Jorge Paxaio was Estrela’s coach last season. He learned of Bebe’s transfer to England early last month when the forward sent him a ‘thank you’ text message.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘Manchester United are getting a truly remarkable kid,’ said the likeable Paxaio, smiling as he spoke to <span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail</span>. ‘Remember that until he was 16 he was just playing with his friends. He has developed incredibly quickly. The first time he plays for United — and I am sure he will make it there — people will notice him because he is different. He has skills that not many players in that League have. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘He is also physically imposing. He will be like [Cristiano] Ronaldo in that point of view. But you will have to wait for him to be ready. I don’t just mean in football terms, but mentally. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘One day he had nothing and then the next day he had everything. That will be a shock to him, even if he hasn’t realised it yet. He was living in the shelter every day he was with us. He travelled in by public transport. He was like a child in that way.’ </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br></span></p>

              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Estrela were second in their division when Bebe stopped playing there. Without their tall, muscular forward, they lost their last five games and finished 10th. For much of the season, Bebe had been the only player getting paid. Eventually his wage was stopped, too. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Bebe’s agent of last season, Goncalo Reis, recalled: ‘His coach was always telling him that he had to do better as he was the only one that was being paid. ‘At 19, that was not fair. In the dressing-room he was the only one with the new shoes and the new shirt.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘His team-mates had children and wives and weren’t getting paid. It was hard for the kid but this pressure made him stronger. He coped with it. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘I think that will help him when he reaches Old Trafford. He will not be scared.’</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Certainly, life at Estrela was never straightforward for Bebe. United manager Ferguson suggested last week that his  new signing needs to develop physically, but there was little opportunity for that last season.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Coach Paxaio, now with another Lisbon club, Mafra, revealed: ‘We used to have a gym and Bebe was in there often. But then one day the players turned up and all the equipment had gone. The club had sold it to pay off debts.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘It will be a different world at United. I only had four staff, no dieticians or anything like that. Bebe used to eat his meals at the shelter so I couldn’t control what he was eating. He got food poisoning twice. But he was our diamond, our jewel. Our problem was that we didn’t have anyone else like him in the team.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘That was the way it was. I played two systems and both were used to get the best out of him.’</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">As Bebe strides towards a new life, Estrela’s would appear to be coming to an end. Their failure to pay him towards the end of last season rendered a 1.2million euro buy-out clause in his contract worthless and he went to Guimaraes for free. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘It makes me sad,’ added Paxaio. ‘These things can only happen in Portugal. With that money Estrela would not be bankrupt. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘A good club is about to die. It is wrong. But I am happy for Bebe, even if he can be a rebel sometimes.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘I spoke to him many times. I told him that he had every chance of rising to the top but that he also had the risk of allowing himself to be dragged down. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘He could be irresponsible and things like that, but it was just due to his background. I told him it was as easy to become a professional footballer as it was to go on the streets to steal. I told him the choice was his. He made the right choice.’</span> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Urbane Goncalo Reis is the small-time football agent who has just seen the deal of a lifetime slip through his fingers. Sitting in the garden of the Lisbon Marriott Hotel this week, he stirred the ice in his Pepsi and lots of things went unsaid.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">What is known, though, is this. Until the end of Bebe’s time at Estrela da Amadora earlier this year, Reis represented him.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Having recognised his talent when he was a junior player, Reis used to buy Bebe his bus-passes to get him from the Casa do Gaiato shelter to training every day. Because it was a journey of two hours by bus, Reis would  sometimes take him in his car. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">He organised and paid for Bebe’s 18th birthday party and when he was selected for a Portugal Under 20 get-together Reis bought him new boots, clothes and luggage. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘I didn’t want him to look out of place and feel small,’ said Reis. Now Bebe is at Manchester United under the care and guidance of Portuguese super-agent Jorge Mendes. Reis is no longer involved.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">How Bebe came to change agents is not clear. Reis is vague on the matter and Mendes is not accused of breaking any rules. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Reis certainly knows Bebe better than most. He has, for example, always been welcomed by staff at Casa do Gaiato.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘The trip to training every day was not easy,’ he recalled. ‘It showed his dedication. ‘After training he would go to the shelter and help with the cleaning and things. They all pray at the end of the day. It’s an obligation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘I don’t feel let down that I am not involved any more. That’s life. But I used to do a lot for him. All he has, I gave him.’</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Reis has read reports from England that Bebe has not yet been selected for United’s reserves. The implied criticism irritates him.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘It’s crazy that people say he is not good enough for the reserves,’ he said. ‘I know the qualities of Bebe and one day he will jump into the first team. It won’t be easy but he will get his space. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘He will not be as good as Ronaldo but will be better than Nani. Somewhere in between. But he will be humble and he will learn. He will be like a little boy with Ferguson. He will just wait for the orders. Then, one day, he will explode on the field.’ </span></p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">If and when Bebe does make his impact, Reis’s only benefit will be an adrenaline shot to his pride. Is he angry?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘I am moving on,’ he said. ‘I have some new boys. Hopefully I will find another Bebe.’</span></p>
              <div class="pageBreak"> </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Back at Casa do Gaiato, a skinny teenager kicks at the dust in his sandals and shorts. He loiters in the searing afternoon sun. His name is Adilson.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Once rated as a better young football prospect than Bebe, he also joined the junior ranks of the Estrela da Amadora club in Lisbon. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">For Adilson, though, the dream died. He never made it because he simply stopped growing. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">In the shelter he is safe and he is loved. Beyond that, though, his future is uncertain.</span></p>

              <div class="firstPar">
              <p><strong>Ooh aah, Dimitar. Echoes of Eric Cantona imbued Dimitar Berbatov’s majestic display here and it was not simply the touches of magic conjuring up a glorious overhead strike as the centrepiece of a fine hat-trick. What should particularly thrill </strong><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span></a><strong> fans is that the Bulgarian clearly now feels he belongs in the famous red shirt. He will be turning his collar up next.</strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p>As with Cantona, there are some instants when all the heat and dust of this mad sport, all the controversy and speculation, are stripped away and a moment of pure sporting genius shines through. Some great goals have spiced this season, from Gareth Bale’s volley to Hatem Ben Arfa’s drive, but what happened a shade before the hour mark here was truly exceptional.</p>
              <p>United were leading through Berbatov’s header, the forward having effortlessly eluded Fernando Torres to connect with Ryan Giggs’s corner. They were in control, exploiting the initial lack of ambition in the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool/"><span style="color: #000000;">Liverpool</span></a> ranks. Nani had taken a welcome break from play-acting, the one stain on his otherwise excellent game, and was troubling Paul Konchesky, soon lifting in a cross.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Berbatov’s response, standing with his back to Pepe Reina’s goal, was sublime. Cushioning the ball on his right thigh, he flicked it up and then hooked it over his head and in off the crossbar. A split-second silence seemed to seize the Stretford End as fans shook the disbelief from their eyes, before an almighty roar erupted.</strong></p>
              <p>“Lots of questions were asked about him last season and he was made something of a whipping boy, to the point where he must have wondered whether he had a future at Old Trafford,’’ Sir Alex Ferguson had mused about Berbatov in his programme notes.</p>
              <p>United’s manager added that the club could have avoided “the aggravation’’ if critics had simply asked whether Berbatov possessed the technical ability and strength of personality to be a United player. The technique has never been in doubt, simply the self-belief. Both qualities now etch his every move.</p>
              <p>As United’s No 9 has waxed this season, Liverpool’s has waned. Well-marshalled by Nemanja Vidic in a scrappy first half, Fernando Torres only showed signs of life when Roy Hodgson rejigged his team after Berbatov’s gem.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u189/zomanu/Flet-1.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>David Ngog came on for the anonymous Maxi Rodríguez, Raul Meireles dropped back from his role in the hole and finally Torres enjoyed more sustained support. Ngog’s mere presence distracted Vidic and company.</strong></p>
              <p>Old Trafford hit fever pitch. Wayne Rooney’s nocturnal escapades drew caustic comment from the visiting Kopite choirs. The Stretford End responded with a reminder of Liverpool’s diary engagements for Thursday evenings. The atmosphere had already been stoked pre-match by the DJ mischievously spinning a succession of hits from 1990, the last time Liverpool won the title.</p>
              <p>This “daddy of all derbies’’, as Ferguson called it, certainly lacked nothing in edge, although little venom discoloured the tackling.</p>
              <p>Trailing 2-0, Liverpool were certainly not diminished in spirit. Torres began making those old runs into the box, particularly attacking areas not protected by the outstanding Vidic.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u189/zomanu/article-1313378-0B41F943000005DC-732_634x291.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Within four minutes of Berbatov’s beauty, Joe Cole slid the ball towards Torres, who was brought down by Jonny Evans. For all Ferguson’s frequent declarations of admiration for his young centre-half, Evans can get caught out. Ask Bobby Zamora and Tim Cahill. Rio Ferdinand, stricken with flu, was undoubtedly missed.</strong></p>
              <p>Steven Gerrard placed the ball on the spot and stepped back, waiting calmly while Howard Webb delivered a lecture to everyone else about encroachment, the referee resembling an experienced doorman dealing with an impatient queue of bargain-hunters outside a department store sale. When Webb was ready, Gerrard ran in and stroked the penalty unerringly past Edwin van der Sar.</p>
              <p>With Fabio Capello watching, Liverpool’s captain provided another example of his composure under pressure and his dead-ball prowess, equalising within six minutes. When Meireles swept a low ball through the middle, Torres was off and running until brought down by John O’Shea on the edge of the area. Liverpool fans bayed for red and a few Liverpool players whispered such thoughts in Webb’s earshot. The world’s leading referee deemed yellow to be sufficient.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u189/zomanu/article-1313378-0B41FA6E000005DC-318_634x350.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u189/zomanu/10b_1B_666x450_1128589a.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Liverpool’s response should have been stamped “Made in Melwood’’.When Meireles deliberately bumped into Darren Fletcher on the end of United’s wall, the Scot overcompensated, shifting the other way and leaving a gap between him and O’Shea. Gerrard promptly swept the ball through the hole and in.</strong></p>
              <p>United had let another lead go, repeating events at Craven Cottage and Goodison Park, but this time they fought back, Berbatov rising to the rescue to head in O’Shea’s cross. It brought United’s first hat-trick against Liverpool in 64 years as well as a deserved victory.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson accused Liverpool striker Fernando Torres of cheating as Manchester United beat their greatest rivals 3-2 at Old Trafford yesterday.</strong></p>
              <p>A superb Dimitar Berbatov hat-trick — the first by a United player against Liverpool for 64 years — ensured Ferguson’s team stayed in touch with Chelsea at the top of the table.</p>
              <p>But Torres found himself charged by Fergie of trying to get United defender John O’Shea sent off in the incident that led to Steven Gerrard converting a free-kick to make the score 2-2 in the second half. </p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">Despite the fact O’Shea could easily have been sent off after hauling down Torres, Ferguson said: ‘I have watched it again. Fernando Torres made a meal of it.</p>
              </div>
              <p>'An absolute meal of it. There is no doubt he tried to get the player sent off.’</p>
              <p>Roy Hodgson, the Liverpool manager — whose side have won just once in their first five league games — refused to be drawn on the matter, suggesting he hadn’t had a clear view of the incident.</p>
              <p>He said: ‘Some of my coaches were jumping up and down but I didn’t have a great view. Sir Alex was closer to it.</p>
              <p>'I thought the referee had a good game. Sir Alex is entitled to his opinion but I prefer to talk about things that interest me. I am not a fan of game saying.’ </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/09/19/article-0-0B4226FA000005DC-902_468x371.jpg" alt="Pointing the finger: Sir Alex Ferguson thinks Torres tried to get O'Shea sent off" width="468" height="371">

              </div>
              <p><strong>But Ferguson took another swipe at Liverpool, suggesting his team should have won by more goals.</strong></p>
              <p>Having led 2- 0, United were pegged back by two Gerrard strikes and looked like surrendering a winning margin for the third time this season before Berbatov headed home his third in the 84th minute. </p>
              <p>The United boss said: ‘It was a game we absolutely dominated and I was saying to myself: “It could’ve been 10”.</p>
              <p>'So when it looked like ending 2-2, it would have been a travesty of a scoreline, but it was a great result at the end.</p>
              <p>‘They had the momentum when it went to 2-2, but they never offered anything did they?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img src="http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u189/zomanu/08_19_350x475_1128578a.jpg" alt=""></div>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>‘This was always going to be a test. The build-up to these games is such that, if one doesn’t win, it’s a catastrophe. For Liverpool, this is a catastrophe.’</strong></p>
              <p>Hodgson disagreed with Ferguson’s assessment.</p>
              <p>He said: ‘I think that’s harsh. I thought United played well but to try and undermine our performance is harsh. Our performance was a lot better than our last two performances and I think we can take credit for the way we played in the second half.</p>

              <p><strong>'Catastrophe? I am not sure about that. I have said all along that our aim is to get in the top four. That is our aim.’</strong></p>
              <p>Berbatov said: ‘It was a magical day. It was special for me to score a hat-trick against our greatest rivals. But when I go home, to my kids, I am not that special.’</p>

              <p><strong>No easy games in the </strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Premier League</strong></span><strong>? Step this way, inspector. </strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span><strong> went top of the table for the first time this season courtesy of what can only be described as an early Christmas present from Blackburn. By the time the margin of victory became embarrassing in the second half, the visitors were clearly wishing they were somewhere else, though it was the way they started the game that was most surprising.</strong></p>
              <p>Sam Allardyce's teams usually display a degree of defensive organisation, but in going behind after a mere 72 seconds then wimping out of the contest completely when a wretched backpass gave United a third goal with less than 30 minutes played, Blackburn put up about as much resistance as a doormat.</p>
              <p>Barely pausing to wipe their feet, United duly filled their boots, with Dimitar Berbatov claiming his second hat-trick of the season before going on to finish with five. It was the Bulgarian who struck first, poking Nani's clever cross past a static Paul Robinson as the Rovers marking went astray on United's opening attack. Park Ji-sung was next, finishing confidently by a wonderfully precise return pass from Wayne Rooney, before Berbatov took advantage of another pass for his second.</p>
              <p>Sadly for Blackburn the provider was Pascal Chimbonda, committing every cardinal sin in the defenders' handbook under not terribly great pressure from Rooney, and already it was clear that anyone hoping for the sort of Lancashire derby to warm the cockles on a cold day might have been better heading for Bolton.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/11/28/article-1333973-0C45ECFA000005DC-212_468x354.jpg" alt="berbatovs goal" width="468" height="354"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The second half opened with a third goal for Berbatov, who started the move, and finished it, with clever feet from Nani in between. Arguably United's best player, with Rooney working unselfishly but not seeing all he attempted come off, Nani scored the fifth after producing more footwork to leave Chimbonda looking foolish, before Berbatov scored two more from close range.</strong></p>
              <p>The striker could have had six but for Robinson making a decent save near the end, and as Berbatov was also denied a penalty in first-half stoppage time, and Nani hit a post with a free-kick intended for Nemanja Vidic to nod in, Blackburn must have been relieved to escape without the score reaching double figures. It was that one-sided. The Rovers fans chanting "Big Sam, sort it out" midway though the game were either attempting humour or trying to keep warm.</p>
              <p>Allardyce listed half-a-dozen players absent through injury, but was not seeking excuses. "Let's face it, we weren't able to cope," the Rovers manager said. "We were completely outplayed, and while I have always been an admirer of Berbatov's quality, our defending was poor. There are occasions when you can come here and block it up, but you need commitment to do that and we didn't show the desire."</p>
              <p>Berbatov, who scored his first league goals since his last hat-trick, against Liverpool on 19 September, said it was one of those days when moves practised on the training ground came off on the pitch. "Today we were excellent in supporting each other," he said. Very true. Particularly the reference to training pitch exercises, which is what this game frequently resembled.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/11/28/article-1333973-0C431EB0000005DC-293_306x423.jpg" alt="Berbatov " width="306" height="423"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption">Goal crazy: Berbatov celebrates the first of five</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>United played well, putting together some intricate passing moves, but mainly because Blackburn allowed them to. Even when they won the ball the visitors gave it away again quickly and cheaply. It was hard to say United made a statement to make Chelsea sit up and take notice; they simply took advantage of a poor side and they will not be able to play Blackburn every week. "I don't think it will affect Chelsea at all," Sir Alex Ferguson said. "The important thing is that it was a top performance by us, we are getting some rhythm back into our game."</strong></p>
              <p>Becoming only the fourth player to score five in a Premier League match – Andy Cole, Alan Shearer and Jermain Defoe, since you ask – will do wonders for Berbatov's confidence and not much harm to his contract negotiations, though again, while the finishing was impeccable and the poacher's instinct in working order, a striker of his ability could hardly miss with the opportunities and space he was given.</p>
              <p>In that respect it was possibly a slight worry for United that Rooney has still not managed a goal from open play for his club all season. He linked up superbly and made chances for others throughout, yet the old Rooney would have run riot in a turkey-shoot such as this, if Blackburn's new owners will forgive the expression. Chris Samba pulled a goal back for Rovers near the end, from a cross by young substitute Josh Morris, but Blackburn will be glad this performance came after their recent takeover had already gone through. It was fowl.</p>

              <p class="storycopy" style="font-weight: bold;">WAYNE ROONEY vented his frustration at his FA ban in the most eloquent way he knows, by letting his feet do the talking.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Sir Alex Ferguson said Rooney would be pumped up by missing Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final for his swearing rant – and he wasn’t wrong.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Rooney’s mature display combined with Ryan Giggs’ ageless skills sent Manchester United into the Champions League semi-finals for the fourth time in five seasons, where they are likely to meet German club Schalke, who are 5-2 up against Inter Milan.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Rooney and Giggs were behind both United goals – the first just before half-time by Javier Hernandez, the second after 77 minutes by Ji-Sung Park to leave Chelsea wondering if they will ever win Europe’s elite club competition – and manager Carlo Ancelotti unsure if he will still have a job next season.</p>
              </div>
              <p class="storycopy">Park’s goal came less than a minute after substitute Didier Drogba had given Chelsea hope with an equaliser – despite having been reduced to 10 men after 70 minutes when Ramires was sent off for a second booking.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">The big surprise from Chelsea was Drogba’s omission as Ancelotti kept faith with Fernando Torres, partnering him with Nicolas Anelka and Florent Malouda.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">It was Ferguson’s 100th European home game at Old Trafford. And the fans responded to his call to arms by whipping up a cracking atmosphere.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Yet Chelsea have beaten United on their own ground more than any other club in the Premier League years and were the last team to win in M16 a year ago. Since then United have gone 27 games unbeaten in all competitions.</p>
              <p>One player nearly always certain of his place for the big occasions is Park, who seems to come into his own the better the opposition.</p>
              <div class="padding7north">
              <p class="storycopy">He underlined that by sparking United’s first attack, robbing Ashley Cole of the ball to send Rooney away. But he overhit his cross as Hernandez was knocked over by Michael Essien in the penalty area. Ancelotti said that his team would play with patience but they started with plenty of urgency and enterprise and were the better side in the opening 25 minutes.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Ramires, who should have been awarded a late penalty when felled by Patrice Evra in the first leg, was first to threaten for Chelsea. He burst into the penalty area but tumbled under the joint challenge of Rio Ferdinand and Vidic, Edwin van der Sar saving at his feet.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Ferdinand was left limping after injuring his right knee in the tackle, prompting Chris Smalling to start warming up.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Chelsea took advantage of United’s unease by creating three chances in quick succession. Torres glanced Anelka’s cross just wide, Anelka sliced his shot from Torres’ lay off and Lampard directed a weak shot straight at Van der Sar after a surging run from Malouda.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">The game panned out as expected – Chelsea enjoying plenty of the ball with United content to hit them on the break. Rooney showed his confidence when he fired a volley at Petr Cech from 35 yards after Hernandez had headed down Vidic’s long ball, but it was a rare United threat.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">O’Shea was booked for a late challenge on Malouda but Lampard floated the free-kick on to the top of the net. Anelka went much closer with a snapshot after O’Shea had headed out Torres’ mis-hit shot as Chelsea continued their assured start. But they lived on their nerves after 26 minutes when Hernandez headed home Rooney’s superb cross only to be flagged offside. Replays showed it was a correct if marginal decision.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Van der Sar raced out of his goal to make a tackle on Anelka after half an hour as Chelsea continued to press and probe. At the other end Ivanoivc was booked for bringing down Nani. Malouda, for a trip on Park, and Terry, for a foul on Hernandez, were also booked.</p>

              <p class="storycopy"> </p>
              <p class="storycopy">But Hernandez put United ahead two minutes before the break after a superb United move. Rooney sprayed the ball out to Giggs who played a one-two with O’Shea before his low cross was turned in by Hernandez. The goal was a tribute to Giggs. No wonder Ferguson preferred him to Anderson, Paul Scholes and Darron Gibson.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">But while it was confirmation of United’s ability to open up any defence, the timing of the goal was a hammer blow for Chelsea.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Ancelotti showed what he thought of Torres’ insipid first-half contribution by replacing him at half-time, sending on the more physically robust Drogba.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">But it didn’t make much difference with United looking increasingly comfortable, no doubt fired by the memories of last season’s quarter-final exit to Bayern Munich.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Thanks to their two-goal advantage, United were able to play the ball about with some confidence and Cech was forced into a scrambling save to prevent Nani adding a third. Giggs also went close with a header after a superb run and cross form Rooney.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Chelsea’s task was made even more difficult after 70 minutes when Ramires was sent off for a second caution – both for fouls on the troublesome Nani.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Yet Drogba equalised in emphatic fashion, bringing the ball down, turning his man and drilling it through Van der Sar’s legs.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">A minute later, though, Park beat the Chelsea offside trap and fired home despite Ivanovic’s despairing lunge.</p>

              <p><strong>So, if <span style="color: #000000;">Manchester United</span><span style="color: #000000;"> are going to win another treble, or at least get close to their towering achievement of 1999 by going the full distance in each of the three big challenges that remain, who is going to be this year's footballer of the year?</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Not the PFA Player of the Year, </span><span style="color: #000000;">the one where voting has already taken place and the winner is due to be announced this weekend</span><span style="color: #000000;">.</span> Though arguably more authentic than the football writers' version, because players themselves make the choices, the PFA award is always slightly compromised by the necessity for a shortlist that is usually drawn up much too early in the season. The Football Writers' Association (FWA) award is usually seen as having more gravitas, because it is a completely free vote and it comes much closer to the end of the season, and even players initially blase about the honour tend to be overwhelmed when they see the photographs of their illustrious predecessors dating right back to 1948 (Stanley Matthews) lining the walls of the Royal Lancaster hotel's cavernous banqueting room.</p>
              <p>The last time United won a treble, the FWA award went to David Ginola of Tottenham, a fact that Sir Alex Ferguson now mentions only about four times a week. He still laughs out loud at the memory while simultaneously shaking his head at confirmation that journalists know nothing whatsoever about football, but for the first couple of years after the event the United manager used to regale passersby with the same incredible story about four times a day.</p>
              <p>The reason Ginola won the award that year is quite simple. The United vote was hopelessly split, with up to half a dozen players sharing it between them, so the core of London votes the Spurs player picked up for having a decent season was enough to push him past the post first. It was an obvious embarrassment, and probably no accident that Roy Keane won the award the following season then Teddy Sheringham the next, but then, as now, United had several leading candidates and because the treble was won with almost literally the last kick of the season all the votes had been cast. Ginola picked up his award in London (he was also the PFA's choice that season, to be fair) a couple of weeks before United added first the FA Cup and then the European Cup to their domestic league title.</p>
              <p>There is nothing in the rules that says the player of the year must come from the most successful team; it is supposed to be an individual award after all. There would be few complaints if <span style="color: #000000;">Gareth Bale</span><span style="color: #000000;">,</span> for instance, picked up one or both honours this season, even though Spurs may well finish empty-handed and the winger's recent performances have been compromised by injury. Yet a treble is such a startling achievement it almost overshadows all others. If a team have really been that dominant it seems perverse to go looking anywhere else for the best player, or certainly it does when looking back on events from a few years down the line.</p>
              <p>The trouble with trebles though, as we are seeing again this season, is that dominance has a habit of announcing itself late. It is only a few weeks since even Ferguson was laughing off the possibility of repeating 1999, saying he would be happy with just one of the major awards. United have not looked all that formidable for much of the season. They look strong right now, with Chelsea out of the way and either Barcelona or Real Madrid their likeliest stumbling block, yet for most of the season people have been complaining that they are an ordinary side that are at the top of the Premier League virtually by default.</p>
              <p>To repeat the question in the first paragraph then, should United be able to prove otherwise in the next few weeks, which of their players has had the most remarkable season? Nemanja Vidic has been a solid presence as captain, and is on the PFA list, though defenders traditionally struggle to get noticed when it comes to awards. Patrice Evra has been just as good, and even Edwin van der Sar has his backers, which just goes to show that even in the unglamorous area of defence United can produce a number of outstanding performers.</p>
              <p>Up front where the headlines are made <span style="color: #000000;">Dimitar Berbatov is the league's leading scorer</span> but cannot get in the side for important matches. Nani has had probably his best ever season but is not the most effective player at Old Trafford, never mind the rest of the country. Wayne Rooney is now rediscovering his best form but produced little before Christmas to suggest he should keep the award he won last year. Rooney thoroughly deserved it last year; this season he has not been quite as impressive. Ryan Giggs, on the other hand, has probably produced more sublime match-winning moments this season than when he won the PFA award two years ago. In 2009 it appeared he was honoured for being such a nice guy and looking after himself so well, whereas now he has a real chance of being the only player ever to win two trebles separated by 12 years and play a vital role in each.</p>
              <p>Yet the more you look at United's season the more the contribution of a player in his first year in England stands out. Javier Hernández started out making brief contributions as a substitute, finishing reliably and winning the confidence of his manager and his team-mates. He now has 18 goals from 20 starts, has relegated £30m Berbatov to the bench and is credited with helping bring the best out of Rooney. The fact that he cost only £6m is neither here nor there – Giggs cost nothing and the less said about Ferguson's £7m investment in Bébé the better – though there is something irresistible about the young Mexican scoring for fun when a player such as £50m Fernando Torres looks as if he may never manage another goal in his life.</p>
              <p>Hernández scored both the goals against Marseille that put United into the quarter-final against Chelsea, and he would have had two more against Carlo Ancelotti's side at Old Trafford but for a highly questionable offside decision denying him his first. Television replays showed Hernández was about level both times – he was certainly more level for the first than Berbatov was for the opener against Fulham on Saturday – and one camera view of the disallowed goal suggested his feet had been onside while his head (he was leaning forward, looking round his defender) was in an offside position. Complete nonsense, of course. Anyone in such a position ought to be given the benefit of the doubt and declared level. Linesmen cannot be expected to reach the sort of fine judgements that television pictures make possible, though the spirit of the law should be that if a player is not clearly offside then he is onside.</p>
              <p>Anyway, the Little Pea, I would suggest, is now as strong a candidate for player of the year as the big bloke from Serbia. It probably comes down to a choice between the value put on reliable defending and sparkling finishing, though in terms of having a terrific, eye-catching season, Hernández could easily give Bale a run for his money. Individual awards do not matter that much, in the general scheme of things, though at least if history repeats itself and United once again win all the prizes and see the player of the year award go to Tottenham, Ferguson could add a punchline to his favourite joke by bidding for Bale's services. He was never going to buy Ginola.</p>
