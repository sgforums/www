              <h1>Why <span style="color: #ff0000;">18</span> really is a magic number for <span style="color: #ff0000;">Manchester United</span><br></h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i127.photobucket.com/albums/p143/zococl/Ferg.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><em>He's done it again: Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson celebrating yet another league title.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i127.photobucket.com/albums/p143/zococl/18x.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson said that the achievement of Manchester United equalling Liverpool's 18 league titles was 'a fan thing'. He's not wrong there.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">He may of course have been underplaying his own personal joy, having openly admitted that his biggest achievement as United boss was to knock Liverpool off their perch.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Either way there must have been more than just a hangover to deal with for thousands of United's supporters on Sunday morning, after their team had clinched yet another Premier League title.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">
              </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">There must surely have also been some sense of disbelief, perhaps a little confusion.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">I recall being at Upton Park to see United lose 1-0 on a sad night for the club in April 1992.</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">You may remember that Sir Alex complained that already relegated West Ham's effort had been 'obscene' (in my books rightly - you had to be there to believe it).</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">United were throwing away the chance to win their first title since 1967, and there were a few of us that wondered whether we would ever see a league success for the club.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Certainly if somebody had said on that night that 17 years later United would be equalling Liverpool 's total of titles you would be sending for the men in white coats.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              </span><p></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><img src="http://i127.photobucket.com/albums/p143/zococl/article-1183830-009.jpg" alt=""></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><em>Mark Hughes shows his frustration on a desperately disappointing night for United at Upton Park in 1992 (look at the anger on the faces of the punters)</em></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">
              </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Indeed a friend said recently that if anyone was to see United draw level, you would have presumed it would be our grandchildren, not us thirty somethings.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">For years and years, Liverpool supporters would shove '18' down the throats of their bitter rivals. I reckon they've stopped talking about it since United's 15th title win in 2003, because by then they probably realised Sir Alex had created some kind of extraordinary juggernaut.</span></p>
              <p></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">
              </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Of course we all sometimes get caught up in the 'here and now' whatever our age, and lose sight of the wider historical picture.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">For example Liverpool and United had both won seven titles each before Liverpool's league title in 1973 that helped trigger a glorious era for that club.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Those of us that saw those great teams from Merseyside dominate English football, with their succession of league titles (not to mention their nights of triumph on the continent), never imagined we'd see another English team come to symbolise a whole era again in our lifetimes.</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">
              <p>The two amazing things are that we saw it happen so quickly with United, and that under Sir Alex the Manchester club threaten to surpass that Liverpool era in terms of longevity.</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Certainly the most dispiriting element of Saturday's events for rival fans must have been Sir Alex's </span>unequivocal<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> assertion that he 'wasn't contemplating' retirement.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">He's the old Father Time of the game: the characters and players change at the top level of the game, but there remains Fergie, still looking down on the others.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">It's hard to believe that he was managing and winning pots at a time when Bob Paisley and Brian Clough were in their pomp, and he's still doing it now with the Mourinhos and Benitez's of this world.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              </span><p></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><img src="http://i127.photobucket.com/albums/p143/zococl/article-0-003.jpg" alt=""></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><em>Steve Bruce and Bryan Robson celebrate winning United's first league for 26 years on an emotional Old Trafford night in 1993</em></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><img src="http://i127.photobucket.com/albums/p143/zococl/article-0.jpg" alt=""></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><em>United stars celebrate the league win that formed the first part of an amazing treble in 1999.</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><em></em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">
              </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Just look at the number of league titles won. Liverpool 18. Manchester United 18.<br>Arsenal 13 - a dignified return for the north London club. Everton 9 - fair play. Aston Villa 7 - you can chuck a European Cup in there too.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">The rest? Tottenham 2. Manchester City 2. Chelsea 3 (and only 1 before Mr Abramovich came into town). Sorry, but these are ridiculous numbers.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Liverpool and United are now remarkably close in terms of honours: domestically (league titles, FA Cups and League Cups) the score is 32-32.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">For now the dominance of United goes on - it's strange because with the cameo played by Chelsea a few years back and the undefeated Arsenal team it hasn't always seemed that United have had this decade all to themselves, as it seemed in the 1990s. Despite that, United have ended up with more titles, six against five.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> sometimes wonder how the players and staff retain that hunger year after year (it took me until November to engage properly in this season and I'm doing nothing more strenuous than finding a seat in the ground or a place by the telly in the local).</span></span>
              </p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><em></em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><img src="http://i127.photobucket.com/albums/p143/zococl/18.png" alt=""></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>
              </p><p> </p>
              <p></p>
              <p></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">But you just know they will - Sir Alex and Ryan Giggs [can you really get your head round one player winning 11 league titles?] said during the celebrations on Saturday that they would be thinking about the match against Barcelona 24 hours later, and before too long the next season, the next chase for silver.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Have no doubt, the club are making history now. The only club to have won a hat-trick of titles twice, ten years after becoming the first and still only to have won the Treble.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">And of course those 18 titles - which probably means more than anything else right now to United supporters.<br></span></p>

              <p><strong>Cristiano Ronaldo tucking into a burger — now that’s what you call fast food.</strong></p>
              <p>It was all fun and games in the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Manchester United</span></span></a> dressing room after they wrapped  up the Premier League title yesterday and a relaxed Ronaldo was leading the banter.</p>
              <p>After polishing off his hamburger, Ronaldo took on the role of TV interviewer, complete with Sky microphone. Anderson was his first ‘victim’ with Ronaldo translating their Portuguese chat— as the Brazilian resisted pleas to speak in English.</p>
              <p>It was light-hearted stuff but the slapstick ends next week as United defend their Champions League title against Barcelona.</p>

              <h2 style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">MICHAEL OWEN has agreed terms to join Manchester United. </h2>
              <p>The out-of-contract striker will take a 50 per cent pay cut for a shock last chance to rescue his injury-plagued career. </p>
              <p>United boss Alex Ferguson contacted Owen, 29, on Tuesday and offered him £50,000 a week to join the champions - plus huge bonuses depending on appearances and goals. </p>
              <p>But Owen must pass a stringent medical, which could take place as early as today, before United put pen to paper. </p>
              <p>A source close to Owen confirmed: "It's incredible that one day Michael was contemplating a move to Hull and now Manchester United have come in. </p>
              <p>"This is just the boost he needed and now he is hoping that everything can be agreed." </p>
              <p>Fergie's shock move comes after United missed out on Lyon striker Karim Benzema, sold Cristiano Ronaldo for £80million and lost Carlos Tevez. </p>
              <p>Owen, axed by England boss Fabio Capello, started his career at United's hated rivals Liverpool. </p>
              <p>He became a free agent two days ago after his contract ran out at Newcastle. But not in his wildest dreams could he have imagined Fergie would come in. </p>

              <p><strong>Michael Owen will join Manchester United today as long as he passes a stringent medical – and accepts a massive cut in his basic salary by signing what amounts to a pay-per-play deal.</strong><br><br><em>FourFourTwo</em> understands that the striker, a free agent since his Newcastle contract lapsed on Tuesday, will be offered a contract which handsomely rewards him for appearances and goals on top of a drastically reduced basic wage.<br><br>Owen was paid £120,000 a week at St James' Park but his injury problems mean he will get nowhere near that from his next club – whoever it may be. Aston Villa, Stoke, Hull and Everton have been linked with moves, with the Toffees said to be willing to pay £50,000 a week.<br><br>However, despite Owen's boyhood allegiance to Everton, David Moyes will accept that the striker is far more likely to sign for Sir Alex Ferguson. The Manchester United manager is a longterm admirer, having tried to sign him as a boy, and is willing to take a relatively low-risk gamble on reuniting Owen with former England partner Wayne Rooney.</p>

              <p><strong>Manchester United is delighted to announce that it has signed Michael Owen on a two-year contract. The striker was out of contract, so no transfer fee is involved.</strong></p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson said: "Michael is a world class forward with a proven goalscoring record at the highest level and that has never been in question. Coming to Manchester United with the expectations that we have is something that Michael will relish.”</p>
              <p>Michael Owen said: "I had just begun to talk to other clubs when out of the blue Sir Alex phoned me on Wednesday afternoon, invited me to have breakfast with him the next morning during which he told me that he wanted to sign me. I agreed without a moment's thought.</p>
              <p>"This is a fantastic opportunity for me and I intend to seize it with both hands. I am now looking forward to being a Manchester United player and I am fortunate that I already know so many of the players here. I missed pre-season last year and am pleased that I will be starting at Carrington from day one.</p>
              <p>"I want to thank Sir Alex for the faith he has shown in me and I give him my assurance that I will repay him with my goals and performances.”</p>
              <p>Owen scored 23 goals in 62 games in a poor Newcastle team, at a ratio of one every 2.69 games. Tevez scored 34 in 99 games in a magnificent Manchester United team, a rate of 2.97. Last season, his ratio was 3.4.</p>

              <p><strong>Graeme Souness:</strong></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>GRAEME SOUNESS thinks Alex Ferguson will turn Michael Owen back into an England World Cup star.</p>
              <p class="article">Former Toon boss Souey, who bought Owen from Real Madrid, believes he could make the World Cup. He said: "I don't think Michael is shot. The move will excite him and give him a new lease of life. </p>
              <p class="article">"At United he will be surrounded by really good team-mates. It's also World Cup year, which will be a motivation for him."</p>

              <p><strong>Ian Rush:</strong></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Ian Rush is backing Michael Owen to prove his critics wrong with Manchester United. Rush has no doubts Owen can prove his class with the Premier League champions.</p>
              <p>He told Sky Sports News: "People have knocked Michael Owen all his career but he comes back bigger and better. "People said he was finished years ago but he's a fantastic player who comes back stronger and better.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Glenn Hoddle:</strong></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Glenn Hoddle is confident that it will be another transfer coup by Ferguson just as Eric Cantona, Teddy Sheringham and Henrik Larsson were.</p>
              <p>They were all surprise sorties into the transfer market by the United boss – and all paid a handsome dividend. “I am sure Michael will be the same,” said Hoddle.</p>
              <p>Hoddle said: “Possession football and a lot of chances, it couldn’t be better for him. “At United he won’t be the focal point of the team. He will have the likes of Rooney, Berbatov and Valencia around him. They are match-winners as well. He will thrive at United.”</p>

              <p><strong>WITH one sweet swish of his left boot and delicate application of instep to orb, Michael Owen was back. He preened himself before his new club’s supporters and they sang the chorus they had been storing since Sir Alex Ferguson signed him: “Are You Watching Merseyside?” Manchester United were also back, finding true form for the first time this season.</strong></p>
              <p>How inevitable it happened at Wigan. They have faced Ferguson’s team 10 times since reaching the top flight and lost each time with a cumulative goal difference of -26. If this was cricket, they would be known as United’s rabbit.</p>
              <p>In fairness, Wigan did not do their Flopsy Bobtail act until 11 minutes into the second half, when Wayne Rooney scored his 100th goal for United with a sharp and decisive header, to jolt his team out of their early-campaign lethargy and break his opponents’ resolve. Until then, Roberto Martinez’s men were competing, trading chances with the champions and pressing a United midfield and forward line which — except for Rooney and the industrious Darren Fletcher — seemed worryingly containable.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Rooney’s goal woke Dimitar Berbatov, who scored a fine one of his own and helped Rooney notch a second before Owen struck. In stoppage time Nani exposed Chris Kirkland’s poor positioning with a crafty free kick and suddenly Wigan faced their record Premier League defeat.</strong></p>
              <p>While it remained 0-0, doubts created by Wednesday’s defeat at Burnley still hung over United. “You always look for a response,” said Ferguson.</p>
              <p>“We’re not going to kill ourselves because of it but we’re going to take reminders from it. It shouldn’t have happened but it did happen and the players had to do something about it.” Owen’s strike pleased him particularly. The striker, introduced for Rooney, tailored his run expertly to the needs of Nani who required time to manoeuvre into a position from which he could deliver a telling ball, something the Portuguese, in his most mature United performance to date, did with aplomb. The pass found Owen in a pocket of space no bigger than a picnic-rug, with Kirkland fast advancing. His dinked finish was instant, sending the ball home via the far post.</p>
              <p>“Fantastic goal, great run, the movement was excellent,” Ferguson slavered. “Michael has been England’s best goalscorer over the last decade and he proved that today. It will do him the world of good.” Rooney — marvellously for England — is adopting his colleague’s predatory mien. Goal No 100 came via a cross by Antonio Valencia. Rooney’s next strike went in off Mario Melchiot’s shins after Berbatov found him in the box.</p>
              <p>Berbatov looked typically enervated before scoring and energised thereafter. In a give-and-go with Paul Scholes he reached Scholes’ chipped pass, flicked it over Kirkland and hooked home the bouncing ball. “Their first goal affected us too much psychologically,” said Martinez. “It was two different games.”</p>
              <p>Though Berbatov (misdirecting a header), Scholes (miscuing a drive) and Rooney (foiled by Kirkland) missed first-half chances, Wigan also made opportunities. Jason Koumas caught Gary Neville flat-footed in possession and smacked in a swerving shot that Ben Foster, fully extended, pushed away.</p>
              <p>Foster made an even better save to repel Hugo Rodallega’s looping header immediately after Rooney scored for 1-0. Forget Owen being back, Nemanja Vidic returned and that, fundamentally, is far more significant for United. With him leading their backline, United gained an assurance in defence missing while he was out with an ankle injury. Titus Bramble executed a fine interception to stop Berbatov scoring but Vidic’s tackle on Charles N’Zogbia, with the midfielder poised to run clear, was just as good.</p>
              <p>Rodallega made the mistake of roughing up Foster and appeared to suffer off-the-ball retribution from Vidic and his elbows. Rodallega will bully plenty of defences but not one containing the Serb. For strikers it must be like jousting with a malevolent pair of giant scissors.</p>

              <p><span class="caption">Standing room only: Arsene Wenger is lost for words after being sent off at the end of Arsenal's 2-1 defeat to Manchester United at Old Trafford</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>It will go down as one of the iconic moments of the season. Having seen his side denied a late equaliser through the linesman’s offside flag, Arsène Wenger was sent off by referee Mike Dean for his protests.</strong></p>
              <p>The <span style="color: #0000ff;">Arsenal</span> manager climbed to the back of the dugout but was told he needed to move to the stands.</p>
              <p>So he clambered up above the benches, standing on a platform in front of the directors box, arms spread out in mockery. Happy now? It was symbolically rich moment.</p>
              <p>You could understand his frustration if not his actions. His Arsenal side had somehow lost to an unconvincing United courtesy of an unlikely penalty and a freak own goal. No wonder Wenger’s sensitivity to persecution was at its rawest.</p>
              <p>Arsenal will receive a £25,000 FA fine after they received six bookings – <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/premierleague/manutd"><span style="color: #0000ff;">United</span></a> had three in an ill tempered game – and with one of them coming for Emmanuel Eboue’s dive, Wenger will again have to defend his side from the accusations of cheating.</p>
              <p>What with the furore about Eduardo’s dive in midweek, Mike Dean evidently didn’t want to be duped by into giving away a penalty.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately he took that to the point of absurdity shortly before half time. The ball had broken to an unmarked Arshavin in the far side of the penalty box.</p>
              <p>Darren Fletcher, firefighter supreme, came sprinting across, slipped and absolutely flattened the Russian. It even looked like he handled the ball in committing the foul. A more certain penalty you will not see all season; Dean waved play on.</p>
              <p>Wenger’s touchline apoplexy – already at arm-flapping levels of intensity over United’s persistent fouling – was understandable but was calmed by the delivery of almost instant compensation by the football gods.</p>
              <p>Arshavin certainly is capable of exploiting the physics of kicking a ball with results beyond the ability of most mortals. Just moments after picking himself up in disbelief after Fletcher’s challenge, he received the ball some 25 yards out and, with Nemanja Vidic failing to close, sent the ball hurtling into the near post with illogical power.</p>
              <p>It was the goal the game needed. Until that point it had suffered from a lack of cohesive play – particularly from an inarticulate United – and a nasty undercurrent that had produced four bookings. With Dimitar Berbatov dropped, Rooney was often left on his own up front and chances were few.</p>
              <p>Fletcher had sent an early left-footed volley over but otherwise United’s usually ruthless counterattacking lacked conviction. And there can be few games where an Alex Ferguson side has so frequently surrendered possession.</p>
              <p>Arsenal certainly played with more menace. With 25 minutes gone they almost opened the scoring, Van Persie cutting inside Vidic and shooting, his effort deflecting off Patrice Evra and wide. The ball broke to Arshavin from the ensuing corner and the Russian cleverly tried to squeeze the ball into the top corner, sending it just wide.</p>
              <p>The outstanding Arshavin was involved again as Arsenal came close to extending their lead minutes after the restart. He seemed to get the ball stuck under his feet running into the area but then surged to the byline and drove a low cross in to Van Persie. The Dutchman met the ball crisply but Ben Foster stuck out his left boot to stop it crossing the line.</p>
              <p>A superb reaction save and the hinge in the game. From that moment things began to swing in United’s favour as the game ramped up in intensity. Out of nowhere, United had a penalty.</p>
              <p>Rooney raced Almunia for a ball that had in behind Gallas, got their first and was brought down by the goalkeeper. Penalty? There were several problems with the decision.</p>
              <p>First was the fact that Rooney was not in control of the ball and had he not been touched the ball would have shot out for a goal kick.</p>
              <p>The second issue was that Rooney was already going down before Almunia made contact. Still, contact in the area: penalty. Rooney converted calmly.</p>
              <p>Arsenal swiftly tried to recover the lead. Abou Diaby went surging down the right and was fouled by first Rooney and then Wes Brown.</p>
              <p>Both were booked and from the free kick, Van Persie hit a viciously swerving shot that thudded into the middle of the cross bar.</p>
              <p>Two minutes later and United had a wide free kick of their own which Ryan Giggs sent swinging into the Arsenal box. What happened next was bizarre.</p>
              <p>Diaby, completely on his own was comfortably under the incoming ball but inexplicably guided his header into his own net.</p>
              <p>The was the chance to put some stoppage-time gloss on the result when united, belatedly, counterattacked with real potency, Rooney finding Nani who hit the pass of the game with the outside of his boot for Berbatov to chase.</p>
              <p>The Bulgarian mis-hit his shot embarrassingly. Nani wasted an equally inviting chance moments later. The points were safe by then though, surely?</p>
              <p>Had William Gallas not drifted offside, Van Persie's late equaliser might well have stood and Wenger would have been spared his dramatic exit.</p>

              <p class="article">Midfield ace Anderson lashed United into the lead before Paul Scholes was dismissed and Wayne Rooney wrapped up the points.</p>
              <p class="article">Scholes was sent off for two trademark fouls — all in the space of five minutes. The veteran was booked for a late studs-up tackle on Defoe. And he was given a second yellow for a lunge on Tom Huddlestone on 59 minutes.</p>
              <p class="article">And Alex Ferguson blew his top at ref Andre Mariner — claiming Scholes' reputation as a rubbish tackler was to blame for the red. He moaned: "It was terrible sending off, I think the referee got it wrong. I have looked at the video twice and I don't see any sending off. "The Tottenham player is the one who has committed the real foul. Scholesy was a foot above him. He's never touched him.</p>
              <p class="article">"He's been sent off because his name is Paul Scholes. That is why he was sent off. It was a ridiculous decision. "It could have mattered. You are down to 10 men against Tottenham and only have a one-goal advantage. It's not easy."</p>
              <p class="article">Harry Redknapp saw his 100 per cent record blown away by the champions. But the Spurs boss wasn't too downcast to have finally lost.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: "I have never got carried away. It's still a great start, 12 points from five games. It wasn't an easy start for us in terms of games this season, with Liverpool and Man United at home, but I fancied us to get something.</p>
              <p class="article">"We had a fantastic start and we were seeing three points again. But we knew they would come back - that's why they win titles and European titles. "They have outstanding players - (Darren) Fletcher was fantastic, I thought."</p>

              <p><strong>Michael Owen stole the show in a derby for the ages as Manchester United defeated Manchester City 4-3 and demonstrated why the team from Old Trafford remain the city's dominant force.</strong></p>
              <p>Michael Owen believes he proved his dedication to Manchester United with his dramatic last-gasp winner against Manchester City at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Owen spent eight years playing for United's bitter rivals Liverpool but Sir Alex Ferguson signed him this summer - and the 29-year-old scored his second goal for the club to seal a 4-3 win deep in stoppage-time against City.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When asked if that would confirm hero status with United fans, Owen told Sky Sports: "Yes, if there was any doubt before then maybe. It was always going to create noise when I joined but even if the fans didn't take to me you're never going to pass up an opportunity to play for team like this."</p>

              <p><strong>City equalised three times before Owen struck. Wayne Rooney opened the scoring before Gareth Barry took advantage of Ben Foster's error. Darren Fletcher scored two headers, with Craig Bellamy levelling twice for the visitors.</strong></p>
              <p>"We dominated and the lads played well for a lot of the game," Owen added. "There were individual mistakes but over the years before I was here the defence has been fantastic."</p>
              <p>Fletcher added: "It was an unbelievable match, we showed great character to come back. The goals were mistakes but we look at the positives - we showed character to the end."</p>

              <p><strong>Michael Owen says his winning goal at Old Trafford against Manchester City will rank as one of the best moments of his career.</strong></p>
              <p>The Manchester United forward struck in the sixth minute of stoppage time yesterday to give the hosts a dramatic 4-3 victory. United had led on three occasions, but the game looked set to end in a draw when Craig Bellamy equalised in the 90th minute.</p>
              <p>"It is probably one of the moments I will reflect on as a highlight of my career," Owen said. "To score a goal as dramatic as that in a derby was amazing. You had to see it to believe it. It must have been one of the best televised games of all time."</p>
              <p>Owen insisted, however, that United would not get carried away by the victory and would turn their attention quickly to the Carling Cup match against Wolverhampton Wanderers on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Darren Fletcher, the United midfielder, who scored two goals in the game, praised Owen’s finish. “The whole move was superb,” he said.“Ryan Giggs’ pass was unbelievable, as was the way Michael controlled the ball with the outside of his right foot and finished it the same way.</p>
              <p>"A natural goalscorer makes natural goalscoring movements and over the next few months Michael is going to be an important player for us."</p>
              <p>Owen's winner sparked tumultuous celebrations among United fans and on the club's bench. The usually implacable former Liverpool forward admitted he, too, was taken up by the emotion of the contest.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>"It was brilliant," he said. "I don't know how the manager and staff do it. It must be so nerve-wracking. When I start a game I never get nervous. I always feel in control. But when you are sat on the bench the game rubs off on you.</strong></p>
              <p>"When you go on to the pitch you are a little nervous because you have felt all the emotions of everyone around you. You kick every ball with the team. The first couple of minutes are quite hard.</p>
              <p>"At this level you have to be at the right speed despite sitting on your backside for the previous hour. But you get sent on to get a goal. Thankfully, that is what I did."</p>

              <p><strong>The banner at the Stretford End mocking Manchester City's lengthy wait for a trophy will not be torn down just yet.</strong></p>
              <p>City boss Roberto Mancini vowed to tear it down, while their cocksure chief executive Garry Cook had predicted an imminent power shift in Manchester.</p>
              <p>Yet all their bold rhetotic proved premature, as United put their "noisy neighbours" firmly in their place by reaching Wembley at their expense and prolonging their 34-year wait for silverware.</p>
              <p>On the eve of the game Sir Alex Ferguson accused City of getting "carried away" with their plans for world domination, and mocked the hapless Cook's delusions of grandeur.</p>

              <p><strong>Wayne Rooney quietened 'noisy neighbours' Manchester City with an injury-time winner which sent Manchester United to Wembley.</strong></p>
              <p>Last week, in a New York bar named Mad Hatter, City chief executive Garry Cook delivered the best team-talk Sir Alex Ferguson could have wanted as he declared this Carling Cup tie as good as over with the Blues leading 2-1 from the first leg at Eastlands.</p>
              <p>If Cook knew much about Manchester United, it is this - never write them off.</p>
              <p>So, after Carlos Tevez had threatened to take the semi-final into extra-time when he quite brilliantly turned home Craig Bellamy's cross 14 minutes from time, up popped Rooney, who nodded home Ryan Giggs' cross to secure a Carling Cup final meeting with Aston Villa on February 28.</p>
              <p>In fact, the Red Devils thought they were already there.</p>
              <p>Controlling possession against a City side which sat too deep, they had carved out a decisive lead thanks to two precise finishes from Paul Scholes and Michael Carrick.</p>
              <p>Only Tevez's refusal to bow at the feet of his old club kept the Blues going, but it was not enough. And though Rooney inexplicably failed to grab a third before Tevez struck, he is too much a part of United's fabric to merely accept defeat.</p>
              <p>City were attempting to "change history" in Mancini's words.</p>
              <p>In pure domestic and European terms alone, United had made 21 cup final appearances and won 11 league titles since the Blues last reached Wembley in 1981.</p>
              <p>Tevez was the clear focal point for City from the start. The South American flung himself at a Bellamy cross and Edwin van der Sar needed Jonny Evans' help to ensure there was no trouble after he had dropped what seemed to be a routine save.</p>
              <p>Rio Ferdinand got away with a despairing lunge at Tevez that left the former United man on the deck. If referee Howard Webb had been feeling in a stricter mood, the gamble of playing Ferdinand this evening and leaving the consequences to be faced tomorrow when he goes before an FA disciplinary panel could have backfired disastrously.</p>

              <p>United players celebrate meeting Aston Villa at wembley Stadium on Feb 28th in a repeat of the 1994 Carling Cup final.</p>
              <p><strong>As the teams trooped in for their half-time pep talk, the feeling persisted that the game was destined to explode.</strong></p>
              <p>The firecracker went off seven minutes after the restart and following a brief stoppage after Bellamy had been hit on the back of the head by a coin as he went to retrieve the ball for a City corner.</p>
              <p>United quickly countered as City conceded possession. Rooney delivered a superb pass for Giggs, who would have had a clear sight of goal if City goalkeeper Shay Given had not been so quick to react and push him out wide.</p>
              <p>The veteran Welshman did not panic and delivered the ball back into the City area and, after, Nani had run into a wall of defenders, Michael Carrick prodded the ball back for Scholes, who drove his shot into the bottom corner.</p>
              <p>United had the scent of Wembley in their nostrils and when Nani flicked a superb pass through to Darren Fletcher inside the City box, the Scotland star had the awareness to lay a pass off to Carrick. The England midfielder does not score many, but he is an accurate striker of the ball and his shot was perfectly placed into the bottom corner with the aid of the post.</p>
              <p>If Rooney had tapped home Patrice Evra's cross when he was completely unmarked three minutes later, the tie would have been over. Inexplicably, he put it wide.</p>
              <p>It was virtually certain Rooney would be made to pay almost instantly. After playing a pass out to Bellamy, Tevez continued his run and somehow managed to squeeze the ball beyond Van der Sar from the most unlikely angle.</p>
              <p>United could feel aggrieved but relief should have arrived 10 minutes from time when Vincent Kompany's block offered Carrick a second chance. On this occasion though his snap shot flew wide.</p>
              <p>But Rooney still had one more trick up his sleeve. And with it came a very large slice of humble pie for Cook.</p>

              <p>An England Under-21 international, Smalling has made 10 first-team appearances for Fulham, who signed him from non-league Maidstone 18 months ago.</p>
              <p>Reds boss Sir Alex Ferguson said: "Chris is an extremely talented young defender, who we have been monitoring for some months. He’s very quick and reads the game well. He will be a great asset to the club, playing alongside some of the best defenders around and we’re delighted to have secured his signature."<br><br>Smalling, 20, described the move as an "unbelievable opportunity".<br><br>"My time at Fulham has been great and I have learned a lot about the game from Roy Hodgson and the coaching staff," he said. “But the chance of coming to the biggest club in the world is something I just couldn’t turn down. I’m excited about working with Sir Alex and the fantastic players in the squad.<br><br>"I’ve played a few times in the Europa League this year, but the thought of making the step up to the Champions League next year is great. I can’t wait.”</p>

              <p>Nani opened the scoring in the 33rd minute when his chip across goal was palmed in by Arsenal goalkeeper Manuel Almunia, before in-form England striker Wayne Rooney swept home a second following a quick counter attack.</p>
              <p>A third on the break from Ji-sung Park at the start of the second half effectively ended the contest, although defender Thomas Vermaelen netted a consolation for the out-muscled Gunners.</p>
              <p>Nani described the match as his best performance since joining United from Sporting Lisbon in 2007.</p>
              <p>'I think that was my best game,' said the Portugal international. 'I played well, scoring and getting an assist.</p>
              <p>'It was a fantastic performance from the team and I was so happy to help. I'm working hard every day to be fit for the team.</p>
              <p>'I want to help the team play well. I can feel the confidence of my team-mates, the fans and the manager. I'm so happy and want to continue this good form.</p>
              <p>'We had a very good game (against Manchester City) last Wednesday and that gave everyone confidence for this match.</p>
              <p>'The manager said we had to have the same attitude today if we want to be champions.'</p>
              <p>Arsenal, who had started the match five points behind Chelsea ahead of their trip to Stamford Bridge next weekend, began well as Andrey Arshavin got away down the left, before cutting inside and trying to curl the ball past Edwin van der Sar from a tight angle, but his shot drifted wide.</p>

              <p><strong>United, though, were quick to regain possession and then cut down any space for the home side. Nani and Darren Fletcher combined as they almost played in Rooney, but William Gallas made an important blocking tackle in the six-yard box.</strong></p>
              <p>Alex Song - back from the African Nations Cup - then had to hack the ball clear at the far post as United again got clear down the right far too easily.</p>
              <p>When Arshavin - who was ineligible for last season's Champions League semi-final clash between the sides - burst away again, he lacked any support in the middle.</p>
              <p>The Russian, though, remained Arsenal's most potent attacking threat.</p>
              <p>In the 13th minute he skipped away down the left, cut back inside Wes Brown and curled another effort goalwards, which this time was only just wide of the far post.</p>
              <p>Arsenal captain Cesc Fabregas suddenly burst into life with a surging run down the middle, before slipping in Arshavin, but the Russian lost his footing at the key moment and United cleared.</p>
              <p>United - who have played a match more than Chelsea - slowly started to gain the upper hand and Gallas needed to make another timely tackle in the penalty area as Paul Scholes shaped to shot.</p>
              <p>Nani drilled the ball wide as Arsenal were again exposed in the right channel, before playing a key part in the goal which gave United the lead.</p>
              <p>The winger skipped easily in between two defenders then chipping the ball back across goal. Almunia pushed it inside his far post, with Park Ji-Sung ready to tap the ball into the net.</p>

              <p><strong>Fabregas' shot following a corner was blocked - and four minutes later United were 2-0 ahead. Again Nani was the provider, dashing clear after picking the ball up from Rooney before squaring it for the England striker to sweep home his 22nd goal of the season, low into the corner.</strong></p>
              <p>The Gunners faced an uphill battle to get back into the match, with Arshavin firing wide from just inside the box - as manager Arsene Wenger was left to scratch his head and looked to the heavens for inspiration.</p>
              <p>It could have been worse on 41 minutes, but Nani blazed his shot wide after more good work from Rooney down the left.</p>
              <p>There was a hold-up at the start of the second half as Rooney received treatment following a knock on the knee in a challenge with Bacary Sagna.</p>
              <p>The England forward, though, was soon back in the action, and tested Almunia with a fierce angled drive after cutting in from the left.</p>
              <p>It was game over on 52 minutes, when United scored a third following another simple counter.</p>
              <p>This time is was Park who broke clear, sprinting onto Fletcher's chip into the Arsenal half and then slotting past Almunia from just inside the box.</p>

              <p><strong>The Gunners were also well beaten here 3-0 by Chelsea at the end of November, before a run of seven wins from nine hauled them back into title contention.</strong></p>
              <p>Fabregas, continued to drive his young team on, firing over and then just too close to van der Sar, then Song volleyed wide.</p>
              <p>Theo Walcott came on as substitute - and Arsenal pulled a goal back with 11 minutes to go when Vermaelen's volley took a deflection off Jonny Evans to wrong-foot van der Sar.</p>
              <p>However, there was to be no grand finale as Wenger's youngsters were again found wanting when it mattered most.</p>
