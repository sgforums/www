He was at it again yesterday, sweeping across the damp surface with the sublime footballing skills of a master showman. The crowd drooled, the visitors cowed and Ronaldo's hat-trick of goals in a second-half rout sent his United to the top of the Premier League with all the style of potential champions.</strong><br><br>All six goals came in the second half after Sir Alex Ferguson had sent out his players with instructions to be sharper with their passing and to stop trying to walk the ball into the net. They could have won deeply into double figures. Four times Newcastle cleared off the line, Wayne Rooney missed four chances before the match was 15 minutes old and for those loyal, noisy and frustrated Newcastle supporters it was all grim and hapless.<br><br>Newcastle keeper Shay Given twice saved well from Rooney as United threatened to lay siege to the visitors' goal. Claudio Cacapa then cleared a goal-bound header from John O'Shea before the game had a moment of controversy after 28 minutes. Ronaldo was furious - as was a gesticulating Sir Alex Ferguson - when referee Rob Styles turned down penalty appeals after he tumbled under challenge from Steven Taylor. As the interval approached, Given saved superbly low from Ronaldo, and it needed a brave clearance from Stephen Carr to block Ryan Giggs as he closed in on the rebound.<br><br>The second period opening in dramatic fashion, with Taylor clearing off the line twice within seconds from Tevez and Rooney. United were threatening every time they went forward, Given saving well from substitute Danny Simpson and then from Rooney, It was embarrassingly one-sided, and Jose Enrique cleared off the line from Carrick, with United appealing for a penalty as Carr clashed with Ferdinand.<br><br>The winger's free-kick broke the deadlock after 49 minutes and Carlos Tevez quickly tapped in a second. Ronaldo capped a stunning four-man move for the third and Rio Ferdinand volleyed in a fourth after 85 minutes. He sealed his treble via a deflection. There was even more agony for Newcastle in injury-time when Tevez added a sixth.

              <p>Two goals: Cristiano Ronaldo was in typical irresistible form.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Manchester United 3</span> (Carlos Tevez 38, Cristiano Ronaldo 69 pen, 88.) </strong></p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">Tottenham 1</span> (Robbie Keane 24)</strong></p>

              <p><strong>Ronaldo double as United send Spurs spinning out</strong> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cristiano Ronaldo continued his astonishing scoring spree to steer Manchester United through to the fifth round of the FA Cup. The Portugal winger set a seasonal best tally of 25 goals for the club with a brace against 10-man Tottenham. Yet the Carling Cup finalists will be left cursing their luck after squandering a number of chances. They were also left to rue defender Michael Dawson's sending off at a crucial stage of the game.[/b]</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Wayne Rooney and Ronaldo both had good efforts for United but it was Tottenham who almost made the breakthrough through Dimitar Berbatov. He got on the end of a corner from Aaron Lennon, only for Rooney to clear off the line and get a pat on the back from goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar in the 16th minute. Tottenham, however, did go ahead in the 24th minute when Aaron Lennon skipped away from Patrice Evra. He delivered the ball into the area and Robbie Keane scored from close range.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Packing a punch: Carlos Teves celebrates his leveller</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Tottenham were looking dangerous on the counter attack and Berbatov picked out Lennon in the 32nd minute. As he was being shadowed by Wes Brown, Lennon tried his luck on goal but failed to test van der Sar. United stepped up the pace and Radek Cerny did well to tip over a shot from Ryan Giggs after 37 minutes. The equaliser came a minute later and Giggs played a crucial role in the build up. He held off the challenge of Young-Pyo Lee and that enabled Carlos Tevez to fire a shot into the corner beyond Cerny.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>It was just the boost United were looking for and and Carrick clipped a shot over the bar in the 41st minute. Jenas should have regained the lead for Spurs in stoppage time when he was clean through. However he failed to get enough power on his effort and van der Sar was able to push it to safety.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Tottenham came close to regaining their lead in the 47th minute when Evra slipped and let in the pacey Lennon. He raced forward and tried to chip van der Sar only for his effort to finish on the roof of the net. Jamie O'Hara then curled a 25-yard free kick wide before Jenas fluffed his lines again in the 55th minute. He had only van der Sar to beat but failed to test the Dutch goalkeeper with his effort.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>United responded and Tevez picked out Ronaldo in the 59th minute but his shot went narrowly wide. Ferguson then decided a change was needed and Paul Scholes was introduced in the 65th minute. Making his first appearance in three months after a knee operation he was given a rousing ovation by the home fans when he replaced Carrick.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Scholes was quickly into the action and released Tevez with a precise pass in the 67th minute but he fired a shot over the bar. The tie took a dramatic turn a minute later when Dawson was sent off for a hand ball in the area under pressure from Rooney. Ronaldo stepped and slotted the spot kick into the corner to put United 2-1 ahead with his 24th goal for the club.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Down to 10 men and a goal down, Tottenham looked a little bit deflated as the game entered a crucial stage. However they almost drew level when Berbatov's effort in the 85th minute came back off the post after a good through ball from Steed Malbranque. Ronaldo got his second in the 88th minute when he got away from substitute Chris Gunter and his shot squirmed under Cerny's body, leaving the goalkeeper red-faced.</p>

              <h1>Ruthless United demolish Gunners</h1>
              <h3>Manchester 4 Arsenal 0</h3>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Wayne Rooney delivered a virtuoso solo display as Manchester United outclassed Arsenal in the FA Cup fifth round.</strong> </span></p>
              <p>Rooney headed United in front from close range after 16 minutes and Darren Fletcher provided another headed finish from Nani's cross four minutes later.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u189/zomanu/Rooney_getty.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><strong>Wayne Rooney finds himself free in the box before flicking a header past Arsenal's Jens Lehmann in the 16th minute</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Michael Carrick set up Nani for a third as United turned on the style.</p>
              <p>Arsenal's Emmanuel Eboue was sent off after 48 minutes for a foul on Patrice Evra before Nani was the creator again as Fletcher headed United's fourth. </p>
              <p>England coach Fabio Capello was in attendance at Old Trafford and showed his appreciation for Rooney's brilliance by applauding his England striker when he was substituted with 20 minutes left.</p>
              <p>United left Cristiano Ronaldo and Ryan Giggs out of their line-up, while Arsenal kept Emmanuel Adebayor and Mathieu Flamini on the bench - and the Gunners suffered most from the changes.</p>
              <p>Rooney returned from suspension after missing the defeat to Manchester City - and made up for lost time by destroying Arsenal with a blistering first-half display.</p>
              <p><img src="http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u189/zomanu/naniMO.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><img src="http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u189/zomanu/fletcher_getty.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><strong>The lead is doubled just moments later as Darren Fletcher heads in after fine work from Nani on the left.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fletcher deservedly doubled the lead four minutes later when Nani opened up Arsenal on the left flank and crossed for the Scot to head in at the near post.</p>
              <p>Rooney continued to terrorise the Arsenal defence and could have added to his goals tally before United made it three seven minutes before the interval.</p>
              <p>Carrick split the Arsenal defence wide open, leaving Nani to control and calmly shoot past Lehmann.</p>
              <p>Rooney had already tested Lehmann again before Arsenal's misery increased after 48 minutes when Eboue was rightly sent off for a raised boot in a tackle on Evra.</p>
              <p>The Arsenal defender seemed reluctant to leave the pitch after referee Alan Wiley brandished the read card, but he had no excuses because it was an horrendous challenge.</p>
              <p>Rooney was in almost unstoppable form, tearing the Arsenal defence apart almost at will, shooting wide after beating Kolo Toure and then bringing a fine save from Lehmann - all in the space of seconds.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>Fletcher's thumping header gives the hosts a 4-0 lead in the 74th minute with Arsenal's defence beaten yet again.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And with 16 minutes left, United got the fourth goal their dazzling football deserved when Nani floated up a perfect far post cross for Fletcher to head in at the far post.</p>
              <p>Arsenal, who have enjoyed taunting outclassed teams in the past, were not enjoying getting a taste of their own medicine and William Gallas was lucky to escape punishment for an ill-disciplined kick at Nani.</p>
              <p>Substitute Louis Saha almost added a fifth with two minutes left but keeper Lehmann - who had been blameless in the defeat - saved well again.</p>
