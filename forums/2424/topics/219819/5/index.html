              <p><strong><span style="color: #008000;">Sunday, 23 March 2008</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>JAVIER MASCHERANO became the dumbest man in the world after crazily provoking ref Steve Bennett to send him off for dissent. </strong><strong>Rafael Benitez last night accused referee Steve Bennett of over-reacting after he sent off Liverpool midfielder Javier Mascherano for an outrageous show of dissent.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On a day when Manchester United took a huge step towards retaining their Barclays Premier League crown with a 3-0 win over Benitez's men and rivals Arsenal lost 2-1 at Chelsea, Mascherano took centre stage by becoming the latest star name to show a lack of respect towards a match official.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u189/zomanu/red_ap.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Liverpool are reduced to 10 men as Javier Mascherano gets a second yellow card for dissent from referee Steve Bennett.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In a week dominated by the debate over players' attitudes towards officials in the wake of the Ashley Cole affair at Tottenham, Mascherano was dismissed for haranguing Bennett in the 44th minute, with his side 1-0 down and still in the game. Remarkable scenes followed as the Argentina midfielder refused to leave the field and eventually had to be placated by Benitez and dragged down the touchline to the dressing room.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u189/zomanu/rafaDM.jpg" alt="" width="468" height="376"></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Desperation: Liverpool's Rafa Benitez has to restrain a furious Javier Mascherano</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Benitez admitted that his player had made a 'mistake' — but insisted that Bennett had overreacted and helped condemn his side to defeat. "The player told me and Ryan Babel also told me that Mascherano was only asking the referee what was happening. He knows he made a mistake but to send a player off for this in a game as important as this is just not right."</p>
              <p><img src="http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u189/zomanu/RooCar.jpg" alt=""> </p>
              <p>Mascherano was booked early in the match for a late tackle on Paul Scholes and subsequently appeared intent on walking a fine line as he questioned several decisions by Bennett. And although TV replays suggested that he was merely saying 'what's happening?' in the pivotal incident, it is possible that Bennett showed him his second yellow card for persistent dissent.</p>
              <p>United manager Sir Alex Ferguson said: "I don't know why he got involved. I think with the thing that had happened with Ashley Cole in midweek, there was going to be a focus on dissent. Mascherano had been booked and he kept badgering the referee. We have been talking about dissent — and that was definitely dissent."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Benitez, who has now failed to beat United in the Premier League in six attempts, refused to be drawn on whether he thought Bennett had been influenced by what happened with Cole during Chelsea's 4-4 draw at Tottenham last week.</p>
              <p>But Bennett was the fourth official at White Hart Lane and was criticised by referees' head Keith Hackett in a Sunday newspaper for failing to intervene as Cole turned his back on match referee Mike Riley. Benitez added: "I have my opinions on all these things but sometimes they are best kept to yourself. When you play a big game like this then you are surprised to see somebody sent off in this way.</p>
              <p><img src="http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u189/zomanu/Browngoal.jpg" alt=""> <img src="http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u189/zomanu/wes_get.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">The 34th-minute header is only Brown's second league goal for the Red Devils and it gives them a crucial advantage.</span></p>

              <p><img src="http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u189/zomanu/cr_.jpg" alt="" width="416" height="300"> <span style="color: #888888;"><img src="http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u189/zomanu/wesbrown412_g.jpg" alt=""> <img src="http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u189/zomanu/nani_ap.jpg" alt="" width="416" height="300"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Liverpool's miserable afternoon goes from bad to worse as Cristiano Ronaldo heads home the second in the 79th minute and Nani finishes things off for Sir Alex Ferguson's men as he rifles a powerful shot past Reina in the 81st minute.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>United's win — their fifth on the bounce in the League — came courtesy of a rare goal from defender Wes Brown and second-half efforts from Cristiano Ronaldo and substitute Nani.</p>
              <p>With Arsenal losing in the day's other big game at Stamford Bridge, United's lead at the top is five points, with Chelsea now their closest challengers. Ferguson was understandably delighted after seeing his team come through another big test. He said: "We should have been three or four up by half-time. I think we were the better team already but the sending-off made it very difficult for them.</p>
              <p>"Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney could have had hat-tricks and it was a bit disappointing that we didn't finish them off earlier. "But it was a performance of real maturity from us. This is a real high peak. It is also very good for our goal difference and it gives confidence and a real boost. I still think the race will go right to the end as Chelsea and Arsenal are both playing really well. It will be very close."</p>

              <p><strong>Man Utd 4-0 Aston Villa: Cristiano Ronaldo opens the scoring on 16 minutes at Old Trafford with a cheeky flick</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Whichever team you support, whatever you think of Manchester United, savour these days. While Cristiano Ronaldo is in the English game to exhibit his sublime, almost ridiculous talent, we are all blessed indeed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As the rain lashed the north-west, Old Trafford's lights shone brightly in the evening sky. Within the stadium, Ronaldo's light shone brightest of all. United's support demands a marquee player, a singular figure who will thrill them, dating back to Billy Meredith a century ago.</p>
              <p>Latterly there has been George Best and Eric Cantona. Ronaldo's place in that Pantheon has become assured. The Portuguese scored United's first goal with an outrageous backheel that gave him his 35th of the season — just 11 short of Denis Law's club record for a campaign — and his 26th in 26 Premier League starts.</p>
              <p>He then proceeded to create three more with an astonishing range of flicks and tricks to condemn outclassed Aston Villa to their third consecutive defeat, extending their miserable record against United.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo landed a cross on the head of Carlos Tevez for the second, then backheeled a flick into the path of Wayne Rooney for the third. A perceptive pass made the fourth and a second for Rooney, who was denied a late hat-trick by a linesman's flag.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u189/zomanu/ronniPA290.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><strong>Ronaldo in full flight and unstoppable.</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p class="first">Manchester United stretched their lead at the Premier League summit to six points with a stunning display. Cristiano Ronaldo's outrageous flick started the agony for Aston Villa after 17 minutes and he provided Carlos Tevez with a simple second before half-time. Wayne Rooney rounded Scott Carson for a third after 53 minutes and he slid home the fourth with 20 minutes left after more superb creativity from Ronaldo.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u189/zomanu/51_tevez.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><strong>Ronaldo then crosses for Carlos Tevez to add a second for the Red Devils before half time.</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>

              <p><strong>Wayne Rooney scores twice in the second half and almost bags a hat-trick to complete a comprehensive win.</strong></p>

              <p><img src="http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u189/zomanu/rooney.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><strong>Ronaldo and Rooney were irresistible - and combined once more for United's fourth in the 70th minute. </strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>• <strong>Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson:</strong></p>
              <p><br>"The players reached a peak last week and we've continued that. "They realise now it's a race to the line, we need consistency and real focus and we showed fantastic energy. "The title doesn't feel that close for us, but there is great confidence in the way the team is playing and that's great at this time of the year."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>• <strong>Aston Villa manager Martin O'Neill:</strong></p>
              <p><br>"If you could ever try to set the benchmark, that's it. "We came up against a team on top of their game; we have to admit they were splendid. "There were things there to give us heart. The scoreline was pretty strong, but we had one or two chances that could have made it more respectable."</p>

              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>CRISTIANO RONALDO</strong> stole the show as Manchester United stormed towards the title. The Portuguese star showed his full array of tricks as he scored one and set up the other three goals in this romp. But Ronaldo's 17th-minute opener left the Old Trafford crowd open-mouthed as he back-heeled a flick through Martin Laursen's legs and into the net from 10 yards.</p>
              <p class="article">Manchester United boss<strong> Alex Ferguson </strong>was so bamboozled he needed to see it again to realise what Ronaldo had pulled off. He said: “It was only when I saw the replay I realised what Ronaldo had done. “The execution was absolutely brilliant, so full marks to him. “We displayed some great attacking movements and you have to admire the players’ enthusiasm in difficult conditions. “It has to be one of our best performances of the season and just what was needed after Arsenal’s victory.</p>
              <p class="article">Fergie added: “The players reached a peak last week and we continued that today. They realise now it’s a race to the line. "We need consistency and real focus and we showed fantastic energy, which is a very pleasing aspect considering some of them have been away for internationals. “The title doesn’t feel that close for us but there is great confidence in the way the team is playing and that’s always great at this time of the year.”</p>
              <p class="article"><strong>Villa boss Martin O'Neill</strong> admitted his men failed to cope with United. He said: “I thought United were really brilliant. They have been in these situations many times, in the Champions League quarter-finals and going for the title. “Their enthusiasm, determination and ability are there for all to see. They are a class side, no question of that.</p>
              <p class="article">“Many teams would have struggled like we did."</p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Cristiano Ronaldo headed home his 36th goal of the season from Paul Scholes' cross six minutes before half-time. Roma rallied, with Christian Panucci missing from close range and Edwin van der Sar saving brilliantly from Mirko Vucinic's 61st-minute header. But Rooney bundled home United's crucial second five minutes later.</strong> </span> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The result leaves United clear favourites to reach a likely semi-final showdown against Barcelona. Sir Alex Ferguson made three changes from the side that won so emphatically against Aston Villa on Saturday - Van der Sar, Anderson and Ji-Sung Park replacing Tomasz Kuszczak, Ryan Giggs and Carlos Tevez. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Vucinic led the Roma attack in place of injured captain Francesco Totti, and he was a lively figure in a first 45 minutes that saw United relatively untroubled. Panucci posed an early threat when he rose to meet David Pizarro's corner but headed over the top. </span> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">It prompted a response from Ferguson after 55 minutes as Owen Hargreaves was sent on for the disappointing Anderson, who was also suffering a hamstring problem. Roma were testing United's resolve, and just after the hour Van der Sar needed to produce a stunning reflex save to turn away Vucinic's flicked header. But United survived the siege to break out and deliver a stunning counter-punch to double their advantage. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Park did well to head Wes Brown's long cross into the danger area and when Doni failed to collect, Rooney bundled home from inside the six-yard box. Roma, understandably, looked demoralised and United came within inches of adding a third and effectively putting the tie to bed late on. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">First Ronaldo fired a low shot against an upright before Michael Carrick was just inches off-target from 20 yards as United gathered momentum. Then, with seconds remaining, Ronaldo almost crowned the perfect in night in spectacular fashion when he volleyed just over from substitute Tevez's cross.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Vucinic was just off target before United suffered a blow after 29 minutes when Nemanja Vidic was carried off after landing awkwardly on his knee in an aerial challenge. However, United reacted well to the setback and took the lead with a priceless away goal from Ronaldo six minutes before the interval. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Scholes sat up an inviting cross and Ronaldo rose superbly to power a downward header past Doni. The Portuguese winger took a heavy bang to the head in scoring, but recovered quickly to carry on. Vucinic could have levelled two minutes later, but he jabbed a finish across the face of goal after escaping the attentions of the United defence. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Roma set about United with intent after the break, Max Tonetto sending a powerful drive just wide and Panucci wasting their best chance of the night when he blasted over from close range after United failed to deal with Vucinic's long throw. </span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #008000;">Sunday, 6 April 2008</span></strong></p>

              <p class="first"><strong>Wayne Rooney earned Manchester United a draw and extended their lead over Chelsea to three points after a pulsating encounter at the Riverside.</strong></p>
              <p>Cristiano Ronaldo gave the visitors an early lead when he converted Michael Carrick's cross.</p>
              <p>Afonso Alves's cool strike, his first for Middlesbrough, hauled the hosts level and he put them ahead just after half-time with a fine curling effort.</p>
              <p>But Rooney turned in Ji-Sung Park's cross from the right to save United.</p>
              <p>During the closing stages Sir Alex Ferguson's men pushed frantically to extend their lead at the top of the table to five points with five games remaining, but they were met by stubborn resistance.</p>
              <p>And Boro, who remain 14th, will be bitterly disappointed not to have emerged victorious having dominated for long spells and continually threatened a third goal.</p>
              <p>United arrived knowing victory against Boro, followed by wins against Arsenal, Blackburn and Chelsea, would see them retain their Premier League title at Stamford Bridge on 26 April.</p>
              <p>And, as if desperate to hasten their coronation, they made a blistering start and were rewarded within 10 minutes.</p>
              <p>Boro have proved awkward opponents for United in recent seasons - winning five of their meetings since 2002.</p>

              <p class="first"><strong>Carlos Tevez struck as Manchester United defeated Roma to seal a Champions League semi-final match-up with Barcelona.</strong></p>
              <p>Roma should have taken the lead from the penalty spot after a foul by Wes Brown but Daniele de Rossi smashed the ball high over the crossbar. Edwin van der Sar denied Mirko Vucinic as Roma threatened but Ryan Giggs and Owen Hargreaves forced saves from Doni. And Tevez scored with a diving header from Hargreaves' cross to seal the tie. </p>
              <p>The Argentine struck after 70 minutes and it was a goal that punctured any lingering hopes Roma harboured of a dramatic comeback. The Italians had been left stunned after their 2-0 defeat in Rome but, after enduring a poor start to the second leg, they showed great spirit to rattle their opponents.</p>
              <p>United boss Sir Alex Ferguson had shown great faith in his squad prior to kick-off by leaving Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo out of his starting line-up. They were two of five changes from the team that drew at Middlesbrough on Sunday.</p>
              <p>Changes or not, United had more than enough opportunities to kill off the tie in the first 10 minutes. Hargreaves was a revelation down the right for United, using his superb athleticism to run on to passes from midfield, and he delivered two telling crosses. The first was met by Giggs while Anderson drilled a low strike from the second - both efforts drawing saves from Doni.</p>
              <p>But Roma should have forced their way back into the tie when referee Tom Hennin Ovrebo ruled that Brown had failed to make any contact with the ball while trying to tackle Mancini. De Rossi buried his head in his shirt after blazing the spot kick way over the crossbar but Roma took confidence from winning the penalty and enjoyed a spell of possession that saw them end the half on top.</p>
              <p>And after Tevez headed home another excellent Hargreaves cross the tie was effectively settled. Further good news for the buoyant home fans arrived with 10 minutes left when Gary Neville came on for his first appearance since picking up an ankle injury on 17 March 2007.</p>

              <h1><span style="color: #0000ff;">Arsenal's Inability To Retain A Lead Ends Their Title Bid.</span></h1>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #008000;">Sunday, 13 April 2008</span></strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u189/zomanu/handshak.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Manchester United went six points clear at the top of the Premier League after coming from behind to beat Arsenal in a pulsating encounter at Old Trafford.</strong></p>
              <p>Arsenal were on top for long spells but striker Emmanuel Adebayor wasted some gilt-edged chances, before he appeared to use his arm to open the scoring. United levelled through a twice-taken Cristiano Ronaldo penalty after William Gallas had handled in the Arsenal box. Owen Hargreaves won it with 20 minutes to go with a superb 25-yard free-kick. The result all-but ends Arsenal's hopes of winning the title and after their Champions League exit at the hands of Liverpool in midweek, means they will end a third successive season trophyless.</p>
              <p>United deserved to be behind, but Arsenal have recently become a team that looks afraid to be ahead and only four minutes later they were pegged back. Hargreaves' ball into the box was inexplicably handled by Gallas and after his first penalty was ruled out for encroaching, Ronaldo slammed his second effort into the bottom corner.</p>
              <p>Sensing blood, United sent on Carlos Tevez and Anderson, while Wenger replied with the introduction of Theo Walcott, under the watching gaze of England coach Fabio Capello. Tevez almost made an immediate impact, his sizzling 25-yard strike flying inches wide of the Arsenal goal with Lehmann comfortably beaten.</p>
              <p>After Gael Clichy's deflected cross was tipped onto a post by Van der Sar, United dealt a hammer blow to the Gunners' hopes of winning silverware this season. Evra was tripped 25 yards out and Hargreaves stepped up to delightfully clip the ball up and over the wall and into the unguarded corner of Lehmann's net.</p>
              <p>Van der Sar saved late on from substitute Nicklas Bendtner as United held on for a victory that may well secure them yet another Premier League title.</p>

              <h1>Ferguson revels in decisive win</h1>
              <em>Sir Alex Ferguson says winning their next two Premier League games will secure the title after they beat Arsenal 2-1. United are six points clear of Chelsea after victory over the Gunners and meet the second-placed Blues on 26 April. Ferguson said: "If we win at Blackburn and at Chelsea we're champions. We've got over a nervous day today. "I thought it was a fantastic game, absolutely outstanding. You won't see a better game anywhere this season."</em>  </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><strong>WENGER: IT`S ALL OVER</strong></div>
              <div><em>Arsene Wenger admitted his team's title hopes are now over following the 2-1 defeat to Manchester United at Old Trafford. "Yes we are out," Wenger told Sky Sports One. "We played with quality and spirit, and I'm very proud of our performance. What can you do? "We had plenty of chances and we were really unlucky not to win."</em> <em>Wenger was at a loss to explain the turnaround in the Gunners' season, having been five points clear at the beginning of February, but feels luck has not been on their side. "The last two months, we have been not very lucky - and you could see that again," he said. "I believe this team is good enough," he added. "We had a dip since March and we need to look at why, but the biggest target is to keep the team together."</em></div>

              <p> </p>
              <p class="first"><strong>Carlos Tevez's late equaliser kept Manchester United on course for the Premier League title as they earned a crucial point at Blackburn.</strong></p>
              <p>Roque Santa Cruz threatened to blow the race for the championship wide open with a calm finish after 21 minutes. And Blackburn keeper Brad Friedel kept United at bay almost single-handedly with a string of stunning saves.</p>
              <p>Tevez's 88th minute header gives United a three-point lead over Chelsea before their visit to Stamford Bridge. United boss Sir Alex Ferguson made four changes ahead of the Champions League semi-final against Barcelona - with Nemanja Vidic returning after a three-game absence because of a knee injury and Tomasz Kuszczak stepping in for Edwin van der Sar in goal. It contributed to moments of uncharacteristic uncertainty at the back, with Kuszczak having to rush out to block Jason Roberts from point-blank range after six minutes.</p>
              <p>Tevez wasted a glorious chance to give United the lead three minutes later when he failed to apply the finishing touch to an inviting cross from Wayne Rooney. And Blackburn made them pay after 21 minutes when Morten Gamst Pedersen's throw led to a mix-up between Vidic and Rio Ferdinand, leaving Santa Cruz to slide in his 20th goal of the season from 12 yards.</p>
              <p><img src="http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u189/zomanu/_44583535_cruz_pa416.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><strong>There was more frustration after 42 minutes when Ronaldo rose to meet Ryan Giggs' corner, only to see Friedel produce a fine diving save. It was Giggs' final contribution as he was replaced by fit-again Nani during the interval.</strong></p>
              <p>United, predictably, upped the tempo after the break and they were desperately unlucky not to draw level after 63 minutes when Ronaldo sent an angled long-range drive against an upright. Blackburn somehow survived again with nine minutes left when Rooney set up Ronaldo, who was denied by Johann Vogel's tackle. Tevez turned the loose ball towards goal, but Friedel got a hand to his effort and then snatched the ball off the goal-line.</p>
              <p>And United looked to be denied a penalty when Michael Carrick's goal-bound header clearly struck Brett Emerton on the arm, but once again their claims fell on deaf ears. Brad Friedel was producing heroics to keep them out and valid penalty claims were being refused by referee Rob Styles. Blackburn were under fierce pressure, and once more Friedel was the hero with six minutes left, saving brilliantly from Rooney when he was clean through.</p>
              <p><img src="http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u189/zomanu/_44583662_tevez2_getty416.jpg" alt=""> <img src="http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u189/zomanu/tevocred203.jpg" alt="" width="203" height="152"></p>
              <p><strong>Friedel was turning in an inspirational performance, and he somehow denied substitute John O'Shea from almost on the line as United laid siege to Blackburn's goal. But he could do nothing as United finally got the equaliser they deserved with two minutes left. Nani's corner was flicked on by Paul Scholes and Tevez headed in from six yards to send the United's hordes wild in celebration.</strong></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Tuesday, 29 April 2008</span>  </strong></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p class="first"><strong>Paul Scholes' spectacular strike sent Manchester United into their first Champions League final for nine years on a night of Old Trafford tension.</strong> <strong>Scholes rifled in a spectacular 25-yard effort after 14 minutes to beat Barcelona and set up an all-English clash with Chelsea or Liverpool</strong><strong> in Moscow on 21 May.</strong> </p>
              <p>There was added poignancy and significance in the victory, coming 50 years after the Munich air crash. And for Scholes, suspended for the 1999 final victory against Bayern Munich in Barcelona, it is a chance to make up for that bitter disappointment. United were dealt a double blow before kick-off when Wayne Rooney's hip injury ruled him out and Nemanja Vidic was sidelined by the concussion he sustained at Chelsea.</p>
              <p>And United almost made a nightmare start when Scholes tripped Lionel Messi as he raced into the area - there was only inches in it and fortunately for the home side German referee Herbert Fandel got the big call right and gave a free-kick. It took United time to settle, but Scholes eased their nerves with a thunderous strike to give them the lead in the 14th minute.</p>
              <p>Gianluca Zambrotta's wayward clearance landed at Scholes' feet, and he delivered a trademark rising drive from 25 yards that flew high into the net beyond the outstretched hands of Barcelona keeper Victor Valdes. It was only the second goal Scholes has scored this season - but it was a fitting strike to send United to the final.</p>
              <p>Messi was the real danger man for Barcelona, and he ended a slalom run with a left-foot shot that was turned away by United keeper Edwin van der Sar. United had chances of their own, with Ji-Sung Park side-footing just wide, but Barcelona regained their composure to enjoy a period of superiority, with Deco twice narrowly off target.</p>
              <p>Nani, preferred to Ryan Giggs, wasted a chance to grab the priceless second goal three minutes before the interval when he glanced Park's cross wide from eight yards. Barcelona began the second half with a spell of possession, but it was United who carved out a clear opportunity as Valdes blocked Tevez's close-range drive after 56 minutes.</p>
              <p>The Catalans made a change on the hour, sending on former Arsenal striker Thierry Henry for Andres Iniesta. Barcelona, inspired by the brilliant Messi, had United penned back, but they were resisted by defensive discipline and resilience of the highest class from a side normally noted for their attacking verve.</p>
              <p>United attempted to stem the tide with 13 minutes left by making a double change, with Ryan Giggs and Darren Fletcher replacing Nani and Scholes. Henry almost returned to haunt United with a point-blank header from from Xavi's corner which was gratefully clutched by Van der Sar.</p>
              <p>Barcelona weaved pretty patterns in the closing stages, but United's defence - superbly marshalled by Rio Ferdinand and Wes Brown - stood firm to spark wild scenes of celebration at the final whistle.</p>

              <h1>Ronaldo named player of the year</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="first"><strong>Manchester United winger Cristiano Ronaldo has been named as the Professional Footballers' Association player of the year.</strong></p>
              <p>The 23-year-old wins the award for the second successive season after another outstanding campaign that has seen him score 38 goals in all competitions. "I feel very happy. It is a great moment, it is an honour, a pleasure," said the Portuguese star. Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas picked up the young player of the year award.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo beat off competition from Liverpool duo Fernando Torres and Steven Gerrard, 20-year-old Fabregas and Gunners team-mate Emmanuel Adebayor and Portsmouth goalkeeper David James. The Portugal international was also in the running to scoop the young player of the year award, a feat he achieved last year, but was pipped to the prize by Spain star Fabregas. Torres, Micah Richards, Gabriel Agbonlahor and Ashley Young were the other nominees.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo did not attend the event, as he is busy preparing for Man Utd's Champions League semi-final second leg clash with Barcelona on Tuesday night, but was presented with the award by United manager Sir Alex Ferguson.</p>
              <p>"When you work all season to play good, to do something for the team, and then at the end of the season the PFA give you this award, it is a great motivation to carry on like that, to work more and get better," said Ronaldo. "I feel very good but it is not just my award, my team-mates have helped me a lot this season. "They give me good passes to score goals - and I score - but it is a good moment for me."</p>
              <p>Ronaldo revealed he voted for Arsenal striker Adebayor, but believes the right man walked away with the award. "I voted for Adebayor because I think he has had a great season as well," he said. "But you have many players who have had a good season - Torres, Fabregas, many players. But I think I deserve to win!"</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Manchester United</span> winger Cristiano Ronaldo has won the Football Writers' footballer of the year award for the second consecutive season. The Football Writers' Association (FWA) voted for the Portuguese international ahead <span style="color: #000000;">of Liverpool striker Fernando Torres - who is the Reds' top scorer in his first season in England - and Portsmouth's veteran goalkeeper David James.<br></span></strong><br><span style="color: #000000;">Ronaldo becomes only the second player ever to win back-to-back awards after Arsenal striker Thierry Henry took the prize in 2003 and 2004. The 23-year-old now enters an elite band of only seven players to have won the FWA award more than once in its history.<br><br>Sir Stanley Matthews (1948 and 1963), Sir Tom Finney (1954 and 1957), Danny Blanchflower (1958 and 1961), John Barnes (1988 and 1990) and Gary Lineker (1986 and 1992) join Henry and Ronaldo in the prestigious list.<br><br>The chairman of the FWA Paul Hetherington said: "Ronaldo's award is no surprise after his brilliant form this season and incredible goal-scoring record - 38 at the moment - and he is, of course, essentially a winger. "Cristiano was an overwhelming winner and, given his age, he has the potential and ability to dominate this award for years."<br><br>Ronaldo's form led United to the Premier League title last season. This year the club is on course to repeat that feat if they can win their final two domestic matches and they face Chelsea in the Champions League final in Moscow later this month.</span></p>

              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>When Manchester United finally crossed the finish line yesterday, they did so more with a stumble and a stagger than a swagger. But they crossed it ahead of Chelsea and, for all their good fortune here at Wigan, deservedly so.</strong></p>
              <p>This was an extraordinary contest. One that will be remembered as much for three first half decisions from Steve Bennett as the moment when Ryan Giggs marked his record-equalling appearance with the goal that secured a 10th Barclays Premier League title both for himself and the club he has served with such distinction.</p>
              <p>But the best team in England lifted the trophy at the JJB Stadium and if they now follow this with victory in Moscow next week Sir Alex Ferguson will rate them even higher than that. Not just the finest side of the season but the finest in his 22 years at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Take nothing away from Chelsea. They too have been terrific over the course of the last nine months, somehow overcoming the sudden departure of Jose Mourinho to turn this into the closest title race in years. Credit should go to Avram Grant as well as his remarkable players, and they too will now move on to Moscow all the more determined to deny United a European and domestic double. Determined and, it has to be said, extremely dangerous given their form of recent weeks.</p>
              <p>It is United, however, who ended the league campaign two points ahead of them. United who scored 80 goals to Chelsea's 65. United who seem to possess style and substance in equal measure, striking the kind of balance that has been beyond both Chelsea and Arsenal.</p>
              <p>That said, United struggled to find that balance yesterday. As much as they struggled to compete against a Wigan Athletic side that more than made sure they could never be accused of undermining the integrity of the competition. They were excellent, not only demonstrating how they conquered Aston Villa the previous weekend but how they managed to take what proved two vital points off Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>The sight of Edwin van der Sar diverting a Marcus Bent header over his crossbar had an animated Ferguson on his feet, and when Ferdinand then used his left arm to guide a missile from Koumas away from his goal for a corner United's manager must have been very concerned indeed.</p>
              <p>Then, though, Rooney secured the penalty, Cristiano Ronaldo stepped up and not only exorcised the ghosts of Barcelona but scored his 41st goal of an exceptional season and United started to relax.</p>
              <p>They had just small slice of luck when Bennett then failed to award what would have been a second penalty for United when Titus Bramble, who was otherwise impressive, hacked down Scholes. But it did little to ease the sense of resentment and, let's face it, jealousy.</p>
              <p>As the pitch became heavier, so Ferguson saw the need for change. Off went Scholes and on went Giggs. Not quite in that order but for reasons that Ferguson explained afterwards. While he rightly said Scholes was even more at risk to a second yellow card on a wet surface, he made the point in horse-racing parlance that the poise and balance of Giggs makes him brilliant on 'soft ground'.</p>
              <p>Which, of course, proved to very much be the case when the Welshman who was matching Sir Bobby Charlton's appearance record emerged between Wigan's centre-halves in the 80th minute. No sooner had he received a super pass from Rooney than he was guiding his shot past an advancing Kirkland.</p>
              <p>At that moment Ferguson could not contain his emotion and nor could his players. While Ferguson jumped into the arms of Carlos Quieroz, every player including Van der Sar piled on top of Giggs.</p>
              <p>It was followed, once the trophy had been presented and the medals handed out, by something even rarer than a game without a goal from Ronaldo. A post Premier League match press conference with Ferguson that was actually far more entertaining than the match.</p>
              <p>"I want to thank you all for your brilliant journalism this season," he said. "You've enthralled me with your honesty, your integrity, and your nonsense." "Likewise," came the reply, and after the accusations that were levelled at Bolton on Friday and the claim that, at best, Rooney would start this one on the bench, it was Ferguson who laughed loudest of all.</p>

              <p class="story"><strong>Manchester United painted the Russian capital red, sending their fans partying into Red Square, after an absorbing, draining collision between English heavyweights here. The red theme intensified with a vengeance with Didier Drogba's dismissal for slapping Nemanja Vidic before United prevailed on penalties.</strong></p>
              <p class="story">Cristiano Ronaldo and John Terry both missed in the penalty shoot-out, forcing sudden death, and Nicolas Anelka saw Chelsea's seventh penalty saved.</p>
              <p class="story">United's victory was awash with history. No more fitting tribute to the 50th anniversary of Munich could be imagined than the sight of Ferguson's adventurous young team shining on the European stage. No more appropriate celebration of the 40 years since United first lifted the trophy could be scripted than this triumph for the new holy trinity of Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney and Carlos Tevez.</p>
              <p class="story">For the vanquished Avram Grant, Chelsea's coach now faces an awkward meeting with the club's benefactor, Roman Abramovich, who so craved lifting the trophy on Russian soil. For the defeated dressing-room, questions will inevitably intensify over the future of Drogba and Ricardo Carvalho.</p>

              <p class="story">Wary of Chelsea's central strength, Hargreaves often tucked inside to assist Paul Scholes and Michael Carrick.</p>
              <p class="story">And so the duels began, Ronaldo running at Michael Essien, so quickly and cleverly in the 15th minute that the Ghanaian right-back was left tackling thin air. On Ronaldo sped, whipping in a cross that cleared Rooney and the onrushing Hargreaves. Then came Patrice Evra, also making good ground down United's left before lifting in a cross that Terry just reached ahead of Rooney.</p>
              <p class="story">The England striker briefly lost his temper with Ashley Cole, who had objected to Scholes' involvement in an aerial collision with Claude Makelele that ended with bookings for the two midfielders and urgent medical attention to Scholes' bloodied nose.</p>
              <p class="story">Scholes soon returned to the fray, immediately making a telling contribution. When Ashley Cole conceded a throw-in deep in Chelsea territory, Scholes combined with Wes Brown three times to engineer a magnificent opening. Brown suddenly proved inspired, working the ball on to his left foot as United's attackers made their moves.</p>
              <p class="story">Rooney darted towards the near post, Tevez ventured towards the centre, dragging Chelsea's centre-backs with them, isolating Essien against Ronaldo. As Brown's cross dropped, Ronaldo outjumped Essien, showing power and timing as he met the ball firmly with his head, sending it flying past Cech from 10 yards.</p>
              <p class="story">Chelsea had to come out and attack now, and they stormed forward, blue waves rolling towards Edwin van der Sar's goal as a sensational game moved up a gear. When Drogba headed back Lampard's cross, Michael Ballack pressured Ferdinand into a goalbound header that Van der Sar instinctively clawed away.</p>

              <p class="story"> </p>
              <p class="story"><strong>Both keepers excelled. Now it was Cech's turn to show his prowess, following a United surge of breathtaking brilliance. When Rooney acquired the ball in his own half, he immediately spotted Ronaldo's lung-breaking burst down the left. Rooney found him, triggering a remarkable sequence of events.</strong></p>
              <p class="story">Ronaldo's hard cross was met by the stooping Tevez, whose header drew an unbelievable save from Cech. Terry completed the clearance but only to the edge of the area where Carrick was arriving like the Trans-Siberian Express. The midfielder met the ball sweetly enough, but too close to Cech, who stretched out his right hand and palmed the ball away. "Come on" screamed Cech.</p>
              <p class="story">What a game. Tight? Cagey? No chance. These two Premier League heavyweights kept tearing into each other, a sliding Tevez almost converting a fabulous cross from Rooney. Back came Chelsea, Ballack firing a free-kick over and then came that emotional equaliser for Lampard. The England midfielder began and ended the move, re-directing a Ferdinand clearance to Essien, who charged forward, unleashing a shot that caused havoc in United's area. The ball caught Vidic, and then Ferdinand before falling invitingly for Lampard.</p>
              <p class="story">All that training in the back garden with his father Frank senior, all that developing of technique down the years were made for moments like this. As Ferdinand slid in with a vain attempt to rescue the situation, Lampard's left foot made perfect contact, placing it over the diving Van der Sar.</p>

              <h1>10 Things you need to know about Manchester United's Dimitar Berbatov</h1>
              <p>Mirror.co.uk <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">12/09/2008</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://images.mirror.co.uk/upl/m4/sep2008/9/6/23B31988-F485-5301-565715AEA761395A.jpg" alt="Dimitar Berbatov " width="200" height="302"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Here’s everything you need to know about Man United’s new number 9…</strong></p>
              <p><br> <br><strong>1)</strong> Dimitar Ivanov Berbatov was born in Blagoevgrad, Bulgaria on 30 January 1981. he clearly has sporting genes: mum Margarita was a professional handball player and dad Ivan a professional footballer with CSKA Sofia. Brother Asen also played in Bulgaria.</p>
              <p><strong>2)</strong> When playing football as a kid, he always pretended to be AC Milan striker Marco van Basten. After Euro 96, though, Berbatov became obsessed with Alan Shearer. He was given a Newcastle number nine shirt for his 18th birthday and even used to sleep in it.<br> <br><strong>3)</strong> After starting out with local side Pirin Blagoevgrad, he was spotted by Dimitar Penev – the manager who led Bulgaria to third place in the 1994 World Cup – and joined CSKA Sofia aged 17. Berbatov shared a dorm with five other players when he first arrived and made his CSKA Sofia debut aged 18. He went on to score 14 goals in 27 games in his first season, and won the Bulgarian Cup.</p>
              <p><strong>4)</strong> Nine goals in 11 games for Sofia in 2000-01 attracted Bayer Leverkusen, and Berbatov made his first move abroad in January 2001. He suffered triple disappointment in the 'Neverkusen' team - also featuring Chelsea's Michael Ballack - which finished as runners-up in three competitions.<br> <br><strong>5)</strong> The goals were slow to come in Germany, but when they did, they really flowed. Berbatov’s final two seasons at Leverkusen saw him achieve a phenomenal strike rate of 41 goals in just 67 games. That rich scoring vein earned him a £10.9million move to Tottenham – the highest fee ever paid for a Bulgarian footballer. Ironically, Sir Alex Ferguson also tried to sign him at that stage to replace Ruud van Nistelrooy.</p>
              <p><strong>6)</strong> To date, Berbatov has won only two trophies: the Bulgarian National Cup in his first season, and the Carling Cup with Tottenham last year. Manchester United will be hoping his trophy cabinet starts filling up rapidly, but with skills like this coming into the reigning Premier League champions, he surely can't spend too long empty-handed.</p>
              <p><strong>7)</strong> In his first season at Tottenham he wore an armband with the slogan "You are not alone", campaigning for the release of five Bulgarian nurses sentenced to death in Libya on charges of injecting hundreds of children with HIV in the 1990s. Berbatov is a also goodwill ambassador for Unicef.</p>
              <p><strong>8)</strong> His time at Spurs saw him cement his reputation as one of Europe’s best strikers, capable of scoring some phenomenal goals.</p>
              <p><strong>9)</strong> He made his Bulgarian debut against Greece, aged just 18-years-old. Currently the side’s captain, Berbatov’s gone on to win 47 caps and score 28 goals - bettering the international record of Bulgarian legend Hristo Stoichkov. All Dimitar needs now is a dozen or so trophies and a Ballon d'Or to boot - but at least he is finally in a position to win them.</p>
              <p><strong>10)</strong> He learnt English by watching the Godfather films – which explains why he joined Manchester United. Clearly Fergie made Berbatov an offer he couldn’t refuse... Berbatov also claims that he never swears. So what he’ll make of this foul-mouthed new chant is anybody’s guess (warning: contains bad language)</p>

              <h1>United win race to sign Berbatov</h1>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Manchester United finally completed the $30.75million transfer of Dimitar Berbatov from Tottenham at midnight last night, with manager Sir Alex Ferguson hailing the Bulgarian as one of the best strikers in the world.</strong></p>
              <p>After weeks of ugly and fractious bargaining with Spurs, United finally signed their top summer transfer target with moments to spare before the close of the transfer window.</p>
              <p>United boss Ferguson said: 'This is a key  signing. Dimitar is one of the best and most exciting strikers in the world. His style and ability will give the team a different dimension and I am sure he will be a popular player with the fans.' </p>
              <p>The signing of the 27-year-old on a four-year contract came at the end of a day that saw United's rivals Manchester City have a ?34m offer accepted by Tottenham at lunchtime. </p>
              <p>But Berbatov has only ever wanted to go to Old Trafford and United were so confident of thrashing out the deal with Spurs that they gave the player a medical and agreed personal terms before they had been given permission by the London club.</p>
              <p>Last night Berbatov said: 'Joining Manchester United is a dream come true for me.</p>
              <p>'I look forward to playing my part in helping this club win more honours in the years to come.'</p>
              <p>Berbatov's signing is crucial to Ferguson and will give the option of using a traditional through-the-middle centre forward for the first time since Ruud van Nistelrooy left the club three summers ago.</p>
              <p>Ferguson also hopes he will bring the best out of Wayne Rooney. As part of the deal, young United striker Fraizer Campbell has joined Tottenham on a season-long loan.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><br><strong>GORDON STRACHAN backed magical Manchester United to win the Champions League again.</strong></p>
              <p class="article">Strachan hailed United the best side he had ever faced after Celtic were blitzed. And the Bhoys boss called Wayne Rooney ‘unplayable’ as the Reds ran riot — with Dimitar Berbatov striking twice before Roo finished the job.</p>
              <p class="article">Strachan said: “We’ve played a lot of good teams in the Champions League like AC Milan and Barcelona. “But nobody as good as Manchester United were tonight. It will take some team to stop them from winning this again.</p>
              <p class="article">“They could defend this for the next couple of years. “Wayne Rooney is simply unplayable. We tried to do everything to stop him. “But when you are facing someone like that you just have to hold your hands up and say tonight we have come up against a world class player.”</p>
              <p class="article">Strachan refused to make a big deal out of Berbatov’s two goals looking offside, — as the home side put one foot in the last 16. He said: “I’m not going to scream about that because I know we were well beaten. “That was one of the best performances I’ve come across watching European football.”</p>
              <p class="article">Berbatov admitted he is putting more effort in at United than at Tottenham. He said: “In the past I did have some moments when I was not 100 per cent but here you cannot hide.”</p>
              <p class="article">Boss Alex Ferguson said: “Celtic got us on a really good night.”</p>
