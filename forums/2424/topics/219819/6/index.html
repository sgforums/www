              <p class="small"><em>SEALED WITH A KISS ... Ronaldo</em> </p>
              <p class="small"> </p>
              <p><strong>Cristiano Ronaldo was overcome by joy as he finally got his hands on the prestigious Ballon d'Or trophy in Paris. The Manchester United winger was named as Kaka's successor in the early hours of Tuesday morning.</strong></p>
              <p>On Sunday he was presented with the Ballon d'Or trophy - a golden ball - in a televised ceremony and admitted it was a dream come true.</p>
              <p>''I'm very, very happy,'' he said. ''It's a dream I've had since I was younger, I've always dreamed about winning it one day. ''I'm very moved, very happy and I'd like to take this opportunity to dedicate this trophy to my family, they've helped me get here.</p>
              <p>''I thank my mother, my father ... my close friends. I had a whole list of people I wanted to thank but it's difficult, I can't remember as it's too emotional. ''The trophy is splendid, marvellous, very beautiful. I've waited for this.''</p>
              <p>Of the 96 leading journalists polled, 77 voted Ronaldo as their number one player this year and every one placed him in their top five after he scored 42 goals in United's Premier League and Champions League winning season.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo polled a massive 446 points from a maximum of 480, finishing comfortably ahead of second-placed Lionel Messi (281) and third-placed Fernando Torres (179).</p>
              <p>The 23-year-old even had a tear in his eye as he listened to people pay tribute to his stunning year. ''I'm very touched,'' he said. ''Very moved, I'm very sensitive. ''But I'd like to thank my fellow professionals especially my team-mates without whom I wouldn't have been able to win the Ballon d'Or.</p>
              <p>''It's also thanks to them that I have this award. ''I was 18 when I came to Manchester, very young. I always had great hopes of becoming a great footballer, in Europe and the world and that's what I've always tried to do - to improve year by year.</p>
              <p>''Of course it's not been easy but I don't regret anything that I've done to get here. ''I always dreamed of lifting this trophy and it's thanks to God that I have it now.''</p>

              <p><strong>Cristiano Ronaldo hailed "a dream come true" after becoming the first Premier League star to be named FIFA world player of the year.</strong></p>
              <p>The Manchester United and Portugal winger finished ahead of runner-up <a class="iAs" style="font-weight: normal! important; font-size: 100%! important; padding-bottom: 0px! important; color: darkblue! important; background-color: transparent! important; text-decoration: none! important; border-bottom-style: none! important;" href="/forums/2424/topics/">Lionel Messi</a> of Barcelona, while Liverpool's Spanish striker Fernando Torres was in third place as Ronaldo collected the award at a star-studded gala in Zurich.</p>
              <p>It ends a stunning year for the 23-year-old in which he played the starring role as United won the Premier League, Champions League and Club World Cup.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo received the award from Pele and dedicated it to his family, but also paid tribute to the influence of United manager Sir Alex Ferguson.</p>
              <p>He said: "It is an overwhelming moment, it is a dream come true and I would like to dedicate this to my family. "I'm extremely happy, it's one of the most important moments in my life and I hope I can come back here again.</p>
              <p>"After what I did in 2008, to receive this award is amazing and I feel very proud of this achievement. "But it's also true that the manager always has an important role to play. It was a great season for me and for my club, and the coach was important for me because I learned a lot for him.</p>
              <p>"His experience over so many years is of paramount importance - it's a privilege to have such a great club manager. "This is the climax of a fantastic era for me. I'm happy and proud about what has been done by my team and what we have won.</p>
              <p>"I am lucky to to be part of the history of a club like Manchester United." Torres was honoured to have come third ahead of Kaka, who finished fourth, and Xavi, who was fifth.</p>
              <p>The Liverpool striker said: "Ronaldo and Messi are for sure the two best players in the world and to come next to them is a privilege. "The very fact of being here is a reason to be proud to represent my club and my country. It's a matter of pride to have two Spaniards amongst this group."</p>
              <p>Ronaldo's 31 league goals - 42 in total - won him the European Golden Shoe as the continent's top scorer, and he was also awarded the Ballon d'Or and FIFPro's player of the year.</p>
              <p>The awards are voted for by all countries' head coaches and captains.</p>
              <p>Steven Gerrard finished sixth, Frank Lampard 12th, Didier Drogba 13th, Michael Ballack 14th, Cesc Fabregas 15th, Emmanuel Adebayor 17th and John Terry 21st.</p>
              <p>Premier League players have finished as runner-up before - David Beckham and Thierry Henry both did so twice, while Lampard also came second two years ago - but Ronaldo is the first to take the top prize.</p>
              <p>For his votes, England head coach Fabio Capello's choices mirrored the one-two-three positions but England skipper Terry voted for Xavi first ahead of Torres in second and Ronaldo third.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>Manchester United turned up the heat on Premier League leaders Liverpool and manager Rafael Benitez as they closed the gap at the top of the table with a convincing win against Chelsea at Old Trafford.</strong></p>
              <p>Nemanja Vidic headed United in front in first half injury-time after Dimitar Berbatov flicked on Ryan Giggs' corner. Wayne Rooney then turned in Patrice Evra's cross after 63 minutes to set United on the path to a deserved three points - leaving them five points behind Liverpool with two games in hand.</p>
              <p>Berbatov rounded off the win by grabbing the third from close range four minutes from time, turning in Cristiano Ronaldo's free-kick as United's fans finally sensed their title charge was hitting top gear.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson will regard the victory as the perfect response to public taunts from Liverpool counterpart Benitez that United may be "a little bit scared" at the sight of their great rivals at the Premier League summit.</p>
              <p>United were not at their free-flowing best in a game that was too stop-start to be of the highest quality, but they showed none of the fear Benitez might have been hoping to detect.</p>
              <p>And if this weekend was the start of psychological warfare between Benitez and Ferguson, there is no doubting that it is United's boss who has taken the first round.</p>
              <p>They were vastly superior to a Chelsea side that lacked a cutting edge, despite coach Luiz Felipe Scolari pairing Nicolas Anelka and Didier Drogba together up front after the break.</p>
              <p>It may also make Benitez question the timing and content of his tirade against United and Ferguson - who appeared inspired rather than deflated by the remarks coming from down the East Lancashire Road.</p>
              <p>For Scolari, it was a sobering afternoon when he received further confirmation that he needs to inject threat, particularly in the shape of more width, into his Chelsea side.</p>
              <p>Former Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho watched from the stands in readiness for Inter Milan's Champions League clash with United. He will have been dismayed at how Chelsea failed to trouble Edwin van der Sar and ended up losing so lifelessly.</p>
              <p>Ferguson sprang a selection surprise by leaving Michael Carrick on the bench and choosing to go with veteran Giggs in midfield, while Drogba was handed Chelsea's lone striking role.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><em>Man Utd winger Cristiano Ronaldo attempts to go on a dangerous run but gets upended by Frank Lampard who receives a yellow card</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img id="picture_5" src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/45365000/jpg/_45365654_ronaldo2_pa300.jpg" alt="Carvalho and Ronaldo tussle" width="300" height="300"></p>
              <p><em>Tempers flare shortly before the half hour when Portuguese compatriots Carvalho and Ronaldo tangle and both get booked.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Referee Howard Webb was in the spotlight after Benitez's blast about Ferguson and officials - and he showed his intent to clamp down quickly with a third minute booking for Frank Lampard after he fouled Ronaldo.</p>
              <p>It set the tone for a scrappy first 45 minutes that only truly burst into life in the closing stages as United finally exerted a measure of supremacy.</p>
              <p>Giggs tested Petr Cech with a powerful free-kick that Chelsea's goalkeeper pushed to safety, before referee Webb produced another flurry of yellow cards.</p>
              <p>He booked Chelsea's Jose Bosingwa for a foul on Rooney, quickly followed by Portugal team-mates Ronaldo and Ricardo Carvalho for a penalty area clash.</p>
              <p>Berbatov has yet to win the hearts and minds of Manchester United supporters, and they were frustrated when he wasted their best chance after 30 minutes, shooting tamely at Cech after he had been played in by Rooney.</p>
              <p>John Terry - taunted mercilessly by United's fans as a result of his miss in the penalty shoot-out in the Champions League final - then rescued Chelsea with a brilliant tackle on Ji-Sung Park as he looked poised to slide home Ronaldo's pass.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><em>The hosts appear to take the lead just before the break but a flag-waving assistant sees that Ronaldo's headed effort is ruled out.</em></p>

              <p><em>Fortunately for them the corner is re-taken and Nemanja Vidic arrives at the far post to head the Red Devils into a half-time lead.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There was a flurry of action and controversy in the closing seconds of the half that led to United taking the lead. Ronaldo's header was ruled out from Giggs' cross after Rooney had taken a short corner that went virtually unnoticed by anyone inside the stadium.</p>
              <p>United were furious, but their pain was eased when the re-taken corner from Giggs was flicked on by Berbatov for Vidic to head in at the far post. The diving Cech got a hand on his effort but failed to keep it out.</p>
              <p>It threw the pressure back on Chelsea to take the initiative away from United, and Scolari responded by replacing Deco with Anelka at the restart.</p>
              <p>Chelsea enjoyed a period of possession without posing any serious threat, and were then hit with a killer blow when Rooney added United's second after 63 minutes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img id="picture_8" src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/45365000/jpg/_45365716_rooney3_afp416.jpg" alt="Rooney celebrates with Man Utd's fans" width="416" height="300"></p>
              <p><em>Rooney doubles United's advantage when he meets Patrice Evra's cross and volleys home from between Ashley Cole's legs.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ronaldo's flick released Evra on the left flank, and when his cross avoided Terry and Berbatov, Rooney poked the ball through Ashley Cole's legs to beat Cech.</p>
              <p>It was Evra's last act as he limped off, to be replaced by John O'Shea.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img id="picture_9" src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/45365000/jpg/_45365734_berbatov_getty300.jpg" alt="Berbatov celebrates scoring the third" width="300" height="300"></p>
              <p><em>Dimitar Berbatov seals the win in the 87th minute as Man Utd go third, five points behind leaders Liverpool with two games in hand</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Chelsea never mounted any serious response, and it was no surprise when the unmarked Berbatov slid in Ronaldo's free-kick late on to set the seal on a hugely satisfying afternoon for United and Ferguson.</p>
              <p>It was a statement of intent that will leave the confrontational Benitez and Liverpool looking nervously over their shoulders after a win that would have increased United's belief that they can retain their crown.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p class="first"><strong>Manchester United moved back to the top of the Premier League as a sublime Ryan Giggs goal saw them overcome West Ham.</strong> <strong>The Hammers gave United a stern test but their best chance was an ambitious Carlton Cole chip that was well saved. </strong></p>
              <p>The visitors were not at their free-flowing best but Giggs cut in from the left and curled in a shot to provide the moment of magic needed for the win. The hosts pushed for a leveller but United stood firm to complete a 13th-straight clean sheet in the league. </p>
              <p>The result ended West Ham's run of six league games without a defeat and, despite their good play, they just could not find a way through United's defence. The Hammers showed plenty of the style and vision that boss Gianfranco Zola was famed for in his playing days as they tried to end United's run of seven league wins on the trot.</p>
              <p>That was no mean task considering the visitors had not conceded a goal since 8 November, 2008, but the Upton Park side twice went close in the early stages. A corner fell to Lucas Neill and his well-struck shot from the edge of the area was well held by keeper Edwin van der Sar.</p>
              <p>In-form striker Cole, who was called into the England squad on Saturday, was played through by Jack Collison and, after shrugging off Rio Ferdinand, tried an audacious chip which was easily saved.</p>
              <p>Rising star Collison then wriggled his way into the United box but his lay-off to Cole was just behind the striker and allowed the visitors to clear.</p>
              <p>United were also passing the ball around with their customary ease and authority, although without penetration, and found West Ham's defence in just as stubborn mood as their own.</p>
              <p>Former Hammers player Carlos Tevez was being well-marshalled as the both midfields wrestled for superiority.</p>
              <p>United did come close to a breakthrough when an off-target Paul Scholes strike was diverted goalwards by Cristiano Ronaldo, who saw keeper Robert Green tip the ball over.</p>
              <p>But Sir Alex Ferguson's side pose a threat from every department and it was the veteran skipper Giggs who rolled back the years to put his side ahead after collecting a sweeping Scholes pass.</p>
              <p>He cut inside the diving challenge of Cole and into the Hammers box from the left before curling a low right-footed shot through a crowd of players for his first league goal of the season.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo could have had a penalty late on after a trip by Neill but referee Phil Dowd waved away his appeals.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, the visitors comfortably secured a 1-0 victory - their ninth by that scoreline in the league this season - that lifts them two points clear of rivals Liverpool.</p>

              <p><strong>West Ham manager Gianfranco Zola:</strong><br>"It was a close match. Unfortunately for us they have some great players and if you make a mistake they punish you. "My team is a young team. They are growing up and improving. "I am pleased with what they are doing. We need to give this team time."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Manchester United assistant manager Mike Phelan:</strong><br>"The result was important. "We felt we needed to come here with the experience and with those two (Giggs and Scholes) you don't get much more experience. "The match was great value for money. Both teams attacked and we managed to get the win."</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">MANCHESTER UNITED were labelled ‘The Untouchables’ this week.</h2>
              <p class="article">And you sense it would probably take Eliot Ness and his Chicago gang-busters to stop them as they head inexorably towards an 11th Premier League title.</p>
              <p class="article">It was Arsene Wenger who came up with the ‘Untouchables’ tag.</p>
              <p class="article">But Alex Ferguson preferred ‘Catch Me If you Can’ last night, as that is the gauntlet now laid down to Liverpool and you just cannot see them picking it up.</p>
              <p class="article">There is nothing fake about United’s form, it is all too real. Just like the task facing Rafa Benitez’s men.</p>
              <p class="article">United are five points clear of Liverpool, after a ninth successive League win and 14th consecutive clean sheet.</p>
              <p class="article">Ferguson said: “We are in excellent form. We may not win every game between now and May but that will be our aim. I think we are going to take some beating.”</p>
              <h4>Trickery</h4>
              <p class="article">Last night the champions were two-up inside 30 minutes, thanks to Paul Scholes’ first league goal for 18 months and Dimitar Berbatov’s 12th of the season.</p>
              <p class="article">In the second half Wayne Rooney made a dramatic return after a month-long lay-off, coming on as a 60th-minute sub and scoring with his very first touch.</p>
              <p class="article">At times it was a joy to watch for United fans, with the opening 45 minutes real exhibition stuff.</p>
              <p class="article">The passing and movement were superb, as was the trickery of Cristiano Ronaldo, the vision of Scholes and the subtlety of Berbatov. Carlos Tevez was the terrier snapping away and the rearguard stayed as strong as ever.</p>
              <p class="article">At one stage, just past the half-hour, the ground broke into spontaneous applause at what they were witnessing.</p>
              <p class="article">You have to take into account Fulham’s atrocious away record, which has seen them fail to win away from Craven Cottage all season and score only three goals.</p>
              <p class="article">Yet it was still a match against a top 10 side who have drawn six of their away league games.</p>
              <p class="article">United slipped up another gear here and there is maybe another to go.</p>
              <p class="article">It was an awesome sight for Blackburn boss Sam Allardyce to behold from the stands. His Rovers are at Old Trafford on Saturday.</p>
              <p class="article">Ferguson says he does not know his best team and agonises over his choices and giving the news to those left out. But the football does not seem to change whoever wears the famous red.</p>
              <p class="article">Scholes, of course, has been one of the best to do so in the club’s history.</p>
              <p class="article">He added another golden moment to his glittering career and further proof as to why Ferguson is keeping him on for another season.</p>
              <p class="article">There can be few more potent strikers of the ball from long range than Scholes, in terms of keeping it down and on target.</p>
              <p class="article">It is a dereliction of duty for any side to leave him free and lingering outside the area when a corner is being taken.</p>
              <p class="article">Remember that cracker he scored at Bradford City in 2000, when David Beckham swung the ball out to him and Scholes rocketed a stunner into the net.</p>
              <div class="float-right width-300 padding-left-10 padding-bottom-10 padding-top-10"></div>
              <p class="article"> Here it was a Michael Carrick corner in the 12th minute that found the ginger magician flying in to conjure up a shot.</p>
              <p class="article">Meeting the ball as it fell, he released a stinging, low, swerving volley which Mark Schwarzer got his hands to at full stretch but could not stop spinning back across him and over the line.</p>
              <p class="article">Scholes admitted: “It’s always enjoyable playing in a team producing good football.</p>
              <p class="article">“I hope that’s just the start and I’ll be able to score a few more.” The waves of red attacks were relentless after that.</p>
              <p class="article">If there has been one fault with United this season, it has been their failure to convert huge amounts of pressure into more goals. Nine of their league wins have been by 1-0.</p>
              <p class="article">There would be no such problem this time. They added the second on the half-hour, thanks to some appalling Fulham defending.</p>
              <p class="article">Scholes flicked the ball into the area for John O’Shea to steer across goal. Aaron Hughes was half-asleep as he let Berbatov stroll in behind him to score.</p>
              <p class="article">Berbatov would have another narrowly ruled out for offside before the break, as did Tevez.</p>
              <p class="article">United kept up the ferocious attacking pressure after half-time but struck just once more.</p>
              <p class="article">There was huge roar on the hour when Rooney made his first appearance since hobbling out of the Wigan victory on January 14 with a hamstring injury.</p>
              <p class="article">Inside two minutes, he had scored with his first touch. Park Ji-Sung fired the ball across and Rooney, after seven games out, pounced at the far post.</p>
              <p class="article">Ferguson added: “I’m pleased he’s off and running again. We didn’t rush him back but there’s no doubt he’s 100 per cent fit once more and, hopefully, he will stay that way.”</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Manchester United completed phase two of their bid to secure an historic haul of five major trophies in a season as they beat Spurs on penalties in the Carling Cup final.</strong></p>
              <p>United, with the Club World Cup already won, emerged victorious from another shoot-out after an encounter low on quality finished goalless after extra-time.</p>
              <p>Goalkeeper Ben Foster, given a Wembley opportunity as manager Sir Alex Ferguson rested Edwin van der Sar, was United's hero with a stunning save from Aaron Lennon in normal time.</p>
              <p>Foster distinguished himself with a superb save from Jamie O'Hara's spot-kick, and when substitute David Bentley missed, Spurs' fate was sealed as Anderson confirmed United's victory.</p>
              <p>Cristiano Ronaldo struck an upright seconds from the end of normal time as both defences dominated a final in which clear-cut opportunities were at a premium.</p>
              <p>Ryan Giggs, Carlos Tevez, Ronaldo and Anderson were successful for United from the spot in the shoot-out, but only Vedran Corluka scored for Spurs.</p>
              <p>Keeper Foster, 25, whose fledgling career has been dogged by injury, will have hugely impressed watching England coach Fabio Capello - who is not exactly blessed with quality keepers as he plans for next year's World Cup.</p>
              <p>There was to be no repeat of Spurs' win against Chelsea in last year's final, with boss Harry Redknapp also denied another Wembley win after lifting the FA Cup with Portsmouth last season.</p>
              <p>This was not United at their vintage best, with too much below-par passing, but once again they showed that winning mentality when it mattered and when the pressure was at its most intense.</p>
              <p>Ferguson kept to his promise to maintain faith with youngsters Darron Gibson, Danny Welbeck and Jonny Evans - but his hopes of calling on Wayne Rooney were dashed after the England striker was ruled out by a virus.</p>
              <p>In an enterprising opening, Ferdinand's dipping volley landed just over the bar with Gomes again struggling to make the save.</p>
              <p>As the early life went out of the final, Spurs were able to establish a foothold and create a series of promising openings down the flanks, only to fail to find the decisive final ball.</p>
              <p>Spurs had successfully kept Ronaldo at arm's length, while youngster Welbeck was having a tough time making an impact in the face of the physical presence of Dawson and King.</p>
              <p>Indeed, it only took Ferguson only 10 minutes after the break to decide to remove Welbeck and introduce Anderson into midfield.</p>
              <p>And United came within inches of breaking the deadlock on the hour when Tevez was just off target as he tried to divert Evans' shot past Gomes.</p>
              <p>Foster justified his inclusion with a stunning save from Lennon after 70 minutes after Benoit Assou-Ekotto's cross found him in space 12 yards out.</p>
              <p>The United keeper's opposite number Gomes had been well protected, but he was called in to action to collect a shot from Anderson at the second attempt.</p>
              <p>John O'Shea, who had been fortunate to escape a second yellow card for a tackle on Luka Modric that went unpunished, was replaced by Nemanja Vidic as Ferguson stiffened up United's central defence.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo almost won the cup for United in the dying seconds of stoppage time when he cut inside and lashed in a shot that bounced off the upright with Nani unable to turn in the rebound.</p>
              <p>It meant extra time - and the inevitable introduction of Ryan Giggs for the tiring Gibson.</p>
              <p>Lennon had been at the heart of most of Spurs' best moments, but he had run himself to a standstill and it was no surprise when he was replaced by Bentley 10 minutes into extra-time.</p>
              <p>Giggs gave United the perfect start in the shoot-out, and Foster set up the win with a fine save from O'Hara's spot-kick.</p>
              <p>Tevez and Corluka exchanged successful penalties, but Bentley sent his wide after Ronaldo had slotted his away.</p>
              <p>Anderson stepped forward to complete the formalities and United had achieved the second part of their pursuit of the five major trophies on offer to them this season.</p>

However, while his shot was too much for Heurelho Gomes, it also flashed wide of the Brazilian's left-hand post.<br><br>Ferdinand was also a mere couple of inches away with a dipping volley that nestled on the roof of Tottenham's net.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Nani had the best chance though, letting fly with a snap-shot that threatened to creep in at the corner, only for Gomes to get down to make a fine save at the near post.<br><br>Unfortunately for Roman Pavlyuchenko, he could not locate his radar at half-time. He skied a terrible free-kick way over the crossbar and while his effort could not be faulted, it was no surprise when he made way for O'Hara.<br><br>Cristiano Ronaldo finally broke free of his shackles and crashed a brute of a shot against the post with almost the last kick of normal time.<br><br>Tevez glanced an extra-time header just wide, with Darren Bent drawing an excellent feet-first save out of Foster later on. But there was no salvation from the penalty lottery which both teams have profited from over the past 12 months.<br><br>This time, it was United's turn. Foster emerged the hero with a save to deny O'Hara and Bentley's miss, combined with Anderson making it four out of four from the spot for the Red Devils, meant the trophy headed to Manchester.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Manchester United fans formed a huge mural from placards before kick-off, spelling out the word "BELIEVE’’, as if confidence could ever possibly be a problem for an untouchable set of players who are champions of England, Europe and the world.</strong></p>
              <p>Each of Sir Alex Ferguson’s players believes in himself, in his team-mates and in the manager. Stars like Wayne Rooney and Dimitar Berbatov were rested but the belief remained in the red shirts. Such faith guided United through squalls of high pressure whipped up by the outstanding Luka Modric and Aaron Lennon. Such poise helped United negotiate a penalty shoot-out with ease, the safe hands of Ben Foster assisting United in getting their eager hands on the trophy.</p>
              <p>The Carling Cup may appear small beer when set against United’s intoxication with more celebrated chalices, notably the Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup, but there was an undeniable thirst for victory here. United’s DNA ensures they give everything in every game. Ferguson’s men wanted to lift this trophy, and keep the momentum going. One down, three to go. Sunday was all about Carling, Foster and dreams of a four-pack.</p>
              <p>After two hours of interesting but not compelling action, the assurance that flows with the red blood and adrenalin through United veins was particularly evident. Their spot-kick hopes heightened by winning the toss to have the shootout staged in front of their fans, United were brutal in executing their dead-ball duties.</p>
              <p>Ryan Giggs stepped up first, a picture of concentration on St David’s Day, a model professional still shining on the eve of the 18th anniversary of his debut. Giggs’ penalty flew in off a post and any belief drained from Tottenham. Poor Jamie O’Hara, Spurs first taker, resembled a man heading towards a firing squad.</p>
              <p>His left foot made strong enough contact but it was at an inviting height for Foster, who pushed it away. Omitted from Spurs’ triumphant team here last year, O’Hara’s eyes again reddened. But when the tears dry, this versatile, highly promising young footballer should reflect that it was his semi-final performance at Burnley that carried the holders back to Wembley.</p>
              <p>As the United camp celebrated O’Hara’s error, one of their number remained unmoved. Ferguson stood there, unflinching. Like any great leader, Ferguson exudes control at the most tense of times. His players looked at their manager and drew even more belief.</p>
              <p>Carlos Tevez broke away from the band of United brothers on the halfway line and made the long walk to the spot. It was the only time the livewire Argentinian did not run all afternoon. Tevez’s non-stop movement, creating chances, linking play, even tracking back, was astonishing, particularly when lesser frames were succumbing to cramp. Gomes was beaten with an irresistible low penalty.</p>
              <p>Vedran Corluka kept Spurs in contention, making light of the pressure with an emphatic strike down the middle, but Cristiano Ronaldo immediately restored United’s advantage.</p>
              <p>At 3-1 down, the spotlight burned fiercely on Spurs. David Bentley marched into the limelight confidently enough. His kick was poor, sent scurrying into the hoardings. The ever-confident Anderson completed the coup de grace with an unstoppable kick past Gomes, one Brazilian beating another.</p>
              <p>A cynic might argue that the sight of two white-shirted Englishmen, O’Hara and Bentley, missing penalties was good practice for Fabio Capello but the watching England manager will also have been buoyed by the work of Foster. With two exceptional earlier saves, from Lennon and Darren Bent, Foster confirmed his right to be considered the eventual successor to David James with England and Edwin van der Sar for United. No wonder Ferguson spoke so enthusiastically about Foster afterwards.</p>
              <p>As Foster and company partied on the pitch, Ferguson, a figure of real dignity, sought to console Harry Redknapp and his vanquished players. As Spurs returned last night to their Berkshire base empty-handed and broken-hearted, their hotel, the castle-like Oakley Court, must have lived up to its old setting for Hammer House of Horror films.</p>
              <p>Modric, a pocket dynamo of Croatian guile, had not deserved to lose. Ditto Didier Zokora, tireless from box to box. Lennon was similarly involved, giving Patrice Evra an exhausting afternoon. Redknapp had set Spurs up well, 4-4-2 with a tweak, the team anchored by the Zokora while Modric drifted in from the left.</p>
              <p>Ferguson’s version of 4-4-2 saw the industrious Tevez working off Danny Welbeck, the Argentinian delivering such a prodigious shift that he was even tackling back by his corner-flag to dispossess Modric. Yet such is the flexibility in United’s ranks, and the depth of their resources, that Ferguson switched seamlessly to 4-3-3 and eventually 4-2-4.</p>
              <p>Eye-catching duels broke out all over the pitch, not only Lennon’s constant eluding of Evra but Ronaldo’s far more even contest with Benoit Assou-Ekotto. Another duel involved Paul Scholes continuing to confound Father Time, United’s 34-year-old midfielder delivering some sublime cross-field passes. With such talent on view, chances arrived. Darron Gibson, Nani, Rio Ferdinand and Tevez went close for United but so did Jermaine Jenas and Bent for Spurs.</p>
              <p>The game’s flow had been maintained by Chris Foy’s sympathetic handling but the St Helens referee, who has been enjoying a good season, erred badly midway through the second half by failing to brandish a second yellow to John O’Shea for clattering Modric. Foy then booked Ronaldo for diving when he had clearly been brought down by Ledley King inside the box. Reputation, not reality, was punished here.</p>
              <p>Extra time was almost avoided but Foster thwarted Lennon and then a post frustrated Ronaldo. United’s nerve held during the shootout. As their coach pulled out of Wembley, it encountered traffic heading towards the nearby Arena for a reality TV show. United have an X-Factor of their own: belief.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Cristiano Ronaldo was sent off as Wayne Rooney's 100th club goal proved enough to give Manchester United a derby win.</strong></p>
              <p>United were dominant early on but Manchester City came closest to scoring when Stephen Ireland grazed a post.</p>
              <p>Rooney followed up Michael Carrick's shot to break the deadlock before Ronaldo was sent off for a second booking after inexplicably handling.</p>
              <p>Richard Dunne almost levelled but saw his shot cleared off the line before Joe Hart kept out a late Rooney lob. &lt;!-- E SF --&gt;</p>
              <p>Hart, who had joined City's attack for an injury-time corner, ran the length of the pitch as United broke and got back to his goal just in time to deny Rooney his second goal of the game.</p>
              <p>The home side had come close to equalising seconds earlier when Patrice Evra did brilliantly to block Dunne's effort but United were still convincing winners.</p>
              <p>Although they were against 10 men for the last 20 minutes following Ronaldo's dismissal, Dunne's shot was the only time City came close to breaking down a well-organised United defence in that period.</p>
              <p>And Sir Alex Ferguson's side had been just as impressive going forward for the majority of the match.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/45254000/jpg/_45254882_handball_getty282.jpg" alt="Ronaldo inexplicably handles the ball" width="226" height="282"></p>
              <div><em>Cristiano Ronaldo inexplicably handled the ball from a Wayne Rooney corner</em></div>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The only blemish on an otherwise perfect day for Ferguson was Ronaldo's red card, which came after an inexplicable handball by the Portuguese winger.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo had already been booked for bringing down Shaun Wright-Phillips and, when he almost caught Rooney's corner at the near post less than 10 minutes later, referee Howard Webb had no choice but to dismiss him.</p>
              <p>It was a bizarre incident but did not take the shine off an impressive display by the visitors.</p>
              <p>While City began nervously, United were into their stride from the start and could have been out of sight by the end of a one-sided first half.</p>
              <p>Dimitar Berbatov, operating behind the marauding Rooney, tormented the City defence in the early stages, while Evra and Rafael da Silva were constant threats on either flank.</p>
              <p>But, for all their possession, a goal continued to elude United.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo nodded over from a corner, Hart brilliantly pushed a Berbatov header round the post and Evra blazed over when his own cross was cleared back to him in the box.</p>
              <p>It took City over half an hour to create any sort of opening but, when it came, they should really have taken the lead.</p>
              <p>A whipped Javier Garrido free-kick was only cleared as far as Ireland, who fired the ball goalwards with United keeper Edwin van der Sar out of position.</p>
              <p>Ireland's shot bounced towards Micah Richards, who was stood in front of the net, but instead of turning it home the defender left the ball and it hit the outside of the post.</p>
              <p>That sparked City's best spell of the first-half, with Robinho inches away from collecting Didi Hamann's slide-rule pass in front of goal, but United remained dangerous and it was no surprise when they scored after 42 minutes.</p>
              <p>The home side had plenty of opportunities to clear the ball but instead it fell for Carrick to fire in a low shot that Hart could only parry into the path of Rooney, who converted with glee for his 100th club goal.</p>
              <p>Ferguson's side continued to get plenty of men behind the ball and even Ronaldo's dismissal did not help the home side, who looked to have run out of ideas before Dunne's late chance came and went.</p>
              <p>The scoreline would have reflected the game far better had Rooney scored with his audacious injury-time lob and, in truth, the match perfectly illustrated the gulf in class between the two sides that City's wealthy new owners Abu Dhabi United are hoping to narrow.</p>

              <p><strong>Jose Mourinho hugged Sir Alex Ferguson at the final whistle but it was really the only time that Inter Milan got to grips with Manchester United. Mourinho’s team went out of Europe with a whimper, not a bang, and Old Trafford serenaded them on their way with chants of "bye, bye Mourinho’’ and "you’re not special any more’’.</strong></p>
              <p>As an audition for any future vacancy here, Mourinho disappointed. Headers from Nemanja Vidic and Cristiano Ronaldo guaranteed the champions’ progression to the quarter-finals. Serie A’s reputation for tough, organised defending took a real knock here as United’s goals, particularly Vidic’s, were avoidable.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i133.photobucket.com/albums/q60/zocos/vid-1.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><img src="http://i133.photobucket.com/albums/q60/zocos/vid2.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><em>Vidic heads in the opener for Man Utd against Inter Milan</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>When the Serb scored, United had the initiative and Wayne Rooney, particularly, was superb, whether charging through the middle or keeping the excellent Maicon occupied on the flank in the second half. Rooney was sought out for an embrace by Mourinho, a picture of frustration by the end.</strong></p>
              <p>As well as moaning about the amount of time added on at the end (only two minutes which seemed about right), Mourinho also complained about the ball, a special one dedicated to United as European champions. Uefa politely reminded the Inter coach that he could choose the ball when his team won the competition.</p>
              <p>Although more enterprising than in the San Siro, Inter still failed to impress and only Javier Zanetti and Maicon deserved any praise. Arguably, the most convincing performance from someone with Inter connections was when Mourinho had entered this famous arena.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/45558000/jpg/_45558792_mourinho226x170.jpg" border="0" alt="Inter Milan coach Jose Mourinho during his side's 2-0 defeat to Man Utd" width="226" height="170">
              <div class="cap"><em>Mourinho could not repeat the success he has had at Old Trafford in the past</em></div>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The show had begun even before kick-off with Mourinho, breaking off from embracing Carlos Tevez in the tunnel, marching on his own down the touchline, milking the mix of applause and many jeers tumbling forth from the United faithful. It was a piece of pure theatre from the Special One, who will have particularly enjoyed the song accompanying his every step towards the dug-out - "This Is The One’’. His smile soon disappeared.</strong></p>
              <p>Within five minutes, United were ahead, exploiting a major tactical weakness Mourinho had inexplicably saddled his team with. Inter’s inexperienced left-back, David Santon, was forced to face Ronaldo, the European Footballer of the Year, with no shielding midfielder. Mario Balotelli, the teenaged striker, started on the left tucked in behind Zlatan Ibrahimovic but rarely tracked back. Poor Santon.</p>
              <p>Mourinho rejigged at the break, inserting Sulley Muntari in front of Santon and pushing Balotelli up but United had the lead by then and were swiftly to add another. Santon, a hugely promising defender, was desperately exposed in the first period. Ronaldo, sensing vulnerability, began running at the full-back, soon winning a fifth-minute corner that bring such substantial reward.</p>
              <p>Ryan Giggs jogged across to the flag as his team-mates began moving into position. As United’s captain curled the ball across, men in red shirts sought to escape those in black-and-blue. Vidic’s move was the most decisive, the Serb twice checking his run to throw Patrick Vieira off the scent. A yard of space gained, Vidic flicked his header imperiously into the goal. Once again, the modern tendency to position defenders on only one post was punished.</p>
              <p>The Stretford End loved it, taunting Mourinho and particularly Vieira, the midfielder who enjoyed a scrap or three here during his Arsenal days. United’s players were determined to ram their message home, grabbing a second but Giggs promptly wasted a glorious chance.</p>
              <p>Inter briefly took confidence. Javier Zanetti, usually an influence on the major occasions, began to control midfield. Maicon, the Brazilian full-back, started to raid down the right. Ibrahimovic, the spearhead of Inter’s 4-1-2-2-1 formation, at last hinted at some substance to all the hype, troubling Rio Ferdinand and Vidic. From one Maicon free-kick, the tall Swedish international headed goalwards, the ball bouncing down and up before hitting the bar and flying over.</p>
              <p>Before Ronaldo’s header relaxed United’s supporters, Inter enjoyed a period of hope. Ibrahimovic set up Dejan Stankovic, whose right-foot shot was pushed away by Edwin van der Sar at full stretch.</p>
              <p>United needed another goal to settle them. Giggs and Rooney combined brilliantly to send O’Shea through, the Irishman having only Julio Cesar to beat. Inter’s keeper seemed to have made O’Shea’s task easier by diving early, inviting the Irishman to dink the ball over him. Instead, O’Shea elected to side-foot the ball low and the Brazilian saved.</p>
              <p>Reprieved, Inter went on the attack again. Stankovic threatened. Then Ibrahimovic, unrecognisable from his first-leg anonymity, shot wide. Van der Sar denied Maicon. United weathered the storm and Ferguson’s inspired tactical tweak at the interval helped them move further clear.</p>

              <p><em>A chipped cross from Wayne Rooney finds the head of Cristiano Ronaldo just after the break and the hosts find themselves 2-0 up</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>To stifle Maicon, Ferguson pulled Rooney back to left midfield, pushing Giggs through the middle in support of Dimitar Berbatov, who had hurt himself in the warm-up but continued. Within four minutes, Ferguson’s switch had paid off. When Giggs dribbled across the box, Rooney cleverly made himself available on the left.</strong></p>
              <p>Possession received, Rooney wrongfooted Maicon and chipped the ball into area. Berbatov was offside but Ronaldo had timed his run perfectly, meeting Rooney’s delivery and heading irresistibly past Julio Cesar.</p>
              <p>Facing the exit, Mourinho threw on another striker, Adriano, who immediately hit the post with a volley.</p>
              <p>Luis Figo then appeared but Inter’s attack lacked focus. The shooting was poor, Ibrahimovic back to his profligate worst. Ferguson’s Maicon plan was working, the full-back largely pegged back by the supreme work-rate of Rooney. Under the approving gaze of Fabio Capello, the England international was tireless up and down the left, although one challenge on Maicon brought a deserved caution.</p>
              <p>The life really began to drain from Inter, the visitors going down without a struggle. Only Maicon and Zanetti fought against the fading of the light for the Italian champions. Ibrahimovic disappeared. Adriano lacked the real athleticism to alarm Ferdinand or Vidic. Figo was playing from memory, albeit magnificent ones.</p>
              <p>As United headed towards the quarter-final draw a week tomorrow, Inter return to securing Serie A and intensifying speculation about the future of Mourinho.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson last night thanked 17-year-old rookie striker Federico Macheda for turning a thrilling Barclays Premier League title race back in Manchester United's favour after an incredible 3-2 victory at Old Trafford.</strong></p>
              <p>United looked to be heading for a dispiriting 2-2 draw after struggling all afternoon against Aston Villa when Italian centre forward Macheda scored a sensational winning goal three minutes into added time on his debut for the first team.</p>
              <p>United manager Ferguson said: 'Through this result, the season could change for us. We are top of the league again and that's where we want to be. I think our blip is over now.</p>
              <p>'It was a great goal and I have just said "well done" to him. It is important to keep his feet on the ground but there is no doubt at all about how important his goal was.'</p>

              <p><strong>United were trailing 2-1 with 10 minutes to go and looked set to hand rivals Liverpool an unexpected boost after Rafael Benitez's team won at Fulham to go top on Saturday.</strong></p>
              <p>But a goal from Cristiano Ronaldo - his second of the game - set United up for a rousing finish and Macheda completed the comeback at the death to leave Ferguson's team a point clear of Liverpool once more with a game in hand.</p>
              <p>Macheda, who has been at Old Trafford for 18 months after arriving from Lazio in September 2007, said: 'It has always been my dream to make my debut and score a goal like this.'</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em><img src="http://i133.photobucket.com/albums/q60/zocos/dad.jpg" alt=""></em></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>That's my boy: Macheda enjoys an emotional encounter in the stands with his father Pascuale.</em></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>The teenager dashed into the crowd after he had scored to hug his father, Pascuale, and later it emerged he should have been on duty with the Italy Under 19 squad but Ferguson had stopped him going and put him on the bench.</strong></p>
              <p>The champions have the initiative once again and Ferguson believes that yesterday afternoon bore similarities to a game against Sheffield Wednesday in 1993 when United scored two late goals to win a game they looked like losing and went on to claim the title.</p>
              <p>Ferguson added: 'We have a much more mature team this time but there are comparisons. In terms of drama it certainly equals it. 'We took risks but that is part of football. This club has been built on that for a long, long time. I love the thrill of it.'</p>
              <p>United now turn their attention to the Champions League quarter-final first leg at home to Porto tomorrow night. But Ferguson said: 'I believe the winner of the European tie between Chelsea and Liverpool will be our biggest threat.'</p>
              <p>Villa manager Martin O'Neill was unhappy referee Mike Riley played five minutes added time. O'Neill said: 'Even the great Sir Alex Ferguson needs a slice of luck but he does not need linesmen and referees helping him every single week.'</p>

              <p class="article">If United go on to lift their 11th Premier League title, this was the moment it was won. </p>
              <p class="article">The moment Federico Macheda went from ‘Who?’ to ‘hero’.</p>
              <p class="article">Make no mistake, this was the result that will give a turbo-boost to the stuttering Red Devils and send them flying again. It was an echo of Sheffield Wednesday almost 16 years ago to the day. </p>
              <p class="article">United fans still punch the air with glee at the thought of Steve Bruce heading home two goals in the closing moments of their home match with Trevor Francis’ side in the inaugural Premiership season. </p>
              <p class="article">Just like back then, United had been wobbling, coming into the tie against the Owls on a run of a defeat, three draws and one win. They were a goal down heading into injury time and their former boss Ron Atkinson — challenging for the title, coincidentally with Aston Villa — was rubbing his hands. </p>
              <p class="article">Then Bruce stooped to conquer. Big Ron was there yesterday to see United pull another incredible victory out of the fire again. After that win over Wednesday, United won their last five games to clinch their first title in 26 years. </p>
              <p class="article">Now after two straight defeats, they are back in the box seat, back on top of Liverpool by a point with a game in hand and eight left to play. The celebrations that followed the goals from Bruce and Macheda were not dissimilar either. </p>
              <p class="article">Who can forget Brian Kidd’s leap and Fergie’s air-punching jig. Yesterday, there was mania throughout Old Trafford. High in the directors’ box, the injured Rio Ferdinand was leaping about shouting and hollering. </p>
              <p class="article">Chief executive David Gill was waving his clenched fists demonically. The 17-year-old Macheda — making his first senior appearance after coming on as a 61st-minute sub — was engulfed by his team-mates and blew kisses to his family.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">At the final whistle, Alex Ferguson leapt into the arms of No 2 Mike Phelan and then marched towards the Stretford End. </p>
              <p class="article">The thunder of his footsteps and the pounding roar that shook this famous ground will have been heard all the way down the East Lancs Road to Anfield. Anyone who questions why the Premier League is the greatest league in the world and United the most watched team, need only have taken in this weekend’s games. </p>
              <p class="article">Yossi Benayoun strikes two minutes into injury time to rescue a 1-0 win at Fulham and put Liverpool back on top. Then 24 hours later, United come back from 2-1 down with Macheda’s winner also coming two minutes into stoppage-time. Short of five players and struggling with form, it was a game they should never have won. </p>
              <p class="article">They took the lead against the run of play when a back-pass from James Milner was collected by Brad Friedel and an indirect free-kick awarded. By the time ref Mike Riley had sorted out the wall and everyone else it was the 14th minute and Ryan Giggs laid it off to Cristiano Ronaldo to scoop into the far top corner. </p>
              <p class="article">Villa got a deserved equaliser on the half-hour. Gareth Barry did superbly to win a high ball and avoid two United players to fire over a cross for John Carew to head home. </p>
              <p class="article">And Villa took the lead on 58 minutes. Ronaldo was forced off the ball by Stiliyan Petrov who fed Carew. His chipped cross found Patrice Evra and Nani taking root and Gabriel Agbonlahor flew in to meet it and score with his head. </p>
              <p class="article">Those Villa fans who had been giving Agbonlahor stick of late were suddenly cheering his name again. At this point Villa were all over United. They should have had more but they were happy to sit back and just let two or three go forward to try and force another goal. </p>
              <p class="article">The champions were level on 80 minutes through Ronaldo. Fed by Michael Carrick, he slid an inch-perfect shot through a crowd and beyond Friedel’s dive.</p>
              <p class="article">While his players celebrated Fergie simply swung his arm, ordering them back to their own half. In his eyes United have never salvaged a draw, they have just set themselves up for a last-gasp win. </p>
              <p class="article">What a goal to win it, too. Plucked from the Lazio youth set-up, Macheda was plunged into United’s academy two years ago and then promoted to the reserves. </p>
              <p class="article">The kid nicknamed Kiko grabbed a hat-trick in the 3-3 draw with Newcastle reserves last Monday. But yesterday on the big stage, with his back to goal on the edge of the area, he turned Luke Young and placed a curling drive beyond Friedel. </p>
              <p class="article">What a goal, what a moment.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Football, bloody hell.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>As Manchester United fans twirled their scarves above their heads, as Porto’s fortress finally fell to British opposition, Ronaldo’s majestic early strike will live long in the memory.</strong></p>
              <p>The advantage gained, United played with great discipline, rarely risking possession, and restricting Porto to few attempts on goal as they progressed to a semi-final with Arsenal, conquerors of Villarreal. Throughout the season, Sir Alex Ferguson has made polite noises about Arsene Wenger, the suspicion being that the United manager did not consider Arsenal a real threat. Real friendship or phoney war? We shall shortly find out.</p>
              <p>United will certainly relish the challenge, having responded superbly to the task of gaining the result they required, and ending Porto’s 22-game unbeaten run at home against British opposition. If Ronaldo will claim the headlines, United’s victory was rooted in the will to win of men like Ryan Giggs and Wayne Rooney, attackers who helped out defensively all the time. Rooney, all deft feet and the heart of a lion, continues to mature marvellously on the grand stages.</p>
              <p>Even the delights of a day spent in the port-houses that cascade down the hill to the inky Douro could not compete with the joy that had intoxicated the United supporters after eight minutes here. Ferguson’s side had started brightly enough, Wayne Rooney looking lively down the right, Dimitar Berbatov showing some neat touches upfront and Anderson snapping into tackles in midfield, but there had been little indication of the thunderbolt to come.</p>
              <p>Only the weather had hinted at such a stunning development: hail lashed against the roof of this magnificent stadium while United fans clung to their scarves as the wind and the rain buffeted them. Then came Ronaldo, unleashing that lightning strike, conjuring up the type of exceptional goal that saw him crowned European Footballer of the Year.</p>

              <p>Picking up possession 35 yards out, Ronaldo was afforded far too much room. Maybe Porto did not expect him to let fly from such a distance. Maybe their centre-halves, Rolando and Bruno Alves, had not anticipated one of the world’s most accomplished wingers being deployed through the middle.</p>
              <p>Yet this was a tactic Ferguson used to good effect in winning the Champions League last year, against Roma en route to Moscow and against Chelsea in the final itself. Ronaldo’s aerial strength always makes him a menace in the central acres yet here he was deep and with the ball at his feet. Neither Rolando nor Bruno Alves stepped out to tackle the problem. Nor was Porto’s anchorman, Fernando, alive to the danger.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo was hardly waiting for an ambush party to gather. Catching the ball powerfully with his right, United’s No 7 sent his shot flying from right to left past the startled Helton. Porto’s keeper had constantly denied United at Old Trafford but was helpless here. Hardly surprising: Ronaldo’s shot hit 64mph as it sped into the net.</p>
              <p>As befits a player proud of his Sporting Lisbon heritage, Ronaldo relished the sight of Porto’s net almost being ripped from the stanchions. Every one of his touches had drawn derision from the Dragao terraces so the moment was all the sweeter. Once again, Ferguson’s strategy had been vindicated, particularly with Rooney delivering a prodigious shift on the right, tracking back to make tackles by United’s corner-flag as well as charging forward.</p>
              <p>Porto rallied. Lisandro tested Edwin van der Sar with an overhead kick but little was seen in the first half of the slick Porto movement that had so alarmed United at Old Trafford. Unlike last week, the champions of Europe were playing with steel as well as élan. Michael Carrick made some important challenges. Even Berbatov put in a tackle.</p>
              <p>Here was the performance that Ferguson had demanded, brimming with organisation, adventure and an appreciation of the need not to concede possession. Ahead on aggregate, United remained acutely aware of the reality that a Porto goal swung the tie back in the hosts’ favour.</p>
              <p>So they hunted stealthily for a second. When the elusive Berbatov crossed from the right, Ryan Giggs met the ball first-time, bringing a scrambled save from Helton.</p>
              <p>At times operating as 4-2-4, their width keeping Porto’s full-backs pinned back, United also displayed real character to go with their attacking zeal. When Rooney tried to race away from Fernando, the England striker took a nasty chop to the ankle from the Porto ball-winner. Refusing to leave his team, United hobbled on, eventually running the knock off.</p>
              <p>United finished the half toying with Porto. First, John O’Shea flicked on a Giggs corner and Nemanja Vidic missed a straightforward chance from close in. Then a wonderful passing move, including a sublime flick from Rooney, was ended only by Helton speeding from his line to spoil the United fun.</p>
              <p>At the break, Ferguson told TV that "we have to go for that second goal’’, pointing out Porto’s quality. Yet as the clock ticked down, nerves rose within local hearts. Ball-boys threw balls back more quickly, passes went astray such was Porto’s haste and occasional spiteful tackles flew in on Ronaldo. United, though, faced a real challenge.</p>
              <p>One slip spelled oblivion. Mariano escaped Rio Ferdinand to send a header floating wide. Hulk drilled in a free-kick that Van der Sar held comfortably. United seemed to be soaking up the intermittent pressure, with Berbatov parading their committed nature with another tackle.</p>
              <p>The Bulgarian was tiring so Ferguson withdrew him halfway through the second period, introducing Nani. United were now 4-2-3-1 and a real variety act: their attack was formed by three players more associated with wing-play and a centre-forward, Rooney, stationed wide.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #003580;">Manchester United</span> midfielder Ryan Giggs paid tribute to Sir Alex Ferguson after being named PFA Player of the Year. Giggs, 35, had picked up the young player's award twice before and has now been awarded the top accolade by his fellow professionals following his exemplary season, which looks likely to end with his 11th Premier League title. Ferguson has been credited with nurturing Giggs and the Welshman was quick to thank his boss.</strong></p>
              <p>'The manager has been massive in my career from when I first met him when I was 13,' Giggs said. 'That's over 20 years and he knows me better than anyone and our relationship has been brilliant and just gets better.</p>
              <p>'I've been so fortunate to have such a great career in so many great teams, it's not even worth thinking about what it would have been like without the manager.'</p>
              <p>Giggs has only started 12 league games this season but has been a regular in the squad for all competitions, with the award acknowledging the respect he has from opponents. </p>
              <div class="relatedItemsTopBorder">If he plays against Arsenal in the Champions League semi-final first leg this week, it will be his 800th appearance for United, although the landmark is not as important to him as adding to his trophy haul.</div>
              <div class="relatedItemsTopBorder"> </div>
              <p>'It's an exciting season,' he said. 'I think it is going to go right to the wire, there's big game after big game now. That is what you want and need at a club like Manchester United.'</p>

              <p><strong>The Welshman has started taking his coaching badges, which may be a hint at the future, but he added: 'As long as I'm getting picked, enjoying it and injury-free, I'll carry on as long as I can. At 35 you can't look too far into the distance, you just can't.'</strong></p>
              <p>Aston Villa winger Ashley Young picked up the Young Player of the Year award and believes it is a sign of the progress his club have made this season.</p>
              <p>'It's a massive achievement for the club and my team-mates around me,' Young said. 'It's a great honour and I'm delighted.'</p>
              <p>John McDermott, the former Grimsby player who spent 20 years at the club, was given the Merit award for his services to the game. 'I thought it was one of the lads winding me up, a real shock,' he said. 'To still be recognised, I was flattered and honoured.'</p>
              <p>The PFA divisional team of the year has six United players and also included Chelsea striker Nicolas Anelka, who was in goalscoring form until the votes were cast but has not found the net since February. Portsmouth right-back Glen Johnson was also included.</p>

              <p><strong>Ryan Giggs no longer starts enough games to be an obvious choice for PFA player of the year, but as Sir Alex ­Ferguson has just said, you won't find many professional footballers who begrudge him the honour. </strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span></a><strong>'s captain for the day could easily win next year's award at this rate. Only the fact that he will not be allowed to play </strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/middlesbrough"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Middlesbrough</strong></span></a><strong> every week appears to be preventing him ending up like a more decorated version of Sir Stanley Matthews.</strong></p>
              <p>The 35-year-old played his 800th game in midweek, and celebrated his 801st with the goal that set United on their way to a victory that will almost certainly ensure that an 11th <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague"><span style="color: #005689;">Premier League</span></a> medal is added to the groaning Giggs collection. He scored in the game that won United the 1996 title at this ground, too, though he is not taking anything for granted this season just yet.</p>
              <p>"Liverpool won't give up, so we just keep concentrating on the games still to come," Giggs said. "It's been a memorable week for me, but I just go from game to game too. Playing central midfield isn't too much of a problem when you've got young legs around you."</p>
              <p>Giggs certainly had willing workers either side, in Wayne Rooney and Ji-Sung Park, as he floated like a butterfly in midfield, though despite his manager's assertion that United knew they would be in for a battle, it was the failure of the home side to engage in anything remotely like combat that made Giggs's afternoon such a comfortable one. Full-blooded relegation scraps ought to be no place for old men, but Middlesbrough don't do full-blooded or scraps. Just ­relegation, on this evidence.</p>
              <p>Gareth Southgate's team are atypical strugglers, which is precisely why they struggle. They are not stodgy or ­physical opponents, never in your face, and though they can sometimes lift themselves to beat a team of Liverpool's calibre, as they did a couple of months ago, rarely do they show much aggression or fight. When a local boxer appeared on the pitch to take part in the half-time crossbar challenge there was practically a queue of Boro supporters ready to offer the opinion that he would do better to pull on a red shirt for the second half.</p>

              <p><strong>Boro were only a goal down at that stage, thanks to Giggs's calm finish from the edge of the area when David ­Wheater and his fellow defenders took too long to close him down, but already the match had only one winner. United might even have wrapped it up before the interval, when Brad Jones carelessly aimed a clearance straight at Dimitar Berbatov, only for Paul Scholes to fire wide when the Bulgarian rolled the ball square.</strong></p>
              <p>­Ferguson had Cristiano Ronaldo and Carlos Tevez on the bench in case of emergency, but the visitors strolled to a second goal just six minutes after the restart, Park supplying a confidently struck shot into the bottom corner from Rooney's marvellous reverse pass into space.</p>
              <p>"Once we got hold of the ball we were always dangerous," Ferguson said, putting it mildly. "The first goal sealed it for us, really. Once Ryan put us in front I thought it would be hard for ­Middlesbrough to come back. They are a young team."</p>
              <p>True enough, though with both Southgate and Wheater going into the game discussing their post-relegation futures, Boro appear to have tacitly ­accepted the inevitable. There was a telling moment towards the end of the first half when Tony McMahon was taking a throw-in in an attacking position and waiting for someone to make a run or show for the ball. No one did. While the visitors ran all over the pitch with indefatigable ­energy and invention, the home side just seemed to want the game over. The ­biggest ­attendance at the Riverside this season was reduced to the "We support our local team" chant. To which ­United fans had an instant response: "You ­support a load of crap." Harsh, but not unfair.</p>
              <p>"We were beaten by a better team, none of our players would get in their side, but we're not playing the world champions in any of our remaining three matches," Southgate said. "We've got to go to Newcastle and win, simple as that. Scoring the first goal could be crucial. We haven't won any of our matches after coming from behind."</p>
              <p>After going two-up United brought Tevez on and spent the rest of the game toying with Boro, turning the second half into a sort of warming down exercise ahead of their Champions League semi-final second leg and just occasionally ­attempting to see if they could pass the ball into their opponents' net. They couldn't, John O'Shea finding himself on the end of the best chance. Boro's attempts to score were even less ­convincing. Before putting a last free-kick hopelessly wide, Afonso Alves came on and flattered to deceive with a mazy run past three ­defenders, only to end up on his knees. Boro know the ­feeling well.</p>

              <p><strong>Middlesbrough manager Gareth Southgate:</strong> <br>"We've gone into the last two games against teams in the Champions League semi-finals and were looking for a miracle. To have a chance you need to take the lead. "But we did get stuck into them early on but it is very tough mentally when you fall behind because they are so good defensively.</p>
              <p>"The second goal killed the game but I have to give credit to my players because they never gave up. "We have got to put this game behind us and start preparing for our next match against Newcastle, which is a huge game for both sides."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson:</strong> <br>"It's a big step forward with only four games left now. I keep saying you whittle the games away until there are none left. "It was a very good performance, they all worked their socks off and once we got a hold of the ball we always looked a danger. "Once we got in front, that was the key to it because they're a young side, Middlesbrough."</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Like the great Emperors of the past, Sir Alex Ferguson will attempt to rule Rome in three weeks' time after Manchester United produced an awesome attacking display to destroy Arsenal.</strong> </p>
              <p>A fortuitous opener from Park Ji-sung was followed by a thunderous 40-yard free-kick from Cristiano Ronaldo to effectively book a Champions League final date with Chelsea or Barcelona on May 27 after only 11 minutes. </p>
              <p>Ronaldo capped a fine performance and drew howls of glee from David Beckham, who had made the trip from Milan to witness a victory that will go alongside that staggering win over Juventus in 1999 that the former England skipper was a part of, by sliding home a third goal, his 25th of the season. </p>
              <p>It was not quite a perfect night for United. How could it be when Darren Fletcher ended it in disbelief at the red card for a tackle on Cesc Fabregas which will rule him out of the Italian job. </p>
              <p>However, it was not far off, leaving United to await events at Stamford Bridge tomorrow with so many neutrals, if not a Chelsea side hell-bent on revenge, hoping Barcelona set up what would be a dream decider. </p>
              <p>No amount of meticulous planning can legislate for bad luck. It is the unknown factor that, in an instant, can screw any amount of hopes and dreams into the tightest ball and throw them out of the highest window, never to be seen again. </p>
              <p>Kieran Gibbs has not been a first-team regular very long. Fitness permitting, he has almost a decade and a half in front of him in the Arsenal side. </p>
              <p>It is a fair bet, at the end of his career, the 18-year-old still regards the horror that unfolded eight minutes into what was such an eagerly-awaited contest as the worst moment he had to endure.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i133.photobucket.com/albums/q60/zocos/park-2.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Quick off the mark: Park squeezes home the early opener for United</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In his head, Gibbs was about to control Ronaldo's cutback, then decide whether to play a short pass out of defence or present Manuel Almunia with a routine clearance. Fate had other plans. </p>
              <p>Instead, poor Gibbs lost his footing and hit the ground with a thump. Like lightning, Park seized on the loose ball, delicately lifting it over Almunia, whose arrival came just too late. </p>
              <p>The United contingent went delirious. Fans, coaches, manager, players, Beckham alike all knew what it meant. They knew the prospect of Arsenal getting three to go through was so remote to be beyond comprehension. </p>
              <p>But if United's opener came courtesy of good fortune, their next was the result of audacity, mixed with high ability. To even think of going for goal from the spot when Robin van Persie had clattered into Ronaldo would be dismissed by most professionals as foolhardy.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Two good: Ronaldo celebrates after his stunning strike doubled United's lead</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Yet, in Porto three weeks ago, the world player of the year drove home a shot measured at exactly 39.1 yards. As Ronaldo stepped back and waited from even further out, ready to unleash his missile, Almunia knew what to expect.</strong> </p>
              <p>Indeed, it could be argued that from such distances, not goalkeeper should be beaten. But as Ronaldo let fly, with venom, and watched his shot dip and flicker, Almunia was powerless to prevent it ripping into the net. </p>
              <p>If three was unlikely, four was an impossibility, turning the remaining 79 minutes into an extended wake, leaving Arsene Wenger on the bench wondering what had hit him, knowing his Champions League obsession will not end in Roman triumph. </p>
              <p>In fairness, Arsenal tried to rally. It was just that by pushing forward, they left wide open gaps that United are too experienced to ignore. </p>
              <p>Almunia's fingertips denied Wayne Rooney, Ronaldo's header from the corner whistled wide, then two more free-kicks from the latter were saved. </p>
              <p>When the Portuguese player cut inside Emmanuel Eboue, on as a half-time replacement to put Gibbs out of his misery, the shot would have found the bottom corner had Almunia not denied him. </p>
              <p>There was nothing the Spaniard could do when United attacked again, Ronaldo supplying the finish to Rooney's cross. As his players cavorted in glee, Ferguson ordered them to tone down their celebrations out of respect to the hosts. It was the only mercy the Red Devils showed all night, although for Fletcher there was a nasty sting in the tail. </p>
              <p>The Scot got studs on the ball before sending Fabregas flying in the penalty area, earning him a red card which will rule him out of the final. Van Persie impressively converted the spot-kick - but it was little consolation for Arsenal.</p>

              <p><strong>Manchester United will be crowned Premier League champions again on Saturday if they avoid defeat against Arsenal at Old Trafford after a 2-1 victory over Wigan.</strong></p>
              <p>Michael Carrick's 86th-minute winner set up a potential title party at the weekend after United had once again fought back from a half-time deficit against a brave Wigan outfit.</p>
              <p>Hugo Rodallega put the Latics in front but Carlos Tevez produced an impudent back-heel within minutes of his arrival as a substitute, with Carrick having the final word.</p>
              <p>The former Spurs star sealed another comeback win when he drove home John O'Shea's pass from the edge of the box.</p>
              <p>The victory leaves United requiring just one point from their remaining two games to clinch a record-equalling 18th title.</p>
              <p>They get the first chance against Arsenal on Saturday before ending with a trip to Hull.</p>
              <p>United boss Sir Alex Ferguson told Sky Sports: ''We were up against a very determined Wigan side.</p>
              <p>''We were fantastic in the second half. We kept going, got a little break and we were the better team. A really gutsy performance.''</p>
              <p>Goalscorer Carrick admitted United were made to battle for the three points.</p>
              <p>He said: ''It (my goal) was worth the wait. 'To score goals as important as that is a great feeling - I had to make up for the miss in the first half, it's a great feeling.</p>
              <p>''Wigan came at us and caused a few problems.</p>
              <p>''It's not the first time we have come from behind - we did it the hard way.''</p>

              <p class="sub-heading padding-top-5 padding-bottom-15"> </p>
              <p><strong>The moment that the heavens opened just before kick-off was the moment that Sir Alex Ferguson felt this was going to be Manchester United’s night. The Scot has always liked to believe that his teams are unbeatable in the rain, but there were times when they looked bedraggled in this sodden corner of Greater Manchester until Carlos Tévez shook them out of their sorry state and brought a third successive Premier League title to within touching distance.</strong></p>
              <p>A draw or a victory at home to Arsenal on Saturday lunchtime will result in United retaining their title and, if there was a moment last night when their crown seemed to slip, it was Tévez, the man who feels as if he has been exiled from Ferguson’s kingdom, who saved them. The Argentina forward equalised with a marvellous piece of skill just three minutes after his arrival as a second-half substitute, his goal building a platform from which Michael Carrick, with a sweet left-foot shot, applied the coup de grâce with only four minutes left.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>As the United goals flew in, the last glimmers of hope were extinguished on Merseyside. Rafael Benítez, the Liverpool manager, never held out much hope for a miracle last night, apparently on the basis of Steve Bruce’s long association with Ferguson, but the Spaniard’s faith in the English game might have been restored by the manner in which Wigan Athletic battled.</strong></p>
              <p>This was Wigan’s ninth defeat at the hands of Ferguson’s team in as many matches since they were promoted to the Premier League in 2005, but Bruce, the former United captain, believed that his team “deserved something out of it”. At half-time they led through Hugo Rodallega’s 28th-minute goal, their pressing game knocking the visiting team out of their stride, leaving Nemanja Vidic and his team-mates squabbling with each other, while Cristiano Ronaldo had another of those evenings when he seems intent on giving his manager reasons to authorise his transfer to Real Madrid.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><img src="http://i133.photobucket.com/albums/q60/zocos/tevezcarrick412pa.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>There was an almighty difference between United’s performance for the first hour and final half-hour. It may be a little too simplistic to say that it all came down to Tévez, but the forward — just as in the second-half fightback against Tottenham Hotspur last month — brought his team an impetus that had been sorely lacking.</strong></p>
              <p>His contribution over the course of the season has been patchy, but last night, intent on proving a point, whether to Ferguson or to his suitors at Liverpool, Manchester City and beyond, it was he who changed the mood of the game and, by extension, the result.</p>
              <p>United had made a terrible start to the evening. Many of Ferguson’s greatest moments with Aberdeen and United have come under rainy skies, including the Premier League title triumph that was secured on this ground 12 months ago, but, while he once made the enlightening claim that Ryan Giggs excels on soft ground, the horse-racing aficionado must have been aghast last night to see so many of his players looking less than sure-footed as they slipped and slid on the greasy surface.</p>
              <p>Jonny Evans went over as early as the second minute, allowing Antonio Valencia a clear run on Edwin van der Sar’s goal, only for the winger, the subject of interest from Real Madrid as well as United over the past 12 months, to float his shot wide of the near post.</p>
              <p>It was a let-off for United, but, after Wayne Rooney missed an equally good chance at the other end and Carrick shot just wide, Ferguson’s team began to look uneasy again.</p>
              <p>Nemanja Vidic was the more convincing of United’s centre halves in the absence of the injured Rio Ferdinand, but he will not look back with fondness on Wigan’s goal. He had his bearings wrong from the moment that Lee Cattermole floated a hopeful pass into the penalty area and, when he and Rodallega contested the aerial ball, the defender fell to the ground.</p>
              <p>Rodallega also looked disorientated as the ball landed, but the Colombia forward reacted quicker to smash a shot past a bewildered Van der Sar.</p>
              <p>United were a disjointed mess, so much so that Rooney called an impromptu team meeting during a break in play. Ronaldo, in particular, was knocked out of his stride by Wigan’s harrying of him, but everything changed with Tévez’s arrival early in the second half, the substitute equalising with an instinctive flick that took Carrick’s shot past Richard Kingson.</p>
              <p>The subsequent onslaught was not what it might have been had United’s need been greater, but, with Wigan having run out of steam, there was a sense of inevitability about what followed. Ronaldo earned an extravagant rebuke from Ferguson for one wild shot too many, but he played a part in the winning goal, sending John O’Shea on an overlapping run that ended with a perceptive pull-back and a Carrick shot that will turn Saturday’s game at Old Trafford into one long celebration. No one, it seems, will rain on United’s parade.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>One more point will do</strong></p>
              <p>- Manchester United need a point from either of their final two matches to win the title. They can achieve that on Saturday at home to Arsenal, a fixture that Arsène Wenger’s side won 1-0 to become champions in May 2002.</p>
              <p>- If Liverpool fail to win either of their final two games, then United will not need to gain another point.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Manchester United were crowned champions of England for a record-equalling 18th time at Old Trafford after a goalless draw with Arsenal ensured Liverpool cannot now catch their north-west rivals.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson's side might not have given Usain Bolt a goal to celebrate on his first visit to the Theatre of Dreams but the Premier League trophy will do as consolation.</p>
              <p>After over three decades as the unquestioned kings of English football, the Merseysiders now have someone else to share the title with. And, if Ferguson is to be believed it will not be long before the Anfield outfit lose it altogether.</p>
              <p>While the first half ended with United still on course for the 11th league title of Ferguson's illustrious reign, Arsenal had every reason to be pleased with themselves.</p>
              <p>After two dire displays that surrendered their Champions League semi-final with the Red Devils, plus a hammering on home soil by Chelsea, it was feared the Gunners would suffer yet another embarrassing mauling.</p>
              <p>Yet, as time wore on, it seemed Ferguson's side were adopting a pragmatic approach to the situation, ensuring their goal was tight and secure, pushing forward in numbers only when really necessary.</p>
              <div>
              <div>Fabregas and Van Persie had one last shot at spoiling the party. But with the trophy ready and the tickets sorted, it seemed a shame to stop it.</div>

"It was a very interesting championship. I think United won it because they got more points at home than any of the other teams in the top four.</div>
