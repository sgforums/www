              Dimitar Berbatov has rejected the accusation that he is too laidback to care whether Manchester United beat Barcelona in Rome on Wednesday.
              
              The Bulgarian has only been a qualified success since arriving at Old Trafford from Tottenham for a club record Â£30.75million. 
              
              Moments of pure genius have been mixed with periods of perceived inactivity as Berbatov adjusted to his new surroundings. 
              
              Sir Alex Ferguson has certainly never questioned the 28-year-old's commitment. 
              
              However, plenty have taken his phlegmatic demeanour as a sign Berbatov lacks the application normally associated with United stars. 
              
              Yet that perception is wide of the mark. 
              
              "I know people sometimes think I don't care. Trust me. I do," he said 
              
              "I get frustrated and if I don't play well I am very disappointed. 
              
              "People should not just look at my face and make an assessment about me, depending on what it shows." 
              
              Ferguson pursued Berbatov for well over 12 months, believing the former Spurs star could add an ingredient missing from his team by being able to unlock the tightest of defences in the most difficult of games. 
              
              A tally of 14 goals and an equal number of assists suggests Berbatov has added a bit extra. 
              
              Yet as the season has reached its dramatic conclusion, he has been gently eased out of the United starting line-up. 
              
              Indeed, it is now expected Berbatov will be on the bench in Rome on Wednesday night as United attempt to join Ajax and Bayern Munich among the list of clubs that have won the European Cup on four occasions. 
              
              "I know what I have done. And I know I can do a lot more," he said. 
              
              "I can improve because I didn't produce 100% in some of the games I have played since I came to the club." 
              
              Concerns about form will be set aside in the Italian capital as Berbatov attempts to win a trophy that has so far proved elusive in a career that finally boasts a Premier League title. 
              
              "I still get nervous," he said. "I play for the biggest club in the world. The nerves are always there. 
              
              "Barcelona will give us a tough match but every game is like that for us. 
              
              "The opposition think, we are playing against Manchester United, we are going to give it everything. We don't expect anything else."
