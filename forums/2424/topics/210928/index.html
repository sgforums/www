            <div class='col-md body'>Michael Carrick is still gaining match fitness but has already targeted a regular spot in UnitedÂ’s team as his aim for the season.<br><br>Carrick made his Champions League debut against Celtic in midweek and then came on as a substitute against Arsenal, something Sir Alex Ferguson described as "a big week for him personally".<br><br>The Â£14million signing says he is settled at United, despite a disruptive summer. The distraction of World Cup duty and a move back up north from London, then an injury in only his second outing means Carrick is still finding his feet in the team.<br><br>Â“I only played one game before getting injured, so I was disappointed not to be ready for the start of the season. Match fitness will take a few games, but IÂ’m looking forward to it.Â”<br><br>Â“IÂ’m taking everything as it comes, I just want to get in the team and stay there. But IÂ’m not taking that for granted, there is a lot of quality here.Â”<br><br>Sir Alex says his sole major summer signing should have no problems making the grade at Old Trafford, even if he is yet to truly show United fans what he is capable of.<br><br>Â“HeÂ’s an excellent footballer, and definitely a Manchester United player,Â” the Reds boss said. Â“HeÂ’s like Wayne Rooney at the moment, he needs games to get his match fitness up.Â”<br>Carrick admits that he only realised how big a club he was joining when he arrived at Old Trafford.<br><br>Â“The club is so big, and itÂ’s not until you get here that you realise how big it is. I think that spurs you on and itÂ’s definitely a challenge," he said. Â“I was never concerned about the size of the club when I was considering UnitedÂ’s offer. IÂ’m quietly confident in my own ability. You have to be sure of your ability to play at this level.Â”<br><br>The 25-year-old has noticed an explicit difference between the expectations at Tottenham and United.<br><br>Â“ThereÂ’s a gap between the two,Â” he added. Â“Spurs is a great club and I improved so much as a player in the two years I was there. But coming to United is totally different. There is a different kind of pressure and expectation here.<br><br>Â“The real difference is that, at Spurs, if you win a trophy itÂ’s a big achievement. At United, you have to win a trophy or itÂ’s a major disappointment. You have to take that in your stride, which is what IÂ’m doing."<br><br><a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=364182" rel="nofollow">http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&amp;newsid=364182</a></div>
