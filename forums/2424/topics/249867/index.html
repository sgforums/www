            <div class='col-md body'>United's injury nightmares continued as Rio Ferdinand limped off against Middlesbrough with a recurrence of the groin injury he picked up in the FA Cup semi final seven days ago.<br><br>The stand-in United captain appeared to tweak his muscle just minutes before the break while snuffing out a Boro attack. The visitors then snatched an equaliser in first-half injury time, with Ferdinand hobbling.<br><br>Sir Alex confirmed Ferdinand's injury had a major impact on the result and said the defender will likely miss the Reds' next four games.<br><br>"Rio's injury was the biggest blow because I felt that if we could get into half-time 1-0 up we'd be okay," the boss said. "His injury isn't long-termÂ… [I'd say he'll be out for], possibly, two weeks. He should be back for the Chelsea game.<br><br>"But they got that goal in injury time [and] I think if Rio had been fit they wouldn't have got it. That's the breaks in football and you have to accept these things."<br><br>The Reds were dealt another blow when Kieran Richardson also failed to appear for the second half. Richardson and Ferdinand join a host of other United stars on the treatment table, including Nemanja Vidic, Mikael Silvestre, Ji-sung Park, Louis Saha and Gary Neville. The United boss also revealed youngster Craig Cathcart, drafted into the first team in recent weeks, is a long-term casualty.<br><br>"We're now playing with just 12 fit players, really," Sir Alex said. "Cathcart's out for the season too. He was injured during training this week, so we don't really have any other defenders to call on. We're down to the bare bones."<br><br>The one positive seems to be French full-back Patrice Evra, who could return on Tuesday night when AC Milan come to Old Trafford in the Champions League.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>RIO FERDINAND</strong> is the latest casualty to join the devastating injury list at Manchester United that has risen to NINE. The defender aggravated a groin problem in the 1-1 draw with Middlesbrough at Old Trafford on Saturday. And with the Premiership title race reaching its climax, boss Alex Ferguson faces a selection crisis. Ferdinand faces a fortnight on the sidelines but is expected to be fit for the cruncher at Chelsea on May 9.<br><br>Skipper <strong>Gary Neville</strong> was crocked at home to Bolton in March, but is back in training after damaging ankle ligaments. He could face Everton on Saturday but is 50-50 for tomorrowÂ’s Champions League semi-final first-leg against AC Milan.<br><br><strong>Nemanja Vidic</strong> broke his collar bone last month and is unlikely to be fit until the FA Cup final on May 19. The Serbian centre-half had been a huge hit in the defence before his injury.<br><br><strong>Patrice Evra</strong> is back in training but still feels the effects of calf and groin injuries he picked up against Sheffield United last week.<br><br>Midfielder <strong>Park Ji-Sung</strong> hopes to have recovered from a knee injury in time to face Manchester City on May 5.<br><br><strong>Mikael Silvestre, Louis Saha</strong> and 18-year-old <strong>Craig Cathcart</strong> are long-term casualties.<br><br>But midfielder <strong>Kieran Richardson</strong> is likely to be fit for the trip to Everton on Saturday after limping off against Boro.<br><br></div>
