              <p> </p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson has been handed his biggest ever transfer 
              war-chest, with more than £100m to spend in January and at the end of 
              the season.<br> <br>The United manager has been modest in his transfer dealings 
              since the departures of Cristiano Ronaldo and Carlos Tevez, with the 
              £16m signing of Antonio Valencia his most expensive recruit.<br> <br>But with owners, the Glazers, freeing up a massive transfer 
              kitty, Ferguson has the funds to move for the star names supporters are 
              desperate to see come to Old Trafford.<br> <br> <strong>Here is a look at 10 stars that might tempt Fergie:<br> </strong> <br> <strong>Bastian Schweinsteiger</strong> <br>Age:  26<br>Position: Central midfield<br>Club: Bayern Munich<br>Cost: £20m<br>Chances of getting him (out of 5): 4. 
                    <br>He wants to come to the Premier League with United his 
              favoured option. Bayern will play hardball but, with only 18 months to 
              run on his contract, he holds all the cards.</p>
              <p><strong>Maicon</strong> <br>Age: 29<br>Position: Right back<br>Club: Inter  Milan<br>Cost: £30m<br>Chances of getting him: 2<br>Inter
               will do everything to hold onto the Brazilian international. If he does
               decide to leave, a more likely destination would be Real Madrid and a 
              reunion with Jose Mourinho.</p>
              <p><strong>Jordan Henderson</strong> <br>Age: 21<br>Position: Central midfield<br>Club: Sunderland<br>Cost: £16m<br>Chances of getting him: 4 
                    <br>Sunderland know they can’t hold onto the England international
               for much longer with United, City and Liverpool all hoping to sign him.
               Ferguson has the advantage over his rivals with Henderson understood to
               prefer a move to Old Trafford.</p>
              <p><strong>Karim Benzema</strong> <br>Age: 22<br>Position: Striker<br>Club: Real Madrid<br>Cost: £25m<br>Chances of getting him: 3.5<br>Fergie
               tried and failed to sign him last year but things haven’t worked out at
               Real for the Frenchman. Still there would be no shortage of takers if 
              he became available.</p>
              <p><strong>Wesley Snjeider</strong> <br>Age: 26<br>Position: Midfield<br>Club: Inter Milan<br>Cost: £30m<br>Chances of getting him: 2<br>One
               of the players of the World Cup, his career has been reignited since 
              moving to Inter. Ferguson wanted him in the summer and couldn’t get him 
              then. Difficult to see him having any more luck in January or at the end
               of the season.</p>
              <p><strong>Manuel Neuer</strong> <br>Age: 24<br>Position: Goalkeeper:<br>Club: Schalke<br>Cost: £20m<br>Chances of getting him: 4 
                    <br>His club are desperate to keep him but a bid in the  region of £20m would be too good to turn down.</p>
              <p><strong>David de Gea</strong> <br>Age: 20<br>Position: Goalkeeper<br>Club: Atletico Madrid<br>Cost: £15m<br>Chances of getting him: 4 
                    <br>It would take around £20m to buy him out of his contract, but £15m should get him.</p>
              <p><strong>Fernando Torres</strong> <br>Age: 26<br>Position: Striker<br>Club: Liverpool<br>Cost: £40m<br>Chances of getting him: 1<br>In
               an ideal world Ferguson would sign Torres and Pepe Reina but he knows 
              Liverpool would do everything in their power to prevent that. With City 
              and Chelsea also desperate to sign Torres, it is unlikely United could 
              live with either of them in a bidding war.<br> <br> <strong>Steven Defour</strong> <br>Age: 22<br>Position: Midfield<br>Club: Standard Liege<br>Cost: £12m<br>Chances of getting him: 4 
                    <br>Ferguson has tracked him for the past 12 months and leads the chase for the Belgian. Liverpool are also interested – but the<br>promise of Champions League football will be enough to see off the Merseysiders.</p>
              <p><strong>Marek Hamsik</strong> <br>Age: 23<br>Position: Attacking midfield<br>Club: Napoli<br>Cost: £20m<br>Chances of getting him: 3 
                    <br>Napoli say he is not for sale but they will sell to the highest bidder. With Europe’s top clubs all monitoring the Slovak,<br>Ferguson is unlikely to want to get involved in a bidding war.<br> <br> <strong>Who should United go for?</strong></p>

              <p>Maicon? don't waste time lah... I don't think United would want to buy a 29 coming to 30 yrs old player... United need a new playmaker thats it. And forget Torres also, cos the guy is so injury prone, it's like a waste of time and money... At least M Owen came free, this guy would cost around $40m to warm the bench, better get a sack of potatoes much cheaper...</p>

              <p>farmer brown is a central def, not a natural RB.</p>
              <p>I think first thing is to sell off berbaflop before doing
              anything.</p>

              <p>brownie is competent at rb too... if memory serves me well, he was our first choice rb when we won the double back in 07/08. i see him as a rcb~</p>

              <p>Maicon? don't waste time lah... I don't think United would want

              playmaker thats it. And forget Torres also, cos the guy is so
              injury prone, it's like a waste of time and money... At least M
              Owen came free, this guy would cost around $40m to warm the bench,
              better get a sack of potatoes much cheaper...</p>

              <p>agree, it seems the board won't sanction any "old" players after berba, as MUFC seemingly is turning to buy unpolished gems, do the polishing and get them into the 1st team.</p>

              <p>defensively, he is good for RB, but he will be burned for pace given he will face most wingers.</p>
              <p>attacking wise, rafael seems a better contributor, but he needs to learn composure and not fly into every tackle.</p>

              <p>if I don't recall wrongly, bale was on the table for MUFC but they seemingly just can't close the deal. bale idolises giggs and that was a big plus pt.. but it just went south and spurs got their man.</p>
