              <p>any player that fergie brought in this season is of course much better than that bellion lol.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the commentator said, maybe its his first match, but that is no excuse for not finishing it. ya I agree with it. it's a  very close range, and with the goalie well beaten, it should not be an excuse for not scoring from a point blank range. also not sure if he should play at left side, as his crossing is bad, as he is a right footer. he was put in a few positions to cross on the left, but his crosses were intercepted by the defenders everytime. I think Nani crosses were  better than him, but also no better lar lol.</p>

              <p>yes berbatov's goal was beautiful and it showed a lot of technique. If he had played against better teams, a quicker defender would have read the pass and gotten to it. It's little wonder why berba only scores against the lower teams.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What's encouraging was that he and rooney seem to exchange more passes these days. Last season, they hardly got the ball to each other as both played so deep.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I got a feeling obertan will be a flop. Even laurent blanc, his coach at bordeaux didnt think much of him. Haha, of cos me now armchair critic nia.....so we shall see.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Feel sorry for nani.....wonder why he cannot up his game. And goodness....I'm still waiting for anderson to score his 2nd!!!</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>for obertan who costs only 3m pounds, my hope for him is that he is a squad player. I mean if a player is that good, he dun costs just 3m pounds isnt it. look at benzema, he is only 21, but how much does he costs already? rooney at 18 yesr old costs unitd 27m pounds. my point is, if a player costs 3m pounds, dun expect much from him. if he can contribute as a squad player for many years, then good for him and the team. I heard the commentator said obertan can be a secret weapon for man utd, I almost LOL. when I see him dribble, his pace and his crossing and his almost unbelieavable miss from point blank, I shall reserve my judgement on him later on, not now.</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>just my two cents, I seems to notice that Evra seems to be caught out a few times, during defending. And the Central Defender has to cover, leaving a big hole, right in the middle.</p></div>

              <p>yea, I actually think Obertan is not too bad as yet. First match
              nerves lah, tho that didn't stop me trying to rip my sofa to pieces
              when he missed that chance lol.. I believe minimum he will be
              better than Bellion. Need to give him some time to integrate into
              the team and understand the style of the team, then I think he
              should be fine. He also needs to bulk up.. he looks v boney.. even
              when compared to O'shea. Or perhaps this is his secret weapon?
              Opponents bang into him will kenna bones and v pain? lol</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>agreed, and it seems, this fella, Obertan is sticking close to a MU legend, Giggs. I see only good coming out of that partnership. And one key element that may help him, his willingness to give the ball, meaning he is more a team player. So even if he is fast and with good dribbling skills, if he can't deliver and always get clogged up by the defence, he is not a contributing factor.</p>
