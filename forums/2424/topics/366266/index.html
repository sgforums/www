              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Lyon coach Claude Puel has admitted the Ligue 1 club would let Karim Benzema join Manchester United if the France striker wished to do so.</span></p>
              <p><span><img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="http://images.teamtalk.com/09/06/330/Karim-Benzema_2319868.jpg" alt="" width="442" height="233"></span></p>
              <p><span>Benzema: Could move on this summer</span></p>
              <p>The 21-year-old is one of the world's hottest properties at the moment, with the Red Devils, Inter Milan and Real Madrid among the clubs reportedly considering a 40 million euro (£34million) bid.</p>
              <p>Both Lyon and Benzema have always claimed he will remain at the Stade Gerland at least until next summer's World Cup, but Puel knows that could swiftly change.</p>
              <p>"We know his importance at OL and his efficiency in our squad," Puel told the club's website. "He's an exceptional player, but we also know the financial figures of the club.</p>
              <p>"We will evaluate the situation with him when he comes back - July 2 - what he wants to do, we'll listen to him.</p>
              <p>"For several months he has said that he wishes to stay with us for the year before the World Cup.</p>
              <p>"If he has any dreams of leaving we will discuss them with him if there are any concrete offers, which is not the case at the moment.</p>
              <p>"So there is no 'Benzema problem' because the player is still with us. Ahead of a transfer which could be out of the ordinary, there is everything to consider."</p>
              <p>Puel insists, however, that Benzema will only leave if the club manage to line up a suitable replacement.</p>
              <p>"We will study the situation if it happens to present itself," he continued. "This doesn't mean that he will definitely leave Lyon.</p>
              <p>"For any coach it would be a great loss to lose Karim. It would mean that we have to replace him - therefore it would be out of the question to lose Karim if one or two players of his calibre were not coming in."</p>
              <p>Benzema came through the ranks with the French giants and burst onto the scene in the 2007-08 season with 31 goals in 51 games, a streak that saw him named Ligue 1 Player of the Year as well as top the scoring charts.</p>
              <p>The last campaign was less impressive for both club and player, as Lyon ended the season without the Ligue 1 title for the first time in eight years, but the France forward nevertheless scored 23 goals in all competitions - an average of a goal every other game.</p>
