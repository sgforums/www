              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>For a young man who has rocketed from semi-obscurity to a seat with the stars, it was fitting that Javier Hernandez planned to spend his second day with Manchester United at the NASA space centre in Houston.</strong></p>
              <p>A year ago, few people outside Mexico had heard of Hernandez. The Guadalajara boy from a footballing family was simply a promising striker with Chivas.</p>
              <p>Early on Thursday morning, a sell-out 70,000 crowd will be at the Reliant Stadium to see United's £7million signing make his debut against MLS All-Stars.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">'My life has changed a lot,' said Hernandez, who arrived in Houston on Sunday to greet more than a thousand fans. 'But I've always tried to be the same, despite what I've achieved.'</p>
              </div>
              <p>Until he met his team-mates on Monday, the closest Hernandez had got to them was on his PlayStation. But the 22-year-old is unfazed at becoming the first Mexican player at United.</p>
              <p>'I always try to see pressure in a different way, more like motivation,' he said. 'There are millions of people in the world who would do anything to be in my position. Sometimes we focus so much on the achievements and our dreams, maybe we forget to enjoy it.</p>

              <p><strong>'I dreamed of one day being able to play with all of these players, and I'm going to try to learn from them. I also want to add my little grain of sand because I want us to be a great team. I've always admired United's players. Rooney and before that Ronaldo and Van Nistelrooy.'</strong></p>
              <p>Hernandez will be joined by his parents and sister in Manchester. Javier Hernandez Snr was in Mexico's 1986 World Cup squad and his father Tomas Balcazar scored against France in the 1954 finals, a feat emulated by young Javier this summer.</p>
              <p>The fastest player at the 2010 World Cup, Hernandez also scored against Argentina. Mexican football's pin-up boy has inherited his father's nickname Chicharito (Little Pea), because of their light green eyes, and it will adorn his No 14 shirt at United this season.</p>
              <p>'How cool that a nickname that's a family tradition is becoming known,' said Hernandez.</p>
              <p>'With my dad and my grandfather, I have two more coaches who have always been able to tell me what I'm missing and what I've done right. That's helped me stay grounded and they've instilled in me the values that I shouldn't feel greater or inferior to any other player.'</p>
              <p>Hernandez has discussed life in England with Tottenham's Giovani dos Santos and Carlos Vela of Arsenal, two Mexicans who have struggled to make an impact in the Premier League. But he is quick to dismiss comparisons with Mexico's greatest export, former Real Madrid striker Hugo Sanchez.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/28/article-1298211-0A920C18000005DC-187_468x314.jpg" alt="The man for all seasons: Sir Alex Ferguson signs autographs before United's clash with Kansas City Wizards on Sunday" width="468" height="314">

              </div>
              <p><strong>'I will always try to lift the Mexico name up high,' he said. 'But I've never liked comparisons. Everyone has their own merit and paid a price to get here. Every player has his own star.'</strong></p>
              <p>Hernandez only won his first cap for Mexico in September, but 21 goals in 28 games for Chivas last season caught United's attention. Sir Alex Ferguson praised his scouts for spotting the striker before he attracted even more interest at the World Cup.</p>
              <p>The United boss is caught between wanting to ease Hernandez in and pleasing fans and sponsors who hope to see him.</p>
              <p>'We want to integrate him into the team as quickly as possible,' said Ferguson. 'There's a big Mexican population in Houston and it's a very exciting attraction for them.'</p>
              <p>After the All-Star Game, United end their tour against Chivas in Guadalajara, where Hernandez will play a half for each side. Asked what happens if his new player scores against United, Ferguson said: 'He'll be fined and transferred back!'</p>

              <p><strong>The 'Little Pea' was a big hit on his first appearance for </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span></a><strong> as Javier Hernandez came off the bench to steal the show at Houston's Reliant Stadium.</strong></p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson has been talking up his £7m signing from Chivas on United's tour of North America and the young man they call 'Chicharito' lived up to expectations when he was sent on for Nani in the 63rd minute to the biggest cheer of the night from a largely Hispanic crowd.</p>
              <p>The Mexico striker has played no football since the World Cup and only met his new teammates for the first time on Monday, but you would never have known it from the way he settled in to the game.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/29/article-0-0A9C0463000005DC-985_468x286.jpg" alt="Major League Soccer All-Star goalie Nick Rimando " width="468" height="286"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>No stopping that one: Nick Rimando is beaten by Darron Gibson's free-kick</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Hernandez had already seen one effort saved by All-Stars substitute goalkeeper Nick Rimando and earned the free-kick that enabled Darron Gibson to restore United's two-goal lead with a wonderful free-kick, when he struck in the 84th minute.</strong></p>
              <p>Paul Scholes' throughball invited the man who was officially the fastest player at this summer's World Cup in South Africa to race clear, and Hernandez showed not the slightest hint of nerves as he lobbed the ball first time over the advancing Rimando. It was an instinctive goal from a 22-year-old clearly high on confidence, and Ferguson was delighted.</p>
              <p>'The one thing defenders worry about is players with speed, who get into the space behind them,' said the United boss.</p>
              <p>'When you see his goal it is an indication of that speed. The timing of his run, coming towards the ball spinning, he is going to be a threat to defenders, no question.'</p>
              <p>Ferguson's insistence that his new generation guarantee a bright future at Old Trafford was rewarded with two first-half goals from Federico Macheda - the first after just 22 seconds - Gibson's strike, and a superbly taken goal from Tom Cleverley as United cruised through what the manager thought would be their toughest test in the United States.</p>
              <p>In truth, the All-Stars had never played together before, and that much was evident straight from the kick-off when defender Kevin Alston attempted a square pass to Jamison Olave. But he placed it wide of his teammate who did not seem to be expecting the ball and Macheda was onto it in a flash, racing clear into the box to beat Donovan Ricketts.</p>
              <p>Ferguson added: 'We always think about Macheda that going through on the goalkeeper he is probably the best we have.</p>

              <p><strong>'He is outstanding in those positions. You always feel very confident.</strong></p>
              <p>'When he went through I expected him to score. It was a well-taken goal.'</p>
              <p>More poor defending allowed Macheda to score his second in the 12th minute when he was left unmarked on the edge of the six-yard box to meet Nani's corner from the right with a well-placed header.</p>
              <p>He could even have had a first-half hat-trick when Guillermo Barros Schelotto allowed the ball to run past him and into Macheda's path in the 36th minute, but this time Ricketts was able to get a touch to the youngster's effort and deflect it just past the post.</p>
              <p>Darren Fletcher also went close to a third goal for United when Cleverley's perfect return pass set the Scotland midfielder free on goal just before half-time but his fierce effort came back off the underside of the bar.</p>
              <p>The All-Stars made six changes at the interval, and two more later in the second half underlined the problems they faced.</p>
              <p>Former <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/everton.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Everton </span></a>midfielder Landon Donovan and Dwayne De Rosario had both played the full 90 minutes in CONCACAF Champions League ties for the LA Galaxy and Houston 24 hours earlier but were called into action by coach Bruce Arena.</p>
              <p>The All-Stars still managed a reply in the 64th minute, ironically as Hernandez was making his long-awaited appearance off the bench.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/29/article-0-0A9BFD7F000005DC-279_468x286.jpg" alt="Major League Soccer All-Star Brian Ching " width="468" height="286">

              <p><strong>The Mexican had only just taken up position as United defended a free-kick on the left and David Ferreira's cross picked out Brian Ching who took got in ahead of Fabio and Edwin van der Sar to head home.</strong></p>
              <p>Gibson hit back with a curling 25-yard free-kick and Cleverley scored an even better goal, skilfully lifting the ball over two defenders before beating Rimando from close-range with a side-footed volley.</p>
              <p>Then came Hernandez's big moment and there was still time for De Roasrio to pull back another goal and Brad Davis to hit the post in a lively finale.</p>
              <p>It was entertaining stuff for the fans at the Reliant Stadium, a superb roofed arena which offered welcome respite from the oppressive heat and humidity of a Texas summer.</p>
              <p>An official crowd of 70,728 was the fourth largest for an All-Star Game in any major US sport, even though the number of empty seats suggested it was in fact some way short of that.</p>
              <p>But this was not an occasion to find fault. Not with Major League Soccer's showpiece game, and certainly not with Hernandez.</p>

              <p><strong>United fans in Ireland will be in for a treat on Wednesday, 4 August, when a quintet of senior players make their first club appearances of the summer.<br><br></strong>Four World Cup players - Wayne Rooney, Michael Carrick, Ji-sung Park and Nemanja Vidic - plus Antonio Valencia, on his way back from an ankle injury, will be in the squad for the match against Airtricity League XI at Dublin's new Aviva Stadium.<br><br>All five missed the Reds' tour of North America and the subsequent friendly in Mexico so Wednesday's game will be a key step in their preparation for the new 2010/11 season.<br><br>"Rooney, Park, Carrick and Vidic are back in training and are doing well," said Sir Alex Ferguson. "Valencia is also training well and needs a game. All of them will be involved and Chicharito will also be part of the squad."<br><br>The boss also confirmed that his two Republic of Ireland internationals - Darron Gibson and John O'Shea - will play. "Yes, they deserve to, and O'Shea will probably be captain."<br><br>After helping to open a new ground in Guadalajara, Mexico on Friday, the Reds will be doing the same in Dublin on Wednesday. Sir Alex is impressed by what he's seen of the Aviva Stadium - "it looks fantastic, it is spectacular" - and feels United are appropriate first visitors given the many links between the club and the country.<br><br>"This is a great way to recognise the relationship we have, which goes back many, many years, to the days of Johnny Carey. We have had some fantastic players from Ireland," said the United manager.<br><br>The Dublin match comes just four days prior to the Community Shield clash with Chelsea at Wembley. The Reds then open the Barclays Premier League campaign with a Monday-night home game against Newcastle United on 16 August.<br><br><strong>Airtricity League XI v United<br>Aviva Stadium, Dublin<br>Wednesday 4 August, 19:45 BST<br></strong></p>
