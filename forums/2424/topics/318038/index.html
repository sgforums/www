              <p><img alt=""><strong>Anderson has a fight on his hands for a place in United's
              starting line-up in Moscow on Wednesday. But he says, if selected, he
              will give his all to bring home a second trophy for the Reds.</strong><br><br>It's
              been a dream debut season for the Brazilian midfielder signed from FC
              Porto in the summer. He has played more often than expected and shown
              he is not just a player for the future.<br><br>"A team with players
              like (Wayne) Rooney, (Carlos) Tevez, (Cristiano) Ronaldo, (Michael)
              Carrick, (Paul) Scholes and other star players, you don't need to do
              much, only work hard," he says modestly.<br><br>"That's something I do
              and if I have the chance I will try to help my team the best that I can
              and make the most of the moment. It is a dream for any player to be in
              a Champions League final and I am no different."<br><br>Anderson can
              hardly believe how well his first season in English football has gone.
              "When I first joined I knew the team had very good players and I
              believed I could reach a Champions League final," he said. "But now I
              have achieved that dream and that’s the best thing.<br><br>"My first
              season has gone better than I expected. Taking into account that I was
              out for seven months with a long-term injury [before I joined], coming
              into this team and winning the Premier League is a great achievement
              for me. Next season I can try to do even better."<br><br>But before he
              can think about that, he wants to complete a Premier League and
              Champions League double to cap off an impressive campaign. "I am
              confident but also a little bit anxious," he added. "Like my other
              team-mates, I just want the day to come in order to bring the trophy
              home."</p>

              <p>no man. He has risen incredily in the epl this season.</p>
              <p>This is particularly edvident at stretford end where every match you hear the chant  for anderson.</p>
              <p>He has played in all the big matches against the other top three.</p>
              <p>I love this boy.</p>
              <p>He stared straight in the eyes of gerrard nose to nose.</p>
              <p>He gave a damn hard time to terry</p>
              <p>and acted like a monkey to piss alot of arsenal players off.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All in his first season. This guy is fierce.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think fergie is warming scholes up to the occasion. because he wasnt permanent in the team until a few weeks ago.</p>

              <p>however, SAF will want a bit of cover and carrick does it quite well.</p>
              <p>I think SAF will hope scholey can come up with another screamer like Barca game.</p>
