              <p>On the scale of things, Nemanja Vidic had a fairly terrible day at the
              office today. Receiving a straight red for bringing down Steven Gerrard
              and making a mistake that allowed Fernando Torres to convert an
              equalizer, it really was not the big Serbian's day.<br><br>Speaking to <em>MUTV</em>, Rio Ferdinand gave his thoughts:<br><br>"The
              sending-off and third goal came at a really critical time. I thought
              the referee's decision to send Vida off was debatable as I could have
              got over there to cover. <br><br>"Vida has been one of our most
              consistent players this season and everyone is allowed to make a
              mistake, so we won’t be getting on his back."<br><br>After a refusal to castigate his fellow defender, Rio summarized the game from his perspective:<br><br>"It was a nervy start from both teams but we took the lead and started to get a foot in the game. <br><br>"Even when they were 2-1 up, we started to turn the screw in the second half and Carlos Tevez had a half-chance".<br><br>Ferdinand
              only displayed positivity despite suffering such a horrendous defeat,
              claiming that his team would use the loss as a learning experience.<br><br>"Losing any game is disappointing, losing to your big rivals is even worse and the scoreline compounds that.<br><br>"But
              we have to turn this into a positive. This game will have torn out any
              sub-conscious complacency there may have been. We got a rude awakening
              today that if we don’t go out and work hard as a collective unit then
              we won’t get the results.<br><br>"We now have time to dust ourselves
              down and get our minds on the game against Fulham next week. It would
              have been nice if that game was right round the corner but we have to
              deal with what’s in front of us."</p>

              <p>straight red is 3, right?</p>
              <p>I feel he deserved the red, and some time to think about the game.</p>
              <p>If he has booted the ball as per he normally does, it won't be a equaliser..</p>

              <p>I guess he was tire lah... with weariness, mistakes are easier to happen... He has been a rock for the team so lets not fault him on one display...

              <p>The players have been playing 8 matches in 25 day already and before that, they also had another long streak... But I am sure the 1 full week of rest will do them wonders...</p>
              <p>I am not too sure yet but some people believe this result could actually be what is needed for them to get back to their best... Cos they were beginning to look out of sort recently... against Inter, they were really poor but got away with that... But personally, I am one of those that feel this result will do them good if they are to meet Pool in the Champions League...

              <p>i agree.. MU seems at their best when hunting or chasing the leaders.. but this time round, they have a big points lead in EPL, and hence I think this is a good wakeup call for the team esp those younger players..</p>
              <p>cause one lapse and top teams like Poo will punish you..</p>
              <p>If MU were to meet poo, it is no longer hunger that will drive MU onwards..</p>
