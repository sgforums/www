              Sir Alex Ferguson is predicting a much quieter summer in the transfer market for Manchester United than rivals Manchester City.
              
              The rivals go head-to-head at Old Trafford on Sunday with the Red Devils attempting to get three of the seven points they require to complete a Premier League title hat-trick. 
              
              It might not be easy, though. In a campaign that never really got off the ground despite a massive influx of cash from new owners the Abu Dhabi United Group, Mark Hughes' men have suddenly hit form. 
              
              A run of four successive wins has included a long-awaited first away triumph since August, and City make the short journey optimistic of adding to their success at Everton by beating United at Old Trafford, 15 months after ending a 34-year drought. 
              
              Such an outcome would blast the title race back open, with Liverpool waiting hungrily for any further setbacks. 
              
              In reality, such a collapse is highly unlikely, which is why - despite rumours circulating about the futures of so many key men, including Cristiano Ronaldo, Carlos Tevez and even Nemanja Vidic - Ferguson does not see the need to ask owners the Glazer family for pots of cash. 
              
              "We won't be going for a lot of players ourselves this summer, that is a fact," said Ferguson. 
              
              "We have a big squad at the moment and I can honestly say there is no one we have actually identified that we want to bring here at the moment. 
              
              "We have had a look at quite a few players over the year, as we normally do, but we are not looking to add a lot of players to our squad." 
              
              Ferguson did not actually mention Franck Ribery's name but his comments seem to cast massive doubt on Bayern Munich's midweek claim they had received a Â£62.5million bid from Old Trafford to secure the Frenchman's services. 
              
              It hardly seems likely Ferguson would spend such a vast amount on one player, even if the 26-year-old was identified as the man to replace Ronaldo should the world player of the year leave for Real Madrid, a transfer that is not certain by any means. 
              
              However, City delving so deep into their pot of cash is not beyond question given they spent a British record Â£32.5million on Robinho on deadline day last summer. 
              
              It is not easy to assess the Blues' campaign as a whole. 
              
              Hughes always claimed the second half of the season would be better than the first and in that he has been proved correct. 
              
              Yet it is hard to escape the conclusion they should have done better than just be involved in a scrap for seventh spot and a place in the new Europa League, which in itself would require a July start to the season. 
              
              City are expected to make major signings in a bid to ensure their second year under Hughes' charge is more productive, although, as Ferguson points out, getting the right men is not as easy as some fans thought when the takeover first took place. 
              
              "It is going to be a busy summer for them," reflected the Scot. 
              
              "But it is all about availability. Some clubs don't want to sell their players to anyone, which is admirable. 
              
              "It is a difficulty. You could have a check list of players but it is reduced by 50% because clubs don't want to sell. 
              
              "Then a lot of clubs, knowing that City have that money there, will be adding noughts onto the value of every player they go for. 
              
              "Mark has to try and evaluate the players he wants at his values rather than their values. That is the difficult thing." 
              
              After starring as a centre-forward against Arsenal, Cristiano Ronaldo is expected to return to his more usual position out wide on Sunday as Carlos Tevez and Dimitar Berbatov are among those itching to return. 
              
              Paul Scholes should also be involved, along with Ryan Giggs, who would be playing in an incredible 29th Manchester derby, the vast majority of which he has won. 
              
              "The players are smelling the big games now," said the United chief. 
              
              "They like that big-game situation. They have proved they can handle it and they are hitting top form at the right time. 
              
              "It is ours to win in the sense of the points we are ahead of our opponents. With the form we are in, we have a good chance."
