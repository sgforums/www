              <p>Ronaldo was at the centre of this year's biggest transfer (or perhaps
              non-transfer) saga, as Real Madrid made it their mission to sign the
              Portuguese ace.<br><br>The 23-year-old made no secret of his desire to
              join the Spanish giants, and at one point it seemed there was no
              turning back as his ties at Old Trafford were hanging by a thread.<br><br>However,
              as Sir Alex Ferguson refused to offload a player who has amassed 42
              goals during the previous season, no move eventuated and Ronaldo was
              stuck with the Red Devils.<br><br>The former Sporting Lisbon winger
              missed the first few weeks of the season after undergoing ankle surgery
              in July, and many commentators were curious as to how the United
              faithful would react when he eventually returned to action.<br><br>Ronaldo
              himself was also anxious ahead of his comeback game against Villarreal
              in the Champions League, but he was overjoyed at the reception he
              received.<br><br>"In the game when I came back against Villarreal I
              wasn’t nervous but just a bit excited to see how the fans would react
              to me," he told <em>The Sun</em>.<br><br>"Thank God things went well.
              This shows people have not forgotten all the good things we’ve done
              together and I’m very happy with that."<br><br>Real Madrid have
              recommenced their pursuit of Ronaldo, with coach Bernd Schuster saying
              in the press this week that he is confident of landing his catch next
              summer.<br><br>But, for the time being at least, Ronaldo is
              concentrating on reproducing last season's form and helping United
              defend their Premier League and Champions League crowns.<br><br>"Things are going pretty well," he added. "I’d love a repeat of last season and continue to show some good progression."</p>

              <p>Yeah true I agree. Moreover he has done very well for United over the last few years... And should he leave, he would leave them with a huge sum for their future purchases...</p>
              <p>Fans should realize that he has given a lot back to United too and stop the unnecessary things going on...</p>
              <p>The cheers he got from the United fans during their Villarreal match was deserving too... To date, I still see him playing his part very well whenever he comes on.</p>
              <p>The guy could have easily followed what Robinho did and called a press conference or continuously ask to leave but he did not after speaking to Fergie. He could have easily threaten not to play as well but he did not too... We could still see him trying his best when ever he comes on... And Rooney's return to form is quite coincident to his return too.</p>

              <p><br>The Glazier debt is a highly leveraged one and is serviced by continual revenues from the club.  It is unlikely that the club will apply the proceeds derived from the sale of C Ronaldo to partial prepayment of the Glazier debt.  They might as well use the monies to invest in new players. </p>
