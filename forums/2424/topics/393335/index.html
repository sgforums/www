              <p>It's difficult to envisage how things could get much better for Wayne Rooney. Winning goals in Madrid in May and Johannesburg in July would probably do it, but nevertheless, the Manchester United striker is enjoying the richest vein of form of his career and has got the world talking about just how much of an impact he can make at this year's finals in South Africa.</p>
              <p>The Champions League has history of bringing out both the best and worst in Rooney, from a scintillating hat-trick on his Old Trafford debut against Fenerbahce in 2004, to a petulant red card against Villarreal in the group stages in 2005 - the only season in which United have been eliminated before the knockout rounds in the past 14 years.</p>
              <p>On Tuesday, in a 4-0 demolition of a Milan side that just three years ago sent United packing at the semi-final stage, Rooney again demonstrated why he is fast becoming the favourite to usurp Lionel Messi as the world's best player. It was the latest in a series of headed goals, something that he credits to both practice and favourable follicles.</p>
              <p>"It was a great performance by us," Rooney said on the <strong>FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour</strong>. "I think AC Milan are one of the great teams and to beat them 4-0 is a great achievement for us, so obviously I'm happy with the result. Of course [I practice a lot], I think probably it's coming off my bald patch and that's helping me score! But of course I've been working on my heading a lot and thankfully that's paying off."</p>
              <p>Rooney's impressive goal haul this season has vindicated those who have called for him to play in the position in which he has been most comfortable since playing on the parks of Merseyside as a youngster - an out-and-out striker. And it seems Sir Alex Ferguson may have been watching the way England boss Fabio Capello deployed Rooney in that very position, after seeing him plunder nine goals in World Cup qualifying.</p>
              <p>"I think I've been in the box a lot more" Rooney explained. "I've been working on my timing and on my finishing and I've also played up front in every game this season when I've played - I think that's definitely the main reason for me scoring a lot of goals.</p>
              <p>"I've played a lot of games up front on my own and when you're the lone striker you know you have to stay up the pitch because you need to be the focal point in your team. I'm not running back quite as much but I'm doing all my work more in the opponents' half."</p>
              <p>It is Capello who is rubbing his hands the most as he knows that he has one of the most dangerous weapons at his disposal in South Africa. Rooney admits that while he is fully focused on the task at hand with United, it is difficult not to keep one eye on the biggest spectacle in world football.</p>
              <p>"You try not to think too much about the World Cup because you need to do the job with your club first. But it's always there in your mind and when it comes it's a dream to play for your country in any competition and at the World Cup it's an unbelievable feeling.</p>
              <p>"I thought we played really well in our qualifying games and I was a bit gutted that we lost the last game because it would have been nice to go through the whole campaign and win every game so that left a bit of a bad taste. But we played really well in the qualifying campaign and we fully deserved to go through.</p>
              <p>"I remember watching Michael Owen in 1998, his goal against Argentina, I was still a young boy and I think when he scored that goal, not just for myself, but for everyone in England, it was a great feeling and a great moment. I watched it at my Nan's house - whenever there was a World Cup on I'd sit around with all my family and watch it, so to play in it knowing that my family will be there or be watching it is a great feeling."</p>
              <p>This year, Rooney hopes it will be he who steals the headlines that were reserved for his current United team-mate 12 years ago, and he is undoubtedly one of the players who has garnered the most attention from opposition managers.</p>
              <p>He has been described as "extra-special" by Australia coach Pim Verbeek, "unstoppable" by Germany coach Joachim Low and "the complete player" by Leonardo, after he saw the England striker net four goals in two matches against his AC Milan side. But despite all the praise, Rooney insists it is only the opinion of a select few that matters to him, and was quick to point to the contribution of his team-mates to his form.</p>
              <p>"Obviously it's nice for top coaches to say good things about you but if I'm being honest I don't really read into it too much. I listen to my manager at England and my manager at Manchester United, and my family and friends - if they tell me I'm doing well I'll listen to them.</p>
              <p>"My team-mates know for sure that I'm getting the goals but I wouldn't be getting the goals without them so they've been a big part of my success this year and hopefully we will be successful as a team at the end of the year.</p>
              <p>Over the past two years, it has been clear to see a change in Rooney - but it is not simply because he has now been charged with spearheading the United attack in the absence of the departed Cristiano Ronaldo. Yes, the Portuguese forward's transfer to Real Madrid has allowed him to be the focal point of the team, but more than that, Rooney's temperament has mellowed, though crucially, he has not lost his irrepressible energy and passionate approach to playing the game.</p>
              <p>He is clearly benefitting from better anger management, and Rooney reveals that the birth of his first son, Kai, last November, has given him even greater motivation to develop a calmer persona.</p>
              <p>"I think I've changed a lot over the last couple of years, obviously becoming a father you have to change and you have to be a role model to your son and someone he can look up to so that's what I've done. He's been to a few games although he probably doesn't know what's happening. The important thing for me was when he came to watch at Everton - the two teams I've played for and the teams who he'll support as well.</p>
              <p>"It's something I'm looking forward to. I've got little cousins who come to the games and you see what it means to them to watch you play and for me to know that there watching me. When my son comes to watch me every week it will be an amazing feeling and something that I will be proud of.</p>
              <p>Clearly enjoying both fatherhood and football, 2010 could potentially be the most memorable of Rooney's 24 years, and though he never likes to be too confident about his club and country's chances of silverware, there's certainly nothing wrong with having a little bit of optimism.</p>
              <p>"We're in a great position with Man United, top of the league at the minute and through to the quarter-finals of the Champions League and obviously with England it's going well and we're preparing right and hopefully by the time we meet up with England, we'll have a great tournament and you never know, we might have this [trophy] back at the end of the end of July."</p>

              <p><img src="http://images.sportinglife.com/10/03/330/Wayne-Rooney-celebrates-Manchester-United-v-F_2431072.jpg" alt="" width="395" height="274"></p>
              <p>Michael Carrick is tipping Wayne Rooney to maintain his blistering form right through until the World Cup.</p>
              <p>Rooney took his Manchester United goal tally to 32 this season with a double in Sunday's defeat of Fulham at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>The 24-year-old has now scored just 10 fewer than Cristiano Ronaldo managed two years ago and a staggering 16 times in his last 11 games, a run that has helped steer United back to the top of the Premier League and into the quarter-finals of the Champions League, where they will discover their next opponents on Friday.</p>
              <p>Almost inevitably, those of a less positive persuasion are questioning whether Rooney can keep it up, not just until after United's campaign is over - May 22 if they reach the Champions League final - but July 11 given that is when England are hoping to play in the World Cup final.</p>
              <p>As someone who hopes to have a major say in both those events himself, Carrick has his fingers tightly crossed.</p>
              <p>"Hopefully this run will end sometime at the end of July," said the midfielder.</p>
              <p>"There is still a long way to go and games to play but Wayne's goal ratio this season is incredible.</p>
              <p>"I am sure he will keep his performance level up. Whether he can keep scoring or makes more of them, who knows?</p>
              <p>"He will say himself it doesn't matter as we are picking up trophies.</p>
              <p>"It is nice for him they are flying in left right and centre. It was just a surprise he didn't score with his head."</p>
              <p>Carrick's tongue-in-cheek comment was a reference to the seven goals on the trot Rooney scored with his head, a run that only came to an end against Milan last week.</p>
              <p>But it emphasised the improvement Rooney has made this season.</p>
              <p>Indeed, it is now generally accepted has gatecrashed the trio of Lionel Messi, Ronaldo and Kaka who were regarded as the best three players on the planet.</p>
              <p>Having worked alongside him at close quarters since his own club record £30.75million move from Tottenham in 2008, Dimitar Berbatov knows exactly how good Rooney is.</p>
              <p>And the Bulgarian has no hesitation in declaring the striker his number one.</p>
              <p>"At the moment he is the best in the world," said Berbatov.</p>
              <p>"He is still so young and has the chance to be even greater.</p>
              <p>"Like I have told him many times, he just needs to stay healthy and he can achieve everything."</p>
              <p>Berbatov certainly sees no reason why Rooney should fail to crash through the 40 goal barrier given United have eight league games and up to five Champions League matches left this season.</p>
              <p>"Wayne can go over 40 because there are plenty of games left in the season," said Berbatov.</p>
              <p>"I wish him luck and we are all going to help him to over the 40 mark."</p>
              <p>Rooney will have extra reason to play well at the weekend given Liverpool are in town.</p>
              <p>United are set to be boosted by the return of Ryan Giggs, who is back in full training after breaking his arm at Aston Villa last month, whilst Sir Alex Ferguson expects to be buoyed by the return of John O'Shea from long-term injury at the start of next month.</p>
              <p>The Red Devils have a few Liverpool demons to exorcise too given they have lost their last three encounters with their fierce local rivals, with Nemanja Vidic being sent off on every occasion.</p>
              <p>There is certainly a perception that Vidic cannot handle Fernando Torres, which is likely to be put to the test at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>However, United may argue Rafael Benitez's men will not be able to deal with their attack either given the form Rooney is in, aided by Berbatov.</p>
              <p>The Bulgarian took his own tally to 10 yesterday, all of which have come in the Premier League, which makes him United's second highest scorer, even if he is way adrift of Rooney.</p>
              <p>Not that the 29-year-old is bothered about that.</p>
              <p>He got as much satisfaction from the goal he created for Rooney on Sunday as the one he scored himself.</p>
              <p>"If we win it doesn't matter who scores for me as long as we are champions in the end," said Berbatov.</p>
              <p>"I try to assist more. In fact I preferred the second assist I gave to Wayne. That is sometimes better than scoring."</p>

              <p>Ryan Giggs has backed team-mate Wayne Rooney to set a multitude of records with Manchester United.</p>
              <p>Giggs, who has made more senior appearances for the Red Devils than any other player, believes the England striker will have surpassed his total by the time he retires from the game and has backed him to overtake Sir Bobby Charlton's all-time goals record for the club.</p>
              <p>Giggs told the Mail on Sunday: "If Wayne plays here, keeps fit and going for the next 10 years, then he will break every record. He will break my appearance record and he will break Bobby Charlton's goalscoring record of 249 goals. I hope that is something he can do."</p>
              <p>Speculation is growing that Real Madrid will attempt to sign Rooney this summer, but Giggs cannot see the 24-year-old wanting to leave Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>He said: "Wayne is at the right place. He's got the best manager and at United you will always be competing for trophies, which is what you want as a footballer.</p>
              <p>"We have great players at United and he loves being here. I can see him staying."</p>

              <p><strong>Ryan Giggs is fit again and ready to lend his skill and vast experience to United's title charge in the coming weeks.</strong><br><br>The veteran midfielder is in contention to feature at Bolton on Saturday after returning from a four-week absence with a broken arm in last weekend's win over Liverpool.<br><br>Giggs revealed it has been maddening to sit on the sidelines, though the Reds' continued good form in his absence was something of a consolation.<br><br>"It’s been tough," Giggs admitted. "With a broken arm, I was running again after a couple of weeks but obviously couldn’t do any contact work.<br><br>"It's frustrating to miss games, especially the two Milan legs and the Carling Cup final, but we managed to win those so that made it a little easier. But I still couldn’t wait to get back and help the lads to finish the season well."<br><br>Titanic tussles with Bayern Munich and Chelsea are looming large, but Giggs insists the champions are fully focused on what is always a tough encounter at the Reebok Stadium. <br><br>"We have to concentrate on Bolton, because if we win it we go confidently into the next game – that’s the way we look at it," the 36-year-old said.<br><br>"We can’t look too far ahead, because every game is tough. The media make out that there are bigger games than others, but for us every one is massive now.<br><br>"But we’re in good form, both as a team and individually, and that's where we want to be for the run-in. It's going to be an exciting end to the season."</p>

              <p><strong>Fergie dampens Giggs' return hopes</strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Sir Alex Ferguson has dismissed the prospect of Ryan Giggs coming out of international retirement for Wales, insisting: "You must be joking."</span><span><span id="intelliTXT"> </span></span></p>
              <p>Giggs, 36, has said he would consider a return if he was asked to cover in an emergency but Manchester United boss Ferguson cannot see it happening.</p>
              <p>Asked about the possibility of Giggs playing for Wales again, Ferguson said: "Ryan? You must be joking. I can't see it, it must have been a weak moment for Ryan. I can't see that happening."</p>
              <p>Giggs has not played for his country since the summer of 2007, but was asked if would consider covering for the injured Aaron Ramsey for the start of John Toshack side's Euro 2012 qualifying campaign.</p>
              <p>Giggs, speaking at United's training ground, said on Friday: "I just said I wouldn't rule it out but it was just a question put to me.</p>
              <p>"I just said if there was ever an emergency or a game that they needed me I would obviously think about it but I've got no immediate plans on coming back and playing regularly."</p>
              <p>He has not had an approach from Toshack but earlier told the Western Mail if that did happen he would give it proper consideration.</p>
              <p>He said: "It is something that I would have to talk about with John and Sir Alex Ferguson.</p>
              <p>"But, at this stage, I wouldn't dismiss the idea.</p>
              <p>"If I had that call from John I would have to think hard about it.</p>
              <p>"I would properly consider the idea. I wouldn't rule it out."</p>
              <p>Wales open their qualifying campaign away to Montenegro on September 3 before facing Bulgaria, Switzerland and England.</p>
              <p>"Starting off well in a fresh campaign is vital," Giggs added.</p>
              <p>"Those first two or three games are so important to get the whole country fully behind the team."</p>
