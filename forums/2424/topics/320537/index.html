              <p>What i read was it all boiled down to Fergie being on holiday when Ramsey visited Carrington.</p>

              <p>well, I think nowsdays, managers are more willing to get youths than to let them go.</p>
              <p>but they know they taking a big gamble.</p>
              <p>most times, these young players have not demonstrated they can perform at the highest level.</p>
              <p>for wenger and saf, they protect the youths and in that, they are expert in this.</p>
              <p>well, maybe, Ramsey is treated better, he feels he can fit into a United Nations team better and he likes the bright lights of London better..<br>so off he goes..</p>
              <p>not end of the world.</p>
