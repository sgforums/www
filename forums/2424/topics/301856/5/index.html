It was clear as daylight for everyone to see... Even if he can get away with the Ronaldo one, Giggs was so obviously fouled... The first goal is always so important... It could win or lose the match for you.<br><br>On Ferdinand's goal, all i can say is... we should go and watch it again... But apart from you, i have not heard anyone else say he was offside...<br><br>Tevez goal... The lineman or ass referee you may like to call him may be running back but what makes you think he wasn't able to see clearly from where he was? Replays clearly showed the ball crossed the line... The back shot wasn't clear but the front shot certainly looked over the line.<br><br>Your last paragraph seem a bit strange too... You seem to be suggesting that  Ferdinand's goal was offside, Tevez's goal didn't crossed the line... The officials didn't do their jobs properly and your fave team won...<br><br>I don't know how to say this and hope it won't offend you... I don't find anything practical from your comments at all... I think its more cynical rather than practical... We should acknowledge that linesman did a great job and was spot-on when he made that call.<br><br>I agree that errors that can be eliminated should have been eliminated... But Rio and Tevez goal wasn't in that basket of errors made during that match...<br><br><blockquote>It was embarrassingly one-sided, and Jose Enrique cleared off the line from Carrick, while many players in red appealed for a penalty as Carr clashed with Ferdinand.<br><br>Ferdinand stole in at the far post five minutes from time to hammer home Rooney's delicate cross, before Ronaldo claimed his first Premier League treble with a deflected finish.<br><br>There was even more agony for Newcastle in injury-time when Tevez added a sixth. Newcastle questioned whether the ball had crossed the line after the Argentine's shot came down off the bar.<br><br>Replays showed it was a goal, and former Old Trafford star Smith contested the decision so fiercely he was sent off.<br><br></blockquote> BBC Sport</div>
