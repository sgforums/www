            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/4/285x214/4234_1.jpg"><br><br><strong>CHRISTIANO RONALDO removed any lingering doubts that he is currently the worldÂ’s best footballer, before offering a frank self-assessment that will send chills through any defence. The dust was still settling on Manchester UnitedÂ’s awesome dismantling of one of ItalyÂ’s most formidable teams in Roma, when Ronaldo said: Â“IÂ’m still young and IÂ’m still improving.Â” No wonder team-mate Patrice Evra was moved to suggest that in years to come the 22-year-old from the holiday island of Madeira will be talked of in the same exalted company of greats like Pele, Maradona and George Best.</strong><br><br>But the memorable 7-1 win over Roma represented a significant step forward in RonaldoÂ’s remorseless drive to take over from Ronaldinho as the world No1. While he has consistently torn apart defences at domestic and international level, the one notable negative in his portfolio had been his failure to make an impact in the Champions League.<br><br>In 26 previous games in the group and knockout stages he had failed to score Â– his one European goal coming in a qualifier against Hungarian unknowns Debrecen two years ago. But all that changed in the two ties with Roma, a team second only to runaway leaders Inter Milan in Serie A, and with the best defensive record in the Champions League of any of the quarter-finalists.<br><br>In the first leg in Rome six days earlier, he had hinted at what was to come with some surging runs and a big assist for Wayne RooneyÂ’s goal. Then in the second leg at Old Trafford he and his team-mates took their game to a new, spectacular level that made the rest of Europe sit up. It only strengthened the feeling that Ronaldo will scoop all the player-of-the-year awards, but the Portugal winger said team honours are what he covets most.<br><br>As he savoured yet another man-of-the-match prize, he said: Â“It is always my aim to be regarded among the best players in the Premiership, or even the world. But IÂ’m still young and IÂ’m still improving. Â“These awards are not the most valuable thing to me. My focus is on helping my team-mates and the club. Above any individual honours, I want to help United win trophies.<br><br>Â“I feel great, to beat Roma 7-1 in a Champions League quarter-final is an unbelievable result. I felt my time was coming in this tournament. I wanted to score in Europe like I have been doing in the Premiership, so IÂ’m very happy. Â“The team played very well, we were very confident of overturning the first-leg result and the supporters played their part by helping the team. It was an amazing night for the players and the club.Â” The destruction of Roma was the perfect pick-me-up for United after the shock defeat at Portsmouth which has raised a question mark over their top target Â– the Premiership.<br><br>Ronaldo added: Â“It is true our big priority is the league. That was our aim at the start of the season and we have worked so hard to get to the position we are in. Â“But, of course, we want to do a good job in the Champions League. We have the players capable of going all the way in the competition.<br><br>Â“We have a great team spirit and it is a different team to two or three years ago because the players are more mature. We know and understand each other on the field a lot better. WeÂ’ve grown together as a team. Â“The last two seasons have not been great in Europe. It is not good for this club unless we are in the quarter-finals, semi-finals and final of the Champions League.<br><br>Â“I have no preference who we play in the semi-finals Â– AC Milan or Bayern Munich would be tough ties Â– but we fear no one. The important thing is that we take this form into the semi-finals.Â” RonaldoÂ’s double took him to 20 goals for the season in all competitions, double the target set by Sir Alex Ferguson at the start of the campaign. It is an impressive tally for a wide player. And there have been a similar number of assists.<br><br>With United still having a possible 11 more games as they pursue the Treble, Ferguson will be hoping Ronaldo is as good as his word and there is yet more to come.<br></div>
