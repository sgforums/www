            <div class='col-md body'>The summer months abounded with rumours that Cristiano Ronaldo was set to leave Old Trafford. But, have proved his devotion to United with some breathtaking performances this season, the Portuguese winger has his heart set on Premiership and Champions League success.<br><br>Ronaldo was again lively on his return from an ankle injury against Copenhagen on Tuesday night. He could easily lay claim to be considered the PremiershipÂ’s star performer so far this season, and has this week received nominations for both FIFAÂ’s World Player of the Year and the Ballon dÂ’Or, European footballÂ’s equivalent.<br><br>"This is a great time for me," he told the Press Association. "The team is playing well and I am really happy here.<br><br>"Now, my dream is to win the Premiership and Champions League with United. I have won other competitions but they are the trophies I really want. I know it will be difficult but we are a good side and if we continue to work hard, anything is possible."<br><br>RonaldoÂ’s talent and the threat he poses to the opposition is enough to quell the boos that met his every touch at the start of the season as England fans sought a scapegoat for the countryÂ’s World Cup quarter final exit at the hands of Portugal in Germany.<br><br>"I don't care about the booing," added Ronaldo. "At the moment, everything is fine. We have made a very good start to the Premiership and the Champions League and we just want to keep it going. That is all I care about.Â”<br><br>Ronaldo is a more polished gem this season, he has elevated his all-round game and could soon, according to Sir Alex Ferguson, be rightly regarded as one of the worldÂ’s best footballers.<br><br>"I have changed a few things about my game but I am also more experienced and more mature," he said, also displaying his vastly improved grasp of English. "But I also feel the team is more compact. Training has been really good, which is one of the major differences from last year and everyone is ecstatic."<br><br>After helping the Reds to a 3-0 win over Copenhagen, Ronaldo wants another victory in a fortnightÂ’s time to secure UnitedÂ’s passage to the Champions League knockout stage.<br><br>"We created a few chances we should have taken on Tuesday but overall, the result spoke for itself," he added.<br><br>"It means if we win the next game, we are into the second round, which is what we all wanted at the start of the season. We didn't do very well in the Champions League last year. We all remember that and we didn't want to suffer the same experience again."<br><br><a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=372086" rel="nofollow">http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&amp;newsid=372086</a></div>
