              <p><span class="italic"><em><strong>Tosic - on loan at Cologne</strong></em></span></p>
              <p><span class="italic"></span></p>
              <p>Zoran Tosic has admitted that he wants to see more first team action at Manchester United next season, or he will look to leave Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>The Serbian winger is currently on loan at Bundeliga side Cologne, where he has netted five times in 12 games since joining in January.</p>
              <p>Despite being hailed as a great prospect after signing for United from Partizan for £8million in January 2009, Tosic made just two appearances in the first team before his move to Germany.</p>
              <p>The 23-year-old has however maintained his desire to stay at Old Trafford, but only if more appearances in the starting eleven were possible.</p>
              <p>"If United want me back I will be very happy to return but I don't want to go back there and be in the same situation as last year, I want a more important role in the set-up," he told Serbian TV channel b92's website.</p>
              <p>"I feel great here but it remains to be seen what Manchester United will say because it's up to them, I have a contract with the club and it's their decision.</p>
              <p>"If that's not what United want, then I will have a look at alternative options.</p>
              <p>"I've spoken to Cologne's officials and they told me they would like to see me wear the team's shirt next season too."</p>
              <p>With Tosic expected to be a part of Serbia coach Radomir Antic's plans for the World Cup in South Africa in June, the former Partizan midfielder, who has scored four goals in his last four games for his country, is confident his side could perform well in the tournament.</p>
              <p>"We have a strong team and want to carry on where we left off in the qualifiers, I am sure we can get through although we are missing some injured players," Tosic added.</p>
              <p>"We have able replacements and my main concern at the moment is to stay fit so can be in coach Radomir Antic's frame as soon as the build-up starts."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>why buy him in the first place if he is not good enough or there are too much wingers in the squad already? frankly I do not expect biram diouf to fight with rooney, owen or berbatov for a place? so is fergie going back to the days of buying the unknown like howard, bellion, forlan etc etc?</em></p>

              <p>This guy suits the bundesliga more than the BPL.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even though bundesliga is more physical <span style="color: #ff0000;">(maybe that's why he was farmed there in the 1st place), </span><span style="color: #000000;">but over there, he has more time on the ball and the ability to showcase his skills and talent. I dont think he would be able to excel in the BPL given the lesser time wingers have in dribbling the ball. Unless he can show that he is like ronaldo in being able to shrug off defenders on his own, he's better off in the bundesliga where famous wingers robben and ribery are.</span></p>
