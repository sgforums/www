Saha was taken off before the end of Sunday's draw with Chelsea after suffering a slight knock, while Ronaldo failed to return after going down under a hefty challenge from Ashley Cole.<br><br>Although Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Park Ji-Sung are due to return to training this week after overcoming hamstring and ankle injuries respectively, neither will come into consideration for Everton's visit and, with Alan Smith now on a personal fitness programme and Giuseppe Rossi kicking his heels at Newcastle, Ferguson could be left with just Wayne Rooney as an orthodox forward.<br><br>Should neither Saha nor Ronaldo make it, Rooney could be joined in attack by Ryan Giggs, with Darren Fletcher and John O'Shea drafted in to fill the vacant midfield slots.<br><br><img src="http://www.teamtalk.com//Images/85258.jpg"><br><br>The problem just highlights the lack of depth in Ferguson's squad compared to Chelsea, although the imminent return of Solskjaer and Park is welcome news at such a congested stage of the season.<br><br>Solskjaer has already confirmed his well-being with six goals this term, while Park's industry could certainly come in handy as Ferguson looks to ease the burden on Giggs and fellow veteran Paul Scholes.<br><br>"Ji-Sung and Ole will begin training this week, which is great news for us," Ferguson told Manchester United Radio.<br><br>"With the hectic December period coming up, it is great we will have those players available."<br><br>Smith could be called on to face the Toffees, even though he looked badly off the pace in a couple of Carling Cup appearances and has not been seen on the bench since the defeat at Southend earlier this month.<br><br>"Alan is coming along fine," said Ferguson. "We have changed his fitness programme with the first team, now he is doing special training to aid his speed.<br><br>"He is responding well and he is enjoying it. He realises there is a lot of hard work involved but he is putting everything into it."<br><br>United (from): Van der Sar, Kuszczak, Neville, Ferdinand, Vidic, Brown, Silvestre, Heinze, Evra, Ronaldo, Fletcher, Carrick, Scholes, O'Shea, Giggs, Rooney, Saha, Smith.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>fortunaely, this match is at OT, cause this is really a test now of our resourcesfulness.<br><br>with Ronaldo and Saha both picking up knocks but still indispensable, they would expect to play, but MUFC will be going for quick scores, and then offload them for them to rest.<br><br>one good sign whenever players are injured are that they can walk off the field, if they can't, then they are in deep trouble.<br>simple truth.<br><br>so ronaldo, and saha both were able to walk off, but saha was holding his hamstring which was a big worry.<br><br>I am just surprised at the lack of progress for ASmith.

            <div class='col-md body'>If you guys have read the papers few days back, there's a small article why Starhub is not showing the live telecast for this week. SOmething like they have rights to show only 370 out of the 380 matches in the season. So they chose not to telecast this weeks one something like that.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>But whooo! Man Utd won!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Nev: First goal was crucial</strong><br><br>After being left frustrated by the 1-1 draw with Chelsea at the weekend, the Reds' skipper was delighted to see the team get back to winning ways against the Toffees.<br><br>"We weren't playing particularly well at that point so to score just before half-time was vital. It also made things comfortable for us in the sense that we knew we just needed to keep the ball in the second half. The second goal killed the game off but even at 1-0 I still felt confident that we would keep a clean sheet. We said at half-time that if we keep a clean sheet we'd go on and win the match and thankfully we did that."<br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson made five changes to the side that started against Chelsea on Sunday. Darren Fletcher, John O'Shea, Patrice Evra, Mikael Silvestre and Kieran Richardson came in to face David Moyes' side and Neville was impressed with their contributions.<br><br>It was a special night for the Neville household as Gary and brother Phil - now captain of Everton - led the two teams out onto the pitch.<br><br>"It's something that I'll look back on in a few years time and feel very proud," explained the Reds' skipper. "Walking out at the front of our teams is a great honour for both of us anyway, but to do it together was brilliant."<br><br>Full news at :<br><a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA%2D9A47%2D47BC%2DB069%2D3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=382811" rel="nofollow">http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA%2D9A47%2D47BC%2DB069%2D3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=382811</a></div>
