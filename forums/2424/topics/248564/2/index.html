            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Manchester United have sent Louis Saha to see a specialist amid growing concerns at Old Trafford about their injury list. Although most of Ferguson's problems are in defence, the United manager has become increasingly concerned by Saha's inability to recover from a recurrent hamstring strain that has limited him to four starts since the turn of the year.</strong><br><br>Saha was a virtual ever-present for the opening half of the season but has not begun a match since February 27, when United beat Reading 3-2 in an FA Cup fifth-round replay, and the club's medical staff are uncertain about how much part, if any, the Frenchman will be able to take in the remaining few weeks of the season.<br><br>The better news for the Premiership leaders is that Rio Ferdinand and John O'Shea hope to be available for Saturday's game at home to Middlesbrough. However, Ferguson is without Nemanja Vidic until mid-May because of a broken collarbone, Gary Neville is still recovering from a groin strain and Patrice Evra faces extensive treatment for a calf injury if he is to be available for Milan's visit to Old Trafford on Tuesday in the first leg of the Champions League semi-final. There are also concerns that Park Ji-sung's season may be over because of a knee injury.<br><br></div>
