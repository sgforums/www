              <p class="art-txt-first">Michael Owen admits he is under no illusions about the size of the task facing him in earning a regular first-team shirt at Manchester United.</p>
              <p>Even when Sir Alex Ferguson offered Owen a new contract at the end of last season, he knew there would be no guarantees about playing.</p>
              <p>As it has turned out, Owen is yet to play a single minute this season.</p>
              <p>The statistic should change at Leeds on Tuesday evening but with the emergence of Danny Welbeck, the 31-year-old finds himself at number five on the United pecking order.</p>
              <p>For someone who still stands at number four on the all-time England scorers chart and was rated as Europe's top striker in his pomp, it could be viewed as a disappointing end to his career.</p>
              <p>But Owen is having none of it. Even if he didn't play another game for the Red Devils, he would have no regrets about the journey.</p>
              <p>"I understand you cannot be given guarantees in football," he told the Manchester Evening News. "As last season drew to an end I was 50-50 about what the manager would say when he called me in.</p>
              <p>"If it had gone the other way I wouldn't have been upset. I am proud to have been involved with such a great club. But secretly when he said he wanted me to stay my fist was clenched under the table.</p>
              <p>"We are all men about it. If I didn't play at all during the season I would sit down with the manager and have another chat.</p>
              <p>"But last summer he was keen to keep me and that was enough."</p>
              <p>Owen admits it is a relatively new experience being so far down the pecking order, although he did have a problem during his short stint at Real Madrid when he found Ronaldo and Zinedine Zidane barring his way.</p>
              <p>However, he is experienced enough to be prepared for whatever challenge faces him.</p>
              <p>"I have been a striker for many years," he reflected.</p>
              <p>"I have been the number one choice and had people chomping at my heels. Now it is roles reversed but I can think of a lot worse places to be.</p>
              <p>"When I train it is with the best players. When I play it is in front of fantastic fans in a great stadium and the quality is high.</p>
              <p>"Who knows what the future holds. I hope I can be involved but I am not stupid there are a lot of top players here and if my chances are limited I will still have a smile on my face and still feel part of a fantastic club."</p>

              <p>Manchester United striker <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/7930/Michael-Owen"><span style="color: #225fb2;">Michael Owen</span></a> believes he has "got a few years left in him" and said he hopes <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=332359&amp;cc=5739"><span style="color: #225fb2;">his brace against Leeds</span></a> in Tuesday's Carling Cup victory will improve his chances of playing more regularly.</p>
              <p>Owen, 31, made just one Premier League start for United last season, with the form of <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/21046/Wayne-Rooney"><span style="color: #225fb2;">Wayne Rooney</span></a>, <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/12724/Dimitar-Berbatov"><span style="color: #225fb2;">Dimitar Berbatov</span></a> and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/146419/Javier-Hern%C3%A1ndez"><span style="color: #225fb2;">Javier Hernandez</span></a> keeping him out of the side.</p>
              <p>And the former Liverpool forward, who has been plagued by injury problems in recent years, admits it has been difficult being made to watch games from the bench on a regular basis.</p>
              <p>"I'm not content if I'm not playing," Owen said. "I get criticised a lot with things like 'you don't play, you pick your money up' and all the rest of it but I'm not proud of that fact. I want to play all the time."</p>
              <p>In his debut season at Old Trafford, Owen managed 31 appearances in all competitions - scoring a derby winner against Manchester City, a Champions League hat-trick against Wolfsburg and a Carling Cup final goal against Aston Villa. And Owen is hoping for a return to that sort of form this time around.</p>
              <p>"If the season was going to be like the first season I was here then I'd be delighted," Owen said. "That was fantastic and I felt involved. I was always either on the bench or playing.</p>
              <p>"Obviously I want to be involved again but I appreciate that there's some top players in the team and in the squad and it's a challenge to get on the bench let alone into the first team."</p>
              <p>Owen admitted he was nervous going into his first appearance of the season against Leeds and so was delighted to take the opportunity afforded him by <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=30"><span style="color: #225fb2;">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></a>.</p>
              <p>"The best players in the world can have a bad game and if I have a bad game tonight you can see the criticism before it even starts," Owen said.</p>
              <p>"That negative thought is definitely in the back of your mind going into games because you can't put it right in three or four days' time like most other players that play all the time. The pressure's on and thankfully every time I have started I've managed to quieten those people before they chirp up.</p>
              <p>"I believe I've got a few years left in me and I'd love it to be at Man United. For that to happen I've got to be involved because the manager wouldn't want me sitting round and I wouldn't want to sit round if I wasn't part of the squad or part of things.</p>
              <p>"As we stand now we've been playing four or five weeks of the season. We've only had one game a week so he hasn't rotated anyone really.</p>
              <p>"You could count all the players out there today and not many of them have had much action so hopefully now the season is under way and we're playing twice a week the whole squad and not just me will get more of a chance."</p>

              <p>In football there are players who score goals and goalscorers who seldom do anything else. The latter are becoming an endangered species. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2011/sep/18/chelsea-manchester-united-fernando-torres"><span style="color: #005689;">Fernando Torres took his goal at Old Trafford last Sunday</span></a> with the aplomb of a gifted striker but a natural scorer <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2011/sep/19/fernando-torres-miss"><span style="color: #005689;">would not have missed the open goal</span></a> that the Spaniard scorned later. Jimmy Greaves would have flicked the ball in without blinking an eye.</p>
              <p>Scoring goals does not necessarily make a player a goalscorer in the strictest sense. Brian Clough, himself a prolific finisher, pointed out the difference when Garry Birtles was making the headlines at Nottingham Forest early in the 1978-79 season with a burst of scoring form that, among other things, helped to knock Liverpool, the holders, out of the European Cup.</p>
              <p>"He's not a goalscorer yet," Clough said reprovingly. "If he's still scoring in five years' time he'll be a goalscorer. Look at Fred Binney. He's a goalscorer." Clough signed Binney from Exeter City, for whom the player had scored 90 times in 177 games, towards the end of his short spell as manager at Brighton &amp; Hove Albion. Binney continued to find the net at the same rate for his new club and was just as successful at Plymouth.</p>
              <p>Clough's reservations about Birtles were justified after the striker had left Forest for Manchester United. "He'll get his next manager the sack," Cloughie had declared cheerfully. It took Birtles 30 games to score his first league goal for United and by then Dave Sexton had been replaced as manager by Ron Atkinson. A topical joke of the time imagined that the first question the American hostages asked after their release following 444 days in captivity in Iran was: "Has Garry Birtles scored for Manchester United yet?"</p>
              <p>Managers and supporters do not mind who is getting the goals so long as they are coming from somewhere. But it is noticeable that the number of players whose sole duty is to find the net from any height or angle almost without thinking about it has reached vanishing point. They were always scarce, now they are facing extinction.</p>
              <p>At 38 Kevin Phillips, an outstanding example of the breed, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2011/aug/14/blackpool-peterborough-championship-match-report"><span style="color: #005689;">is scoring goals for Blackpool</span></a> as regularly as he did for Sunderland in the late 90s. The true goalscorer never loses the knack and the fruitful partnership Phillips enjoyed with Niall Quinn owed much to his being able to work out where the knockdowns were going to drop a fraction ahead of the defenders.</p>
              <p><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Michael Owen" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/michael-owen"><span style="color: #005689;">Michael Owen</span></a>'s career at Manchester United has been plagued by injuries but his two goals in <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2011/sep/20/leeds-united-manchester-united-carling-cup"><span style="color: #005689;">United's 3-0 Carling Cup victory at Leeds United</span></a> on Tuesday suggested that his scoring instincts are as sharp as ever. He is still only 31 and remains a member of that select company of footballers who can have the fans celebrating a goal the moment the ball reaches him in a scoring position.</p>
              <p><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Wayne Rooney" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/wayne-rooney"><span style="color: #005689;">Wayne Rooney</span></a> falls into a similar category except that he is about rather more than simply getting goals, going deep and wide in his search for the ball, then creating chances as well as taking them. His ability to switch the play and pick out a colleague on the opposite wing is at times inspired.</p>
              <p>Greaves was not expected to waste energy hunting for possession. His job was to score. He could embark on mesmerising dribbles, swaying and swerving through defences with the ball glued to his left foot, but his principal role was to finish what others had started, and this he did with a regularity that amounted to genius.</p>
              <p>Perhaps the modern game, with its emphasis on constant movement by the whole team and the need to close down space once possession has been lost, cannot afford the luxury of a player who is a relative stranger in his own half. Even when Ian Rush was at his most prolific for Liverpool he was still expected to defend from the front and win back the ball when a move had broken down.</p>
              <p>Torres, like Rooney, can be an inspired creator but he was bought for £50m on the strength of 65 goals for Liverpool in 102 appearances. Since then he has scored twice in 24 games for Chelsea. Presumably Roman Abramovich has never heard of Garry Birtles, let alone Fred Binney.</p>
              <p>The shot Torres dragged wide last weekend has been compared to Ronnie Rosenthal missing an open net for Liverpool at Villa Park in 1992, but at least Rosenthal hit the bar.</p>

              <div id="article-body-blocks">
              <p>For such a private man <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Michael Owen" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/michael-owen"><span style="color: #005689;">Michael Owen</span></a> has fought a lot of public battles recently, abandoning his natural reserve to confront widespread condescension. By fighting back, and arguing his case with words and goals, Owen has developed a new purpose, and placed a fresh shine on a career that he insists is no slow obituary.</p>
              <p>"I was born to score goals, I feel. How I score them – how I get the ball into the back of the net – might have changed. The actual ability of what I was born to do will never leave me," he says. "I used to be able to create a lot for other people, move defences all over the park, make great diagonal runs into channels, turn and beat players. I can't do that as much as I used to be able to. But what I've done is refine my game to be more clever, get into different positions, be more instinctive around the box."</p>
              <p>The less he plays for <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester United" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united"><span style="color: #005689;">Manchester United</span></a>, the more startling Owen's contributions when his name is called and he reminds us who he really is. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2011/sep/20/leeds-united-manchester-united-carling-cup"><span style="color: #005689;">Two goals – the second, a pearl – at Leeds on Tuesday night</span></a> started the first of two debates about lost England stars. Twenty-four hours after he had scored for the 11th time in only 12 starts for United since October 2009, another Owen – Hargreaves – returned from the wilderness with a redemptive hit for Manchester City.</p>
              <p>If both were fit, Hargreaves would be the more likely to catch Fabio Capello's eye because Owen has been exiled by the England manager. Stranded on 40 international goals and 89 caps, he says: "I was in every squad for over a decade and all of a sudden it stopped one day. I would never turn my back on it, but obviously there's a scar there that still hurts a bit. But I don't get upset now when I'm not in the squad, like I used to. If I got a call-up I'd be there within five minutes.</p>
              <p>"Fabio Capello picked his first squad and I was on the bench. I thought: 'This might be a sign that he doesn't fancy me.' The next time I wasn't in the squad, and that's just been that. I think he came to watch me twice in a year when I was at Newcastle, both times at the Emirates. Arsenal were one of the best teams in the league. We got tonked, and whoever was the striker for Newcastle away at Arsenal wasn't going to get too many touches, so I did feel a bit sorry for myself at that point."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But Owen's immediate priority is to force his way into a Manchester United side overflowing with attacking talent. At Liverpool for a time he grappled with Robbie Fowler and Emile Heskey for a starting shirt and Real Madrid brought new struggles with Ronaldo and Raúl. Now he laughs at the sheer scale of competition at United, where Wayne Rooney, Javier Hernández, Dimitar Berbatov and increasingly Danny Welbeck block his path.</p>
              <p>"In many ways that's what harms your chances of a place – the fact that we are so bloody good. The strikers are just fabulous. No matter where you look there are world-class players, and they're a good range of ages, virtually every type of striker. It's one position where we're particularly well off. Even at 31 I'm enjoying learning how different people play and how you can play along side them. That's the positive."</p>
              <p>The negative, though, is frustration: battening down the desperate urge to play more regularly. After the Carling Cup tie at Leeds, Owen admits he left the pitch not expecting to start against Stoke on Saturday – in the event he played 80 minutes after Hernández was injured. Owen says: "You've got to enjoy the good days, haven't you? It's nice to remind people you're still on this planet and that you can do it still at this top level."</p>
              <p>On Twitter and elsewhere he has quashed the most persistent of the allegations aimed in his direction. The main claim is that he joined United for money when he might by now have signed for a lower-ranked club where he would play every week. This brings out his best debating skills.</p>
              <p>He starts out: "I joined Twitter and you read a lot of the comments. You're biting your lip and you want to reply but you know a headline will be made from it and you don't want to give people the satisfaction. It's obvious I've had a good career and earned money. The last thing I thought I'd be accused of by going to Manchester United was doing it for money.</p>
              <p>"I could have gone to lots of other clubs and earned more. The attraction from Man Utd's end was that they could get a free transfer and use their name and their ability to win trophies and their kudos to attract players such as me. That's where they've got an advantage, where they wouldn't have to pay bigger wages.</p>
              <p>"At other clubs a wealthy investor might have to pay twice as much as everyone else because if they don't they won't get the player. My situation is the opposite. I've been attracted to the club by the players, by the manager, the ability to win things. Money is not the motivation. I've had a great career. I've done really well. My management company [the Wasserman Media Group] concluded the deal with United in hours. That shows you. I wanted to play under the manager and in a fantastic team. I just can't believe how many people think otherwise."</p>
              <p>Owen has started 16 times since his free transfer in July 2009 and appeared 33 more times as substitute, scoring on 16 occasions. Defying expectation, Sir Alex Ferguson renewed the striker's contract this year, citing his professionalism and influence on United's younger players. "I can't find him a regular place in the team at the moment but what I've always said about Michael Owen is that if you need a goal out of nothing there is no one better, and I think that is still the case," his manager said. "He's just got a gift for it. His attitude is excellent. He's a good professional and a good presence to have around the dressing room." Ferguson likes to be surrounded by allies and Owen has become an adopted Paul Scholes or Ryan Giggs though he resists this characterisation: "Naturally I'm quite laid-back, more shy than outgoing, so I wouldn't say I'm good at pressing myself on people and taking them to one side and telling them what to do.</p>
              <p>"I'm probably like Scholesy and Giggs in many ways, so I'm always there if people have got anything to say or ask. We lost a lot of players of that ilk. We lost Edwin van der Sar and Gary Neville, Scholes. It's only really Giggsy, me and Rio [Ferdinand] from that generation. I think I'm the third oldest there, which is bloody frightening."</p>
              <p>He peers down the age scale and sees Hernández, a player in his own image. "He's a great example to kids. If you just watch him, he works hard. Speaking perfect English helps. In terms of playing the game a lot of people compare our styles. I don't think he's like me when I was young, he's a better version of me now. We're both that type of predatory player but he's got legs that are 10 years younger so he can do it faster.</p>
              <p>"Chicho does his fair share outside the box but he really comes alive inside it. Even though I scored a lot in there when I was younger, the one thing you associate me with is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51AHO2Ufaho"><span style="color: #005689;">the goal against Argentina</span></a> [in the 1998 World Cup]. I could get wide, I could run at people, I could beat players, cross the ball for others. The older I've got the more I've defined my style and played more as a penalty-box player. He's a sharper version of me now."</p>
              <p>Change is a favourite theme in his autumn years and it's here that he is at his most insistent: "The way I look at myself, the biggest achievement in my eyes – forget winning trophies or scoring in World Cups – is that I'm still at a top club playing at a really high standard having been almost two different players.</p>
              <p>"When you look around, Paul Scholes used to be a centre midfielder and score goals regularly, bombing in, late runs, headers, great finishing. Look at him in the last two years of his career. He was still one of the world's best, but doing a totally different job. When you lose half a yard of pace you have to refine your game."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At Elland Road, Ferguson admitted: "He's not getting the games he deserves and that's unfortunate," and there is no escaping the sheer strangeness of his predicament, which was the talk of the industry this week. He wrestles with it too: "At Liverpool for a while I was one of the first names on the team-sheet, and the same with England after France 98. There was a bit of a change in Madrid – though one of my pet hates is people asking why it didn't go well in Spain.</p>
              <p>"People think I never started a game. As it happens I started about 20 games and came on in 18 and scored a lot of goals, had a great time out there. Then I came back to Newcastle as the star signing and was in the team every time again. At Man United it's just that there's a mass of world-class players."</p>
              <p>Which was part of the attraction. "No disrespect to other teams but when you're training every single day with top, top players your level doesn't really come down," he says, explaining his ability to locate scoring form after long spells on the margins. "For all that people talk about injuries I've been pretty fit at United. I've had a problem at the end of the first season and couple of little ones in the second, but I haven't had problems that have kept me out for months and months. I'm normally always there and on my toes and training with the lads.</p>
              <p>"You've got Rooney and Berbatov and Welbeck's fit now as well. I'm looking really at the next Carling Cup and Champions League games. So it's definitely a different mental state, but it doesn't change wanting to play all the time, having that hunger to play all the time. That will never change.</p>
              <p>"The difficult bit is explaining to people who say: 'You're just happy to play out your career there,' – that I'm not. I want to play on, I don't want to drop down leagues but I want to play on for a few more years. It'd be too much of a waste for me to retire early. My absolute ideal is to play where I'm playing, because it doesn't get any better. But I'm not stupid, I know one of the best players in the world plays up front, with world-class players in behind. I've got great respect for the manager and I know he respects me as well. I'd love to stay at the club for a few years to come and play a big part."</p>
              <p>With England and United, you might call him some days an exile on Main Street, but in word and deed he is still fighting his way back in.</p>
