"Last season we did really well up until the second leg of the semi-final, but injuries and tiredness went against us.<br><br>"This year we know we'll be as good if not better. We've got the squad and the confidence to do well and hopefully we can go one step further."<br><br>Despite the disappointing manner in which United bowed out of the tournament last season, the team produced some stunning performances along the way, not least the 7-1 thrashing of Roma and the dramatic victory over Milan at Old Trafford.<br><br>"Last season the performances got better and better as the tournament went on," recalls the 27-year-old defender. "Our wins at Old Trafford against Roma and Milan really brought something out in the players, knowing that we could play that well against some of Europe's top teams.<br><br>"We'll be taking that into this season's campaign and will be looking to do really well."<br></div>

Last season's quarter-final tussle between the pair was scarred by violence, with fighting marring both legs. United supporters were attacked by fans and police in the Stadio Olimpico, with the hosts fined Â£31,000 for the behaviour of their supporters, while United were ordered to pay out Â£14,500 by UEFA.</strong><br><br>The trouble overshadowed one of the finest European performances of all-time by Sir Alex Ferguson's men, who thrashed the Serie A outfit 7-1 at Old Trafford after losing the first leg 2-1. "That will be the talking point after last season," said Ferguson.<br><br>However, the United boss also has other major challenges to ponder, not least a testing trip to Dynamo Kiev and two encounters with Sporting Lisbon, the club which provided the Red Devils with both Cistiano Ronaldo and Nani.<br><br>"It is a very tight group," he added. "Dynamo Kiev are a good side. "We also have two of Sporting Lisbon's former players, so we know a bit about them."<br><br>Ferguson has already set his side the task of gaining 10 points to get them on the road to bettering last season's semi-final berth.<br><br>"The whole group possesses some very interesting aspects," he said. "We hope we can get 10 points. It will be difficult but if we can get that I think we will qualify."<br></div>

No disrespect to the other three teams but we've not really got any of the big European sides in our group. United are capable of beating them all.<br><br>I don't think we'll beat Roma 7-1 again, that will be a much more difficult match this time. But it's a good draw. I've been to all three places before. Kiev was a long journey and we got a no-score draw. I think that will be the most difficult match of the lot.<br><br>It's an amazing situation, drawing Sporting Lisbon when we've got Nani and Cristiano Ronaldo at our club.<br><br>I played against Sporting Lisbon during my time at United. We beat them 4-1 at Old Trafford when it could have been 14-1.<br><br>We all thought, 'Well that's us through.' Then they beat us 5-0 in the second leg! Our goalkeeper had an absolute nightmare that day, he let in two goals in the space of three minutes or something.<br><br>That's European football for you. You've got to treat it with the respect it deserves and not think that any game's an easy game.</div>
