              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson's biggest headache before the start of the new season may not be recruiting a midfielder of sufficient quality to replace Paul Scholes, the man he described as "a player of a lifetime".</strong></p>
              <p>While United's pursuit of both Wesley Sneijer and Samir Nasri has stalled, perhaps Ferguson's biggest dilemma may be deciding who starts in goal in their opening Premier League game of the season at West Brom on August 15.</p>
              <p>Logic suggests it will be David De Gea, United having spent £18.3million - a British transfer record for a goalkeeper - on prising him away from Atletico Madrid to fill the huge void left by Edwin van der Sar, following his retirement at the end of last season.</p>
              <p>Despite his huge talent and potential, De Dea's status as United No.1 is not a given, Ferguson himself admitting, in his annual summer interview with the English Press on the pre-season tour of the US, that he fully expects Anders Lingegaard to challenge for the position.</p>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">
              <p>Lindegaard, a £2m signing from Norwegian side Aalesunds, looked sharp and assured in United's opening two games of the tour, before De Gea joined the tour and made his debut in Chicago, the Spaniard duly impressing with a succession of fine saves, atoning for a first-half blunder when he conceded a goal after failing to come off his line to intercept a cross.</p>
              <p>Last night at the Red Bull Arena in New Jersey, Fergie gave Lindegaard the nod for the penultimate game of United's pre-season jaunt of the US, against an MLS All-Stars team that included former United midfielder David Beckham and ex-Arsenal forward Thierry Henry.</p>
              <p>Lindegaard's favourite phrase, which he has uttered on numerous occasions since arriving at United in January, is that he didn't move to Old Trafford to "sit on the bench and pick my nose", a crude but blunt articulation of the challenge he intends to present to De Gea this season.</p>
              <p>Ferguson has admitted De Gea is likely to need time to adapt to the Premier League from La Liga, the wirey 20-year-old not yet in possession of the muscular physique required to hold off defenders in what is arguably the most physical league in world football.</p>
              <p>Lindegaard, at 26, has the right build and, having been at United since the start of the year, does not have to go through the settling-in process, both on and off the field, that De Gea must undergo following his move from Spain.</p>
              <p>And with De Gea not speaking English, communication is likely to be a problem, which gives Lindeaard - who is fluent in English - another crucial edge over his rival for the No.1 spot.</p>
              <p>Lindegaard has developed a reputation as a vocal keeper, while United goalkeeping coach Eric Steele has admitted the language barrier is an obstacle for De Gea in terms of having the same command of his defence.</p>
              <p>Last night, Lindegaard provided further proof of why he may start the new season ahead of De Gea, despite costing a fraction of what United paid Atletico Madrid for the Spain Under-21 goalkeeper, bought ostensibly as Edwin van der Sar's natural replacement.</p>
              <p>Lindegaard produced a spectacular save at full-stretch to deny Beckham, who tried his luck with a dipping strike from 25 yards, then pulled off an equally impressive stop five minutes later, tipping another long-range effort, this time from Brad Davis, over the bar.</p>
              <p>It was perhaps significant Lindegaard did not reappear for the second-half, with rookie keeper Ben Amos replacing for him. For Ferguson has surely seen enough of Lindegaard to be satisfied the Dane could start the new season in goal for United.</p>
              <p>Now it is up to De Gea to show Ferguson why it should be him that starts United's Premier League opener at The Hawthorns. It promises to be a fascinating battle.</p>
