Its not easy. Man u did well against Newcastle i thought, cos it isn't easy to play away matches these days... They even had a goal line clearance towards the end of that game. We must not forget that Newcastle are a good side and on form recently especially at home. So a point gain there is also a good result considering they took the lead first, it could have been worst. And also they got 10 points out of the 12 for the holiday matches... Arsenal and Pool both got 9 out of 12 while Chelsea got 6 from a possible of 12. So 10 points in this period was consider good i would say.

It's really awful. Mis-timed tackles, wayward passes and sudden lapse of concentration. I wonder why Fergie didn't sub him off soon enough.<br><br>Where's Smudge(Alan Smith)?

            <div class='col-md body'>look what happened to the so called world class players like sheva and ballack struggling in the epl title. even if chelsea were to go out to buy, the new recruits must be given time to adapt to the epl frenetic pace, especially if they are from serie a, german league or la liga.<br><br>ballack and sheva been in chelsea since July, yet are not able to adapt and blend in to chelsea's play. besides football, have to consider if the new recruit are able to blend in or adapt to the country's culture, food, weather, language, people and so on, non football factors.<br><br>Mourinho just opened a can of worms,  when he blasted his players for unable to defend and adapt. I hope he knows what he is doing as it is a double edge sword, especially if the blasting is hoped to galvanise or challenge the players to perform better, or it may lead to a eroding of their already fragile confidence, only time will tell  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>
