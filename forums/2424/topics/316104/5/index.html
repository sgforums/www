              <p>hahaha. it was nice to see him and SAF so close. It shows that united has something unique that many other teams do not have.</p>
              <p>I think the players, fans, staff form united. It shows. Especially on occasions like this. Its more than football.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So many twists and turns to this game. Classic! same as 99!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Like what SAF says. They always do it the hard way.</p>

              <p>chelsea simply were the better team in the second half, and yeah, ronaldo should have taken his penalty simple and nice instead of stopping halfway.</p>
              <p>congratulations to the whole of man utd! now the england players in man utd can finally get their rest for about 3 months before the start of new season!</p>

              <p>actually what had caused the big scramble? I only know evra was
              about to throw in then all of a sudden everyone just rushed towards
              tevez...</p>

              <p>They went to confront tevez because he played the ball out all the way back in the chelsea's half. Evra wasnt taking the throw in i think ashley cole was taking the throw in for chelsea.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why they were so angry with the whole thing is because chelsea played the ball out when one of their players was injured and they stopped the game.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But instead of returning the ball to them where they played in out, tevez kicked it deep into their half.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Retards. They did the same to man united twice earlier. And tevez returned the favour so they got pissed.</p>

              <p>first half belong to man u, 2nd half chelsea. drog was plain stupid. Man u had the edge in terms of luck, cause we also missed 2 great chances to bury chelsea.</p>

              <p>cant blame drogba. his fav manager got fired. he is prolly not liked by his team mates and had to listen to terry's nagging during the whole match.</p>
              <p>he tried to play the mind game with vidic but lost it all.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>thank goodness his team mates was there to stop him though. if not i think vidic would have beat the hell out of drogba. hahaha</p>

              <p>congrats man u.</p>
              <p>you deserves the win.  after all chelsea's equaliser was a fluke.  malouda played terribly but was not substituted until injury time.  ballack seems to be good only at set pieces.  his passing was terrible.  joe cole played badly too.</p>

              <p>Wooooooohooooo exciting PKs....see one by one taking the PKs is worse than getting exam results la...See ronaldo missed his kick, really angered me...Methinks that he has lost that "loyalty" already now that he has won the Champs League medal and is 99.99% sure of winning FIFA Player of The Year  and Balloon D'OR already...dun think he wants a League Cup or FA Cup medal at all..Though i see the team of 99 being much more superior with the likes of Stam, Keane, Blanc and Becks and Yorke and Cole...team of 08 is more fluid, technical and tactical..Emotional scene of Rio and Giggs lifting the cup together...sigh..</p>

              <p>to be fair, the two teams did not deserve to lose. They cancelled out each other magnificiently.</p>
              <p>SAF and Grant got their tatics right from the start. The pitch was okie, the referee was good.</p>
              <p>To me, none of the big stars stood out except the goals. Ronaldo was quiet, so was Rooney. Lampard, Drogba even Ballack were also subduded.</p>
              <p>Have you even seen a match where Ronaldo did not have a chance to take a free kick at goal??</p>
              <p>First half belongs to MU and Cech. If MU managed to score with their chances, the match would have finished. Chelsea got a great equaliser back and the game was balanced at the end of First half. 2nd half, Chelsea began to gather momentum. It is not that MU were lacking just that Chelsea became more efficient going forward.</p>
              <p>However, I just felt that Chelsea players esp Jcole were whinning just a bit too much. Yes, they may have not get the calls they deserved, but hey, just get on with the game..</p>
              <p>In extra time, the significant event took place. Tevez in a way, just got back @ Chelsea for what they have unsportly
                  did by not returning the ball when their players needed treatment.And in turn, to me, he created that special advantage when penalties came.Drobga just couldn't control himself, he just wanted to get back at Vidic for all the comments he made b4 the game, and the way they compete throughout the game.Credit to Vidic, he did not go down like a Rivaldo when hit in the face.To me, a red card seems harsh. With Drobga out, Terry took the penalty and missed. To me, he was the last person who deserved such a fate. My Sympathy.</p>
              <p>Also, given how chelsea struck the post twice and not score, once by Drogba, once by Lampard, gave me a belief that somehow, this was going to be MU's day.Quite amazed at how Anderson and Nani took their kicks, so young and yet composed.</p>
              <p>Another minor highlight was when the camera zoomed in on a banner that reads "Scouse free zone". That bought a huge smile.</p>
              <p>Did anyone see Grant giving the losers' medals to the crowd? Well, he must be  very bitter.Btw, did Glaciers come??</p>
              <p>Finally, the skies opened and bathe our heros in their glory!!! And of course, masked the tears of the blues and their fans. Now, we are not that far now from Pool who still clinging on to their tag as "most" successful club in the country. One league and two more cups to go. Impossible??  Don't bet on it.  :P</p>
