              <p>To be fair, grant did well for the season (until now, I am still unsure whether he is qualified to be a manager in BPL).</p>

              <p>btw, whose your Man of Match??</p>
              <p>"Ferguson identified Edwin van der Sar for special acclaim, presenting
              him with a plaque as Uefa's man-of-the-match, and going on to compare
              him with Peter Schmeichel. "That penalty save was no accident," said
              Ferguson. "I have to say I thought it was over when Cristiano missed
              his penalty. But the slip by John Terry gave us an opening. Maybe it
              was fate, him missing his kick like that. I really think fate has
              played its hand."</p>

              <p>For me, Carrick is my MOM. He strings the passes, intercepts and he should have scored. In two teams of mega-stars, he was the one who was quietly doing his business and for me, the most impressive.</p>

              <p>Although he was forced to play in a position he is not comfortable with, he did his best. when ronaldo scored he knew it was his fault but he could do nothing about it.</p>
              <p>So he found the best way to reply. he attacked. and resulted in the lucky goal.</p>

              <p>Watch all the Penalties here... Cech for all his good skill in saving and blocking shots in open play, is not good or experience with penalties...</p>
              <p>Watch Vds how he played with Anelka's mind by telling him shoot to his left, his left, like taunting him like that then he jumped to the right... lol... I didn't notice this from the Tv last night, just realised it after watching this clip...</p>
              <p>This is called experience man... He knows how to wind-up an opponent at a critical moment... He also almost saved Lampard's and Cole's too...</p>
