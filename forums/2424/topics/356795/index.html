              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson has
              leapt to the defence of Dimitar Berbatov in the wake of mounting
              criticism of the Bulgarian star.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>The Bulgarian's £30.75million transfer fee has
              been the subject of considerable debate almost since the day he moved
              north from Tottenham last summer.</p>
              <p>And the critics were out in force again on Sunday following
              Berbatov's woeful penalty miss in the FA Cup semi-final shoot-out
              defeat to Everton at Wembley.</p>
              <p>As one of United's more experienced players, a lot more was
              expected of Berbatov on Sunday, although afterwards he did look
              genuinely distraught at the defeat.</p>
              <p>And Ferguson confirmed the 28-year-old was upset before defending his contribution to the Old Trafford cause.</p>
              <p>"He will get criticism because when you pay £30million for a
              player everyone thinks he should be able to score with a penalty kick,"
              said Ferguson.</p>
              <p>"He was upset and disappointed, as we all were.</p>
              <p>"But I don't see any evidence of Berbatov's season tailing off.</p>
              <p>"He has missed a few games and overall, I thought he did really well."</p>
              <p>While Ferguson's desire for victory could not be questioned
              after his rant at referee Mike Riley for failing to give a spot-kick
              when Danny Welbeck was brought down by Phil Jagielka in the second
              half, the Scot is not getting too down about the defeat.</p>
              <p>After winning three successive shoot-outs, including last
              season's Champions League final, he knew a defeat was inevitable at
              some stage.</p>
              <p>"Anyone can lose out a penalty kick shoot-out," he said.</p>
              <p>"I cannot look upon it as a definition of the team's record. It is done, we just have to move on."</p>

              save your judgement on him next season.
              
              He didnt have proper pre-season training at Man Utd. then he got injured a couple of times. remember he got a good few touches earlier in the season?
              
              If he is thrash, he could be sold off like Veron for a loss to some other clubs, probably Man City :)
