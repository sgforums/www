              <p>Birmingham duo to miss Man United clash</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Experienced Birmingham City duo <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=127964"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lee Carsley</span></a> and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=8018"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stuart Parnaby</span></a> have been ruled out of Saturday's home Premier League clash against Manchester United through injury.</p>
              <p>Midfielder Carsley suffered ankle ligament ligament damage during the FA Cup tie with Nottingham Forest while full-back Parnaby pulled a back muscle in the goalless draw at the City Ground.</p>
              <p>Blues boss <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=52"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Alex McLeish</span></a> is refusing to put a time-scale on how long the duo will be out of action except to confirm they will not be fit to face the Red Devils.</p>
              <p>McLeish said: "Lee and Stuart are both out for Saturday. We've not put a timescale on when they'll be fit again.</p>
              <p>"Lee has got an ankle ligament injury and Stuart has pulled a muscle in his back, so we're not sure how long they'll be sidelined for."</p>
              <p>Parnaby made a rare start against Forest as regular right-back <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=127950"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stephen Carr</span></a> was serving a one game ban for incurring five bookings during the current campaign.</p>
              <p>Carsley has had to play second fiddle to the <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=7809"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lee Bowyer</span></a>-<a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=69178"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Barry Ferguson</span></a> partnership for most of the campaign.</p>
              <p>But the duo are still considered as important back-up players by McLeish who is continuing to step up his search to bring in new blood during the January transfer window.</p>
              <p>Sporting Gijon midfielder Michel is close to finalising a deal to move to St. Andrews while McLeish is understood to have put in a bid - believed to be around £11 million - for Sunderland striker <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=42600"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Kenwyne Jones</span></a>.</p>

              <h2>McLEISH <span style="color: #000000;">Plans To Give Utd 'Fright Of Their Lives'</span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></h2>
              <div id="printsaveline"><img id="articleImage" src="http://images.football365.com/10/01/240/Alex-McLeish-1_2403736.jpg" border="0" alt="McLeish - wary of United."></div>
              <div>.</div>
              <div>.</div>
              <p><br></p>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Birmingham boss Alex McLeish has warned his players to "beware of the wounded animal" when they face Manchester United in Saturday evening's Barclays Premier League clash at St Andrews.</strong></p>
              <p>McLeish knows the Red Devils will be "hurting" after suffering a shock FA Cup third round defeat against Leeds at Old Trafford last weekend. But he is still confident his in-form players can give United - and his former Aberdeen boss Sir Alex Ferguson - the "fright of their lives."</p>
              <p>City will go into the game defending an 11 game unbeaten league run which has catapulted them into the top half of the table and already virtually guaranteed their top flight status for another campaign.</p>
              <p>McLeish said: "Manchester United, you can't judge them on the last couple of results, because they don't normally go a few games without winning. "You know there will be a bit of a wounded animal this weekend and extremely dangerous - and if we were to get something off them then we would still be punching above our weight.</p>
              <p>"But the players are relishing matches like this. Players who haven't played before in the Premier League relished coming up against Chelsea on Boxing Day, really loved it, and it will be the same against Manchester United.</p>
              <p>"Some of them played against United this season at Old Trafford but, at St Andrews, we feel we can be a match for anybody and we will try to give Manchester United the fright of their lives."</p>
              <p>McLeish is continually stressing the need for his players not to rest on their laurels after accumulating 32 points going into the New Year means they are only a handful away from safety.</p>
              <p>He said: "The points we have amassed so far are way ahead of where we thought we would be and maybe we have got a few points in the bank for a rainy day.</p>
              <p>"It has given the players a real impetus and a challenge to such a degree that they are all driving each other on.</p>
              <p>"They want to rise to every single challenge and that is the challenge I have issued to them, that they should not be resting on their laurels, not be content with the points they have gained so far.</p>
              <p>"They shouldn't be thinking they have got a bit of leeway. "They have got to keep going and get as many points as they can, as quickly as they can and be relentless and they have risen to every one of those challenges so far.</p>
              <p>"At some stage we will lose a game, and that's a fact, but we believe that we can continue the run but they don't come any bigger than Manchester United."</p>
              <p>McLeish played under Ferguson in the successful Aberdeen team of the early 1980s and believes some of his qualities have rubbed off on him in management.</p>
              <p>He said: "If you go and try and be somebody else, you find you are not actually being true to yourself.</p>
              <p>"I always remember getting that advice when I started out in management, that you've got to be yourself and you don't really know what that is until you have a feeling, and you try something. and think 'that wasn't me.'</p>
              <p>"Then you begin to evolve - but, at the same time, a lot of the advice and things I learned under Alex Ferguson are in my make-up now, without me actually copying him. "But it is about players. Let's be honest, Sir Alex has players who are world stars, world class players, so my players are not quite at that level yet - so on paper Manchester United should win."</p>
              <p>Birmingham defender Stephen Carr will return after suspension after missing the goalless draw at Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup while serving a one-game ban for incurring five bookings.</p>
              <p>McLeish will have to reorganise his bench as fringe players Lee Carsley, Stuart Parnaby and Gregory Vignal are all ruled out through injury. But number two goalkeeper Maik Taylor has recovered from a back problem after having an injection.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Birmingham are confident the clash with United will go ahead, despite weather-enforced postponements of other Premier League games.</p>
              <p>A statement from Birmingham read: "Club officials have met with local authority inspectors who have reiterated that they are happy for the fixture to go ahead. This followed an inspection earlier in the week.</p>
              <p>"Discussions have also taken place with the emergency services and the Premier League since the recent bad weather took hold and club staff have worked around the clock to ensure the St. Andrew's walkways, car parks and other areas are clear.</p>
              <p>"The club's undersoil heating system means there are no problems at all with the pitch."</p>

              <p>Wah... This match could have lost... Birmingham is really a hard side to beat recently... And congrats to them... 12 matches unbeaten is the longest in their club history i think...</p>
              <p>Anyway, I pleased with a point considering the way the match went... 1 goal down, 1 man down and still got a draw away to this in-form side... somemore came from an own goal... lol. Can't ask for more lah...</p>
              <p>On another positive side, gunners also drop points... at home somemore... So still quite a good day lor...</p>
