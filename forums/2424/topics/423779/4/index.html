              <p>I think they will lose all the away matches against these sides. Come on, the best they did away against title contender is to draw against City.</p>
              <p>I really loose faith in the current crop of United players. Uninspiring. Rooney's episode earlier in the season is another f-up moment.</p>
              <p>I'm sad but I have to admit it, United were thumped in all areas on the pitch. Toothless in attack, Porous in defence. A team overhaul maybe?</p>
              <p>What's more to come: Fergie's retirement. I'm sure United fans are going to suffer for a long long time unless some good news comes in (Qatari takeover)</p>

              <p>If this match showed anything, it is United can't go on without
              Rio and Vidic... Brown is very poor, no wonder he hardly play these
              days...</p>
              <p>Overall, I think United can afford to lose this after
              Arsenal's surprise draw yesterday... Cos this last 2 matches were
              expected to be more difficult...  And their today's
              performance is without Rio and Vidic. Those 2 are expected to be
              back next week so I think they will do much better in
              defending... And together with the soon to return of Valencis, Park
              and Anderson... There is more hope.</p>
              <p>It is the lost of Nani that I am more concern with... Hope it
              isn't too serious cos he is the most creative player for United
              this season... If United lose him for the remainder of the
              season... Then I think the title it's over for them.</p>
              <p>It is another poor decision by the referee not to send Carragher
              off for that challenge on Nani...</p>

              <p>I think the United can kiss the title goodbye for good. They have not learnt their lesson. It's a harsh one to learn but I really hope Arsenal can pip them to the title.</p>
              <p>I've lost all faith for them. I think even if Vidic and Rio played in this match, the result will not change too. The simple reason is the midfield battle has already been lost before it even started. Carrick can even trip on the ball! Would you believe that?! Scholes is on the decline, no questions about that. He was really rash today and could have gotten himself sent off. Giggs, try as he might, failed to deliver a single decent cross before Chicharito's consolation. Nani should just concentrate on playing and not showboating.</p>

              <p>Really nothing to say about this match. Liverpool simply outplayed United.</p>
              <p>I'm worrying about defence. No leader on the pitch. Brown plays with his mouth shut. Smalling is still green. Evra and Rafael are busy attacking.</p>
              <p>No leader on the pitch, defenders suddenly forget their job? All those runs that could easily be tracked, or are usually tracked in other games when Vidic is on the pitch. Die lah like that.</p>

He was really rash today and could have gotten himself sent off. Giggs, try as he might, failed to deliver a single decent cross before Chicharito's consolation. Nani should just concentrate on playing and not showboating.</p>

              <p><br>Don't lose the faith... Yes they played poorly today but it was kind of expected with the unknown factor of not having Rio and Vidic for today's match... They will be back very soon so keep the faith.</p>
              <p>Arsenal unexpectedly dropping 2 points in a home match yesterday is very important... Cos even if the win that game in hand, it would only mean they are on equal points... When I see the remainding fixtures, I find Arsenal's more tricky than United's...</p>
              <p>So don't lose heart and keep the faith man... lol.</p>

              <p>Has Fergie faith in giggs and scholes in crucial matches and no faith in other players even though fletcher was fit to play and was on the bench, even though they are 37 &amp; 36 already. last season double header, both giggs and scholes also played in home and away, not to mention gary neville, when all 3 played in the home defeat against chelsea. you need fletcher in away matches to do the dirty work. carrick and scholes combo in away matches, is a dead giveaway to the home team. united midfield is overran by Gerrad and Lucas at will today. Carrick is weak in tackles as usual, and his passing has gone from bad to worse. as for scholes, you cant expect him to play in 2 consecutive matches, esp against your rivals. He hasnt the legs to last the entire match because he is 36 already, as simple as that.</p>

              <p>in fact, i hope we lose to lyon also and win NOTHING this season.</p>
              <p>ideal scenario: we win nothing. fans revolt. need to rebuild squad. no money. fans revolt more. owners forced to sell. qatarians drop by and shop for united. gives 500m transfer funds. game on. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>signing carrick is a major facepalm. tactics was totally wrong last night. missing 1st choice cbs and no fletchy somemore. need to fine rafael 2 weeks wages.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>He did all the work for the first goal and his curling freekick for the 3rd goal made it possible for Kuyt to score.</p>

              <p>Kuyt was just at the right place at the right time for all 3 goals.</p>

              <p>Actually giggs has been misplacing passes for a long time this season. What gave him a new contract was flashes of brilliance in a number of matches. Scholes shd retire as backroom staff, like neville. Omg and carrick.....his presence makes the midfield lacking in bite.</p>
              <p>Pls pls.....I hope we get someone like roy keane, zidane or gattuso in june.</p>
              <p>Half of me is hoping man u wakes up. The other half tells me they shd just lose the title fight. And rafael shd really check his temper, I thought he wld have learnt better since that debacle in munich. Behaving like a wild child, unprofessional.</p>
