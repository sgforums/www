              <p><strong>Jamie Carragher escaped a red card late in the first half at Anfield for a very poor tackle but I could see why Phil Dowd showed only a yellow.</strong></p>
              <p>At first viewing, at full speed, it was difficult to detect the severity of the challenge on Nani and slow motion often makes things look worse.</p>
              <p>But it should have been a red and the home side could well have been reduced to nine when, moments later, Maxi Rodriguez caught Rafael da Silva with a very high, studs-up challenge.</p>
              <p>This time Dowd should certainly have seen the challenge as an unfair one but he played on and Rafael continued, with momentum and anger, and sent Lucas flying with a poor challenge of his own.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>Liverpool players swarmed around demanding red, as United players appeared to have done after the Carragher challenge, and that mass dissent was the only disappointing aspect of a good game.</strong></p>
              <p>If Dowd had seen, and punished, the Rodriguez challenge he could have avoided the recrimination that followed; had he seen Luis Suarez pull Rafael’s hair in the melee, Liverpool could have had another player dismissed.</p>
              <p>It was a pity Dowd missed those few incidents because he otherwise refereed well.</p>

              <p>• <strong><a href="http://forums.soccernet.com/could-goal-difference-be-crucial-this-season--t114230.html">Fourm: Could goal difference be crucial?</a></strong></p>
              <p>United have lost three out of their last five Premier League games - 
              including a painful 3-1 loss to Liverpool - as their challenge for the 
              title has been somewhat derailed, with many critics pointing to a lack 
              of quality in the centre of the pitch.</p>
              <p>Sheringham won the Treble 
              with United in 1999 under the captaincy of Roy Keane and now says that 
              Sir Alex Ferguson's current crop are desperate for a similar style of 
              player to take command of the dressing room.</p>
              <p>"When you are a top team, you have to have a leader, a power house," he said. "It was always Roy Keane in my day.</p>
              <p>"Wayne
               Rooney has been that talisman when he's on top form, but he's not been 
              there for six months. When your main talisman isn't firing and leading 
              you, I think the other players need someone else to respond to.</p>
              <p>"Someone
               else needs to take up the mantle. Dimitar Berbatov has at times, but 
              he's not really that sort of character. You need a leader for that great
               team."</p>

              <p>It's nothing to do with got or no leader...  I just felt it was all meant to be...  United didn't have Keane for the last 4, 5 years and they have done very well in those times, and no one mentioned it at all... So I discount that as a proper reason...</p>
              <p>It was just simple, You lost their 2 first choice centre-backs, injury to most of the midfielders Park, Anderson &amp; Fletcher causing the same few who are not known for their running abilities to play too many matches...</p>
              <p>The reason Darren Fletcher was on the bench in this match was because he was ill for much of the week... That cause the reason why Fergie didn't played him from the start... and only the last 20 mins.</p>
              <p>And yes indeed, the referee decisions in the last 2 matches leave a lot to be desired... These very poor decisions can make the difference between winning and losing the league like it did last season... The 2 matches against Chelsea especially the one at Old Trafford where Drogba was so clear off side that it didn't even need a replay or slow-mo to tell...</p>
              <p>But what to do?</p>
