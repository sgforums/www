            <div class='col-md body'>Louis Saha is as good as any striker in the world, according to Reds' skipper Gary Neville.<br><br>The French striker fired a superb winner during United's Champions League trip to Benfica on Tuesday, taking his tally for the competition to three goals in two games following his brace against Celtic.<br><br>Neville paid tribute to Saha's attacking prowess afterwards and believes he ranks alongside the top strikers in world football.<br><br>"Up there on his own Louis's as good as anybody, there's no doubt about that," he told MUTV. "United fans and defenders know better than most how good he is from when he used to play against us for Fulham.<br><br>"He's an extremely difficult player to play against. A real handful who's very quick and skilful, and his goal against Benfica was fantastic.<br><br>"He's done really well this season but to be honest he's been brilliant for us since last Christmas."<br><br>Saha's European goals so far this term have helped United move top of Group F.<br><br>Despite riding their luck somewhat in the first half in Lisbon, United's patient play resulted in their first European away win in nine games.<br><br>"It's a big result," declared Neville afterwards. "We dug in. We've come to learn that when you're away in Europe, you're not always going to play fantastic football.<br><br>"Playing teams on their home patch is not easy and we saw that in the first half. They had lots of possession and pushed us back onto the edge of our own box. But we hung in there, dug in and made our counter-attacks pay in the second half. That's the most pleasing thing.<br><br>"We knew our chances would come and the game would open up," added the United captain. "And with Louis, Ronaldo and Rooney you've got three players who can win you the game."<br><br><a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=366719" rel="nofollow">http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&amp;newsid=366719</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I can still see the day when Fulham first came into EPL and Saha scored two.<br>For me, he reminded me of LOTR warriors then.<br><br>but he has really blossomed and the thing i liked about him is his lack of air, and he seems to blend in well with other players.<br><br>technically, he is different from RVN who is a poacher. Saha likes to collect in MF and drives the ball.<br><br>Finger-crossed that he has a no-injury season.</div>
