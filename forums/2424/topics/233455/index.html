            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.teamtalk.com//Images/78854.jpg"><br><br><strong>Ruud van Nistelrooy has told Holland coach Marco van Basten he is no longer available for the national team. </strong><br><br>The 30-year-old Real Madrid striker, who has been capped 54 times by his country, has not featured at international level since last summer's World Cup. His announcement will come as a blow to van Basten, who thought he had built some bridges with the former Manchester United man.<br><br>"(It is) disappointing, I always played for Oranje with much pleasure and I would have liked to continue to do that," said van Nistelrooy in a statement. Van Basten said: "We [himself and assistant John van't Schip] have had a good conversation [with Van Nistelrooy] in Madrid about the cooperation over the past year.<br><br>"We ironed out some folds. And with that there was a base to eventually come together again." Van Basten told van Nistelrooy he could not guarantee him a starting place in the side. "We have told Ruud when he asked us about this, that the situation about his position is no longer the same as a year ago.<br><br>"In 2006, we saw other candidates for the striking position. "That is why he should be prepared to compete with the others. We cannot guarantee him a starting place. That would be not be fair to the other candidates for the position." That standpoint was the obstacle for Van Nistelrooy to make himself available for Holland again.<br><br>Van Nistelrooy said: "I did not specifically ask for a place in the side, but I did want to have the feeling that I would be a candidate for that. "I did not get that feeling. That is why I don't see the conditions to give a good performance. No-one benefits from frustration. That's why this was a difficult but correct decision."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think RVN is running scared after seeing the 'cold turkey' treatment dished out to Ronaldo &amp; Beckam and the likes.<br><br>As such, he realised, he better buck up, score more for the club. In any case, you play for national team, the hand that gives you the pay is still Real Madrid.  Some more you play for national team, suay suay genna injured, you lose your starting place in the team and this could be permanent.<br><br>I will say he smart. He know he won't feature anymore in World Cup 2010 and European Cup is also a question mark, so why waste the effort and run risk of getting injured.  Besides, its not as if Holland is gonna be a major contender for the European crown....</div>
