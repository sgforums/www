              <p>After Carlos Tevez helped Manchester United win both the Premier
              League and Champions League in his first season with the club, it
              seemed a certainty that his loan deal would be made permanent.</p>
              <p>No contract was offered during the summer, however, as Sir Alex
              Ferguson instead decided to blow most of his transfer kitty on
              Bulgarian star Dimitar Berbatov.</p>
              <p>And now, with a pre-agreed €34 million price-tag hanging off his
              collar, Tevez is struggling to get a game for the Red Devils - quite
              remarkable considering he scored 19 goals in all competitions last term.</p>
              <p>Real Madrid and Inter Milan are among a number of clubs who have in
              recent months sought talks with Media Sports Investment (MSI), the firm
              which owns the Argentine star's rights.</p>
              <p>But the 24-year-old, who is currently holidaying in Buenos Aires,
              has insisted that he is not at all perturbed by the uncertainty
              surrounding his position at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Tevez told <em>The Daily Mail</em>: "I am not preoccupied about my
              future. My instincts are to stay with the club and in the next week or
              so I think there will be more contact with regards to sorting out my
              contract. That is what we've been told.</p>
              <p>"My agent is in touch with United all the time and he tells me that
              everything is very positive now. So it is up to the club. Other clubs
              have asked about me but I see my future at United."</p>
              <p>Tevez has started just eight out of a possible 18 Premier League
              games this season, as he has become the fourth prong in United's
              preferred three-man attack of Wayne Rooney, Cristiano Ronaldo and
              Berbatov.</p>
              <p>And the former West Ham United star admitted that it has not been
              easy competing for a first-team place against such a highly talented
              batch of attackers.</p>
              <p>"It has been a complicated season for me, there is no point denying
              that," he said. "I have not been able to get as many minutes on the
              field as I would like because the quality of the forwards at the club
              is incredible.</p>
              <p>"It is not easy for forwards to get into this team and I have
              suffered. But that does not make me want to leave. I have no urge to
              run away."</p>
              <p>Tevez's loan deal with United expires at the end of the season.</p>
