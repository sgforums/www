But he is 26 now and he wants regular football.<br><br>"I have to look at Manchester United in terms of how do we improve to get better. And when someone like Tevez comes along, it makes it difficult for people like Alan and Giuseppe in particular.<br><br>"The most important thing is that they are our players and we can make decisions when we like."<br><br>The situation is further muddied by Ferguson's admission he lodged a bid for another striker this summer.<br><br>Ferguson opted not to name the player but Bolton's Nicolas Anelka was rumoured to be a strong target, while the agent of Fabio Quagliarella, who scored 13 goals for Italian outfit Sampdoria last term but has since had his contract bought out in its entirety by co-owners Udinese, claimed six weeks ago United had bid Â£10million for the 23-year-old.<br><br>"We did try to get another player," confirmed Ferguson.<br><br>"It is obvious they are not going to sell at this particular time but we have our tabs on the situation."</div>
