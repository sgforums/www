            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Papers: Adu keen on switch</strong><br><br>I'm Freddy to Roll<br>Freddy Adu has four days left to convince Sir Alex Ferguson he can be a star of the future. The American teenager is coming to the end of his two-week trial from Major League Soccer team D.C. United. While many young Americans dream of glory in baseball, American football or basketball, it has always been soccer for Freddy. Adu said: "IÂ’m hoping this all leads to a transfer offer. My aim was to show flashes of the kind of player I can become. To go to one of the worldÂ’s biggest clubs and get a chance to train is an honour and a privilege."<br>Neil Custis, The Sun<br><br>Meanwhile, all the papers report on United's 3-0 win over Everton. The Sun leads with a picture of Wayne Rooney who kissed his badge in front of the Everton fans after taking stick all night from his former Goodison supporters.<br><br>Jose Mourinho insists Chelsea will eventually catch United at the top of the table. The Chelsea boss insisted: "I always like to be first but I'm happy with the situation. We won't take a lot of time to be top of the league."<br><br>In other news, The Sun report that United's hopes of signing Owen Hargreaves in the transfer window have been dealt another blow. The England midfielder broke a bone in his leg in September and was hoping to make his comeback next month, but a spokesman has confirmed that the bone has not healded 100 per cent.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>after the last two games, it clearly show one fact.<br><br>Chelsea has got the resources to turn a match around if they are down.<br>They got players like Shev, Kalou, Robben who can swing the game towards them.<br><br>Whereas MUFC got only OShea, Park..<br>Paul Masfield of ESPN made a good observation, MUFC relies on wing play.<br>when Giggs is sub, we start to look ordinary, Park was introduced too late.<br><br>And now with the Jan windows, MUFC got one chance to make a difference and match Chelsea. Yes, Match. At present, it is undeniable that we are way behind them in terms of bench strength.<br><br>If we spend and get two or even three "QUALITY" players, not youth players, we got a chance to substain the run.<br><br>If MUFC management come out with the regular "BS", and said that they got good enough team, and they can rely on their youth, bah, bah, bah, then it is Chelsea's title.<br><br>Simple logic.<br><br>Only 4 teams have done the treble in League Championships, Arsenal, Liverpool, MUFC, and Hudderfields. I think that is enough.<br></div>
