              Never ever take on Fergie
              Cristiano Ronaldo has been told to prepare for a blast from Sir Alex Ferguson's hairdryer after his petulant strop. Striker Andy Cole witnessed Ferguson's fury during his seven years at Manchester United - and knows the boss will not tolerate dissent. He reckons Ronaldo could cop it from Ferguson for sulking so badly when he was substituted during the derby win over Manchester City, despite the United boss claiming he had "no problem" with the World Player of the Year. "It will be interesting to see what the manager makes of it," said Cole. "The old hairdryer could be out. We can speculate how the manager is going to deal with it, but he always deals with things like this in his own way." Ronaldo simmered with rage in the dugout for the last half-hour of the game before driving off from Old Trafford in his Bentley within 15 minutes of the final whistle.
              David Anderson, Daily Mirror
              
              Cole's former United strike partner Dwight Yorke echoes these thoughts in The Sun ('Mess with Fergie and you'll be sorry Ron') whilst the Daily Telegraph features another ex-Red Paul Parker urging the Portuguese star to apologise for his outburst.
              
              The Telegraph also quotes Mikael Silvestre, who has accused his old team-mate Patrice Evra of lacking respect after he described Unitedâ€™s Champions League victory over Arsenal as â€œmen against babiesâ€�.
              
              AC Milan are lining up a Â£40million bid to land Carlos Tevez, according to the Daily Star. However The Sun claims the Argentinian has admitted he will play for Liverpool should an offer be made ('Tev: I'll play for Kop').

              <p>my favourite writer -&gt; Holt</p>
              <p>http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/2009/05/13/sir-alex-ferguson-is-bullet-proof-he-will-not-worry-about-ronaldo-s-histrionics-115875-21354556/</p>
              <p>One interpretation of Cristiano Ronaldo’s absurd posturing on the
              Old Trafford touchline on Sunday was that it was a threat to Sir Alex
              Ferguson’s authority.</p>
              <p>Well, let’s put that one right straight away.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo
              may be a very fine footballer indeed but there’s nothing he can do,
              nothing he can say, no tantrum he can throw, no strop he can perform,
              that could affect the aura surrounding the Manchester United manager.</p>
              <p>Standing
              on the touchline pouting like a diva isn’t going to do it and snatching
              a tracksuit top from an assistant and flinging it on the floor isn’t
              going to work either. He may be World Footballer of the Year but he
              hasn’t the power to destabilise Ferguson and never will have.</p>
              <p>A
              win at Wigan tonight and a draw with Arsenal on Saturday will add yet
              another league title – his 11th – to Ferguson’s collection. To
              paraphrase the late BBC presenter Robin Day, why should United fans
              prefer a here-today-gone-tomorrow prima donna like Ronaldo over a man
              like Ferguson?</p>
              <p>The time for challenging Ferguson’s authority
              passed a long, long time ago. Trust me, I should know. A few years
              back, in the midst of Fergie’s Kleberson, Djemba-Djemba, Rock of
              Gibraltar period, I suggested in a book he’d gone on too long.</p>
              <p>Whoops-a-daisy.
              That ship has sailed. Ferguson could buy a couple of ring-tailed lemurs
              this summer and stick them up front with Wayne Rooney and I’d still
              back his judgment.</p>
              <p>When he had won one Champions League trophy
              in 21 years at one of the world’s richest clubs, he was vulnerable to
              criticism. Now, he’s on the brink of winning his third and ending the
              argument about who is Britain’s most successful manager of all time,
              the man is bullet-proof. So when Ronaldo stands with his back to him on
              the touchline like a two-year-old, he just makes himself look like an
              utter fool.</p>
              <p>The match against Manchester City was already won
              and Ferguson was paying Ronaldo a compliment by bringing him off to
              save his legs for the rest of the run-in.</p>
              <p>Everyone else could
              see that, just like everyone else can see that even though Ronaldo
              deserves to be hailed the best player in the world, the biggest loser
              if he leaves this summer will not be Ferguson or United. Of course,
              they’ll miss him if he picks up his teddies and jets off to Real
              Madrid. But not as much as Ronaldo will miss them.</p>
              <p>Ferguson has built a squad at United that could withstand the departure of any single player.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo
              has been a massive contributor to the success but I’d still back United
              to win the title again next season, with or without him.</p>
              <p>With Rooney and Dimitar Berbatov up front and strength in depth all over the pitch, they’re too strong simply to wither away.</p>
              <p>And
              if Ronaldo goes, Ferguson will buy big to add another attacking option.
              It might be Franck Ribery or Karim Benzema. Whoever it is, it will
              ensure United remain a formidable force at home and in Europe.</p>
              <p>The
              same might not quite be true of the man last seen stamping his foot on
              the Old Trafford touchline. Real Madrid may hold a sentimental
              attachment for him but that will soon wear off when Barcelona are
              sticking six past them.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo will make them a better team
              but won’t be a remedy for their core weaknesses in defence and
              organisation. If he goes to Madrid, it may be a while before he sees a
              Champions League Final again.</p>
              <p>So the next time Ferguson calls
              him to the touchline, Ronaldo might be better served behaving like a
              man rather than a child. And realising he needs Ferguson more than
              Ferguson needs him.</p>
