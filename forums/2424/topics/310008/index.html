Despite joining three years ago from Stoke City, his injury and two seasons on loan at Watford have prevented him from making a single competitive appearance for the Reds.<br><br>The England international has resigned himself to waiting until next season for a first team opening at Old Trafford, but Thursday's match against Boro will be a welcome step in the right direction.<br><br>Foster is the oldest member of a strong squad for the Teessiders' visit. Chris Eagles, Gerard Pique and Danny Simpson are also included, alongside the highly-rated Rodrigo Possebon and Danny Welbeck.</p></div>

              <p><strong>Ben Foster completed 90 minutes on his return from knee surgery on Thursday evening, as United's Reserves registered a hard-fought win over Middlesbrough's second string with goals from Sam Hewson and Chris Eagles.<br><br></strong>The England international goalkeeper turned in a solid display and showed no apparent ill-effects of his first competitive outing since his final loan appearance for Watford 10 months ago.<br><br>Foster was rarely tested by Boro's forwards in a scrappy match, but looked alert and was sharply off his line on a number of occasions. When he was finally beaten, it was by a controversial second half penalty from Boro's Graham Owens.<br><br>That spot kick cancelled out Hewson's fine opener for United, a goal which was the outstanding moment in a scrappy first 45 minutes. The Reds' skipper was on hand to convert after Danny Welbeck had fired Chris Eagles' neat pass goalwards.<br><br>Ten minutes after the break, Owens rattled the frame of Foster's goal with a superb 25 yard free-kick, but the Reds goalkeeper almost had a hand in United doubling their advantage six minutes later.<br><br>Foster picked out Danny Welbeck with a mammoth clearance and, although the England youth striker managed to head past goalkeeper Brad Jones, his effort was cleared off the line by Seb Hines.<br><br>The visitors were handed a route back into the match on 68 minutes when Danny Simpson was harshly ruled to have handled inside the area, and Owens hammered the spot kick in off the bar.</p>
              <p>Hewson then lashed a volley just wide and Eagles drove wide from 25 yards as United sought to regain their lead. Eagles' effort proved to be a valuable sighter as, six minutes from time, he had a more successful effort from similar range.<br><br>Picking the ball up from substitute Anton Bryan, the winger worked his way infield and, ignoring the runs of Welbeck and Tom Cleverley, lashed a superb 30 yard effort in off Jones' left-hand post.<br><br>It was the latest in a long line of special goals from Eagles this season, but he almost topped the lot three minutes later. From a free-kick 25 yards out, Welbeck flicked the ball up for Eagles to volley, and Jones had to fling himself to his left to claw the ball round the post.<br><br>Eagles then slipped a fine cross back to Welbeck in injury time, but the promising young striker could only clip his shot wide of the near post.<br><br>The two goals were enough in the end, however, to register a first win in four games for the Reserves, while Foster provided the evening's main positive with a long-awaited return to action.<br><br><em><strong>United: </strong>Foster; Simpson, Pique, Chester, Eckersley; Cleverley, Hewson, Possebon (C Evans 75), Eagles; Fagan (Bryan 78), Welbeck.<br>Subs not used: Zieler, Lea, James.</em></p>
