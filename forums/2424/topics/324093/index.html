              <h2><img src="http://www.goal.com/images/17485_news.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="177"></h2>
              <h2>Manchester United captain Gary Neville has revealed he has spent
              the summer completing his coaching badges, as the end of his playing
              career approaches.</h2>
              <p>Speaking to the <em>Daily Star</em>, Neville admitted: "I have done my coaching badges in the summer - along with Ryan Giggs and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer."</p>
              <p>Solskjaer has gone on to become the new reserve team coach at United
              and it looks as though Neville is already considering his future as he
              approaches the twilight of his career.</p>
              <p>"It's difficult as regards the future because at the age of 33 or 34
              you have to start thinking about what you are going to do once you
              stop," confessed Neville before adding, "At that age you feel like you
              are about to fall off a cliff because there's nothing you can do to
              replicate the last 15 years."</p>
              <p>Neville has seen a number of former United players head into
              management such as Steve Bruce, Mark Hughes and Paul Ince. However, the
              defender emphasised that despite completing his badges, his playing
              days weren’t behind him just yet. <br>Speaking about the coaching
              course, he said: "although the two weeks were good fun and hard work,
              it doesn't replace actually playing."</p>
              <p>Having spent most of last season watching from the sidelines as
              United went on to win both the Premier League and Champions League, it
              is clear that Neville is itching to get back on the pitch. The defender
              confessed: "What it did do was make me think about the fact I hadn't
              played for more than 12 months and that I've got to make the most of
              the next season and play for as long as I possibly can."</p>
              <p>Neville has spent his entire career at United, making over 300
              appearances for the club and admitted he was a one club man. He said:
              "I'm into the last year of my contract, so I've got to do my best and
              try to maintain my existence at United because this is the only club I
              want to play football for."</p>
              <p>Whilst age and injuries have ensured he is reaching the end of his
              playing career, Neville admits that he still have something to offer
              United. Speaking about his future he admitted management was something
              that may interest him but not just yet. He concluded:  "You have to try
              to find something. Hopefully I can keep that at bay for two years."</p>
