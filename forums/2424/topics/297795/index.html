            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.panmacmillan.com/images/ronaldo%204.jpg"><br><br>Cristiano Ronaldo has revealed his love of the English game and reiterated his desire to stay at Manchester United for "many years".<br><br>The Portugal winger was the centre of intense transfer speculation for much of last season, with regular media reports linking him with moves to Spanish giants Real Madrid and Barcelona.<br><br>However, the 22-year-old signed a five-year contract extension in the summer to tie him to United until 2012, and he confirmed in an interview with Spanish newspaper Marca on Sunday that he sees his long-term future at the Premier League champions.<br><br>When asked his thoughts on Real Madrid, Ronaldo said: "Real Madrid are a great club, everybody knows that. But I insist that I am very happy at Manchester United and I want to continue here for many years."<br><br>Ronaldo also revealed his love for the English game, which last season saw him voted as both the PFA Player and Young Player of the Year - the first player to land the double award since 1977.<br><br>No player playing in England has ever won the FIFA World Player of the Year award though - which is in stark contrast to both Spain and Italy - but Ronaldo dismissed any suggestion that playing in the Premier League hindered his chances of winning an award like that.<br><br>"In England all the stadiums are full and any smaller team can now win against the big teams. As well as that, the play is not stopped so many times, it is very fast, intense and aggressive, and the players are stronger," he said.<br><br>"The Spanish league is also a very good league. I like it very much and I have a lot of interest in it, but I think that right now the English league is better."<br><br>Ronaldo also paid tribute to United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, the man who took the flying winger from Sporting Lisbon to England in a Â£12.24million deal in 2003.<br><br>"He is a great man, because he was won everything at this club. And he is a coach who I appreciate a lot because he has always helped me whenever I have needed it, and thanks to him I am now a much better player."</div>
