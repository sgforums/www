              <p>Carlos Tevez insists Manchester United will always have a special place in his heart, even though he is now intent on aiding Manchester City's bid for glory.</p>
              <p>Tevez spent two years with the Red Devils, helping them win two Premier League titles and reach consecutive Champions League finals.</p>
              <p>Although his time at Old Trafford ended in a bitter dispute with Sir Alex Ferguson, Tevez will never forget United - and particularly their fans, who stood by the South American when he was regularly overlooked in favour of Dimitar Berbatov.</p>
              <p>"The fact I did not stay at United was not because of the fans," he said.</p>
              <p>"They must understand a part of my heart will always be with them. They were always extremely supportive, even when I wasn't playing."</p>
              <p>If the United faithful are looking for someone to blame for Tevez's departure, the 25-year-old believes they need look no further than their long-serving manager.</p>
              <p>Tevez disputes Ferguson's claim that he tried to make contact with the Argentina star on a number of occasions after the Champions League final, and revealed he just did not feel wanted enough.</p>
              <p>"I felt Sir Alex Ferguson and (United chief executive) David Gill did not do enough to try to keep me," said Tevez.</p>
              <p>"I was at Manchester United for two years. I never got a call or a text message from Sir Alex Ferguson.</p>
              <p>"The only time he spoke to me was after the Champions League final in Rome when I was going back to Argentina.</p>
              <p>"I don't think this is the way to treat a player who is at a club for two years. There was no line of communication."</p>
              <p>It allowed Tevez to join a rare breed to move from United to City, Denis Law being the most high-profile example.</p>
              <p>All the paperwork on a five-year deal has been accepted by the authorities, giving City sole ownership rights, although it will be interesting to see what happens should a parting of the ways eventually be required.</p>
              <p>It means Tevez will link up with his new team-mates on their three-match tour of South Africa when they leave later today.</p>
              <p>Then he returns to friendlies against Barnsley and Old Firm duo Rangers and Celtic before the Blues open an eagerly-awaited Premier League campaign at Blackburn on August 15.</p>
              <p>His trip to Old Trafford comes on September 20, by which time even he should be used to his new surroundings and a training ground barely a mile from the one he spent two years working at.</p>
              <p>"I am in an odd situation because I have been in this city for some time and now I am at a different club," he said.</p>
              <p>"But I have been presented with a challenge I am excited by.</p>
              <p>"I am one more player. Each time that happens, the ambition of Manchester City recovering their old status as one of the best clubs in England gets nearer.</p>
              <p>"I am here to try and win titles and trophies. That is what I will try to do."</p>
