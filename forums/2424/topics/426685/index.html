              <p><strong><span>Darren Fletcher is in danger of missing the crucial stage of </span><span style="color: #000000;">Manchester United</span><span>'s season as concerns grow over when the midfielder will be fit to play again. </span></strong></p>
              <p><span>Fletcher has been at the club's Carrington training ground only once in the last three weeks for a doctor's check-up, with manager Sir Alex Ferguson putting his absence down to a virus. </span></p>
              <p><span>The 27-year-old is suffering from a stomach problem that one source has described as 'serious'. </span></p>
              <p><span>United have been alarmed at his rapid weight loss and lack of energy since he came down with a temperature on the eve of United's defeat by Liverpool on March 6. He was a substitute at Anfield, playing for the last seven minutes, but that was his last appearance. </span></p>
              <p><span>Doctors have advised him to stay away from Carrington and recuperate until they can get to the root of the problem. </span></p>
              <p><span>He was hoping to return to training in some capacity this week but that plan has been put on hold. </span></p>
              <p><span>Having already missed three games, it appears Fletcher is no nearer a return and that will come as a huge blow to United as they head into a critical fortnight in search of the Treble. </span></p>
              <p><span>They take on West Ham and Fulham in the Barclays Premier League looking to stay top of the table, meet Chelsea twice in their Champions League quarter-final and face Manchester City at Wembley in the last four of the FA Cup.</span></p>

              <p><span><strong>Another worry for Ferguson is that goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar was injured in training and has been rated doubtful for Saturday's trip to Upton Park. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span>There is better news for United, however, with Anderson close to a return following his knee injury. Owen Hargreaves' shoulder injury is not as bad as first feared. <br></span></p>
