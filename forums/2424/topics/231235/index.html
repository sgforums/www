And Neville, who played with Becks at Manchester United and for England, said: "I wish him all the best in everything he does.<br><br>"He is a great friend and this is another challenge for him. "He has another six months left at Real Madrid and I am sure he will want to try and win something with them. "After that he will head for America and having spoken to him I know he is looking forward to it.<br><br>"You need challenges in your life and he has a new one. "David has always wanted to do things differently and in his own way. He has done it again."<br><br>Beckham was back in training with Madrid today but the ex-England skipper cannot wait to begin the new chapter in his career. He said: "Some people laughed at me yesterday but this move is not about the money.<br><br>"It's about making a difference in the US and that's what I'm going there for. "Of course I'm going for the life, for my kids to enjoy it and my wife to enjoy it. "But the main thing for me is to improve the game's standard and to be part of history. "I think soccer can be a lot bigger in the US. "From a young age kids are brought up with soccer Â— they're brought up with it to a certain age and then they seem to go into other areas.<br><br>"Hopefully that's what I'll be there for, to pass my experience on to them."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Nev hails nice guys of footie</strong></span><br><br>GARY NEVILLE insists footballers are good role models Â— despite their pampered image.<br><br>The Manchester United defender, 31, reckons the playersÂ’ union needs to get that message across to the public. He said: Â“I think 99.9 per cent of footballers are really good lads. Â“They make mistakes at times, including myself, but that doesnÂ’t mean we are bad people.<br><br>Â“We do try and do a lot of good work outside of football but that work isnÂ’t seen. People have to realise that it goes on. Â“You might not hear of a footballer doing great work but IÂ’m sure he is visiting hospitals, raising money. It goes on constantly through the year. Â“When people say you need to be a role model, most of the time we are.Â”<br><br><img src="http://i133.photobucket.com/albums/q60/zocos/larrson1.jpg"><br><br>Meanwhile, HENRIK LARSSON claims he still needs to improve at Manchester United Â— despite his debut goal against Aston Villa. Swede Larsson Â— on loan until March Â— said: Â“I was happy with my fitness and sharpness but I canÂ’t get carried away. Â“One swallow doesnÂ’t make a summer and I know I need to keep working hard and improving.<br><br>Â“The last time I had played was the start of December so I know I need to work hard and full fitness will come. Â“I want to play as big a part as possible while IÂ’m with this great team.Â”<br><br>Larsson, 35, enjoyed his partnership with Wayne Rooney in the 2-1 FA Cup win over Villa. He added: Â“We had some nice little combinations and we were able to find each other at important moments.Â”<br><br></div>
