              <p><strong>Michael Carrick has been ruled out for three weeks with an Achilles injury.  The </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester United </strong></span></a><strong>midfielder had an injection yesterday after informing Sir Alex Ferguson the long-standing problem was starting to bother him once more.</strong> </p>
              <p>'He should be out for three weeks, maybe a month at most,' said Ferguson. But there was better news for Ferguson in the form of Carrick's midfield colleague Anderson, who stepped up his own return from injury with an appearance in United's reserves on Thursday night.</p>
              <p>The 22-year-old Brazil international is on his way back from a cruciate knee ligament injury suffered during his side's Premier League win over West Ham in February.  </p>

              <p><strong>Anderson endured a disappointing season last term with the midfielder blighted by poor form. But the sight of a proven international-class footballer pushing for selection again will surely cheer Ferguson as he contemplates nearly another month without Carrick.</strong></p>
              <p>Carrick was an unused substitute during England's recent Euro 2012 double-header but has not started a game for United since the Community Shield triumph over Chelsea at Wembley last month.  </p>
              <p>'He has had a problem with his achilles,' added Ferguson. 'It has been bothering him for a few weeks now, so we sent him to a specialist in London yesterday and he had an injection. We are hoping that settles it down.</p>
              <p>'We have been considering what we should do about it. The best thing is to get it treated and out of the road now because everyone in the squad is fit.'</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">It means Carrick will miss tomorrow's visit to Everton, plus the home matches with Rangers and Liverpool that follow in a busy week.  </p>
              </div>
              <p>However, Ferguson will have Rio Ferdinand available for the first time this season after the defender made a quicker than expected recovery from the knee injury he suffered on the first day of World Cup training in South Africa.</p>
              <p>'Rio Ferdinand could have played for the reserves against Stockport last night,' said Ferguson. 'He wanted to play but his training performances are so good I didn't see any point. He is in the squad. With three games this week, it is good that he is back in the fold.'</p>
              <p>Anderson is unlikely to be involved tomorrow after picking up a slight knock on reserve team duty last night, although Ferguson does not believe the injury is too serious. </p>
              <p>'Anderson came off with a little niggle yesterday but it is nothing serious,' said the United chief. 'It is just the fact he has been out for a long time and he is just coming back. I don't think it will knock him back any length of time.'</p>
