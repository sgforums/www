              <p><strong>Wayne Rooney has been named Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year for 2010 after a fantastic season for United.<br><br></strong>It's the second time he's won the award, as voted for by United fans around the world, following his original success in 2006.<br><br>He won by a landslide this year, receiving 83 per cent of the votes cast on ManUtd.com. Patrice Evra and Antonio Valencia were in second and third place respectively.<br><br>On receiving the trophy, Wayne said: "I’m delighted to win the fans’ Player of the Year award. It's a special feeling and something I’m really proud of.<br><br>"The fans come and watch us all over the country and all over Europe and pay a lot of money to do it. The support they give us is unbelievable. <br><br>"If we’re playing at home and the game isn’t going right for us and we need to score a goal to win it, the fans push you on. You can feel that, you can sense that on the pitch. It’s a magical feeling really. And the fans away from home are incredible. They’re the best fans in the world."<br><br>Rooney is the first Englishman to be named United's Player of the Year since Teddy Sheringham in 2001. Should he retain it in 2011, he'll become only the second man to win it three times, emulating Cristiano Ronaldo (2004, 2007 and 2008).<br><br>Wayne's club accolade completes a personal Player of the Year hat-trick for this season, after his peers in the PFA and the nation's top football journalists in the FWA also made him their top man for 2009/10.</p>
              <p>He won a hat-trick of club awards on Tuesday night, also collecting the Players' Player of the Year accolade from Sir Alex Ferguson and the Goal of the Season trophy for his strike on the counter-attack against Arsenal on 31 January.<br><br>Wayne admitted he was "a bit surprised I got Goal of the Season. I think Michael Owen's winner against Manchester City should have won it.<br><br>"But I think the one against Arsenal was the best I scored. Most of my goals this season have been tap-ins so it was nice to be a bit more involved in the build-up for a goal like that. It was a quick break and I was tired at the end of the run! <br><br>"It's always nice to score against Arsenal. It came at an important time in the game, to make it 2-0, and it was a good goal. I was delighted with it."<br><br>Although he could narrowly miss out on a fourth championship medal this weekend, Rooney is rightly still happy with his work during 2009/10.<br><br>"This has definitely been my best season. I’ve played well and I’ve become more consistent in my goal scoring which is something I wanted to do. I’ve also scored more headers this season. To score any goal is great but to score with my head when I’m not the tallest player is extra special!"</p>
