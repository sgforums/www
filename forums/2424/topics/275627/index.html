The Scotland midfielder will voice his concern and frustration to Ferguson over his lack of first-team action when he returns to Carrington from leading his country in last nightÂ’s friendly against South Africa.</strong><br><br>The summer arrivals of Owen Hargreaves, Carlos Tevez, Nani and Anderson have pushed Fletcher down the midfield pecking order. Despite UnitedÂ’s injury problems, Fletcher has failed to start a game this season and, surprisingly, did not even make the bench for SundayÂ’s Manchester derby when Ferguson selected youngsters Chris Eagles and Fraizer Campbell ahead of him.<br><br>With the transfer window closing at the end of next week, the 23-year-old has told friends that the time may have come to quit United. Newcastle Â– who have already snapped up Alan Smith, another player who was on the first-team fringe at Old Trafford Â– and Liverpool, surprisingly, will lead the queue of clubs interested in Fletcher.<br><br>He joined United as a 16-year-old and has made 150 appearances Â– 115 starts plus 35 as a substitute Â– for the club since his debut in March 2003.<br><br></div>

Christiano Ronaldo is doing very well and now there is Nani - so time for him to say adios and pack up....though he did do well whilst filling in as emergency right back, Brown (although I think he is crap) seems to be the guy SAF favor.<br><br>So, with Fletcher sounding his dissatisfaction, who's next?
