            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">Evra's card forces reshuffle</span></strong><br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson is hoping one defender proves his fitness as another bows out ahead of next week's crucial trip to Milan.<br><br>Patrice Evra's booking for dissent in the first leg will again limit the manager's options when he selects the back four. And if Rio Ferdinand's groin injury fails to mend in time, Sir Alex will be forced to deploy Darren Fletcher out of position again - less than ideal, considering the Scot's outstanding midfield performances against Roma and Milan at Old Trafford.<br><br>"We're going to try hard to get Rio Ferdinand fit, there is some improvement," says Sir Alex.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>"But I'm anticipating I'll have to play Darren Fletcher at right-back, John O'Shea at centre-back and move Gabby to left-back."</strong></span><br><br>Milan also have concerns for the second leg, following the first leg substitutions of veteran Paolo Maldini at half-time and midfield dynamo Gennaro Gattuso eight minutes later.<br><br>Gattuso says, "I was really sorry I had to come off. But I'll do everything I can to play at the San Siro."<br><br>Whatever the line-ups, Sir Alex expects another exciting contest in Italy - the same country where United sealed a place in their last Champions League final, in 1999.<br><br>"It should be a fantastic game," says Sir Alex.<br><br>"Obviously it's not going to be easy. I think we can score, they have to score obviously. It'll not be easy but I just think we have a great chance.<br><br>"The last time we played there (Milan, 2005) it was an open match. We had four chances including a great one for Van Nistelrooy, when he blasted over from five yards, before they'd had a shot at goal. So anything's possible."<br><br>---------------------------------------------------<br><br>Richardson isnt playing  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><span class="small">Yay Athens here we come</span>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

No point fielding them and risk further injury and end up compromising on the title. If we can mgt 3-2 with the makeshift defence, good chance can pull through.<br><br>I thought Heinze works better as LB? Anyway, if field him as centre, he will still tend to drift to the left. I realised those in the centre and extreme right always like to pass to him and he will make those flank runs and filter the balls to Ronaldo or whoever in attack...seems to work quite well. Remember some goals were scored this way, like Carrick's 2nd goal in the 7-1 thrashing of Roma  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Pulling off a few good saves.<br><br>1st goal was definitely his mistake.<br><br>2nd goal was a nice flick by Scholes, pity he doesn't play for England anymore. There'd be no debate about Lampard vs Gerrard otherwise.<br><br>3rd goal was unexpected, I think Dida was expecting a cut back or pass to the centre where there were more players. Either that or he was expecting Rooney to play to the side (Man U always has someone on the wings) to cross in to the centre. Still, it was a good finish by Rooney as he hit a ball that was low and hard for keeper to get a hand to.</div>
