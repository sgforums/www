            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Ryan: We can reach the final<br><br>Ryan: We can reach the final<br><br>Ryan Giggs is confident United's character and nerve will see them through next week's Champions League semi-final decider in Milan.</strong><br><br>The Welsh veteran, skipper in the absence of Gary Neville and Rio Ferdinand, was disappointed to concede two away goals, but he is adamant that United are capable of scoring in the return leg.<br><br>"It was always going to be tough," he told MUTV. "We didn't want to give away goals but we've got to go out there with confidence.<br><br>"With the second half in mind, we know that if we keep the tempo up and keep our shape we've got a great chance of creating chances. We'll probably have to defend better, but we're capable of doing that.<br><br>"It's going to be difficult, it always is going to the San Siro, but we've seen enough in the second half to show that we can go there and get a good result. If we keep our character and nerve then hopefully we will."<br><br>Wayne Rooney's injury-time winner edged a thrilling first leg United's way, and Giggs was proud of his side's grit at overturning a 2-1 half-time deficit.<br><br>Kaka's fine brace gave the Rossoneri a strong position at the interval despite Cristiano Ronaldo's early opener, but Rooney's second half brace swung the tie back in United's favour.<br><br>"We got off to a great start," said Giggs. "Milan hit us with a bit of a sucker punch with the two goals, but in the second half we kept playing our football, kept the intensity up and we're pleased to get the two goals.<br><br>"We wanted to keep a clean sheet, away goals are key in this competition. We didn't want to give away one goal, let alone two, so that knocked the stuffing out of us a little bit. In the second half we showed a lot of patience and character.<br><br>"We just felt that we could create chances by not panicking and keeping our shape, and that's what happened.<br><br>"We feel that we're going to create chances every time we go out. Milan are a quality team so when you get those chances you have to put them away, and we put most of them away. To score so late on showed great character and ended the game on a high."<br><br>United's victory is all the more noteworthy for the fact that it was attained with only four fit defenders, with regular starters Ferdinand, Neville and Nemanja Vidic injured.<br><br>But Giggs insists United's strength in depth has smoothed what could have been a potentially crippling injury crisis.<br><br>"I don't think the injuries have fazed us really," he said. "Everyone who has come in has done a job brilliantly. That's what it's all about, using the squad this season.<br><br>"Darren Fletcher again tonight was outstanding, but that's what it's about. It's not about 11 players, it's about 20."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When the referee blown the whistle for the first half, I was feeling quite down.<br>It was as if MUFC was pressed down, and they just can't perform. They go left, right, centre, and they run into a brick wall.<br><br>Scholes was pitiful, Ronaldo was trying too much, Giggs was not doing anything other than delivering corner kicks, EdwnVS was horrible.<br>The only bright spots were Fletcher &amp; Heinze. They just did not give up.<br><br>Commentators were suggesting throwing in Ole, or Smith to get some aggression in. But deep down, I felt there is still one who has not yet get going, and that's Rooney - Baby Shrek.<br><br>I think during the 15mins, halftime break, either SAF snake-charms everyone or he bought his caterpillar boot cause everyone seems to wake up.<br><br>And Yes, the crowd was really helping, they were really harassing the Milan players. And once Gattuso was out,  and Carrick &amp; Scholes had more space.<br><br>And once we managed to score the equalizer, things started to look up.<br>On the other end, kaka was now shadowed. And Milan's attack could not get going as before.<br><br>And just when everyone is looking at a draw, Rooney pops up and plant his flag.. 3-2.<br><br>One thing, this game was respect. Players were helping each other up, and there seems to be no bad blood. Quite a good message of football.<br><br>Now MUFC just need a 1-0 in San Siro to win it.<br><br>However, as the commentators mentioned, no English Team has ever won in San Siro. EVER!!!!<br><br>Well, MUFC has broken many records, so one more won't hurt, right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

So I give him the benefit of doubts.<br><br>The one major factor of his play was to join in attack with Ronaldo, forcing Milan to have at least 3 players on the backfoot.<br><br>I think the key was to neutralize each other. if Milan choose to stop Ronaldo, then with Evra, Milan would need to sacrifice something in return.<br><br>I just wish out of those injured, someone can come back cause Evra is out next leg.

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, we got a result, although not what everyone wanted, a 2 goal conceded in the process, but at least we got a cushion. at least with a makeshift defence like ours, i am impressed, Heinze was on fire, man this guys is really a no nonsense defender, if he didn't played football, i reckon he can be a wrestler.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>At least we now can look forward to our premiership fixture, and hopefully have a couple of players back in Milan fixture 'crosses finger'<br><br>Kaka was real class i have to say, but died down i nthe second half when Milan was reduced more to defence with Kattuso and Maldini out.<br><br>Oh yea, no English Team ever won in Silsa, thats true... but hey?!! who said we needed to win to get through to the finals? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

The defence is so weak currently i don't see them able to keep a clean sheet in any match... United badly need Ferdinand and Neville back asap... I notice most of their goals concede seem to come from the right-back side...<br><br>The way its going... the team have too many injuries, current fit players will have to play a game every 3, 4 days and won't be allow to rest... Can they hold out?
