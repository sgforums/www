"All the big players are available. The only problem I have is maybe having an adequate bench, but I'm happy with the squad I've got," said the United boss. "Obviously you miss players like Rio Ferdinand and Gary Neville in big matches but the spirit is good. "We should expect a very good performance with the players we have."</strong><br><br>As well as Ferdinand and Neville, United are without Nemanja Vidic, Mikael Silvestre, Craig Cathcart, Louis Saha, Ji-Sung Park and Kieran Richardson (hamstring). Patrice Evra is only likely to be fit enough to make the bench, which could also feature the likes of Chris Eagles, Fang Zhou Dong, Kieran Lee and Michael Barnes.<br><br>United beat Roma 7-1 in their last Champions League match at Old Trafford, but while Ferguson says he does not expect a repeat against AC Milan, he is hopeful of a victory. "At this level, with the players we have, there is always going to be expectation," he said.<br><br>"The desire of the players is to reach a higher level. The quality of the opposition and the importance of the occasion demand the best performance. "The performance in the last round was very, very good and that must give the players confidence.<br><br>"They haven't done much wrong this season. The team spirit has got better because the group is getting to know each other. "I don't have any fears about it. I see the mood in the camp and it pleases me. "Yes, we have concerns about one or two injuries, but the important players are playing and it's good to have them."<br><br>AC Milan have only one injury worry, over keeper Dida, and manager Carlo Ancelotti was able to rest his key players on Saturday. "We arrive in perfect condition, relaxed and convinced," said Ancelotti. "They have some problems, but in games like these everything is solvable with great determination and concentration."<br><br></div>

Â“It was a once-in-a-lifetime result. But we should still expect a very good performance.<br><br>Â“At this level, with the players we have, there is always going to be expectation and desire among the players to reach a high level.<br><br>Â“The quality of our opponents and the occasion demand the best of our players. ItÂ’s not going to be easy to get through, but if you get to a semi final youÂ’re never going to get it easy.Â”<br><br>United will need to apply the same penetration and relentless attacking gusto of that performance two weeks ago.<br><br>Â“The performance in the last phase was very, very good,Â” added Sir Alex. Â“That must give players confidence. Winning is always a confidence booster anyway.<br><br>Â“The team spirit has become stronger over the course of the season as the players get to know each other better. There is a great coming-together of young people, which is always a good thing.<br><br>Â“I donÂ’t have any fears about it. I see the mood in the campand it pleases me. WeÂ’re always looking for signs at this time of year, warning signs about nerves.<br><br>Â“On Saturday against Middlesbrough we saw some anxiety and bad decision making in the final third of the field. But the positive thing was that nobody was hiding, everyone wanted the ball, which is a good sign.Â”<br><br>Carlo AncelottiÂ’s side will no doubt aim to be compact and stubbornly difficult to break down, but they their defensive stability is complimented with skill and guile going forward with gifted technicians like Kaka and Andrea Pirlo.<br><br>Â“We canÂ’t ignore the ability of some of the Milan players,Â” adds the boss cautiously. Â“We have to prepare that awareness for our players.<br><br>Â“But everyone is expecting us to have a go and hopefully score to give us a chance. The name of the game is that you win and donÂ’t lose a goal. ThatÂ’s our hope and what we are planning to do. It would be a massive result for us. It wonÂ’t be easy, but thatÂ’s what weÂ’re aiming for.</div>
