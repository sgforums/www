            <div class='col-md body'>ok some serious post match review...<br><br>Gilardino was really put of place last night.. can only grab a couple of shots... O shea did great with the legendary seedorf.. it was seedorf that supplied Kaka most of the opportunities.. there's a rumour that goes that Seedorf has customized boots that somehow reacts with the pitch at San Siro...dunno true or not but sounds credible  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Wes brown had a tough match last night being the "only" veteran" central defender amongst the back 4...Evra had too much going on in attacking  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> He only tire himself if he keeps going on like this in San Siro...but this through ins and one-twos are nice though... Fletcher is a workhorse.. He improved helluva lot this season and can see that he matured like a true Man Utd player...Carrick was quiet..he gave away too many balls and can see the fatigue liao..Giggs should be the MOTM imo...he attacked and defended well too..Scholes seems like he wants to make it up for his past demeanours..he stole quite alot of possession for AC and made more direct passes than through balls like he always do..Rooney and ronaldo are like bread and butter...unstoppable lah those two..and it's quite funny when the presenters of the preview show said that when Paolo maldini made his debut.. Rooney is still in his mother's tummy and Ronaldo was only 7 months old  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> but seriously, Nesta and Paolo really are jaded and they look like they are gonna collapse very soon  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

Next time they relegation threatened we ought to do them no favours as well.<br><br>Conceding 2 away goals is pretty bad. If they win 1-0, 2-1 in San Siro then Man Utd out. Hopefully Man Utd can blitz and score early against Milan over there then it will be much easier.<br><br>Defence is really troubling Man Utd. When Kaka shoot the 2nd goal, the camera turn and show the Man Utd bench with Vidic, Silvestre, Rio, G.Neville all sitting there. Can see their face they really wish to be on the field. Quite Jialat.<br><br>Anyway, Kaka is 1st yellow card so next match he still around I think.

            <div class='col-md body'>Fletcher is definately my MOTM.. He was all over the pitch, hunting down Pirlo &amp; company.. Superb &amp; timely hard tackles.. Plays like and duracell bunny..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>With him playing at this current form, we may no need Owen Hargreaves liew and save to by an out to out striker..<br><br>Tink lucky that Inzhagi never feature.. Tink the wily fox sure to score against our make shift defense.. Lucky Maidini injured 2nd half, Milan defense loop-hole than started appearing..<br><br>Scholes chip was magnificently jaw dropping, tink its takes credit off Rooney's finishing.. Giggs last minute pass was time to perfection.. Of coz Rooney had a magnificent run down too..<br><br>Basically the lads played very well in all department, tink Ronaldo tried too hard to out perform in Kaka presence.. Lost his focus on the team game, played like when he 1st joined United.. Quite disappointing..<br><br>Thumbs up for the lads..
