It's a good partnership. It has pace and strength.<br><br>There is a good balance between the two of them.<br><br>"And I expect a bit more authority from Vidic. This will be his third season, he came halfway through the first and it took him time to adjust. But I am very excited about him.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"We saw him come off in a friendly last week with five stitches - and he's smiling.</span><br><br>Big Pally would have been crying about his good looks. I remember the season he broke his nose for the first time. He said he was going to sue me!"<br><br>Pallister, like Ferdinand, was the ball-playing half of his partnership while Bruce was a man to be reckoned with in either box, a fearless attacker of the ball, and Vidic is developing that same reputation.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"Vidic has qualities like Brucey," said Ferguson. "He'd stick his head in and ask the defender, 'Do you want to get hurt? I'm putting my head in there and if you want to get the ball you're going to have to put it in front of mine.'</span><br><br>"Of course Steve's nose was long gone when he was doing that for us. He looked like Bernard Cribbins then - and he looks more like him now his hair's going white!"<br><br>United will be hoping to maintain the remarkable record of defending Premier League champions. The previous season's title winners have never lost the opening match of the next campaign, with victories in 13 of the 14 games in question. Ferguson must have dozed lazily in the French Riviera sun as he recharged his batteries this summer.<br><br>For the Old Trafford boss, however, the work ethic is impossible to ignore for long.<br><br>Ferguson paints a revealing cameo that proves to Jose Mourinho, Rafa Benitez, Arsene Wenger and the rest that the hunger remains as intense as ever, saying: "The thing about being on holiday is that you get the fixture list. And as soon as you get that fixture list you start to plan.<br><br>"You are looking at the first six games, the last six games, your New Year programme, the games after European matches, which ones you think you'll need changes in.<br><br>"The fire may die a little in the summer, but not for long."</div>
