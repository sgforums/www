            <div class='col-md body'>Cristiano Ronaldo has called a truce in his feud with Jose Mourinho and wished his fellow countryman all the best for the future.<br><br>The pair became embroiled in a major row at the end of last season, which ended with the former Chelsea boss claiming Manchester United star Ronaldo 'lacked class'.<br><br>His attack brought a stinging response from Sir Alex Ferguson, who felt compelled to stand up for his star man, marking the low point in what was generally a cordial relationship between the Scot and former Chelsea boss Mourinho.<br><br>However, Ronaldo has shown he bears no grudge towards Mourinho and feels the loss of the Portuguese coach will leave a hole in the Premier League.<br><br>'English football will miss Jose Mourinho,' said Ronaldo.<br><br>'He is a great manager.<br><br>'He won a lot of things in England and the titles speak for themselves.<br><br>'Maybe he wants a new experience but I wish him all the best.'<br><br>Ronaldo did not say whether he felt Mourinho's exit would have an adverse effect on Chelsea's title challenge this term.<br><br>However, with just two points from their last four games heading into this weekend, Avram Grant has a major job on his hands to rekindle hopes of a third championship in four seasons for the Stamford Bridge outfit.<br><br>Whether Grant achieves his aim or not, Ronaldo is convinced United are destined for at least one major honour this season despite their own slow start.</div>

Ronaldo with his form and talent, can play in any team. Its the manager or mourinho the one that might need him instead. If mourinho does become portugal team coach (which i think rather slim chance of this happening anytime soon) Its Ronaldo the one that he will need to please... If the "Star Player" in the squad won't play for you... Chances are their FA won't consider him for the post even...<br><br>Anyway, it just show that Ronny is more of a gentleman than jose will ever be...</div>
