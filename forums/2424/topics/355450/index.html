              <p><strong>Wayne Rooney is fit to face Sunderland on Saturday and Rio Ferdinand is back in training ahead of the trip to the North East. </strong></p>
              <p>The England internationals could both be involved at The Stadium of
              Light if Sir Alex Ferguson decides to gamble on the fitness of key
              defender Ferdinand, even though the early indications are that the game
              will come too soon for him.</p>
              <p>With Jonny Evans out with an ankle injury, the United boss is likely
              to give Ferdinand every chance to feature on Wearside, with Gary
              Neville or John O'Shea alternative options as partners for Nemanja
              Vidic.</p>
              <p>However, the midweek trip to Portugal may turn out to be a more
              realistic target for the centre back's comeback as Ferguson does not
              want to risk aggravating the groin injury.</p>
              <p>"I don't think they'll be fit," said Ferguson of Evans and
              Ferdinand. "We'tr ying our best but, in which case, John O'Shea will
              play centre back and Gary Neville at right back.</p>
              <p>"Rio's started to run today and hopefully we'll get him ready for Wednesday's game.</p>
              <p>"Rafael has started training this week, on Tuesday, and he needs a
              few days' training but he will be available for next Saturday. That's
              some good news. Wes Brown is not far away. He'll start football
              training next week. We need these defenders back as they'll make a hell
              of a difference to us, no question.</p>
              <p>"In these situations, we want our experienced players playing all
              the time. Unfortunately, we didn't have that with Vidic's suspension
              and Rio and Gary have been injured. A collection of players like that
              coming back will be good for us."</p>
              <p>Dimitar Berbatov could be back in time from his ankle problem in
              time to face Porto in what is almost certainly a must-win game in the
              Champions League but his absence is offset this weekend by Rooney's
              availability.</p>
              <p>The former Everton attacker was dealt a painful blow by the ball on
              Tuesday night but has been passed fit to lead the line against Ricky
              Sbragia's struggling Black Cats.</p>
