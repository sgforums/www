              <p>Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney
              has managed to avoid the further three match ban many feared he would
              be awarded following his show of petulance at Fulham on Saturday after
              being sent off for receiving a second yellow card when he hurled the
              ball back at referee Phil Dowd for a free-kick to be taken.</p>
              <p>Dowd has confirmed that he wasn't sworn at by Rooney, and there will
              therefore be no upgrading of his standard one-match ban for receiving
              two yellow cards. The FA will be writing to the player though to
              formally warn him over his future conduct after he punched the corner
              flag on his way to the tunnel after his sending off.</p>
              <p>"We have clarified with Phil Dowd that there was no abuse from the
              player after he was dismissed," an FA spokesman is reported as saying
              in <em>The Times</em>.</p>
              <p>"In relation to the incident when he punched the corner flag, the
              referee did not see that and we have written to Wayne Rooney reminding
              him of his responsibilities."</p>
              <p>That means that the England international is now set to miss only
              United's game with Aston Villa, which takes place at Old Trafford on
              April 5.</p>
              <p>Paul Scholes was also sent off for United, for deliberate handball,
              as Fulham dented the Mancunians' title hopes just a little by beating
              them 2-0.</p>

              scholes was quite clear cut, but Rooney's one, is debatable.
              
              Can get the ref to reloook as rooney just wanted to get the game restarted, hence he threw back the ball, but he is also pissed off with the ref decision.
              
              It's a catch 11 situation.

              heard from ESPN that its controlled aggression. Some said he was overly aggressive, needed to tone down and the other said the ref was wrong to sent him off, as the ball did not hit the ref and he wanted the game restarted quickly.
              
              But its secondary now, cos its already over. What I want to know was, why was Rooney a sub in the first place. shouldnt he start the game with tevez as sub as usual. 
              
              When he came for Berbatov in the second half, Man Utd improved and he nearly scored despite playing with 10 man.
