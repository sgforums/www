              <p>Sunderland loan star Danny Welbeck is refusing to make a decision on his future after Black Cats boss Steve Bruce confirmed his desire to sign him on a permanent basis.</p>
              <p>The Manchester United starlet has impressed in the early stages of his season-long deal at the Stadium of Light.</p>
              <p>Bruce has wasted little time in declaring his ambition to sign the England Under-21 international on a permanent basis.</p>
              <p>But 19-year-old Welbeck admits he has not considered his future just yet, saying: "I've seen what Steve Bruce has said and I need to make a decision on my future.</p>
              <p>"For now, I'm looking short term. I just want to do my best in every game and I'm not thinking about whether I go back to United.</p>
              <p>"My aim was to come here and get minutes on the pitch.</p>
              <p>"At United, I was getting the odd chance here and there but I was never ready to take them. I'd miss loads of games and then I'd be thrown in and would struggle to do myself justice.</p>
              <p>"It's different here. I'm playing every game and I'm getting better and better. You can see I am benefiting from it.</p>
              <p>"I'm confident and I'm really enjoying my football."</p>
              <p>Welbeck has spent most of his time on Wearside playing on the wing, but he was given the chance to play through the middle against Everton on Monday and scored twice.</p>
              <p>And he was delighted to show what he could do, adding: "We've relied too heavily on (Darren) Bent and (Asamoah) Gyan, so it's nice to finally contribute.</p>
              <p>"It's taken me a bit of time but that's three in two and I've got to be happy with that.</p>
              <p>"We're a great, hungry, young team who just want to go as far in the game as we can.</p>
              <p>"The manager has had a massive influence on me. He's shown a lot of faith and I owe him a lot of thanks.</p>
              <p>"I'm learning my trade. I'm still developing. This experience is good for me and can only help."</p>
