              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher is hoping a pain-easing injection will delay the need for ankle surgery until next summer.</span><span><span id="intelliTXT">Â </span></span></p>
              <p>The Scot returned to action after a month on the sidelines in Tuesday's six-goal thriller with CSKA Moscow in the Champions League.</p>
              <p>It should mean Fletcher will face Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Sunday, when United attempt to depose the current Premier League leaders.</p>
              <p>However, the Scotland star knows he will still be experiencing an element of discomfort from a long-standing injury he aggravated against Sunderland last month, which he accepts will eventually consign him to surgery.</p>
              <p>"A bit of bone has broken off the back of my ankle and stuck out about an inch," he revealed.</p>
              <p>"Every time I bend, it is causing a bit of pain so I have had an injection to clear it up for a while.</p>
              <p>"It should be okay to the end of the season but the plan is to get me through to the summer and then do something then."</p>
              <p>Scotland's failure to qualify for next year's World Cup Finals in South Africa provides the perfect gap for Fletcher to have the operation.</p>
              <p>"I have had it for a couple of years now and the build-up of fluid and other medical things the doctors know more about than me has been constantly aggravating it," he said.</p>
              <p>"Striking a ball or bending the ankle in a flexed position or pushing off it hurts.</p>
              <p>"It got to the point where it was too sore to train and play. Something had to be done and I had the injection."</p>
              <p>It would seem certain Fletcher will be one of the first names on Sir Alex Ferguson's team-sheet on Sunday.</p>
              <p>Certainly, United missed Fletcher's battling qualities against Liverpool a fortnight ago, with the hole his injury left proving just as troublesome to fill as it did in Rome last May, when Barcelona ran riot in the Champions League final.</p>
              <p>Ferguson is unlikely to leave his team similarly exposed at the weekend now Fletcher is a proven top-class performer.</p>
              <p>For a player whose early days in the Red Devils' first-team were dismissed rather crudely, the plaudits that have followed recently must sound nice.</p>
              <p>But Fletcher insists he is not taking them too seriously.</p>
              <p>"I take the compliments with a pinch of salt," he said.</p>
              <p>"I enjoy these matches as much as anyone and I put pressure on myself to perform more than anyone does.</p>
              <p>"The challenge of playing against the top-class players that Chelsea have is one I look forward to and I will be doing my best to win the match.</p>
              <p>"But I am not going to make or break a game like this."</p>
