              <p>“I was there for two years and Sir Alex never called or sent any text messages in that time.</p>
              <p>“The only time he talked to me was after a match against Roma to
                  discuss a situation about going to play for Argentina. It doesn’t seem
                  that this is the way to treat a player in two years at the club. It
                  doesn’t seem there is a line of communication.”</p>

              <p>“From the moment I arrived, he has treated me with
                  respect as a person. His greatest quality is that, for him, there are
                  no star players - everyone is equal, whether they cost many millions or
                  are a young player who hasn’t played many times for the team. When I
                  see him work he reminds me of Carlos Bianchi, who was my coach at Boca
                  Juniors in Argentina. Both have had a big influence on my career, and
                  both know how to treat people.”</p>

              <p>“We have not started talks with Manchester United yet,
                  though I am keen to stay. Sir Alex Ferguson has told me he wants me to
                  remain a United player and that is certainly my desire too. My contract
                  ends in the summer and we have agreed to sit down at the end of the
                  season and discuss a new contract, nothing I have heard from the club
                  suggests it will be otherwise. There is simply no reason to sit down
                  now. I have a great relationship with Sir Alex and I hope that will
                  continue long into the future.”</p>

              <p>Even though i am an arsenal fan, i have the utmost respect for ferguson. I dont believe what tevez has said of ferguson. Ferguson has to make a choice, to let tevez leave or stay. He made his choice.</p>
              <p>Tevez should just accept this and stop crying like a crybaby. It has happened so long ago, and now he is a city player then just so be it. Join the city revolution and earn your big bucks.</p>
              <p>This is the end of the story. But I still love to see tevez scoring against man utd and ferguson's reaction after that.</p>
              <p>City would be strong with Santa cruz, Tevez, Robinho, (possibly) adebayor and Terry. With barry, ireland, wright philips, they have one of the better attacking force in the EPL. But I reckon, they will still be outside the top 4, because of hughes.</p>

              <p>He's obviously lying as he is contradicting himself during media rants.</p>
              <p>Whatever it is, lets move on shall we? Do we really need to know who's lying? A proposal to sign him was already given and he certainly should not need a call from Ferguson to convince him to stay when all this while he has been claiming his desire to stay.</p>
              <p>He has signed for City. Let him be. An empty vessel makes the most noise. It is clear he's bitter or he will have move on by now.</p>
              <p>As a professional, he should know that he has not dont well enough last season (albeit all the running) and certainly does not justify a confirmed place in the starting 11. We'll see how he copes at City; where there are more strikers fighting for places, no European games, where the team spirit will not be as high as Utd's and a likelihood that the owners will not be so patient.</p>
              <p>Good luck to him. He'll need it.</p>

              <p>Manchester City new-boy Carlos Tevez has had more to say about his former boss Sir Alex Ferguson.</p>
              <p>According to the <em>Sunday Mirror</em>, the Argentine international has insisted that Ferguson was the reason he left Old Trafford and he admitted that he does not know whether he will shake his hand when he next sees him.</p>
              <p>"There is no mystery why I left United and Alex gave me all the reasons to leave," said the striker. "I did not play an important role in any of the important games.</p>
              <p>"In the Champions League I didn't play, I didn't play in the derby.</p>
              <p>"I tried several times to speak to him, to express my feelings, but the only thing he'd say was 'don't worry, don't worry, this is going to change'.</p>
              <p>"He never gave any justification or explanation - I don't know if I will shake his hand this season."</p>
              <p>Tevez also went on to thank his Manchester United team-mates for all their efforts in attempting to make him stay.</p>
              <p>"My team-mates tried several times to convince me to stay and that things would change," he revealed. "I'm always very thankful to them and we had a very good relationship, because we won a lot of things in two years."</p>
              <p>Yet, despite his colleagues' protests, Tevez decided to swap the red half of Manchester for the blue and he believes that he can win trophies at City.</p>
              <p>"If I didn't think that City would win titles, I could have stayed at home with my daughters," he added. "I want to give the best to help the team develop and win trophies."</p>

              <p>Lets face it...Utd paid (i think) 10m per season for his services (he is considered on loan) so 2 seasons means 20m. Isnt that a fair price for his services? I think so.</p>
              <p>If you are with a company on a 2-yr contract and at the end of ur contract, there is a clause stating should the company want to retain ur services, they have to pay additional fees, the company would certainly think whether it is worth to pay that certain amount based on ur performances for the past 2 yrs.</p>
              <p>Its simple, if the company says no, they are not at fault coz u signed a 2-yr contract.</p>
              <p>This applies to the Tevez situation though Utd came in with an offer but he decides to go to City. Worse, he blames the manager and has not stopped spouting nonsense and lies since. In a business world, an employee could have been sued for defamation.</p>

              <p><strong></strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/sir-alex-ferguson"><span style="color: #005689;">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></a> tonight said the reason <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/carlos-tevez"><span style="color: #005689;">Carlos Tevez</span></a> was no longer at Old Trafford was that the striker was not worth the £25m fee his adviser, Kia Joorabchian, had been demanding. The split between the Argentina striker and his former manager has been bitter, with Tevez accusing Ferguson and the club of refusing to speak to him about extending his two-year loan, which expired last month.</p>
              <p>"We made contact with Carlos," Ferguson retorted. "We sent him texts and spoke to him when he was in Argentina. Our chief executive, David Gill, made an offer to Kia Joorabchian and we spoke to Tevez before we played Inter Milan [in March] and told him we had spoken to Kia but we never heard back.</p>
              <p>"In my opinion, I don't think he was worth £25m. He was popular with the supporters. The fans quite rightly have their heroes and I was happy to go along with the deal as long as it was the right one but, quite simply, he is not worth £25m."</p>
              <p>That Tevez has gone from the world champions to a side that finished ninth in the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague"><span style="color: #005689;">Premier League</span></a> is, say sources at United, proof that money is the main motivating force for those players who have joined Manchester City. However despite an outlay of £200m under the manager, Mark Hughes, Ferguson doubts City will achieve their aim of breaking into the Champions League positions.</p>
              <p>"Well, you just name their best team and then ask where it would go and you would have to say that they would struggle to get into the top four. It is understandable they should go for John Terry, given the money they have got. They have made their intentions known, so if I were in City's shoes with all that money, I would have a go at doing that myself. He has the experience and he is captain of England."</p>
