              Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson is not hopeful of overturning the red card that rules Darren Fletcher out of the Champions League final. 
              
              Fletcher was harshly dismissed in the win over Arsenal and Uefa is to make a decision on Monday after United wrote to them on the matter. 
              
              "I am not optimistic at all," said Ferguson. "We have to do it for Darren and sometimes, you never know. 
              
              "I don't think it will be overturned. The referee made an honest decision." 
              
              Fletcher was sent off towards the end of the semi-final second-leg victory over Arsenal for a challenge on Cesc Fabregas that resulted in a penalty. 
              
              However, replays made it clear that the United player had in fact made contact with the ball. 
              
              
              Ferguson said the decision was "a tragedy", while Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger admitted the call was "very harsh", but initially Uefa said there was no right of appeal unless the referee made an error in identifying the player. 
              
              However, Uefa general secretary David Taylor gave the Old Trafford outfit hope of contesting the decision and Fletcher being available to play Barcelona on 27 May in Rome. 
              
              "The likelihood is we'd refer it to our disciplinary body," Taylor told BBC World Service. "They'd see if there were circumstances to justify a departure from procedure. 
              
              "I must stress there is normally no way these matters can be overturned. 
              
              Fletcher, 25, was an unused substitute in last season's Champions League final win on penalties over Chelsea and has played an important part in helping his side reach the final. 
              
              He walked off without protest after being red-carded and Ferguson has praised his reaction over a decision which is set to see him miss out on the showpiece game. 
              
              "Darren is quite a placid lad," said Ferguson.
              
              "He is not an over-emotional boy. He just accepts it. He takes great credit for the way he handled it. 
              
              "I honestly believed the referee made the right decision at the time. From his angle - and from mine - it looked like a penalty. 
              
              "It was only when I saw the replay that I saw that Darren had managed to get his leg round Fabregas and flick the ball away. 
              
              "Darren is an honest player, so honest if he had been an old stager he would probably have let him go on and score. 
              
              "But he was still determined to try and do his job and prevent a goal. In the process he gave away a penalty." 
              
              The Football Association uses videos to investigate decisions and Ferguson believes the fact the Uefa does not is a flaw. 
              
              "It seems to be a weakness in Uefa that part," he said.
