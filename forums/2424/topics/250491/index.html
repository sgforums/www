            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Hat-Trick for Cristiano as he's now named PFA Fans' Player of the Year 2007<br><br>On Sunday night, Cristiano Ronaldo was crowned both Players' Player and Young Player of the Year and, as he prepares to put AC Milan to the sword tonight, the Manchester United winger has another good reason to celebrate as he has also been voted the Official PFA Fans' Player of the Year. </strong><br><br>It has been an incredible season for the very personable Portuguese star who continues to set the football world alight with his dazzling skills and the equally-dazzling smile that was very much on view as he was suitably honoured by his fellow professionals this weekend at the PFA's Grosvenor House Hotel extravaganza.<br><br>There's still plenty of hard work for Ronaldo and his United colleagues to do as they chase another trophy treble, and Cristiano reckons the best is still to come. "Maybe its destiny to win them all because we are playing so well," he told us. "I think the best things are still to come from me too. We have three competitions to play for. We have everything to win and we have a great chance.'<br><br>United boss Sir Alex Ferguson, himself an award winner on Sunday night, paid tribute to his 22-year-old jewel in the crown by saying: "Hes been fantastic. His improvement and development have been superb. He is the best player in the world. Its easy for a manager to say that but hes getting that accolade from everywhere, not just me. When that happens it is difficult for some players but he is so level-headed.'<br><br>Ronaldo has won over everyone since 'you know what' happened at the World Cup and he, and the family members who attended the Player of the Year dinner in London, has every reason to feel supremely proud. The Portuguese star added: "I put myself to the test and it succeeded. The pressures ended up strengthening me and the boos gave me even more strength. Ive matured and calmed down, and these awards have given me even more motivation to be successful."<br><br>PFA Chief Executive Gordon Taylor also paid tribute to our treble award winner, saying: "He is the most exciting player in the country at the moment. The quickness of his feet and the skills he possesses make you think, at times, that he's from another planet.<br><br>"This season was a big test for him, both of his temperament and his ability to rise above the abuse he received after the incident with Wayne Rooney at the World Cup, and he has passed with flying colours in every department.<br><br>"I wasn't sure, after the World Cup, if things would get back to normal at Old Trafford, but Cristiano has shown great maturity and proved himself to be a top, top player. All credit to Sir Alex for resolving what was a difficult situation. All credit to Cristiano too because he has developed from a player who perhaps used to run down too many closed avenues in his early days at United, to a wonderful entertainer whose tricks and skills are much more constructive, and productive, these days.<br><br>"He is much more of a team player now and, as is the test of all great forwards, he knows how to find the back of the net - as he has done on so many occasions this season. He has still got all the tricks and, if he was to perform them on the stage at the London Palladium, you would have to stand up and applaud. "For him to be able to perform them on a football field, at full speed with everything going on around him, makes it all the more remarkable and it is great that Sir Alex continues to encourage him to do so, whereas at some clubs he might have been told to 'keep it simple'."<br><br>Fans' Player of the Year in the Championship is Matt Murray who also had the honour at the weekend of being voted, by his fellow pros, as the top stopper in his division, and with Wolves currently occupying a play-off position it could be a memorable end to what has been a fantastic season for the Molineux keeper.<br><br>And what a season it has been for Scunthorpe striker Billy Sharp - 30+ goals and promotion to the Championship - and he is a worthy winner of the Fans' Player of the Year award in League One. His manager, Nigel Adkins, is full of praise for his star striker and says: "He's been magnificent for us, not just this season but also last. We are not a one-man band, it's very much a team effort, but it was fitting that Billy got the goals that sealed our promotion - I'm so proud."<br><br>Another player who could soon be celebrating promotion is Swindon's Lee Peacock who has been named by givemefootball readers as the Fans' Player of the Year in League Two.
