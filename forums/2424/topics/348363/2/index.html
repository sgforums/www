              <p><strong>Jose Mourinho last night mocked the idea that Manchester United are so good they are "untouchable". The Inter Milan boss laughed when he heard United had been given the tag by Arsene Wenger.</strong></p>
              <p>And he stoked the tension ahead of Inter's Champions League clash with United here tomorrow by promising KEVIN NOLAN apologised to Everton's Victor Anichebe at half-time after his dangerous two-footed lunge crocked the striker.</p>
              <p>The Newcastle midfielder was shown a straight red card for his horror tackle in the 44th minute, which left his side would punish any complacency in their opponents.</p>
              <p>"Untouchable ... no," said Mourinho when told of the way this United side is regarded in the Premier League. "I hope United think like that, though, because they're not untouchable."</p>
              <p>Inter remained nine points clear at the top of Serie A with a 2-1 win at struggling Bologna on Saturday.</p>
              <p>But even though they were not convincing and played with little of the fluency or panache that has marked out so many of United's performances this season, Mourinho insisted his players would be a match for Sir Alex Ferguson's side.</p>
              <p>"It doesn't matter how many of my team could get into theirs because my team is more than the sum of the parts," added Mourinho.</p>
              <p>"Players don't play individually. It's team play and United is not better than my team. We will beat them."</p>

              <p><strong>Manchester United's injury crisis has deepened ahead of their Champions League last 16 first-leg tie against Inter Milan at the San Siro, as Brazilian defender </strong><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=25409"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Rafael Da Silva</strong></span></a><strong> failed to board the team's flight to Italy.</strong></p>
              <p>The teenager reportedly injured himself during the 2-1 win against Blackburn at Old Trafford on Saturday, though the nature of the problem is not known. While <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=24529"><span style="color: #000000;">Nemanja Vidic</span></a> is suspended and England duo <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=8862"><span style="color: #000000;">Gary Neville</span></a> and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=8866"><span style="color: #000000;">Wes Brown</span></a> both ruled out through injury, there are also doubts over the fitness of <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=7624"><span style="color: #000000;">John O'Shea</span></a> and <a href="http://sgforums.com/players/profile?id=83176&amp;cc=4716"><span style="color: #000000;">Jonny Evans</span></a>, although they both boarded the flight.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The six United defenders who have travelled to Milan are: </span><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=7825"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Rio Ferdinand</span></a><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=21931"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Patrice Evra</span></a><span style="color: #ff0000;">, O'Shea, Evans, Fabio Da Silva (Rafael's twin) and </span><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=108326"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Richard Eckersley</span></a><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span></p>
              <p>While the fitness of O'Shea and Evans cannot be guaranteed, the fact they were able to make the journey suggested Ferguson is optimistic he will be able to call on one of them.</p>
              <p><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=8871"><span style="color: #000000;">Darren Fletcher</span></a> is also available, should Ferguson require him, while <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=7971"><span style="color: #000000;">Michael Carrick</span></a> has been tipped to slot into defence if he is needed. The midfielder believes that despite the problems, United should still overcome Jose Mourinho's men.</p>
              <p>''Inter are as tough an opponent as we could get right now,'' said Carrick. ''They are in good form at the top of their league. ''We are both probably amongst the top four or five in Europe at the moment but that is what the Champions League is all about. You have to defeat the best if you want to win it.''</p>
              <p>Carrick watched on last week as Inter overcame a Milan side including David Beckham in the derby at the San Siro, although that did not come as a surprise.</p>
              <p>''Inter were good but we know what to expect anyway,'' he said. ''Going to the San Siro to play Inter is a massive game and a big test for us. Over the past two years we have been very consistent in the Champions League.</p>
              <p>''We have not suffered any defeats since the last time we went to the San Siro and hopefully we can keep that run going.''</p>

              <h1>Beckham 'Can't Wait' For Manchester United - Inter Clash</h1>
              <p><img src="http://i43.tinypic.com/iypf8m.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>David Beckham attended Manchester United's training
              session in Milan the San Siro earlier, ahead of their Champions League
              match-up with Inter tomorrow night, and spoke about the massive sense
              of anticipation he is feeling prior to the tie, even though he is not
              playing.</p>
              <p>"I can't wait," the England midfielder told Manchester United's
              official website. "I haven't been to many United games since I left so
              as soon as this match was announced I looked to see if I was still
              going to be in Milan when it would be played.</p>
              <p>"I'm so excited about it, but it's also a great opportunity to see
              the likes of Rio [Ferdinand], Wazza [Wayne Rooney] and, of course,
              Giggsy [Ryan Giggs] and Scholesy [Paul Scholes] who I haven't seen for
              a while.</p>
              <p>It's a match between two of the biggest clubs in the world and two
              great teams who are both in top form, so it's got the makings of a
              fantastic game. Both managers are so experienced so technically and
              tactically I'm sure it'll be a very tight contest."</p>
              <p>The iconic midfielder went on to reiterate his undying loyalty as a
              supporter of Manchester United, and expressed hopes that they could go
              on and capture a historic 'quadruple' of trophies.</p>
              <p>"Oh yes, I've been a United fan all and always will be," he
              continued. "I've still got friends in the team who I played with at Old
              Trafford and still play with for England. So I always follow how
              they're doing.<br><br>"I really hope they'll win every one of them. It
              would be amazing if they could. It was a fantastic achievement when we
              won the Treble in '99 and for them to be involved in four competitions
              this season is brilliant - as a player there's nothing better than
              that. Hopefully they can do it."</p>
              <p>As for the key to beating Inter, Beckham felt that it might well be
              to stop their deadly front two of Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Adriano from
              performing at their best.</p>
              <p>"Inter have got top players throughout their team, but, yes, the two
              forwards are the players who can cause the most problems," Beckham
              explained.</p>
              <p>"But United have got great defenders and don't forget, Inter will also be worried about the players United have got in attack."</p>
              <p>With all the talk of 'quadruples' and 'domestic clean sweeps' that's
              currently doing the rounds, Beckham also felt that the current United
              team was every beat as good as the one with which he won a famous
              'treble' in 1999.</p>
              <p>"Yes definitely," he affirmed. "It's so strong all the way through
              from the goalkeeper to the strikers. It's an amazing squad of players
              and I'm sure they'll go on to achieve great things."</p>

              <p>I am thinking that the best United can hope for is a draw for this match...</p>
              <p>Base on their current CL matches record away from home, they usually don't do as well away in Europe. That year they beat Roma 7 - 1, they even lost to Roma 2 - 1 in the first leg in Italy. So, thats why I say if they can get a score draw, its a very good result already... A scoreless draw is still ok i guess... I feel even if they lose by 2-1, I still think they can make it up at OT. A win is like a big bonus to me with the current problems they have in their defence... </p>

              <p>good job by our fellas to keep a clean sheet, if i recall, it's an european record now for VDS right?</p>
              <p>but sad we didn't get an away goal, CR7 came so close so many times.1st time in a long time so many of his free kick on target but suay never score, if is against EPL team he sure got a few from his free kicks le.</p>
              <p>anyway, we've got the league cup finals to look forward to this wkend</p>
