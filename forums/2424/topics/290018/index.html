            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.soccerbid.co.uk/listman/listings/images/868_1.jpg"><br><br>Another milestone for Sir Alex Ferguson, his 21st anniversary today at Manchester United as the most consistently successful manager in the history of English football Â– and another need to ask the questions that will probably never go away as long as he draws a competitive breath. They follow him in a pack.<br><br>How it is that he acquires years but not age? Why is it that his partiality still burns like some tinder-box canyon in southern California? Can it be true that he still takes offence quicker than a hell-fire preacher in a bawdy house?<br><br>Will he ever mellow? Will he ever take off the clothes of a curmudgeon when things do not go quite as well as he likes?<br><br>No, he will not Â– not as long as he does what he does so masterfully. Not if he fights harder than some kid trying to make his way. No, it is not always attractive. Indeed, sometimes it is more than a little outrageous. The weekend saw a classic effusion.<br><br>The huge consensus was that it was a match of beautiful ambition Â– and quite a lot of beautiful content Â– at the Emirates. Arsenal and United shared the points and the praise, but there was Fergie raging on about a few head-banging Gooners who behaved pretty much as their United counterparts do the moment ArsÃ¨ne Wenger takes his place at Old Trafford.<br><br>Howard Webb, a referee on whom Ferguson has been known to heap praise, was the author of United's failure to win the game. He favoured Arsenal. Of course. It couldn't have been the resilience of Arsenal's new captain, William Gallas, and the unstaunchable enterprise of Cesc Fabregas.<br><br>To allow that would have broken one of Ferguson's cardinal beliefs. It is that, for his United, victory is not a goal but a right. Ferguson doesn't believe in defeat or even parity; it is not something that just happens, it is a sinister development which has to be explained and, having done that to his satisfaction, he can return to the essential business of not letting it happen again.<br><br>Twenty-one years at one football place, 21 years when ambition is rekindled as formally as we turn back and forward the clocks, is a phenomenal circumstance, and permits no routine explanation. It is true that his great predecessor Sir Matt Busby went 23 unbroken years at Old Trafford, built three great teams and survived, bruised and agonised in the spirit, the tragedy of Munich. But then if Sir Matt climbed great pinnacles, he also had years of pause, gaps in success that would have tormented Ferguson to the point of distraction.<br><br>Because of his nature, Busby was easier on himself Â– and the rest of the world. Ferguson has never stopped running, in ecstasy at moments of supreme triumph, and in anger when things haven't worked so well. He is fuelled by joy and rage and adrenalin. In another man it might be a toxic mix. For Fergie is it is life-sustaining.<br><br>Consider the ground he has covered, how much more of it there is now than that of the great Scottish triumvirate around whose examples he shaped his youthful ambition, Busby, Jock Stein and Bill Shankly. Busby, weary of all the accumulated pressure, said that enough was enough when he faced a fourth rebuilding challenge in the wake of the 1968 European Cup triumph. With Best, Charlton and Law heading towards the horizon, Busby just couldn't go again. He was 62 Â– the same age as Stein when he died on the Ninian Park touchline while managing Scotland. Shankly was 60 when he walked away from Anfield. Ferguson will be 66 on the last day of December. Time to act like a guy who owns a bus pass? Not with Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo and the likely lad from Brazil, Anderson, still in the foothills of their careers.<br><br>For some the celebration of Ferguson's 21 years at Old Trafford needs to be muted. Yes, he has proved himself a natural-born winner, but what about his bullying style, his refusal to see any point of view but his own? Someone said he could have caused a row among the flower people of Woodstock, possibly even at the Last Supper. No doubt they are right, but then Ferguson is what he is and the results have been tumultuous. If we salute Wenger for the artistry of his football Â– and recognition is, understandably enough, running at a flood time now Â– is he any better able to step away from the trenches than his fiercest rival? Does it not hurt him just as badly to lose, and are the results often not equally unedifying? Of course, the answers are yes.<br><br>Today we have to judge Ferguson on his work and who can say that, when you bring it all together, it does not represent a hugely rich contribution to the English game? He has given us great players, underpinned by ceaseless ambition, and if there has been ruthlessness, if such separate characters as Roy Keane and David Beckham have been let go without, in the end, a sliver of sentimentality, it has been the mark of his understanding of how to develop a team. Like Busby, he has made three championship teams. Unlike Busby, he has been careless in the matter of creating waves of controversy Â– and shaping his image. His signings have not been unerringly brilliant and sometimes his tactics have been open to question.<br><br>But now we are in the margins of astonishing achievement. Above all, he has demanded competitive honesty from his players, and never was the result more spectacular than at the Nou Camp in 1999, when a team who looked beaten found something that carried them beyond the normal boundaries of commitment. He could have gone then, with the historic hat-trick of league title, FA Cup and European Cup gathered in at the age of 57, and of course some urged him to do so. The advice has punctuated recent years, but, except for one period of indecision, it has been brusquely rejected.<br><br>In this we find the great and continuing redemption of Alex Ferguson. He cares less for his reputation as a gentleman of sport than the sting of battle. He ignites the game to which he has devoted his life and because he cares so much, and whatever we think of his style, so do we. It means that today the toast is not so much to a unique football manager as the sheer force of life.<br><br><a href="http://sport.independent.co.uk/football/comment/article3132449.ece" rel="nofollow">http://sport.independent.co.uk/football/comment/article3132449.ece</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>ALEX FERGUSON celebrates 21 years at Manchester United today. </strong><br><br><img src="http://i21.tinypic.com/2w55d0n.jpg"><br><br>Those 21 years as manager have brought 20 major trophies and a thousand memories to savour.<br><br>When he arrived from Aberdeen on November 6, 1986 FergusonÂ’s personal goal was to overhaul Liverpool as the dominant force in English football.<br><br>Within seven years, that mission was accomplished, as United landed their first league title since 1967.<br><br>Here SunSport brings you the 21 happiest memories of his time at the helm of the worldÂ’s biggest football club.<br><br><strong>MEMORY 1:</strong> Â‘The Miracle at the Nou CampÂ’, it was called in his autobiography. And few who witnessed the two goals in injury time that denied Bayern Munich and clinched the 1999 Champions League crown would argue with that description.<br><br><strong>MEMORIES 2-10:</strong> The nine titles Ferguson has brought to Old Trafford. The first in 1993 set the ball rolling, to win on the final game at home to Tottenham in 1999 was another amazing chapter in the epic Treble season and last season will be looked upon by Ferguson as the start of a new era.<br><br><strong>MEMORY 11:</strong> Steve BruceÂ’s two last-gasp headers to seal a 2-1 Old Trafford win over Sheffield Wednesday on April 10, 1993 had Ferguson holding his arms aloft and coach Brian Kidd kneeling on the pitch in thanks as United stayed on course for the title.<br><br><strong>MEMORIES 12-16:</strong> Many blame United for ruining the FA Cup by pulling out in January 2000 to compete in the World Club Cup in Brazil. Yet few clubs have treated it with such reverence. They have won it a record 11 times, five under Ferguson.<br><br><strong>MEMORY 17:</strong> Mark RobinsÂ’ 1-0 winner in the FA Cup third round clash at Nottingham Forest on January 7, 1990 is still tagged the goal that saved FergieÂ’s job, after eight league games without a win. United went on to land their first trophy under the Scot.<br><br><strong>MEMORY 18:</strong> Ryan GiggsÂ’ extra-time solo goal in the 1999 FA Cup semi-final replay against Arsenal at Villa Park is probably the best in the CupÂ’s history. The wing wizard picked up a loose pass on half-way and ran half the length of the field before despatching the ball past David Seaman amid scenes of pandemonium.<br><br><strong>MEMORY 19: </strong>Signing Eric Cantona in November 1992 was a major turning point in UnitedÂ’s history under Ferguson. The Frenchman proved the catalyst in winning the clubÂ’s first Premiership that same season.<br><br><strong>MEMORY 20: </strong>Beating Barcelona 2-1 in the 1991 European Cup-WinnersÂ’ Cup final on a rainy night in Rotterdam.<br><br><strong>MEMORY 21: </strong>Fergie is saving that up for another Champions League triumph next May in Moscow. He might even decide, at 66, it would be the perfect way to bow out. Then again ...<br></div>
