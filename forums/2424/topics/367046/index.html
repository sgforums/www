            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong>David May is backing new signing Michael Owen to hit double figures in the goalscoring charts ahead of the new season.<br><br></strong>The striker signed a two-year deal with the Reds on Friday after he became a free agent following a four-year stay at Newcastle.<br><br>May reckons Owen's surprise arrival is a shrewd bit of business by Sir Alex Ferguson and fully expects the 29-year-old to repay the United boss with goals.<br><br>"When you look at the amount of chances United create, there's no reason why Michael can't get 15 to 20 goals this season," May told <strong>MUTV</strong>.<br><br>"He didn't have the best of times at Newcastle, but he's a proven goalscorer who knows where the back of the net is. <br><br>"It's up to Michael to prove to himself, the manager and the fans that he's capable of doing a job for both club and country and he's got the perfect platform on which to do that."<br><br>Despite a frustrating time with injuries, Owen still has time on his side and May believes he will bring something different to the table.<br><br>"When people talk about players being in their prime, it's from the age of around 27 to 31 and Michael still has at least a couple of years left in his prime," explained May. "And he's totally different to Rooney and Berbatov - he'll be the out-an-out striker who'll play on the shoulders of defenders. <br><br>"He doesn't score that many goals outside the box, but when he's in the area he knows exactly where the back of the net is. I'm sure he'll do very well here."</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong>Owen's right for United and England<br></strong>Michael Owen shock move to Manchester United can re-ignite his England career. So says Old Trafford legend Bryan Robson even though injury-plagued striker Owen made only 65 starts for Newcastle in four seasons. Robson said: "He will be in and around the box and I can see him scoring a lot of goals. I can also see him getting back into the England squad. It is a great signing, getting someone like Michael in on a free transfer. He is a great player, he is only 29 and for me he is at the peak of his career. The way United play and the way they dominate possession will suit Michael's game."<br><em>Ross Gregory, The Sun<br><br></em>When <strong>Wayne Rooney</strong> was a young scamp on the streets of Croxteth, he says he loved watching Paul Gascoigne play. "The way he went past players and how he could dribble was just brilliant. He was an amazing player to watch," he told The Sun.<br><br>All the papers report on <strong>Carlos Tevez</strong>'s controversial switch to our neighbours City.</p></div>

              <p>Cristiano Ronaldo believes Michael Owen will prove a fine replacement for him in the Manchester United number seven shirt.</p>
              <p>United brought in England striker Owen, a free agent after leaving Newcastle, to help fill the void left by Ronaldo's world record £80million move to Real Madrid.</p>
              <p>Owen, 29, is looking to get his career back on track after falling down the England pecking order during four injury-ravaged years on Tyneside and Ronaldo expects him to make an impact at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>"Manchester United did well to give him the number seven," the Portuguese star said.</p>
              <p>"He is a great player, an English player. He has everything to win there. He is at a fantastic club."</p>
              <p>Ronaldo had been heavily linked with a move to the Bernabeu for around two years before United finally sanctioned his sale this summer.</p>
              <p>Yet despite the 24-year-old's obvious excitement at signing for the Spanish giants, he insists leaving United was not an easy decision.</p>
              <p>"I arrived at Manchester when I was 18 years old and I'd been there six years and I think it's a lot of time," he said.</p>
              <p>"I won many things there, collective and individual trophies and awards, and I met very good people there, good friends - so it's not easy you know.</p>
              <p>"Life is a challenge and I'm a man of challenges. I think it's a good move."</p>
              <p>Ronaldo heads an impressive new wave of 'galacticos' to sign for Real Madrid this summer.</p>
              <p>His move, plus those of Karim Benzema and Kaka from Lyon and AC Milan respectively, have taken Real's summer spending past the £180million mark.</p>
              <p>There have been claims that the arrival of so many big-money stars may lead to friction in the dressing room but Ronaldo insists there are no problems in that regard.</p>
              <p>"It is much better than what I expected," said Ronaldo, in Dublin ahead of Real's pre-season friendly against Shamrock Rovers next week.</p>
              <p>"I am very happy to be in this working group.</p>
              <p>"The players have made me very, very welcome and it is very important the way that they have welcomed me.</p>
              <p>"You can read whatever in the papers, but when I am with Real Madrid the atmosphere is fantastic and I'd like to thank my colleagues for that."</p>

              <p>Michael Owen feels like a 21-year-old again - and he is convinced his move to Manchester United will get him back into the England squad.</p>
              <p>After a difficult year at Real Madrid, followed by four poor seasons with Newcastle, Owen is ready to relaunch himself on the greatest stage after jumping at the opportunity to join Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United.</p>
              <p>To outsiders, it was a stunning move, resurrecting a career that appeared to be heading for the buffers. Even to Owen it was an unexpected development.</p>
              <p>But there is no disguising the enthusiasm now coursing through his veins as he looks ahead to a campaign that will see United attempt to become the first club in English history to win four consecutive league championships.</p>
              <p>"I feel like I did eight years ago," said Owen.</p>
              <p>"There are so many players on my wavelength - world-class players. I just know this move is going to be fantastic for me.</p>
              <p>"When you sign for Manchester United there are that many things you think about; the players alongside you, playing at Old Trafford, the men who are going to create chances for you.</p>
              <p>"Then you wake up the following morning and realise you could win the league or the Champions League.</p>
              <p>"It just goes on and on. It is a very exciting prospect."</p>
              <p>Messages of support have come from unlikely quarters. Jamie Carragher for a start who, as a football man rather than a Liverpool player, is delighted such an old friend is back where he belongs.</p>
              <p>And, if all goes well, it is certain someone else might be interested too. Someone who is very influential, especially in a season that ends with the World Cup. Someone whose regular contact has previously remained unpublicised.</p>
              <p>"I have never given up on England," said Owen.</p>
              <p>"I have been in every preliminary squad before it is pared down. I have had a letter every time. I know from that the manager is keeping an eye on me."</p>
              <p>An England recall would offer Owen the opportunity to score the nine goals required for him to jump up from being the fourth highest goalscorer in Three Lions history to join Sir Bobby Charlton on his record mark of 49.</p>
              <p>As Charlton burst into the room where Owen was discussing the matter looking for a folder he left behind at an earlier meeting, the comparison was there to be made.</p>
              <p>"I would catch him now because he is a bit older and has just left the room," laughed Owen.</p>
              <p>"I have nine goals to catch him, so that is probably a year and a half. We'll see."</p>
              <p>A combination of United fans' long-standing antipathy for all things England and Owen's past injury record on national duty means the former Liverpool star would be well advised to stay clear of the topic for now.</p>
              <p>He is also keen to avoid discussing his association with Anfield, or at least the impact it has on his present status as the wearer of United's prized number seven shirt.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, Owen does find himself in the strange position of knowing his goals might help United overtake Liverpool's long-standing record of 18 league titles. Not that such a prospect - or his return to Merseyside in a United shirt will faze him.</p>
              <p>"I used to play for Liverpool and I know a couple of the players, but there have been a lot of changes there," he said.</p>
              <p>"I am quite mature about football. I don't feel the need to react if people sing a song about me. Call me boring but it is not in my make-up."</p>
              <p>There is a certain irony in the shift of opinion on Owen's career that has taken place since his Old Trafford move was confirmed.</p>
              <p>From being a washed-up old has-been, destined for the scrap yard, the 29-year-old is now on the cusp of a complete rejuvenation, gone from Phil Brown's Hull to Ferguson's United.</p>
              <p>It is quite a transformation although, as ever, the truth is far more mundane.</p>
              <p>"There are some clubs from whom it is quite good if they say they want to sign you," he said.</p>
              <p>"It gives their fans a lift to think their team is going in for a player like Michael Owen.</p>
              <p>"But I could have gone to a number of other clubs who were doing things much more quietly.</p>
              <p>"And, in the end, the one man who in world football who you would want a good opinion from is the one man who wanted to sign me."</p>

              <p>Rio Ferdinand is backing Michael Owen to fire Manchester United to glory this season.</p>
              <p>As a regular team-mate of Owen's with England, Ferdinand is acutely aware of the 29-year-old's predatory instincts.</p>
              <p>United supporters are beginning to find out too given Owen has scored in both games on the Red Devils' pre-season tour of the Far East, even though it is fairly obvious that much stiffer tests await than those that were posed by a Malaysian XI over the past few days.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, it is the first step towards proving that Owen has not lost his natural talent amid the wreckage of four awful years at Newcastle, blighted by injury and poor form.</p>
              <p>And Ferdinand knows Owen could turn out to be a major factor in United's pursuit of an unprecedented fourth consecutive league championship.</p>
              <p>"He is one of those players you might not see for 90 minutes but in time added on, he will score a goal," said Ferdinand.</p>
              <p>"Those are the type of players you need to win things.</p>
              <p>"It is great to have him in our squad because he is such a good player and a fantastic lad to have around.</p>
              <p>"Fingers crossed he can have an injury free season and score some goals for us."</p>
              <p>With Fabio Capello largely ignoring Owen on fitness grounds since his installation as England coach 19 months ago, Ferdinand has been restricted to watching from afar as the reputation of England's fourth highest goalscorer took a nosedive.</p>
              <p>After Cristiano Ronaldo left for Real Madrid in exchange for a whopping £80million cheque and Carlos Tevez made his bad-tempered way to Manchester City, the United faithful were hoping for a significant statement of intent in response.</p>
              <p>The reaction to news of Owen being targeted as a replacement following the failed attempt to sign Karim Benzema was first stunned amazement, then dismay, before finally they arrived at a general feeling of nothing ventured, nothing gained.</p>
              <p>Ferdinand probably felt the same, although his time with Owen wearing England's Three Lions gives him an insight available to few others.</p>
              <p>"The lads get a great buzz out of seeing someone like Michael Owen score goals," he said.</p>
              <p>"When he signed for the club there were a lot of doubters out there. People were saying all kinds of things about him. We have heard it all.</p>
              <p>"But the players go in there with an open mind and just hope to see the player we know Michael can be."</p>
              <p>It has to be said, the initial signs are encouraging.</p>
              <p>"So far this pre-season he has played two games and scored two goals," he said.</p>
              <p>"That speaks for itself. When he is on his game, there are not many better finishers in world football."</p>
              <p>Question marks hanging over Owen will probably not be totally dispelled until he gets through half a season without suffering a significant injury.</p>
              <p>Ferdinand will not be judged quite as harshly, nevertheless, after a back problem that kept him out for six weeks following United's return from their successful Club World Cup quest last December and a calf strain that ruled him out for two weeks immediately before the Champions League final and an England double-header straight afterwards, there are a few doubts about him as well.</p>
              <p>"It is probably the first season I have ever been injured really but I still played 43 games," he said.</p>
              <p>"However, I accept I missed a few so hopefully this season it will be back to normal practice."</p>
              <p>Looking back, Ferdinand accepts he was not 100 per cent in Rome as United were flogged so mercilessly by Barcelona.</p>
              <p>Not that he is using it as an excuse, just the reality of life as a modern-day top-flight professional.</p>
              <p>"Obviously you would prefer to go into any game feeling you are the best you can be," he said.</p>
              <p>"But realistically the football season does not allow for that.</p>
              <p>"You carry niggles most of the time and the Champions League final was no different.</p>
              <p>"I did a little bit of training on my own this summer but I have started the pre-season with everybody else and been happy with it."</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson’s capture of one-time Kop idol Michael Owen from Newcastle represents a colossal coup for the Old Trafford boss.<br><br></strong>So says Phil Chisnall, the last man to move directly between the two footballing superpowers of the north-west, when United transferred the creative inside-forward to Liverpool for £25,000 in the spring of 1964.<br><br>Nearly half a century on from that deal, displaying a unique qualification to comment on Owen switch allegiances, Chisnall is unequivocal: “It’s a brilliant piece of business. Michael’s had his injury problems, but he didn’t become a bad player during his time at St James’ Park. If you’d put George Best into that Newcastle team he’d have struggled!<br><br>“When United are playing well, and the passing movements are flowing, they create countless chances, and he’ll poke in a high percentage of them. He won’t be bombing about all over the place as Carlos Tevez did, but he’ll wait for his opportunities and he’ll score hatfuls."<br><br>Owen has already shown signs of his poaching qualities in two pre-season matches, scoring two goals. And Chisnall feels that, at Old Trafford, the England forward can rediscover his best form.<br><br>"United have found themselves a thoroughbred striker without paying a transfer fee and Michael Owen has got himself back in the top bracket," he adds. "It’s a perfect scenario for both parties.”</p></div>

              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson has set Michael Owen a 15-goal target for his debut season at Manchester United.</p>
              <p>Owen was a surprise capture for a club reeling at the loss of Cristiano Ronaldo and Carlos Tevez from their title-winning squad.</p>
              <p>At first, most United fans were seriously underwhelmed by the signing. However, with two goals in three games on the Red Devils' Far East tour so far, Owen has hit the ground running and looks fitter and fresher than at any stage during four seasons at Newcastle.</p>
              <p>Ferguson, though, does intend paying some heed to Owen's past fitness record.</p>
              <p>The Scot nevertheless expects Owen to figure in 25 games this term. And providing he reaches that figure, Ferguson sees no reason why his new forward should fail to hit the 15-goal mark.</p>
              <p>"Michael has scored two already and I hope there are plenty more to come," said the Red Devils chief.</p>
              <p>"If you look at his record over the years, even the last two years at Newcastle when they were going through a difficult time, he scored one in every two games.</p>
              <p>"He is easily capable of reaching that level again.</p>
              <p>"If he plays 25 games for me this season I think we'll get 15 goals."</p>
              <p>Ferguson was speaking ahead of Sunday's encounter with Hangzhou Greentown at the Dragon Stadium, which will conclude another successful trip to Asia that once again highlights how popular United are in this part of the world.</p>
              <p>The reaction in South Korea to Park Ji-sung's arrival was astounding, while United arrived in China to instantly find their team hotel mobbed by supporters today, with high pitched screaming coming every time one of the players ventured into public view.</p>
              <p>Little wonder Ferguson is not ruling out the possibility of signing another Chinese player, despite the purchase of Dong Fangzhou now being regarded as a failure.</p>
              <p>"United are always searching for talent throughout the world," said Ferguson.</p>
              <p>"Of course we had Dong for a couple of years.</p>
              <p>"He is a good boy, a good professional and he did his very best but unfortunately it didn't work out for him.</p>
              <p>"However if we see potential we will bring them to United. Our search always goes on."</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson agrees with ManUtd.com readers - he believes Michael Owen will reach a double-figures goal tally in his maiden campaign with United.<br><br></strong>Speaking at a pre-match press conference in Hangzhou, China, the boss replied "I hope it's plenty" when asked how many times his new striker would score in 2009/10.<br><br>"If you look at his goal-scoring record over the years, even the last two years at Newcastle in difficult times, he’s scored at one in two," said Sir Alex.<br><br>"He’s easily capable of that level, one in two games, so if he plays 25 games for me next season, I think he’ll get 15 goals.”<br><br>Earlier this week, ManUtd.com started a poll in which fans were asked the same question. The <a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7B671CF63E-EAF1-4231-AD3D-8A37AEDE301C%7D&amp;pollid=2121"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">poll remains open</span></span></strong></a> but at the time of publishing this story, 95 per cent of supporters are backing Owen to net more than ten goals in his first season. This includes 40 per cent cent who think he'll finish with somewhere between 16 and 20 strikes.<br><br>Sir Alex will, of course, look to all his forwards for goals as the Reds try to replace Cristiano Ronaldo's firepower. The Asia Tour has been encouraging with Owen, Dimitar Berbatov, Federico Macheda and Wayne Rooney all on target in the first three games.<br><br>"We’ve actually been rotating all the four strikers," said the boss, "because we’re bringing new players like Owen into the team and also there’s young players like Macheda coming through. We have to find out and understand the best possible combination.”</p></div>

              <p><strong>Owen fit to wear United's No7 shirt<br></strong>Alex Ferguson insists Michael Owen deserves to wear Manchester United's coveted No 7 shirt. Eyebrows were raised by many fans when the England striker signed for United and was handed the famous jersey. But Owen, 29, is making an instant impact and scored a brace against Hangzhou Greentown yesterday to make it four in as many games as United's Far East tour ended with a thumping win. And boss Fergie said: "I gave him a shirt that has belonged to some high-profile players - and we have that in Michael. I am not concerned with what supporters think. The important thing is to give it to someone who is confident to carry it and he is the natural one to get it."<br><em>Neil Custis, The Sun</em></p>
              <p><em>The Daily Mail</em> claim that, despite Sir Alex's insistence that there will be no more new signings this summer, the Reds are set to make an offer for Valencia winger <strong>David Silva </strong>this week. Liverpool are also apparently eyeing the Spanish international.</p>
              <p>United's chances of claiming a fourth straight Premier League title have been severely dented by the departures of <strong>Cristiano Ronaldo</strong> and <strong>Carlos Tevez</strong>, according to <strong>Nicolas Anelka</strong>. "United have lost two big players so it gives everyone else - including ourselves - a big chance to win it," said the Chelsea striker.<br><br>According to <em>The Sun</em>, <strong>Edwin van der Sar </strong>has rubbished suggestions that he has already decided to retire at the end of the 2009/10 campaign. "As far as making a decision on my future, I'm going to see how the season goes," said the Dutchman.</p>
