              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson is spoilt for choice in the centre of the
              park with Paul Scholes, Michael Carrick, Owen Hargreaves, Darren
              Fletcher and Anderson all vying for a starting berth.</strong><br><br>Here, veteran midfielder <strong>Paul Scholes</strong> gives us the lowdown on his fellow comrades...<br><br><strong>Carrick</strong><br>Michael
              is a top player who brings a relaxed nature to the team. He can pick
              the ball up anywhere on the pitch and pass it long or short. He can
              also tackle and score goals, so he can do everything. He’s just a
              really good player to play with.<br><br><strong>Hargreaves</strong><br>I
              knew Owen before he joined from our England days. He’s a great athlete
              who gets about the pitch very well and is a good passer of the ball.
              Last season was a bit stop-start for him because of injuries, but once
              he got some more games under his belt, he proved what a top player he
              is.<br><br><strong>Fletcher</strong><br>All the players know what a
              quality player Fletch is. He was unfortunate not to play for parts of
              last season, but you have to give him credit for sticking at it. He
              never moaned, he just continued to train well every day and more than
              anyone he deserved his chance. Whenever he plays he’s fantastic for the
              team and he showed that against Arsenal in the FA Cup victory back in
              February. It was unbelievable to see the way he ran about, despite not
              having really played for a couple of months.<br><br><strong>Anderson</strong><br>He
              improved as last season went on and is a great prospect. It’s a well
              known fact that foreign players can take time to settle, but in truth
              it didn’t take him that long. He’s been fantastic whenever he’s played.
              He’s only 20-years-old so it’s amazing to think what he could achieve
              in his career.</p>

              <p>One thing with scholes is that he knows when to vary the game and the speed. Gone are his ghosting in from MF to score..</p>
              <p>It is a beautiful sight when the ball is laid infront and he just gives it a good thump into the back of the net.</p>
