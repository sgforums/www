              <p>They will try to tell us that it is <em>only</em> the <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Carling Cup" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/carlingcup"><span style="color: #005689;">Carling Cup</span></a>. They will remind us that for years they have regarded this competition as little more an afterthought, cluttering up an already-congested fixture list and getting in the way of more important matters. They will enjoy the fact that <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester City" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchestercity"><span style="color: #005689;">Manchester City</span></a> created a commemorative programme for reaching their first semi-final since 1981 and they will insist this competition represents football's equivalent of the girl next door to the supermodels they normally date.</p>
              <p>Yet this is a strange time for <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester United" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united"><span style="color: #005689;">Manchester United</span></a>. There has been a bad vibe at their recent home matches. The crowd have been restless, occasionally mutinous, as the team have laboured and the news has seeped out of the offences to football committed by that orchestra of geeks known as the Glazer family. The whole club needs a lift and there can be no doubt how much it will hurt them if they are unable to turn this tie upside down next Wednesday. This was another blow to their morale.</p>
              <p><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Sir Alex Ferguson" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/sir-alex-ferguson"><span style="color: #005689;">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></a>'s team have already lost five times in the league and been knocked out of the FA Cup by a Leeds United side from League One. Now the latest indignity: two goals from the striker they lost to City during the summer. United fans used to have a "sign him up" campaign on Tevez's behalf. Since he left they have, almost overnight, tried to convince themselves he had the worst first touch of any United attacker since Ralph Milne, the man Ferguson remembers as his worst-ever signing. In the away end at the City of Manchester Stadium they will have watched Tevez milking his celebrations through the latticework of their fingers.</p>
              <p>Ferguson argued that the damage was not irreparable, and justifiably so given the number of chances his team carved out. Yet the United manager is beginning to sound like a looped tape, lamenting his team's finishing, almost rolling his eyes as he expresses his astonishment that they could be so generous. Ferguson has been almost reluctant in the past to acknowledge City as genuine rivals for United, calling their stadium the Temple of Doom and offering painkillers to City journalists at his press conferences. But the team he selected last night demonstrated how he has had to modify his thinking.</p>
              <p>The old deceiver had initially promised to play his youngsters, as is the norm in the Carling Cup. He then backtracked a little after the defeat to Leeds United in the FA Cup to say it would be a mix, but mainly still the kids. What we got instead looked suspiciously like Team A when you consider Edwin van der Sar's previous appearance in this competition was all the way back in the final against Wigan Athletic five years ago. Darron Gibson, the hero in the quarter-final against Tottenham Hotspur, was not even on the bench. Rafael da Silva brought down the average age but, even then, there was an argument the Brazilian deserved his place given that Gary Neville can be a danger to his own team when the pace is this frenetic.</p>
              <p>Or at least that was the sense beforehand. As it turned out, Ferguson must regret not going for the more experienced man when he considers the impetuousness with which Rafael tugged at Craig Bellamy's arm to concede the penalty that changed the course of this game.</p>
              <p>This was the moment Tevez had been craving since his defection from Old Trafford and the lingering sense of bad feeling could be seen in the exuberant way he chose to celebrate compared to the respect he has afforded West Ham when scoring against another of his former clubs. Tevez was so pumped up he made a beeline for the touchline where Gary Neville had been warming up and informed his former team-mate (imagine Rod Hull with an invisible Emu) that he talked too much. Neville had said on the eve of this match that he could not argue with Ferguson's assessment that Tevez was over-priced at Â£25.5m.</p>
              <p>For the second goal his intention seemed to be to make a point to Ferguson, running to the same touchline to cup his ears in front of the two dug-outs. Ferguson, one imagines, will use the memory of that moment to motivate his players in the return leg. As it stands, however, United look like they could do with Carlos Alberto Tevez.</p>
