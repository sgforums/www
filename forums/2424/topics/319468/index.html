              <h2>Manchester United hot-shot Cristiano Ronaldo has stated that the final decision over his future will be announced by Tuesday.</h2>
              <p>The Portuguese ace has been tipped for a move to Real Madrid, with
              Manchester United apparently unwilling to off-load their star, who
              scored 42 goals in all competitions this season, despite big-money
              approaches from the Spanish club.<br><br>And Ronaldo, who is reported
              to be interested in a move to Santiago Bernabéu, has ensured that his
              future will be decided next week.<br><br>"Let's see, I hope there will
              be news soon. In two or three days I will announce my decision," he
              said after the game against Georgia.<br><br>On Portugal's display
              against Georgia, Ronaldo, who played during the first-half, said that
              he was happy with the 2-0 win and with his own level of play.<br><br>"I
              felt fine in the game, from now on I only have to make maintenance. I
              have realized that my level won't drop, just like it won't raise.<br><br>"I will be in good form in Euro, and I really want to make a good tournament," he added.</p>

              <p>in a cruel way, I agree with him.</p>
              <p>I hate being held hostage even through he is a 40goals hero.</p>
              <p>if his heart is no longer with MU, then it is better to flog him.</p>
              <p>Sell him for maximum and then get good replacements.</p>
              <p>it took near 10yrs to get back to European Summit, and if he is the disruption like beckham, then we need someone stable and able to build and not rip the whole team up..</p>

              <p><strong>Ramon Calderon has grudgingly admitted that there is little point in Real Madrid trying to sign Cristiano Ronaldo. Ronaldo has announced that he will decide on his future over the next few days after being strongly linked with a move to the Bernabeu.</strong></p>
              <p>However, Manchester United have insisted that he will not be sold this summer and have threatened to go to Fifa over Real's public pursuit of the Portuguese winger. Calderon has now stated that he does not want to continue to lift the supporters' hopes when the chances of landing Ronaldo appear very slim.</p>
              <p>The Real Madrid president has also stressed that his side would be able to cope if they failed to prise Ronaldo away from Old Trafford. "We would like to have a player like Cristiano, but if he does not sign for us then it would not be a major problem," Calderon told <em>Marca</em>.</p>
              <p>"The club has said that they do not want to sell him and we cannot keep going back. "One has to know when to stop these things in order to avoid the frustration that the fans could feel. "His club have to want to and if they want to negotiate with Madrid or any other club then they will."</p>
