              <p>Defour's signing would be good but correct me if i'm wrong, he's a defensive midfielder?</p>

              <p>yes, his contribution is immense, but the lingering question, can he still do it when he is back?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Manchester United target Steven Defour - the man Sir Alex Ferguson sent a get well telegram last year - admits he is ready to leave Belgium and seal a dream move to Old Trafford.</strong></p>
              <p>The Belgium international is a long-term target for Sir Alex Ferguson, who is understood to have been handed a substantial transfer kitty to boost his squad after Wayne Rooney questioned club's ambition last week.</p>
              <p>Ferguson sent Defour - who has also been linked with Liverpool - a personal message last year when the talented midfielder suffered a serious foot injury playing for Standard Liege.</p>
              <p>Defour had previously remained tight-lipped on United - but the 22-year-old has finally admitted he is aware of interest from Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>And Defour says he is ready to leave Standard Liege, he said: 'I know that Manchester United are closely monitoring my situation. There hasn't been any official contact yet though.<em></em></p>
              <p>'I've been sidelined for quite a while due to injury, but I'm playing at a high level again. The chance that I'll leave the club is rather big if I continue to play like I currently do.</p>

              <p>yes, his contribution is immense, but the lingering question, can he still do it when he is back?</p>
              <p>look @ Gary Neville after his comback? he is a pale shadow.</p>
              <p>i believe all MU fans will welcome OwenH playing on the field again, but how long more?</p>

              <h1>Manchester United target Steven Defour issues come-and-get-me
              plea to Sir Alex Ferguson<br></h1>

              <p><em>Target: Standard Liege midfielder Steven Defour is
              wanted by United</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Manchester United target Steven Defour - the man Sir
              Alex Ferguson sent a get well telegram last year - admits he is
              ready to leave Belgium and seal a dream move to Old
              Trafford.</strong></p>
              <p>The Belgium international is a long-term target for Sir Alex
              Ferguson, who is understood to have been handed a substantial
              transfer kitty to boost his squad after Wayne Rooney questioned
              club's ambition last week.</p>
              <p>Ferguson sent Defour - who has also been linked with Liverpool -
              a personal message last year when the talented midfielder suffered
              a serious foot injury playing for Standard Liege.</p>
              <p>Defour had previously remained tight-lipped on United - but the
              22-year-old has finally admitted he is aware of interest from Old
              Trafford.</p>
              <p>And Defour says he is ready to leave Standard Liege, he said: 'I
              know that Manchester United are closely monitoring my situation.
              There hasn't been any official contact yet though.</p>
              <p>'I've been sidelined for quite a while due to injury, but I'm
              playing at a high level again. The chance that I'll leave the club
              is rather big if I continue to play like I currently do.</p>
