              Chelsea have to blame themselves for not qualify for finals.
              
              when barcelona was one man down, they should not have sub drogba and should instead partner anelka and drogba and attacked barcelona for the second goal to easy nerves.
              
              instead what did chelsea do? sub drogba and the rest is history. thats bad defending in the final min of play against 10 men. so thay cant blame, but themselves really

              <p>I tot the sub was becos Drogba was injured.. but instead we are treated to him in his flip-flops chasing after the ref with energy and passion he should have injected into his own game.. neverthless, I think to put this thing to a close, Chelsea got themselves to blame, Ref did not have a good night, some chelsea players going get spank by UEFA, essien scored a great goal, we won't see a repeat of Terry's banana slip.</p>
              <p>Let's move on and focus on Finals.</p>

              <h3>Winger not taking his Champions League final inclusion for granted</h3>
              <p><img src="http://img.skysports.com/09/05/218x298/Ji-Sung-Park-Arsenal-Manchester-United-Champi_2267896.jpg" alt="" width="218" height="298"></p>
              <p><span class="main-content">
              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Park Ji-Sung has
              admitted that he is still wary of his involvement in the UEFA Champions
              League final against Barcelona despite assurances from manager Sir Alex
              Ferguson. </strong></p>
              <p>The 28-year-old's cautious approach is understandable
              after he was sensationally left out of the squad for the penalty
              shoot-out win over Chelsea in Moscow last year by manager Sir Alex
              Ferguson; a decision made even stranger after the winger had started
              both legs in the quarter and semi-finals.</p>
              <p>But after scoring the
              opener in the second-leg at Emirates Stadium in this year's semi-final,
              Ferguson has all but guaranteed Park's place in the starting XI in Rome
              in two weeks' time.</p>
              <p>Despite his manager hinting that the former
              PSV ace will not suffer a similar fate against Barcelona, Park admits
              that he isn't taking anything for granted.</p>
              <p>"If I play in Rome it
              would be great because I didn't play last season. But you don't know.
              There are two weeks left yet," he told the <em>Manchester Evening News</em>.</p>
              <p>"I
              must show on the pitch in that time that I deserve to be in the final.
              I have to keep my form up and show my ability on the pitch.</p>
              <p>"I
              have heard and read in the media that the manager has said I should be
              okay for the Champions League final. He has told the press but he
              hasn't said anything to me.</p>
              <p>"So I just will have to do my best in the meantime. I am not going to get excited yet.</p>
              <p><span class="main-content">
              </span></p><p>"It was hard to take not being in the
              Moscow team. But all the players want to be in the big games. We all
              want to be in the Champions League final.</p>
              <p>"But so many players
              have never even reached that stage of the tournament. Some great
              players have not even had the chance of getting there. But at least I
              had a chance."</p>
              <p>Despite the pain he suffered in Moscow the South
              Korean always believed that he would get another shot at playing in the
              final, especially at a club like United.</p>
              <p>"It was a big
              heartbreak but I believed I would get back again with Manchester
              United. I felt certain it would happen again soon so I comforted myself
              with that," he added.</p>
              <p>"I am certainly at the right club to believe I could get back again.</p>
              <p>"No
              European Cup winner has ever retained the Champions League and not many
              winners have actually got back to the final but I never lost faith that
              United could do it and I might have a chance again.</p>
              <p>"I have never
              lost the belief that I would play in a Champions League final. I knew
              we could get there. Now we are back and I just hope it is different for
              me this time.</p>
              <p>"But I won't believe anything until the night. Up until then I will still be proving myself on the pitch."</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;">Three goals in a devastating nine-minute spell at the start of the second half saw Barcelona to a 4-1 win over Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey final on Wednesday and the first of three possible titles.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;">Yaya Toure levelled for Barca in the first half before Lionel Messi, Bojan Krkic and Xavi struck after the break to give the club their 25th Copa del Rey.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;">The Catalans could wrap up the Primera Liga title this weekend and they face Manchester United in the Champions League final on May 27.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;">"Now we are reaping the rewards of all the hard work we have put in during the season," Barca midfielder Sergio Busquets told Spanish state television as the team celebrated on the pitch.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;">"I hope this weekend we can secure our second title."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;">Barca had an unfamiliar look in defence with reserve keeper Jose Manuel Pinto in goal and Yaya Toure at centre back again, and they were quickly exposed at a set piece.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;">Pinto had tipped a Javi Martinez shot round the post and Fran Yeste made it count. His whipped-in corner after nine minutes found Gaizka Toquero rising above two defenders to head in at the back post.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;">Athletic looked fresher, snapping at Barca all over the pitch, until Toure stepped up to level in spectacular fashion as he advanced out of defence.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;">The Ivory Coast midfielder went past three Bilbao players in the 31st minute, and from outside the area drilled a low shot inside the near post.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;">Gradually Barca asserted themselves and as they swarmed round the Bilbao area in the 55th minute it was Messi who struck, firing through a crowd of legs after Gorka Iraizoz could only parry Samuel Eto'o's shot.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;">Three minutes later, Bojan raced through on a break to score off the far post and with Bilbao reeling Xavi curled a superb freekick over the wall and in off the near post in the 64th.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;">Just before Xavi's goal the match was held up briefly after Barcelona defender Daniel Alves was hit on the head by a tin can thrown from the stands.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;">Alves was able to continue and television pictures showed police leading a fan away.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;">Athletic were a broken team after that, but earn a place in next season's Europa League with Barca's place in the Champions League assured for next year.</p>

              <h1 class="sIFR-ignore">Henry doing everything to be in Rome</h1>
              <p><strong>Thierry Henry has insisted he is doing everything in his power to be
              involved in the Champions League final with Manchester United.</strong></p>
              <p><strong><img src="http://www.setanta.com/Global/Images/sport/football/2008-2009/spain/Barcelona/henry_copa.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="270"></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Henry opted against celebrating his team’s Copa del Rey victory on
              Wednesday in order to recover on time for the Rome final at Stadio
              Olimpico.</strong></p>
              <p>The Champions League is the only major title that the legendary striker is yet to claim.</p>
              <p>The France international’s trophy room is full, as he has already
              won the World Cup, the European championship, the Confederation Cup,
              the Golden Boot, as well as the English and French league, the FA Cup
              and the Community Shield.</p>
              <p>“The team are in an incredible form at the moment, it is impressive,” Henry told sport.es.</p>
              <p>“If I am not celebrating it is because I want to be ready for Rome.”</p>

              Barcelona has 3 defenders out. Alves and left back are suspended, and Marquez is injured. I feel that Man Utd should attack and Barcelona sure collapse. which team wont, if 3 of their defenders are out, especially when you have Ronaldo, Rooney or Berbatov or Tevez in attack.
              
              Imagine Man Utd 3 of its first team defenders are out, I wonder how are they going to cope?
              
              so based on this, I would rate Man Utd as favourites for the title.

              <div id="div_article_main_content">
              <p><strong>Lionel Messi has stoked the
              fires ahead of the Champions League final with his assertion that
              Barcelona’s football is better than Manchester United’s.</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.setanta.com/Global/Images/sport/football/2008-2009/spain/Barcelona/messi_lionel_groupceleb480.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="270"></p>
              <p><strong>Both Barca and United this weekend secured their respective domestic
              titles and now must turn their attentions to Rome on May 27 where they
              will look to be crowned the best in Europe.</strong></p>
              <p>Real Madrid’s Saturday night slip-up meant that Barca wrapped up the
              Spanish league title without playing and allowed Josep Guardiola to
              rest Messi and four other first-teamers for Sunday’s trip to Mallorca.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson is sure to follow a similar script when his side
              visit Hull on the last day of the domestic season as they prepare their
              attempts to become the first team in Champions League history to defend
              the trophy.</p>
              <p>Ferguson has been receiving plaudits left, right and centre for the
              manner in which his full-to-the-brim squad has gone about yet another
              dominant season but Messi feels that it is Barca who strut their stuff
              more impressively.</p>
              <p>"We are going to give everything to win the Champions League," said
              the Argentinian, "Manchester United have a great team with some great
              players but I think we just have that little bit more football.</p>
              <p>"We have to take advantage of this moment because we don't know if
              it will ever present itself again. We have the chance to pass into the
              history books of a club as great as Barcelona and we are going to do
              just that."</p>

              <div id="div_article_main_content">
              <p>Barcelona’s medical staff have announced that Thierry Henry could be fit for the Champions League final with Manchester United.</p>
              <p>The French striker remains a doubt for the Rome final that is due to
              be played on May 27 in the Eternal City after damaging his knee
              ligament during the Classico with Real Madrid.</p>
              <p>But the Arsenal legend is recovering quickly and could feature in the glamorous European clash according to club medics.</p>
              <p>Henry can run again and is expected to return to full training by the end of the week, it has been claimed.</p>
              <p>The forward’s return would be a huge boost for the Blaugranas, as he
              has been in a top-class form this season, bagging 19 league goals so
              far.</p>
              <p>“His knee is stable again,” a member of the Barcelona medical staff told L’Equipe.</p>
              <p>“There is still a risk of aggravating the damage."</p>
              <p>“But this risk will not be the same in a 10 days’ time.”</p>

              <p>Both Thierry Henry and Andres
              Iniesta will board the flight to Rome for Barcelona’s Champions League
              final against Manchester United.</p>
              <p>Josep Guardiola already has a bevy of defensive absentees to deal
              with and had previously looked likely to be without the attacking gusto
              of two other certain starters.</p>
              <p>Full backs Eric Abidal and Daniel Alves are both unavailable and
              fears had since been raised that they would be joined on the bench by
              Henry, who suffered knee ligament damage in early May, and Iniesta, who
              tore a thigh muscle eight days later.</p>
              <p>However, Henry is ‘optimistic’ after coming through recent training
              and Iniesta maintains that he ‘will be in Rome’, sentiments that have
              now been echoed by a member of Barca’s medical department.</p>
              <p>“The coach will have them both at his disposal for the final,” he told El Pais.</p>
              <p>“It is more difficult for Henry to get up to match fitness because of the type of player that he is and the type of injury.</p>
              <p>“But they will both be fit for the game....only just.”</p>
