              <p>I have nothing against Liverpool fans, as seen in my other post where StevieG wanted MU to win, in fact, I posted "kudos to him".  I didn't target pool fans, but just in general Anti-MU fans who for the past week, "prefers" barca to win. I am happy for them cause now, they can sleep and eat well..</p>
              <p>Dude, U come in here, saying you win big $$, and saying the shortest guy score? For those who bet big on MU win, you think they read your comments and not get pissed off? U may claim to be writing neutrally, but then, it gloats people leh.</p>
              <p>But you lucky la, most MU fans are smarter &amp; with bigger hearts, so I believe they will take your remarks at face value and not read between the lines and thus deem you are making a general comment and not trying to shame us.</p>

              I have been following english football for a long time, and sad to say, its brand of football is always long balls to its strikers, unlike the short passing game of la liga.
              
              if you play long balls searching for your strikers, it is likely to land in then feet of the opposing defenders. no difference if you make the pass directly to your opponents.
              
              english football is about power, running, stamina whereas la liga is more like controlled possession and short passing football. they also have long passes, but they do it in a more controlled manner.

            <div class='col-md body'>Man Utd midfield really need some replacement. miss the power and running of owen hargreaves and fletcher. Carrick is not the same mould as of Xavi and Iniesta, although he can do some accurate long passes. as for anderson, he just didnt turn up against Barcelona with his powerful running. he is only 21 and will improve as a player in a few more seasons to come. as for giggs and scholes, they are in their twilight years and probably will retire at end of next season. Nani is really a disappointing buy. let's see what Man Utd buy for next season. I hope it will be a top class midfielder, like kaka or ribery :)</div>

              the first goal conceded was crucial. Vidic really should have done better, than easily deceived by Etoo change of pace. after the goal was conceded after Barcelona first attack, it was deflated and I thought second half would improve, but it totally collapsed in the second half, unlike the fightback of 1999.

Its disappointing that anderson did not do the running he is capable of. maybe the big occassion overwhelmed him. Carrick?
              the most disappointing midfielder, as he always played long stray passes to barcelona players. so much for his accurate and pinpoint passing. he is supposed to be the holding midfielders to protect the back 4.

              even if fletcher was around, i think he would also be powerless to stop Xavi and Iniesta bossing the midfield. Carrick keep passing to Barcelona players :(

              I hope this loss will spur Man Utd to be hungrier for next season. with owen hargreaves coming back next season, Man Utd chances looked brighter.
              
              let's see who they get in the off season? I hope its a midfielder.

              <p><br> and owen hargreaves too. they can cover every blade of the pitch,

              not do the running he is capable of. maybe the big occassion
              overwhelmed him. Carrick? the most disappointing midfielder, as he
              always played long stray passes to barcelona players. so much for
              his accurate and pinpoint passing. he is supposed to be the holding
              midfielders to protect the back 4.</p>

              <p><span class="main-content"></span></p><blockquote>
              <p>"We didn't come here and give a good account of ourselves," Ferdinand told <em>Sky Sports News</em>.</p>
              <p>"We
              have played better 99 per cent of the time this season, but saying that
              we created four or five good opportunities to score, but they scored
              two goals at crucial times and two bad goals on our part.</p>
              <p>"But we
              have no arguments, they were the better team on the day, you have got
              to do it on the day - if we played better or played to our strengths it
              would have been a different game, but if you don't do it on the day you
              don't deserve to win."</p>
              <p>Vidic agreed, adding: "We didn't play well.</p>
              <p>"They
              had a good game and scored at the right time - then we chased the game
              and they had space to counter attack us, they deserved to win."</p>
              <p>Left-back Patrice Evra was equally disappointed.</p>
              <p>"You
              can have a lot of excuses, but I am disappointed as we didn't see
              Manchester United playing quick - we were slow and we didn't press
              enough and you didn't see the character of Manchester United tonight,"
              he concluded.</p>
