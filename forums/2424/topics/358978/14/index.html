              <p>I think ytd it was supposed to be Anderson's job, but he ended up chasing shadows instead.</p>
              <p>He clearly couldn't catch up with the movement of the Barca players.</p>

              Arsenal Vs Barcelona should be a dream final in 2006, but cos of the sent off, Barcelona got the advantage.
              
              But the Arsenal now is weaker then the Arsenal of 2006, as that time still got henry around.
              
              Both like to play its passing game and possession football game. if Barcelona buy Febregas from Arsenal, Barcelona midfield is the best, with 3 of the midfielders bossing the midfied, Xavi, Iniesta and Febregas. awesome spanish midfielders.
              
              Spain should be favourite for 2010 world cup liao.

              how many of you here, had a bad start to your day today?
              
              how many took urgent leave and how many took mc today, didnt feel like going to work?
              
              I was on leave today, but were moody for the rest of today lar. other than that I was alright, just sleeping almost the whole day today. Maybe its the curse of the holders unable to retain the title after they have won it.
              
              time to move on and see what fergie bring in new players in the off season. hope this will spur them to greater glory next season.
              
              I hope next season, players will learn to keep their mouth shut, lest it comes back to haunt them and eat humble pie. what comes arounds, goes around. let the talking done on the pitch, not newspaper!

              no midfield support la, Xavi and Iniesta running the show. our midfielders did not turn up, hopelessly outclassed. the strikers no support at all. Man Utd need to overhaul its midfield and need to bring in midfielders like Gatusso, Pirlo, and the roma midfielder, whats his name?
