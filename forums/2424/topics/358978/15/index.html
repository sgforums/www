              rememeber when RM trashed Man Utd in the QFs of the CL, with Zidane, Figo running the show in midfield.
              
              Man Utd need to go and buy world class midfielders to boost the midfield like De Rossi, Pirlo or Kaka. Go buy kaka and Man Utd midfield will be great.
              
              Fletcher, although he is full of running and stamina, he isnt world class like makelele or essien. Carrick, he is not tough enough to be holding midfielder. Owen Hargreaves injury prone. Anderson, he is still learning his trade, thats why the inconsistency.

              <p>I think the trouble with the current lot is they lack a real character who can lead naturally. When things are going well, they flow smoothly. When things start getting a little challenging, there just isn't anyone to lead the way.</p>
              <p>This is borne out by the simple fact of how the captaincy seems to be shared on a rotated basis (honestly, I don't even know who the hell is the captain anymore - it seems to work on a de facto basis in terms of seniority based on the starting XI).</p>
              <p>Yesterday's match bore an uncanny resemblance to so many past failures (think Milan 3-0 two seasons back) where they just succumbed without much of a fight. United can do with a real leader as they had in abundance in the '99 side - Keane dragged United back from the dead against Juventus, Schmeichel was inspirational in the FA Cup semi-final replay against Arsenal.</p>
              <p>You just can't buy those qualities...</p>

              that Manchester United might not have lost the UEFA Champions League
              final if he had been named in the starting XI. </strong></p>
              <p class="ss-text-bold"><img src="http://img.skysports.com/09/05/218x298/RonaldoTevez_2311735.jpg" alt="" width="218" height="298"></p>
              <p><strong>The Argentine's future at Old Trafford remains
              uncertain as he nears the end of a two-year loan deal, and press
              reports on Friday suggest an exit is inevitable.</strong></p>
              <p>Tevez has grown
              frustrated at a lack of regular first-team action at United and he
              failed to land a starting berth in Wednesday's 2-0 loss to Barcelona.</p>
              <p>The
              attacker was introduced at half-time but he could not inspire the Red
              Devils as Barca cruised to a memorable success in Rome.</p>
              <p>Tevez has reiterated that he is keen for his future to be resolved, with talks ongoing between United and his advisors.</p>
              <p>He said in the <em>Daily Mirror</em>: "I wanted to play in the starting line-up in Rome but that decision was down to the coach.</p>
              <p>"But with a strategy more attacking in the first minute then perhaps the result would have been different.</p>
              <p>"It
              has not been a good time for me because I believe that I should have
              played more minutes. My future will now be decided. My agents are
              negotiating and I am waiting to hear some news."</p>

              <h1>Tevez wanted starting role</h1>
              <p><span><strong>Carlos Tevez feels that
              Manchester United might not have lost the UEFA Champions League
              final if he had been named in the starting XI.</strong></span></p>

              <p><strong>The Argentine's future at Old Trafford remains uncertain
              as he nears the end of a two-year loan deal, and press reports on
              Friday suggest an exit is inevitable.</strong></p>
              <p>Tevez has grown frustrated at a lack of regular first-team
              action at United and he failed to land a starting berth in
              Wednesday's 2-0 loss to Barcelona.</p>
              <p>The attacker was introduced at half-time but he could not
              inspire the Red Devils as Barca cruised to a memorable success in
              Rome.</p>
              <p>Tevez has reiterated that he is keen for his future to be
              resolved, with talks ongoing between United and his advisors.</p>
              <p>He said in the <em>Daily Mirror</em>: "I wanted to play in the
              starting line-up in Rome but that decision was down to the
              coach.</p>
              <p>"But with a strategy more attacking in the first minute then
              perhaps the result would have been different.</p>
              <p>"It has not been a good time for me because I believe that I
              should have played more minutes. My future will now be decided. My
              agents are negotiating and I am waiting to hear some news."</p>

              <p><span class="main-content">
              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Manchester United stalwart Ryan Giggs has targeted reaching a third successive UEFA Champions League final. </strong></p>
              <p class="ss-text-bold"><img src="http://img.skysports.com/09/05/218x298/Ryan-Giggs-Manchester-United-Barcelona-Champi_2311588.jpg" alt="" width="218" height="298"></p>
              <p><strong>The Red Devils were unable to make Champions League
              history by winning back-to-back crowns as they lost 2-0 to Barcelona on
              Wednesday.</strong></p>
              <p>However, PFA Player of the Year Giggs has already
              challenged his team-mates to reach next year's showpiece at the
              Santiago Bernabeu.</p>
              <p>"Great teams and great players always look
              forward to the next challenge and we are going for a third Champions
              League final," said the 35-year-old.</p>
              <p>"No one likes to experience this kind of feeling and we must use that as motivation next season."</p>
              <p><span class="main-content">
              </span></p><p>Giggs also highlighted United's
              achievements this season, after the club recorded Fifa Club World Cup,
              League Cup and Premier League triumphs.</p>
              <p>"It has been a fantastic season and we must not forget that. We have achieved so much," he said the Welshman.</p>
              <p>"All we have done is fall just short at the final hurdle in the Champions League.</p>
              <p>"We are still a great team and we have great players in that dressing room."</p>
              <p>He added: "To win three Premier League titles on the trot is an unbelievable thing to do.</p>
              <p>"Now we must look to make it four."</p>

              <p>I think the trouble with the current lot is they lack a real character who can lead naturally. When things are going well, they flow smoothly. When things start getting a little challenging, there just isn't anyone to lead the way.</p>
              <p>This is borne out by the simple fact of how the captaincy seems to be shared on a rotated basis (honestly, I don't even know who the hell is the captain anymore - it seems to work on a de facto basis in terms of seniority based on the starting XI).</p>
              <p>Yesterday's match bore an uncanny resemblance to so many past failures (think Milan 3-0 two seasons back) where they just succumbed without much of a fight. United can do with a real leader as they had in abundance in the '99 side - Keane dragged United back from the dead against Juventus, Schmeichel was inspirational in the FA Cup semi-final replay against Arsenal.</p>
              <p>You just can't buy those qualities...</p>
