              <h1>Martin Samuel: United victory in Rome would eclipse Liverpool's Seventies glory<br></h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/05/25/article-0-0515FAF9000005DC-354_468x310.jpg" alt="United" width="468" height="310"></p>
              <p><em>Quest for glory: United board their plane to Rome for the Champions League final </em><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1187550" rel="1187550|3| nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/sport/football/article-1187550/Martin-Samuel-United-victory-Rome-eclipse-Liverpools-Seventies-glory.html"> </a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span></a><strong> arrived in Rome on Monday. That, in itself, is an achievement. Not making the journey, but getting here, to this point, to this match. They will not be satisfied with anything less than victory, of course, but merely by appearing in consecutive Champions League finals they will have bucked a trend. The hard part, it could be argued, has been done.</strong></p>
              <p>Since the European Cup became the Champions League and incorporated group places and additional teams from the major countries, no team have retained the title and only Juventus and Valencia have been in back-to-back finals.</p>
              <p>Before Manchester United, the previous four winners of the Champions League — Porto, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Liverpool</span></a>, Barcelona and AC Milan — were eliminated in the first knock-out round of 16 the following season.</p>
              <p>In this campaign, Manchester United played Inter Milan, the champions of Italy, at that stage and won comfortably.</p>
              <p>It was a sign. Here was a different animal, a club with a squad so strong they could resist fatigue, and a manager so driven he would not allow his players to stand still</p>
              <p>Make no mistake, if Manchester United beat Barcelona tomorrow, it will be the most significant victory by an English club in European competition.</p>
              <p>There are two English teams who have retained their title as champions of Europe: Liverpool in 1977 and 1978 and Nottingham Forest in 1979 and 1980.</p>
              <p>These were fabulous achievements, too; but they do not compare to Manchester United keeping the prize in the 21st century.</p>
              <p>Liverpool played 16 games to win their back-to-back crowns, Nottingham Forest played 18.</p>
              <p>Manchester United are on a run of 25 games, and will need to make it 26 against a Barcelona team who have laid waste to the record books in Spain.</p>
              <p>It is often stated that there are no easy games in football, but there are, and there were, and a number of them occurred in the early rounds of the old European Cup.</p>
              <p>Not any more.</p>
              <p>English clubs may have made it look simple in recent seasons, but the calibre of opposition is tougher than at any time before.</p>
              <p>The random factor, the soft draw, has all but been eliminated.</p>
              <p>To reach this stage, across two seasons, Manchester United have played Sporting Lisbon, Roma, Dynamo Kiev, Lyon, Roma, Barcelona, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Chelsea</span></a>, Villarreal, AaB Aalborg, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/celtic.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Celtic</span></a>, Inter Milan, Porto, Arsenal and, now, Barcelona.</p>
              <p>Winning in 1977 and 1978, Liverpool faced Crusaders, Trabzonspor, St Etienne, FC Zurich, Borussia Moenchengladbach, Dynamo Dresden, Benfica, Borussia Moenchengladbach and FC Brugge.</p>
              <p>Nottingham Forest played Liverpool, AEK Athens, Grasshopper, Cologne, Malmo, Osters IF Vaxjo, Arges Pitesti, Dynamo Berlin, Ajax and Hamburg.</p>
              <p>For at least two of those teams, answers on a postcard, please.</p>
              <p>Those who said Sweden and Romania, go to the top of the class.</p>
              <p>This is not to decry the successes of previous generations.</p>
              <p>A team can only win a tournament in the format that is available; who is to say that the great Liverpool team would not have emerged triumphant across 26 games in two seasons, too?</p>
              <p>Yet even those involved in the old competition acknowledge that the modern Champions League presents a more stringent examination of a team than did the European Cup.</p>
              <p>Mark Lawrenson also travelled to Rome on Monday, scene of his victory as a player with Liverpool in 1984.</p>
              <p>He said that while the old European Cup could throw up a rogue draw against serious opposition early in the competition — the biggest clubs are now protected by the seeding system — the sheer volume of strong, wealthy opponents in the Champions League now makes it a different proposition.</p>
              <p>‘When we beat Roma, we knew Falcao, their Brazilian player, and maybe one other, but that was about it,’ Lawrenson recalled.</p>
              <p>‘As for the rest of them, we didn’t have a clue. 'Now, you know everything about the opposition, and they know everything about you. 'That professionalism has gone up a level, which makes it harder.’</p>

              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Those who espouse the difficulty of the old format, with the presence of instant knockout rounds from the start, often make the argument that a modern Champions League team can afford to lose the odd game, while the European Cup competitor could not. </strong></p>
              <p>History does not bear this out, either. Manchester United have not lost a single match across these two years, winning 15 and drawing 10 of 25.</p>
              <p>Compare that to Liverpool, who lost four of their 16, or Nottingham Forest, who lost two in 18, and drew four.</p>
              <p>Any game played across two legs carries the potential for defeat and then retrieval and Liverpool exercised it in the unlikeliest places, not least Trabzonspor in Turkey, where they lost 1-0.</p>
              <p>It is a myth that just one slip spelt disaster in the old European Cup.</p>
              <p>Liverpool lost twice on the way to the final in 1978, and played only seven matches.</p>
              <p>That year, they received a bye in the first round, meaning that a solitary win against Dynamo Dresden of East Germany at Anfield — they lost the away leg 2-1 — was enough to put the team in the quarter-finals.</p>
              <p>The Kop may join Michel Platini, the UEFA president, in romanticising the old days, but in victory, the case for United as the greatest of all champions would be a compelling one.</p>

              against Everton in the FA Cup semi-final defeat and the Bulgarian has
              admitted the incident has shaken his confidence ahead of Wednesday's
              meeting with Barcelona.</strong></p>
              <p>He said: "That hurt. I'm not sure I'd step up now."</p>
              <p>Berbatov also claimed only victory in Rome would make him feel like an equal in the United dressing room.</p>
              <p>"I am part of this team but I don't feel fully part of it as I didn't win the Champions League (last season)," he added.</p>
              <p>"If we can do that again this year, with me in the team, it will mean so much. I was jealous watching last year."</p>
