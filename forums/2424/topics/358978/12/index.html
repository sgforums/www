                                      whenever Man Utd lost.. you come over to us and try to give comfort
                                      but it actually contains sarcasm and then you say WE DONT DO THIS
                                      AND DONT DO THAT UNLESS THEY GOT PROVOKE. For goodness sake.. you
                                      look at all your participation in our threads and forums.. Thank
                                      god for good ness sake scram back to your YNWA forum and rot there.

                                      sarcasms.</p>

              <p>I have nothing against Liverpool fans, as seen in my other post where StevieG wanted MU to win, in fact, I posted "kudos to him".  I didn't target pool fans, but just in general Anti-MU fans who for the past week, "prefers" barca to win. I am happy for them cause now, they can sleep and eat well..</p>
              <p>Dude, U come in here, saying you win big $$, and saying the shortest guy score? For those who bet big on MU win, you think they read your comments and not get pissed off? U may claim to be writing neutrally, but then, it gloats people leh.</p>
              <p>But you lucky la, most MU fans are smarter &amp; with bigger hearts, so I believe they will take your remarks at face value and not read between the lines and thus deem you are making a general comment and not trying to shame us.</p>

              <p>Haha. I just feel everything from the tactics to the selection of players were wrong. The man marking were wrong.. Eto too fast for Vidic. Sadly Rio's match sharpness were not there.. O'Shea was busy deterring attacks from Henry.. Evra was leaving spaces for Eto and Messi to run about..</p>
              <p>I also thought Anderson's inclusion in the starting line up was to maimed Iniesta's dribbling of the ball. But I was wrong.. Our 3 man midfield still gave Barca the time to pass and dribble...</p>

              Man Utd started well in the first 10 mins, but faded after conceded. what a bad goal to concede by Vidic, who was easily deceived by Etoo's change of direction. what a soft goal to concede. from that point on, barcelone confidend grew and Man Utd committing more stray passes and passes to Barcelona players very often. I thought Man Utd would improve in the second half, Barcelona just got better in the second half, the final scoreline would be 4 or 5 if Barcelona is more prolific with their chances. Man Utd just collapsed in the second half.
              
              I really hope Man Utd can play like Barcelona, possession football, good passing and not spray long and hopeful punts upfield, like a typical english long balls. The difference between Man Utd and Barcelona midfielders is Xavi &amp; Iniesta seldom miss pass and long punt to its strikers, whereas Carrick and co keep passing to Barcelona players and punting long hopefull balls to ronaldo or rooney, but always pass it to Barcelona defenders. 
              
              Gullit once said, if you do a long pass, it is likely to land in the feet of opposing defenders, not your strikers. It is like giving the ball to your opponent, period!
              
              The best of english can't cope with the best spanish can offer. at least this season, la liga reign supreme over BPL.
              let's see if Barcelona can break the curse of holders never retaining the title next season.

              <p>I have nothing against Liverpool fans, as seen in my other post where StevieG wanted MU to win, in fact, I posted "kudos to him".  I didn't target pool fans, but just in general Anti-MU fans who for the past week, "prefers" barca to win. I am happy for them cause now, they can sleep and eat well..</p>
              <p>Dude, U come in here, saying you win big $$, and saying the shortest guy score? For those who bet big on MU win, you think they read your comments and not get pissed off? U may claim to be writing neutrally, but then, it gloats people leh.</p>
              <p>But you lucky la, most MU fans are smarter &amp; with bigger hearts, so I believe they will take your remarks at face value and not read between the lines and thus deem you are making a general comment and not trying to shame us.</p>

              goals changed matches and the first goal proved that. Man Utd did well in the first 10 mins. especially in the second half, Man Utd totally collapsed and was lucky to escape only 2-0 defeat. It could have been a more heavier defeat.
              
              Man Utd passing was really atrocious. long balls and stray passes to Barcelona players, did you watch that?
