              <div><span><strong>Federico Macheda admits he can think of nothing better than lifting the Champions League for Manchester United in his home city of Rome.</strong> </span></div>
              <div id="articlebody">
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Red Devils have the chance to become the first team since the competition's inception in 1992 to win successive titles when they face Barcelona at the Stadio Olimpico next week.</p>
              <p>Macheda must first secure a place on the bench for the game and could get a chance to stake his claim against Hull on Sunday, with manager Sir Alex Ferguson almost certain to rest his star names ahead of the final.</p>
              <p>The 17-year-old has already made a name for himself at Old Trafford this term after scoring two decisive goals in his first two appearances for the club, against Aston Villa and Sunderland respectively.</p>
              <p>Plucked from the Lazio youth team in September 2007, the Italian has made no secret of his love for his home city as he looks to cap off what has already been a memorable season.</p>
              <p>"It's a dream I've had many times in the last few days. Me with the champions in my own stadium, he told Corriere dello Sport.</p>
              <p>"I hope it happens but I don't even know if I will be on the bench. Manchester have many great players and there is a big competition for places. It would be fantastic playing for just a few minutes."</p>
              <p>Despite scaling heights that seemed unimaginable at the start of the campaign, the striker insists his feet are firmly planted on the ground.</p>
              <p>"Here people think I am a hero but I have only scored two goals in the Premier League. I have done nothing and I must show my value.</p>
              <p>"The most beautiful things arrive now and it is necessary to keep my head on my shoulders and continue playing football."</p>

              I certainly hope I am right, that Man Utd will attack Barcelona back 4, as three of their defenders are either suspended or injured, but also need to defend well as Barcelona likes to play possession and passing game, like Arsenal.
              
              I think Henry will start on the bench, as he is not 100% match fit. Iniesta may start the game though. Barcelona may play 4-5-1, with Etoo as the lone striker, supported by Messi in the free role, plus 4 midfielders. Yaya Toure to protect the back 4 as midfield anchorman.
              
              That said, Man Utd will pay heed to practise pk and also rehearsing in the players mind if that happen. should look at how barcelona players take their pk. It may pan out to a pk after 120 mins, like last season.

              <h2>FERGUSON HAILS PIQUE PERFORMANCE</h2>
              <div><span id="intelliTXT"><img id="articleImage" src="http://images.football365.com/09/05/240/Pique_2293069.jpg" border="0" alt="Pique - returned to Barca last summer."></span></div>

              <div><span><strong>Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson will head into next week's Champions League final hoping their bid to retain the trophy is not scuppered by a familiar face.</strong> </span></div>
              <div><span>.</span></div>
              <div><span>Ferguson sold Gerard Pique back to Barcelona last summer for £5million because the defender wanted more first-team football and was also keen on a return to his homeland. </span></div>
              <div><span>.</span></div>
              <div><span>Although he was involved in a number of matches last season he could not break the Rio Ferdinand-Nemanja Vidic partnership on a regular basis and the United boss reluctantly let him go. </span></div>
              <div><span>.</span></div>
              <div></div>
              <div id="articlebody">
              <p>The 22-year-old has since proved what Ferguson knew all along when he tempted the player away from the Catalans as a youngster, before he could sign a professional contract.</p>
              <p>Pique has outshone his more illustrious and experienced captain Carles Puyol and kept veteran Mexico defender Rafael Marquez out of the side.</p>
              <p>Despite his relative youth he has been the rock at the heart of Barcelona's defence and that has come as no surprise to Ferguson.</p>
              <p>"I have always liked the boy. I did expect him to reach this level so quickly," he said. "He has fantastic qualities but most importantly, he has a good self-determination about him. He is a winner and a good professional.</p>
              <p>"I always thought he would do well. We were disappointed to lose him but we understood at the time that his family desire was to go back to Barcelona.</p>
              <p>"He looked at Ferdinand and Vidic and wanted to be in the first team immediately. "I can understand why he wanted to go back to Barcelona. We wished him well at the time but we don't wish him well on Wednesday."</p>
              <p>Ironically, had Pique stayed there would have been a chance he could have been lining up for United against Barcelona in Rome as Ferguson has a fitness doubt over Ferdinand, who has missed the last three matches with a calf injury.</p>
              <p>Instead it is another youngster Jonny Evans who is on standby, having partnered Vidic in Ferdinand's absence.</p>
              <p>Ferguson drew comparisons between the development of Pique and the 21-year-old Evans, saying their progress was very much down to United's youth system.</p>
              <p>"The kid (Evans) has had a fantastic season," said the Scot. "Jonny and Gerard both came through together. It is a credit to our academy they both could be playing in the final - I am sure Gerard will be, and it will be a nice touch."</p>

              <p><strong>Barcelona’s management team were sitting uncomfortably on Thursday as Lionel Messi missed training with a knee problem. </strong></p>

              <p><strong>The little Argentinian genius, who has scored 37 goals and created a
              further 16 this season, arrived for Barcelona’s press open day carrying
              a slight limp and sat out of practice as a precaution. </strong></p>
              <p>Spanish media are currently positive that the injury will not rule
              Messi out of the Champions League final against Manchester United, with
              suggestions even emerging that the player’s absence could be early mind
              games.</p>
              <p>There was better news for Pep Guardiola though, with fellow schemer
              Andres Iniesta confirming that he expects to be fit for Wednesday
              final.</p>
              <p>"I write just to inform all of you that my injury is on the right road,” Iniesta wrote in his official blog.</p>
              <p>“Since I injured myself against Villarreal in the last match in the
              Camp Nou, I have tried to put everything into recovering and managing
              to be at 100% for next Wednesday.</p>
              <p>"Today I can say that for the past two days I've already been doing
              work in the mountain with Emili Ricard, my physiotherapist, to
              strengthen my muscles and I'm getting fitter.</p>
              <p>"The truth is that it is incredible training and I hope shortly to be able to begin to run and to touch the ball.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">PATRICE EVRA has a message for Barcelona’s golden boy: Don’t 
              Messi with me because I’m the top man.</h2>
              <p class="article">The Manchester United left-back has the most daunting job of all in the 
              Champions League final next Wednesday.</p>
              <p class="article">He is the man charged with keeping Barca superstar Lionel Messi quiet.</p>
              <p class="article">But if confidence counts for anything, he can look forward to silencing the 
              Argie forward for the second successive season.</p>
              <p class="article">The French stopper is convinced he can stand alongside any of the world’s 
              great defenders — and feels he proved the point with a rare <strong>BAD</strong> game in the Carling Cup final back in March.</p>
              <p class="article">Evra had a shocker against Tottenham’s Aaron Lennon and immediately 
              the knives were out.</p>
              <p class="article">But the man himself felt if one bad game stood out so much, it merely proved 
              how well he had done in all the others.</p>
              <p class="article">Evra, 28, insisted: “I’ve played for United for three years 
              and had one bad game, so I was actually happy with the criticism because it 
              made me believe I’m the best left-back in the world.</p>
              <p class="article">“When you’ve had one bad performance and people are 
              criticising you, it makes you proud. I said after that ‘OK, we will 
              see’.</p>
              <p class="article">“It wasn’t a good day in the final but I just played one 
              bad game, that’s all.</p>
              <p class="article">“But after that I think I showed my real form again and you can see 
              that now.</p>
              <p class="article">“Every year I think I have improved. I have been honoured to be 
              named in the World’s Best XI twice, the Premier League XI twice — 
              and things like that make you believe. But it’s not easy.</p>
              <p class="article">“You can be the best left-back in the world but if you play badly in 
              the final, people will say you’re the worst.</p>
              <p class="article">“And of course I am playing against Messi, so it won’t be 
              easy.</p>
              <p class="article">“But I won’t prepare any differently against him, because 
              every day in training I am up against people like Rooney, Berbatov, Ronaldo 
              and Tevez, so you know what to do against big players.</p>
              <p class="article">“The only thing is, against Messi you can stop him 10 times but if 
              he passes you once and scores, people say ‘Evra played a poor game’.</p>
              <p class="article">“I don’t know if he’s better this year but he’s 
              scored more goals and has probably been more important for Barcelona.</p>
              <p class="article">“I respect him but must make sure he doesn’t play well 
              again.”</p>
              <p class="article">Evra snuffed out the threat of Messi in both legs of the semi-final 12 months 
              ago en route to United’s Moscow triumph.</p>
              <p class="article">Yet it has not all been plain sailing for the man who cost £5.5million 
              from Monaco — where he also tasted Champions League glory — 
              three years ago.</p>
              <p class="article">In December he landed a four-game ban for his part in last season’s 
              post-match bust-up with the Stamford Bridge ground staff.</p>
              <p class="article">And after setting up United’s second in a 3-0 romp on his return, 
              ironically against Chelsea, he suffered a hamstring strain which kept him 
              out for another month.</p>
              <p class="article">Even now, the mere mention of it sees the usual smile replaced by a tightening 
              of the lips.</p>
              <p class="article">Evra insisted: “If you ask me about it for the next 10 years I’d 
              still say I don’t accept it. I didn’t touch anyone but got 
              a four-game ban and it still hurts now.</p>
              <p class="article">“I touched no one, you can see that on any video in the world.</p>
              <p class="article">“I was relaxed after meeting the FA and when the boss told me ‘Pat, 
              it’s four games’, I couldn’t believe it.</p>
              <p class="article">“My team-mates did a good job at a busy time with lots of games.</p>
              <p class="article">“I was banned for a month, came back and set up the second goal 
              against Chelsea — and then got injured.</p>
              <p class="article">“Two months out was very, very difficult. For me it was an 
              injustice. OK, now it’s finished but it is still in my heart, I 
              still have pain about it.</p>
              <p class="article">“I remember every day in the gym thinking of coming back against 
              Chelsea. I was angry before the game and although I played well, that ban 
              killed me.”</p>
              <p class="article">Surely, then, after silencing the critics in the same way he silenced Messi 
              last year, another European triumph would be the highlight of his career.</p>
              <p class="article">Don’t you believe it. That came more than a decade ago when Evra 
              chanced his arm in the nether reaches of Italy after failing to make a mark 
              in France.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: “I had a year at Marsala in Serie C and then another at 
              Monza before I went back to France and I have great memories of Italy.</p>
              <p class="article">“They opened the door to my career and when I’m asked what 
              is my best moment, I don’t say the Champions League final or things 
              like that, I say it was in Italy.</p>
              <p class="article">“I was 17 and they were great to me. I remember when I got my first 
              tracksuit, looking at it in the mirror and feeling so proud.”</p>

              <p>UNITED will be hoping the spirit of 1991 will help them beat Barcelona in Rome next week.<br> <br>The
              Reds have lost the right to be recognised as the `home team' by UEFA
              thus the Spaniards will be wearing their first choice kit of red and
              blue.<br> <br>That combination rules out United wearing their
              traditional home kit and also the all-blue strip that was a replica of
              their 1968 Wembley European Cup winning kit.<br> <br>So the
              European Champions will wear the third choice of all-white. Not only
              will that rile Barca, whose Spanish rivals Real Madrid sport the famous
              all white strip, but it is also a lucky omen for United who beat
              Barcelona in the 1991 European Cup Winners' Cup final in Rotterdam
              wearing the white kit.</p>
              <p>Another thingy, the last time, one spurs striker joined us, we got the cup, hopefully, history repeats itself...</p>

              <p>nope, there are new players coming in, and hence the hunger. Also, this time, Ronaldo needs to show he is better than Messi. And it is not like we are on top of mountain cause we still lag behind Pool in terms of UCL cups..</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #005689;">Manchester United</span> will try to inspire their players with an emotive tribute to Sir Matt Busby at the <span style="color: #005689;">Champions League</span> final against Barcelona in Rome next Wednesday. Busby would have turned 100 on the eve of the final, the 10th anniversary of Sir Alex Ferguson's first European Cup success, and the club have received permission from Uefa to create a huge mosaic in honour of their former manager at the end of the Stadio Olimpico that houses United's supporters.</strong></p>
              <p>The mosaic will spell "For Sir Matt" and will be made up of 16,000 red and white sheets, including a black and white portrait of the man who has been described by Ferguson as "the heartbeat of Manchester United". It will be unveiled shortly before kick-off and the organisers, the Stretford End Flags group, say they hope it will "inspire the team" and be "a tribute to the Godfather of football and the architect of the modern Manchester United".</p>
              <p>Busby, who died in 1994, was manager at Old Trafford from 1945 to 1969, surviving the Munich air disaster, and had a second spell in charge during the 1970-71 season. As well as winning the league five times and the FA Cup twice, his 1968 team, including George Best and Bobby Charlton, were the first-ever English side to win the European Cup, beating Benfica 4–1 at Wembley.</p>
              <p>"We wanted to do something to mark Sir Matt's 100th birthday and we were approached by the fans with an idea that would recognise the role he had played in the club's unique place in Europe," the United chief executive, David Gill, said . "Alex liked the idea straight away. The mosaic will remind millions of people around the world what a great man Sir Matt was."</p>
              <p>United have also invited Busby's son, Sandy, and daughter Sheena to be the club's guests in Rome and attend a dinner with the club's directors on Tuesday evening.</p>
              <p>"It's going to be really heart-rending when the mosaic is lifted up and I'm sure there are going to be a few tears from my sister and myself," said Sandy. "My dad would have been so proud and pleased. He was a sentimental man and he would be absolutely delighted that the fans still remember him with such affection and still sing songs in his honour but this is something else – he will be the proudest man in heaven."</p>
              <p>Cristiano Ronaldo, meanwhile, has said he is not the least interested in what is going on at Real Madrid. "I'm sure [Florentino] Pérez would create an incredible team at Madrid but at the moment I'm at United and I don't care about what happens there. I only care about what will happen next season at United."</p>

              <p><strong>Barcelona midfielder Andres Iniesta promised 80,000 titlecelebrating fans: 'We will see you back here with the European Cup on Thursday' as Manchester United's final opponents were given an emotional send-off after their last home game of the season.</strong></p>
              <p>Both Iniesta and Thierry Henry, who look on course to be fit for selection, took the microphone as Barca paraded the league trophy and the Copa del Rey around the Nou Camp.</p>

              <p>Guardiola told celebrating supporters: 'We will not fail you in Rome.' And striker Samuel Eto'o added: 'If I have to run 80km to win the trophy on Wednesday, I will do it.'</p>
              <p>Eto'o was one of only two possible starters for the final in Rome as Barcelona lost 1-0 to Osasuna. Veteran left back Sylvinho, who may replace the suspended Eric Abidal, was the other.</p>
              <p>The former Arsenal player faces the prospect of marking Cristiano Ronaldo. Sylvinho, 35, said: 'Ronaldo is difficult to defend against. He can do things that others cannot do. His mind is so quick, but I think my mind is quick, too. I don't think I will be our weakness if I play.'</p>
