            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Reds thrilled by Scholes' return<br><br>Paul Scholes slipped back into action on Sunday and played his part as United beat Tottenham 3-1 in the FA Cup fourth round.</strong><br><br>The fans at Old Trafford greeted his return from a three-month absence with rapturous applause. Moments after coming on for Michael Carrick, it was as if he had never been away as he pinged a perfect pass into the path of Cristiano Ronaldo on the right wing.<br><br>Scholes also tried his shooting boots out, narrowly missing the target with an attempt from just outside the box. He popped up at the other end too, using a calm head to nod the ball back into Edwin van der Sar's arms when the visitors were pressing for an equaliser.<br><br>"ItÂ’s great to have Scholesy back for the big run-in now," says Owen Hargreaves, Paul's partner in central midfield.<br><br>"I think ScholesyÂ’s probably one of the best players IÂ’ve ever played with. I think heÂ’ll be our most important players towards the end of the season now. If he's fit, he could be crucial."<br><br>Scholes' 27 minutes on Sunday could put him in the frame for a start against Portsmouth, the only team he's scored against this season (in the 1-1 draw on 15 August). Whomever Sir Alex selects, it's inevitable that some top players will have to live with being left out.<br><br>"We canÂ’t play every game," accepts Hargreaves, "but the camaraderieÂ’s there and everyone sticks together. As long as weÂ’re successful I think weÂ’ll all be happy."</div>

              <h3>Fergie hails 'amazing' Scholes</h3>

              <p>SIR Alex Ferguson believes that at the age of 33, Paul Scholes still has something special to offer Manchester United.<br><br>The former England midfielder enjoyed a 25-minute cameo appearance in the 3-1 victory against Tottenham in the FA Cup on Sunday.<br><br>It was Scholes' first run-out in three months following an knee operation.<br><br>Yet it seemed as though he had never been away, so smoothly did he slip into the United framework.<br><br>Scholes underwent an operation to repair his cartilage in October after pulling up before the Champions League match against Dynamo Kiev.<br><br>He returned to light training over Christmas and was given the all-clear by the medical staff last Thursday.<br><br>Old Trafford boss Ferguson said: "It was a bonus to have Scholesy back. He brings a bit of urgency to the game.<br><br>"Something special seems to happen when the ball goes to him. He has an innate sense of composure about him.<br><br>"The game just seems to stop so he controls it. He is an amazing player."<br><br>Scholes' return comes at an ideal time for United as they are chasing success on three fronts.<br><br>Having safely moved through to the FA Cup fifth round, where they will face Arsenal at home, United turn their attention back the Barclays Premier League on Wednesday as Portsmouth visit the leaders at Old Trafford. Europe's top prize is also still up for grabs with a two-legged match against Lyon to come.<br><br>Scholes looks certain to be involved against Portsmouth providing he has suffered no reaction to his knee problem.<br><br>There is now fierce competition for places in midfield, according to Owen Hargreaves.<br><br>He said: "We can't play every game but the camaraderie's there and everyone sticks together.<br><br>"As long as we are successful I think we will all be happy.<br><br>"It's great to have Scholesy back for the big run-in now.<br><br>"He is probably one of the best players I've ever played with.<br><br>"He will be one of our most important players towards the end of the season now. If he's fit, he could be crucial."</p>
