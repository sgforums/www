              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">UEFA general secretary David
              Taylor has revealed an avenue of appeal could be open to Manchester
              United over Darren Fletcher's red card.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>The Scotland international
              was dismissed late on in Tuesday's Champions League semi-final win over
              Arsenal for a professional foul on Cesc Fabregas.</p>
              <p>Replays showed Fletcher had in fact played the ball but UEFA
              confirmed on Wednesday that United do not have the right to appeal
              against the referee's decision.</p>
              <p>As things stand Fletcher will sit out the final against
              Barcelona in Rome later this month but Taylor has hinted at a reprieve
              for the combative midfielder.</p>
              <p>"I have spoken with Alex Ferguson personally on this - as fate
              would have it we shared a car after the match. We were rather thrown
              together but had an interesting discussion," Taylor told The Sun.</p>
              <p>"He was very fair about the referee and what had happened but equally he was very disappointed for Darren, as are we all.</p>
              <p>"I tried to give Alex as much advice as I could with regards the procedure in these circumstances.</p>
              <p>"There is no formal process. But if the club want to write to us
              with information - such as video evidence - explaining why they think
              this is a harsh punishment then they can do that.</p>
              <p>"The likelihood is that we'd then refer the matter to our disciplinary body.</p>
              <p>"They would then look to see if there were any special circumstances to justify any departure from established procedures.</p>
              <p>"I must stress there is normally no way these matters can be overturned."</p>
              <p>Fletcher's hopes could hang on referee Roberto Rosetti admitting
              to his apparent error in his match report, but Taylor concedes such an
              admission may not be enough to reverse the red card.</p>
              <p>"The ref may take the view a mistake has been made and include
              that in his report but that wouldn't be in any way decisive," he
              continued.</p>
              <p>"It's an entirely discretionary thing, whether or not the committee feels there is reason to intervene.</p>
              <p>"That's the position. Strictly speaking there's no appeal process but representation can be made and looked at."</p>
