              <p><strong>Owen Hargreaves has undergone another knee operation in a bid to save his career.</strong></p>
              <p>The Manchester United midfielder, who has been blighted by tendinitis since making the £18million switch from Bayern Munich 18 months ago, went back under the knife at Dr Richard Steadman's clinic in Colorado on Thursday.</p>
              <p>It is the second time in four months that he has had his right knee operated on.</p>
              <p>The England star, who has not played since September, has already been ruled out for the rest of the season.</p>
              <p>He will be given a strict rehabilitation programme in the hope that he will be fit for pre-season training.</p>
              <p>United, meanwhile, will hand a debut to £7m new boy Zoran Tosic when they face Derby in the Carling Cup semi-final at Old Trafford on Tuesday night.</p>
              <p>The 21-year-old Serbian from Partizan Belgrade will feature as United look to overturn a 1-0 first-leg deficit.</p>

              <p>me too, his energy and ball tackling were second to none, maybe park.</p>
              <p>at least with him, he can bring the ball forward with pace and pass them intelligently, unlike Anderson..</p>

              hopefully he can come out of the operation better - if not it will be waste if he has to call time on his career.
              
              Man U does miss him a bit.  I still rem his outstanding performance as right back / winger against Barca. Fletcher is crap.  And Anderson needs time to mature.

              <p>well, the arguements are that they are having stop-go seasons where they don't even play 3-4 games in a row but often come into games where they are instantly need to produce or games that are already 'concluded'.</p>
              <p>with Tosic and Valenica, Nani's future is in doubt. He has failed to build on his first season, and unlike Ronaldo, has not go from strength to strength.</p>
              <p>Anderson, is fast becoming a kleberson unless he maintain some consistency.</p>
              <p>but they got youth on their side but how long is SAF willing to wait is another question.</p>

              <p>nani's another let down. besides the wonder goals(and flips) i think he's just ronaldo wannabe and alwaysbe</p>
              <p>fletcher's performance has been solid cept the last 2 matches. and he's a big match player, unlike nani (played against derby and still din perform)</p>
              <p>but well, nth beats the carrick scholes combi <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>anderson is jus 20 this year or 21 for god sake..how u expect him to do this kind of stuff so fast besides he is placed into a defensive position..he played well against derby today...</p>
              <p>bascially both anderson and nani needs time and games ...</p>

              <p>problem is he did well last season and people expect same level if not better but he is disappointing a lot of fans..</p>
              <p>yes, he is 20, 21, but look around, what age did rooney burst onto the scene? now, 20,21 is not very "young".</p>
              <p>"he played well against derby" how can that be a good barometer when derby is not even an EPL team? if he can't do well, he is a goner la.</p>

              <p>Yeah I agree Anderson has done well enough.</p>
              <p>And I think the best buy for the last 3 seasons will be Berbatov.</p>

              <p>anderson's not even played defensively pls. in fact SAF prolly encouraged him to go forward more. and he was bought as Scholes replacement, which is to shoot on sight and make right passes.. his passes against derby were disappointing. and nani's goal just reminded how good he is, at shooting only.. nth else. he din cover enough ground defensively unlike when park plays.. and he over dribbles.</p>
              <p>thanks iceFatboy for pointing out the age matter. rooney did exploded at nani's and anderson's age or prolly earlier. and for much less money. period.</p>
              <p>side note, its disappointing tt tosic din debut. cant wait to see him replace nani.</p>

              <p>anderson was unlucky in that he was spotted, and then got injured thus he waited for a while before playing..</p>
              <p>I don't think Rooney played every game, only selectively, but the key is he PERFORMED.  haha..</p>
