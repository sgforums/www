              <p>It seemed almost inevitable that the Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid
              rumours would resurface if the Portuguese winger won the FIFA World
              Player of the Year award, and it has taken only a few hours for tongues
              to start wagging.<br><br>Spanish journalist Guillem Balague claimed
              this morning, via his website, that the Manchester United star's agent,
              Jorge Mendes, has come to an agreement with Madrid president Ramon
              Calderon meaning that Ronaldo will move in the summer.<br><br>Earlier
              reports had stated that a similar agreement had been set-up with
              Florentino Perez, which he would exploit in order to re-gain his
              presidency at the Bernabeu.<br><br>However, it is instead with Calderon
              that a deal has been struck, allowing the Portuguese international to
              tell a press conference before the FIFA ceremony: "My agent does not
              have an agreement with Florentino Pérez."<br><br>Now, Balague has spoken to <em>Sky Sports News</em>, giving "access to the details of the agreement, including the financial terms," as promised within his initial claim.<br><br>The
              agent explained: "Ramon Calderon, I understand, has got an agreement
              with the player. He is going to play €12 million to Cristiano Ronaldo,
              €8m to Jorge Mendes, the agent, and they've got €85m - which will go up
              to €105m - to pay Manchester United.<br><br>"All that doesn't mean
              there's any agreement between the clubs. Still, I put all these things
              to high standing figures at Real Madrid, and they all came out with the
              same answer: 'We're not going to deny this, we're not going to say that
              it's true, but you're on the right path'."<br><br><strong>Deal Or No Deal</strong><br><br>Turning
              his attention to how the apparent understanding will affect Manchester
              United, Balague continued: "It's a verbal agreement and I think there
              will be a punishment though, if it doesn't get respected in the summer.
              <br><br>"It's up to Manchester United to accept or, as they did in the
              summer, not accept any kind of deal. What is strange that, if Cristiano
              Ronaldo doesn't want to leave Manchester United, why is his agent
              agreeing things with Real Madrid?<br><br>"I know Sir Alex Ferguson is going to be upset."<br><br>Asked about the legal implications, he mused: "You'd have to ask Real Madrid and UEFA. You find this constantly in football.<br><br>"Now it's a matter of convincing United with money... it won't be easily done."<br><br>Agreement in place, <em>Los Merengues</em> have apparently decided to scrap plans to sign Wigan Athletic's Luis Antonio Valencia in order to save funds."</p>

              <p>Well, I am unsure about others but @ United..Neville, Scholes, Giggs, are all one club.. Yes, Keano, Stam, RVN, Beckham are top classes, but then, they can't fit into the managers' plan.When these players bring disputes into the dressing room, only logical team is to remove, cut out the cancer, take the rotting apple away.</p>
              <p>Rem how SAF chopped the earlier batch of Robson, Ince and etc, and bring in the young players, Mark Lawerence laughed and remarked, "you can't win the league with youngters". Well, he did it with Beckham, Giggs, Scholes, Nevilles, and Butt..Now, even Wenger is doing it, but with less success.</p>
              <p>Yes, he condemns, but what about Cantona, after his kungfu kick? What about Beckham after his world cup dismissal? or Even Ronaldo and Rooney?</p>
              <p>Who introduced the 4 strikers rotation policy? And didn't it win the club the first, true treble in 99..</p>
              <p>Ask any other managers who have called SAF for help. He never refused to pass on his knowledge and time. That speaks volume of his passion for the game.</p>
              <p>Yes, Keano is my hero but when he lost focus of the team, and put himself first, SAF has to do what he has to do. And I agreed with SAF, for the club comes first. No compromise.</p>

              <p>Whether he goes or not its not the big deal, Whats important is he has already helped United win lots ot trophies during his time there and that should be respected.</p>
              <p>One more thing I feel is, It won't be a bad time to cash in on him by 2010 cos good players who start out very early, normally don't last very long... Especially one like Ronaldo who used speed as his strongest point... If we notice, he don't do as much twist and turns like he used too thesedays... And as he gets older, could be more prone to injury when doing his tricks...</p>
              <p>Today he is already 24, two yrs from now and he wouldbe 26... Look at Ronaldinho, Today he is 28 and already a shadow of his previous best... To be fair, at 27 he seemed to have decline partly because he started out very early too...</p>
              <p>So I say in 2 yrs time sell him away to Real Madrid or whoever wants him. As long as don't sell to another English club will do. They can still get a big sum before he loses his value... Take the 100m and buy 3 to 4 very good youngsters for the future... Its better that way, cos you never know when he will start to go downhill...</p>
