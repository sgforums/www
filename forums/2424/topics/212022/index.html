            <div class='col-md body'>Rio wants Lisbon revenge<br><br>Manchester United will be out for revenge against Benfica in the UEFA Champions League, according to Rio Ferdinand.<br><br>United slumped to a 2-1 defeat in last season's competition, which put an end to The Reds' proud record of reaching the knockout stages of the competition.<br><br>Having made a strong start to the new campaign in Group F, with a 3-2 victory over Celtic at Old Trafford, Ferdinand admits the players will be motivated by more than just the three points on Tuesday night.<br><br>"To go out at that stage in the Champions League was very disappointing," Ferdinand told Sky Sports News.<br><br>"You want to be playing in the latter stages of any tournament and the Champions League is the biggest, so we'd like to play in the latter stages of that.<br><br>"Last season was disappointing when we played there, this season we are going out to rectify that.<br><br>"We know there's not much more the manager can say to make us want to go over there and do a job.<br><br>"Losing to any team, it hurts you, but we've got an opportunity to rectify that now."<br><br>The team's results have also dipped in the last two games, taking just one point from a possible six against Arsenal and Reading in the league, and the team will be anxious to bounce back against the Portuguese giants.<br></div>
