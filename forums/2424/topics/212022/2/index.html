But Santos believes his side deserved more from the match.<br><br>"We feel disillusioned," he said. "It's sad after what the team did, especially in the first 45 minutes. We played an excellent game.<br><br>"We pressured them in midfield and recovered the ball in the attacking areas. Manchester clearly opted for a strategy of containment, in an attempt to take advantage of any errors of ours in a counter-attack situation."<br><br>United did exactly that when Louis Saha broke forward from Cristiano Ronaldo's pass, before lashing in the winner.<br><br>"In the second half, Manchester managed to control things better, but it is too much of an unjust result for what Benfica did."<br><br><a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA%2D9A47%2D47BC%2DB069%2D3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=366514" rel="nofollow">http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA%2D9A47%2D47BC%2DB069%2D3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=366514</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That was the best eleven of united i think... with Vidic and Heinze back, the defence looked more tougher.

            <div class='col-md body'>well, the new kid was not tooo bad too. the keeper from west brom.<br>the last I saw, his gloves seems abit big..<br><br>Edwin is experienced and sadly he came to United now.<br>Surprisingly, all our reserves and loaned keepers are doing quite well, like Tim &amp;  Ben..<br><br>Unjust or not, the end results counts. What's the point like Liverpool to have high counts of shots on goals but unable to win matches??<br><br>I am pleasantly surprised that SAF dare to change from all-attacking to contain and then counter-attack.. We are talking about millions of pounds gain or lost. And for a big club like MUFC, you won't expect them to go to others' backyard, and gift a win to the other team year in, year out, right??<br><br>Benfica will be stupid to expect that. and rightfully so, they lost.</div>
