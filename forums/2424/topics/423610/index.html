              <div id="article-body-blocks">
              <p>In the end, Darron Gibson could reflect on a job reasonably well done last night. He was prominently involved during those spells when Sir Alex Ferguson's side dominated possession, he generally took care of the ball and on the occasions he was a bit more ambitious with his passing, we saw a footballer who can play the ball long or short. So how can it be that this Irishman inspires so little trust he has been in danger lately of ousting Bébé and Gabriel Obertan as the player who makes <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester United" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united"><span style="color: #005689;">Manchester United</span></a>'s supporters despair the most?</p>
              <p>That might sound terribly harsh given the qualities he has demonstrated, sporadically, over time: a thunderbolt of a shot, a decent passing range and a quality that should not be under-estimated in football, namely the ability to carry the ball with his head up, sizing up the game.</p>
              <p>But that is not to say the scrutiny has been unwarranted. Gibson's involvement, at the expense of Paul Scholes, who later replaced him after 73 minutes, registered as a genuine shock and what then unfolded scarcely lifted the sense that, without their best passer, United lacked both the wit and creativity to represent a more significant threat.</p>
              <p>Gibson clearly has something if Ferguson should trust him with such a key assignment. He is functional. He gets about, puts in his quota of tackles and occasionally he might score a great goal with that wonderful power in his right boot.</p>
              <p>Yet the criticism does not attach itself to him purely because of the fact his name is not Scholes. Gibson does not have the passing range of Michael Carrick, let alone Scholes.</p>
              <p>He is not a slouch, but he can lack mobility. And here's the thing: this is not some kid trying to make a name for himself. Gibson is 24 later this year and at that age, it is no good talking about potential or of him learning the game; he should be imposing his personality on football matches as the norm rather than the exception. If a player has not established himself at his club at that age then it is probably worth wondering whether he ever will. If that comes across as unduly severe for what was, in essence, a decent enough six-out-of-10 performance, then consider the fact it is five years since Gibson made his debut, in a Carling Cup tie against Barnet, and that there has never been one concerted spell since when he has given the impression of establishing himself in the team for good.</p>
              <p>Giovanni Trapattoni, his manager for the Republic of Ireland, will tell anyone who cares to listen that Gibson should accept it is not going to happen for him at United.</p>
              <p>The opposite view, you might say, is that there is something admirable about the way Gibson grits his teeth and refuses to let go, but the frustrations of those who watch him on a regular basis are not without foundation.</p>
              <p>Or perhaps there is a wider issue here and Gibson's presence alongside Darren Fletcher and Carrick symbolises the shift in style that prompted such an astute reader of the game as Didier Deschamps to comment on the eve of the match that there was no longer the same "fantasy" attached to the modern-day United.</p>
              <p>They were the most devastating team in Europe when they last played here in the <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Champions League" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/championsleague"><span style="color: #005689;">Champions League</span></a>, the Class of 1999 incorporating four players – Scholes, Ryan Giggs, Roy Keane and David Beckham – who had legitimate credentials to be recognised as the greatest midfield quartet in the history of the sport.</p>
              <p>Giggs and Beckham brought artistry and penetration to the wings. Scholes was Zinedine Zidane's favourite player (enough said). Keane was not just in the engine-room; he was the engine-room.</p>
              <p>The current side lack that kind of stardust. It can happen, particularly when there are financial restraints in place. Is Gibson the man to replace Scholes in the coming years?</p>
              <p>Few would say he was. That man was available last summer but Ferguson, spending £7.4m on Bébé said there was "no value in the market".</p>
              <p>The man in question cost Tottenham Hotspur just a little more. His name: Rafael van der Vaart.</p>
