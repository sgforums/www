              <div id="placeholder_1"></div>
              <div id="abody" class="articlebody">
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Sir Alex Ferguson is hoping that Serbian defender Nemanja Vidic, who missed Saturday's 2-1 Premier League win over Bolton Wanderers here at Old Trafford with an ankle injury, will be fit enough to return in mid-week.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">But he admits he has concerns over both Evra and Giggs after they sustained knocks against Bolton.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">It was not a convincing performance from United but they returned to the top of the table thanks to Chelsea's loss to Aston Villa. </span><span style="color: #000000;">And although Ferguson is calling for improvements at the back - his defence have kept just three clean sheets in nine Premier League matches - he was happy to move back to the top of the table despite suffering further injuries.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">United's defence was the key to last season's title win and although Ferguson reckons the league is tougher this season, he believes his players can do better.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">"Giggs is doubtful for Moscow with a knock," said Ferguson as he surveyed his casualty list. </span><span style="color: #000000;">"Evra we will look at tomorrow (Sunday) and he may be doubtful. Vidic should be okay and definitely will be fit for Liverpool (a week on Sunday).</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">"I think (Dimitar) Berbatov will be okay and we will try and get Wayne Rooney ready but he will be okay for Liverpool." </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Ferguson added: "In the past few years we have had runs of games when we haven't lost goals and that's been important in winning the championship and we have to get back to that.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">"We were in a comfort zone at 2-0 and maybe we were relaxed in terms of our play and we should have finished the game off but we didn't.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">"Sometimes you can leave yourself regretting that but we got through and with the other results it's been a good day for us.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">"All the top teams have to accept it's a tough league."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Veteran Dutch goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar played for the first time since suffering a hand injury in pre-season and Ferguson feels that the former Ajax player will make a big difference to his defence.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">"Edwin was fantastic. He has the composure and the experience and steadiness at the back that's what his career is about."</span></p>

And United are now lesser without their World player of the year... So this being at Anfield, Pool would probably do well at home... And I guess most are expecting G &amp; T to be back for this... Its always a tough place to get points... So expect a tough battle...</p></div>

              <p>Liverpool is not at its best form now.</p>
              <p>You cannot compare with the team that beat Man Utd twice last year.</p>
              <p>Only advantage they have is that they are playing at home during mid week.</p>
              <p>But, they MUST win in order to stay in CL. (They are under unnecessary stress to perform and all balloons and beach balls will be banned in anfield)</p>
              <p>At the present moment, all the department at Liverpool are in bad shape and Ah Ben is really at a tactical mess in how to resolve it. (He is in self-denial mode)</p>
              <p>For Alex and Ah Ben, they have to decide who to rest for the showdown at Sunday.</p>
              <p>Alex have the depth of the squad to handle both matches.</p>
              <p>There is no guarantee that Liverpool can beat Man Utd even with SG and FT back cos they can switched off or they may be rested.</p>
              <p>So, if you are Alex, you should have no worries.</p>

              <p>last season is last season, this season is this season. meaning last season results were no indication of how the 2 teams will fare against each other this season.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All I can say is, the best teams win. it will be a tough match, no question. all will be involved in midweek CL match, so squad rotation will come into it by the time they face off next week on sunday. Rooney, Torres and Gerrard will be back next week in some capacity, as a subtitute. if liverpool were to lose, rafa's tenure will be seriously in doubt.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>lol this thread is CL, how come got liverpool match into it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">. Hope ferguson puts in a reserve squad against CSK Moscow, even if utd were to lose, its ok, just need to beat them when they come to old trafford.</p>

              <p>last season is last season, this season is this season. meaning
                  last season results were no indication of how the 2 teams will fare
                  against each other this season.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All I can say is, the best teams win. it will be a tough match,
                  no question. all will be involved in midweek CL match, so squad
                  rotation will come into it by the time they face off next week on
                  sunday. Rooney, Torres and Gerrard will be back next week in some
                  capacity, as a subtitute. if liverpool were to lose, rafa's tenure
                  will be seriously in doubt.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>lol this thread is CL, how come got liverpool match into it
                  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">. Hope ferguson puts in a reserve squad against
                  CSK Moscow, even if utd were to lose, its ok, just need to beat
                  them when they come to old trafford.</p>

              <p>in another thread, zocoss said something along the lines of form vs derbies.</p>
              <p>in such red hot derbies, esp mu vs pool, form is out of window, both teams will lock horn and go all out..</p>

              <p><strong>Wayne Rooney and Ryan Giggs are among five senior Manchester United players to have been ruled out of Wednesday's Champions League tie against CSKA Moscow.</strong></p>
              <p>United boss Sir Alex Ferguson had revealed the duo had been doubtful for the game and they have not been included in the squad to travel to Russia.</p>
              <p>Darren Fletcher, Park Ji-sung and Patrice Evra are also missing for United, who have made a 100 per cent start to Group B.</p>
              <p>Giggs will not make the trip to the Russian capital after picking up a knock during the Red Devils' 2-1 win over Bolton on Saturday when he played the full 90 minutes.</p>
              <p>Rooney is out with the calf strain suffered on international duty with England and he sat out the Bolton game as a result of the problem.</p>
              <p>He will also be sidelined for the game against CSKA Moscow, but Ferguson is optimistic the striker will be fit for Sunday's Premier League clash with arch-rivals Liverpool.</p>
              <p>Evra was another player to collect a knock against Bolton and he was replaced by John O'Shea in the final 10 minutes at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Fletcher and Park both missed the Bolton clash and are again unavailable as the 2008 winners look to edge a step closer to booking a place in the last 16 of the Champions League.</p>
              <p>However, Nemanja Vidic, who missed out against the Trotters due to an ankle problem, has travelled with the squad, along with Dimitar Berbatov.</p>

              <p>rest the regulars like ferdinand, VDS and play ben foster, nani, macheda instead. even lose also never mind, cos sunday is the more important match than this midweek CL. can always beat them when they come calling at old trafford. plus its a long trip to Russia and back.</p>

              <p><strong>Russia goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev faces an audition against the club many expect he will soon join. CSKA Moscow are ready to talk business with </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span><strong> during the winter as Sir Alex Ferguson prepares for life after Edwin van der Sar.</strong></p>
              <p>Akinfeev, 23, has an impressive cv. While the unconvincing Ben Foster has suffered a series of injuries and has yet to make 100 senior appearances, his rival has racked up honours — 37 caps and a Euro 2008 semi-final outing with Russia, as well as three League titles, four Russian Cups and the 2005 UEFA Cup with CSKA.</p>
              <p>He is constantly compared to the great Lev Yashin and has won the goalkeeper of the year award named after the Soviet legend four times.</p>
              <p>Russia boss Guus Hiddink believes the country’s youngest international, first capped at 18 years and 20 days, is ready to play in a top league. But there is one concern: how would the self-confessed hothead cope with the Fergie ‘hairdryer’?</p>
              <p>Akinfeev once served a five-match ban for hitting an opponent in the face and admits: ‘Even when I was a kid, I couldn’t remain silent if the coach started shouting at me. I don’t like it done in public.’</p>
              <p>Plastic pitches have come a long way since the 1980s monstrosities at Luton and QPR, but the Luzhniki Stadium’s ‘FieldTurf’ still carries a threat. </p>

              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson says he isn’t worried, but the surface can take a toll on joints – and Wayne Rooney and Rio Ferdinand were in the England team that lost 2-1 to Russia in the Euro 2008 qualifier on it.</strong></p>
              <p>The surface was replaced by grass for United’s Champions League final win.</p>
