And he is always the first face Fergie sees at Carrington.<br><br>The United boss added: Â“Wayne is exceptional. He gets up and is the first in the training ground every morning.<br><br>Â“We like the players to come in for breakfast and he is in at 8.45am. HeÂ’s unbelievable.Â”<br><br>In normal circumstances, Fergie would rest Rooney tonight. But the England striker, 21, has played only twice since returning from a metatarsal injury.<br><br>Wing wizard Cristiano Ronaldo, 22, is also difficult to keep out of any game Â— even friendlies.<br><br>Ferguson said: Â“They are both young and want to play all the time.<br><br>Â“They would be quite happy to play all day, every day.<br><br>Â“It is very difficult to stop that enthusiasm.Â”<br><br>Most players look forward to a summer break Â— but not Rooney.<br><br>He said: Â“I was really looking forward to playing again because this is the longest summer IÂ’ve ever had off. It was six weeks.<br><br>Â“After the first couple of weeks, I got bored and wanted to play again.Â”<br><br>Roo knows there is hot competition for places this season. Carlos Tevez has arrived from West Ham and Louis Saha is fit again.<br><br>But the former Everton ace refuses to make way for anyone. He said: Â“This is a big squad and there are a lot of world-class players here.<br><br>Â“But I want to play every week Â— the manager knows that.<br><br>Â“Hopefully, I can do that. If I donÂ’t, I obviously wonÂ’t be too happy. But itÂ’s the managerÂ’s decision. If Louis plays, itÂ’s for me to drop in. And if Tevez plays, itÂ’s for me to stay up. So I donÂ’t mind who I play with.Â”<br><br>Rooney could finally open his account for the season after suffering his injury on the opening day.<br><br>United have struggled for goals with him sidelined and Ronaldo suspended for three games.<br><br>Rooney added: Â“We want to play attacking football and score loads of goals.<br><br>Â“We did that last season and we knew it would be more difficult this time.<br><br>Â“But we have still been getting the results, which is important.Â”</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>good...please do what the striker is supposed to do - that is to score.<br><br>his performance in terms of goal return has not been that prolific that we hope to see - maybe he is young and shld not be rushed but...it has better come loh...<br><br>I think Rooney shld be fielded to get him in tune esp for upcoming league &amp; European games.  Ronaldo I will rest.  Let others have the chance - ppl like Saha and other young players - we will need them this season becos Scholes &amp; Giggs are getting old.</div>
