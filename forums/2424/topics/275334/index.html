            <div class='col-md body'>A Premier League statement read: Â“The Premier League Board appointed panel having heard submissions of evidence from both parties has ruled to dismiss Gabriel HeinzeÂ’s case.<br><br>Â“The letter was unambiguous as it only envisages only an Â‘international transferÂ’. It did not create an obligation or binding agreement for the club to transfer the player to any particular club.<br><br>Â“The letter is evidence of an intention to negotiate both between the parties and with potential buying clubs and not evidence of any intention to create legal intentions.Â”<br><br>So what next for Heinze? Well, the player will be given the right to appeal against the decision but this could take more than the ten days remaining in the transfer window.<br><br>Another option would be to pursue a move to Lyon who have already stated their interest in the left-back. Alternatively Heinze could await the decision of the likes of Real Madrid and Barcelona who have been offered the player at a cut price.<br><br>The least likely of the options is for Heinze to stay at United and fight for his place. Ferguson has already conceded that fan contempt will not alter his selection policy, but whether fans will ever forgive the player for anchoring after a move to rivals Liverpool is unlikely.</div>

In other words the Letter is evidence of an intention to negotiate, both between the parties and with potential buying clubs, and not evidence of any intention to create legal relations.<br><br>Any appeal will be heard by the Premier League Appeals Committee, which is made up of an independent legally qualified Chair, a member of the Premier League Panel and a PFA appointee.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>He was actually no longer in Fergie's plans... He has lost his place to Evra since last season... Fergie wanted to get rid of him since the break of the season that is why the letter was given to his agent but only thing no takers, only Pool's ah ben who is trying desperately hard to get him to the extend of even offering him Pool's lawyers... Now he can rot in the reserve...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>
