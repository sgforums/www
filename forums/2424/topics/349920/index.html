              <h1>Ferguson: Manchester United Must Keep Focus</h1>
              <h2>Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson has been keen to taper
              expectations after his side's Carling Cup conquest kept them on course
              to win the quintuple.</h2>
              <p>Manchester United already lifted the Club World Cup trophy earlier this
              campaign and are looking in good position to do the same with that of
              the Champions League, FA Cup and the Premier League especially.<br><br>Ferguson
              knows how burdensome big expectations can be, so his most recent
              comments following their success over Tottenham on the weekend were
              reasoned rather than rambunctious.  <br><br>"I'm not getting carried away with it, only the media will. We will keep our feet on the ground," he was quoted as saying by <em>BBC</em>.<br><br>"We could go to Fulham in the FA Cup, the ball comes off someone's backside and we are out of that one," he warned.<br><br>United
              are seven points clear in the Premier League, face Fulham in the
              quarter-final of the FA Cup, and their Champions League tie with Inter
              of Italy is deadlocked at 0-0 after the first leg in Milan last week.</p>

              <p>was watching football focus, and most of the guys expect MU to win only 4 (given they have already won 2), while Stevie only expect MU to win 2.</p>
              <p>their claim is FA Cup and UCL are all the one-offs game which may swing the other way, esp with the Inter 0-0.. which is logical. and fulham in the FA Cup which looks easy but Fulham got some mean defence too.</p>
              <p>so how many do you expect MU to win (starting from two)??</p>

              <p>I feel its too difficult a thing to achieve especially with the FA Cup always just before the CL match... If it continues this way, United will have a very difficult semi finals match just before the CL... It could be Arsenal or Chelsea or Everton... so resting players for CL will effect the FA cup. Therefore its almost impossible... Have to give up one.</p>

              <p><br>Players wanting to play isn't new... I think most would be, even at other clubs... Playing in successive games is good if its once a week... But if its once every 3 days for a duration of 2, 3 months plus you add in all the travelling to away matches... It could eventually take its toll... Players become jaded, hamstring injury could easily happen...</p>
              <p>Of course it would be great to win the CL and FA cup too but the League is the most important to me...  </p>

              Let's count chickens before the egg hatch.
              
              League? 8 win out of 11 games will confirm the title at this stage. I think 7 would be good enough though, the other teams sure screw up one.
              
              FA cup, 3 more and win! The next one is tiring, the 2nd one can concentrate as league is in the bag. The finals is after the league ends,so can concentrate.
              
              Champions League, home ground advantage for next game! and with the league in the bag, just concentrate on this!

              <p>inter is tricky.. more so than the rest of league games/FA cup.. no offense to the other teams..</p>
              <p>For the league, MU has to lose 3 and other teams needs to win all their games.. quite hard to happen given that it is only 11 games leh.</p>
