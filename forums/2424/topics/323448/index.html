              <p> </p>
              <p>Real Madrid president Ramon Calderon believes Manchester United should be 'happy and proud' to let Cristiano Ronaldo leave the club in what he believes would be 'the transfer of the century'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Calderon was set to meet United chief executive David Gill today, with the Premier League side expected to issue an official 'hands off' warning to Real.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yesterday the Real president seemingly conceded defeat in his attempts to capture the Portugal winger after admitting it would be difficult to convince United to sell.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But 24 hours later he told Spanish newspaper AS that it was Ronaldo's wish to join his club and the English champions should allow him.</p>
              <p>Calderon said: 'I think that, first of all, it's the desire of the player (to join us), but, of course, Manchester shouldn't be angry and they should open up their stance.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'We can't be blamed if nearly every player wants to come to Real Madrid. If I was Manchester United I'd be happy and proud to be able to negotiate such a transfer for one of my players.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'Everything would be a lot easier if United realised that they could pull off the transfer of the century.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Calderon appeared confident a deal could still be reached, as he believes that if a player wants to leave then there is little a club can do to stop him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But he again insisted the Spanish champions would not act on their interest until United agreed to talks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Calderon continued: 'It depends on the player, on Ronaldo. Since I've known football it has been the case that the desires of the footballer are what decide matters.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'If Ronaldo wants to leave Manchester, he'll leave. If he wants to stay, he'll stay.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'I don't think you can keep anyone in a place where they don't want to be, not even in a family.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'But I insist that for a formal negotiation to start Manchester United will have to open their doors to us. Manchester have to want to talk.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On Ronaldo's ankle injury Calderon added: 'At the moment that is something which should only concern the player and United.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Real chief admitted there was no plan B should the club fail prise Ronaldo away, insisting there would be no 'comings and goings' this summer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That includes reported Chelsea target Robinho, who Calderon claims the club are not willing to sell.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'We have no intention of making any little touches to the squad, no comings and goings,' he said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'The squad is young and it's fine as it is. There is no negotiation going on at the moment for Robinho to leave the club.'</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>Schuster and Calderon should just shut the fucking hell up.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://manu.theoffside.com/files/2008/06/glaz.jpg"></a></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.t-arty.com/images/designslarge/stfu.jpg" alt="" width="182" height="223">  <img src="http://kr.goal.com/images/21097_hp.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="230"> </p>
              <p><strong>That is the blunt message from the Manchester United fratenity from sgForums. They are sick and tired of the Ronaldo saga and the numerous attempts by the Los Merengues. They think that Real can take advantage of the Glazers’ £600million debt in owning United by offering a record-busting £70m for Ronaldo. But a senior source close to the sgForums Man Utd family told SunSport: “There is no way Ronaldo is for sale at all, even if he puts in a transfer request.”</strong></p>
              <p>sgForums' Man Utd famiy insist they will back United boss Alex Ferguson all the way in his bid to keep Portuguese winger Ronaldo, 23. The source said: “Anyone thinking the debt comes into this is totally ignorant of the facts. “The debt is covered comfortably by the interest payments.</p>
              <p>“In the three years the family have owned the club, they have shown a clear track record of investment which will continue. “The Glazers have never meddled in anything the manager has done and never will interfere.</p>
              <p>“All decisions on buying and selling are down to him and if he wants new players the money is there. “There is no truth in any insinuation we would be willing to talk to Real Madrid about selling Cristiano. That is nonsense.”</p>
              <p>United are adamant Ronaldo must return to pre-season training at Carrington three weeks after Portugal’s Euro 2008 campaign ends. The Glazer source added: “The next move is for the manager to talk to Cristiano when he returns for training.”</p>
              <p> All of the forumites agree that Ronaldo should not bite the hand that feeds him. Manchester Utd made him the star he is today and he should at least be loyal to the club. However, some have mixed feelings adding that with the money, Man Utd can buy alot of good players. Huntelaar, Benzema, Alves, Podolski were mentioned.</p>

              <p>funny real madrid said that at most RC7 is worth like 5-10 million more than zidane.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Zidane. He cost €75m FOR PLAY from 29-34YEARS OLD FOR 5 years, ASUMMING CR7 is 23 years old and retires at 34YEARS OLD TOO, that leaves him with 11 YEARS MORE TO PLAY.<br><br>THAT JUST MAKES HIS "cost €5m or €10m more" becoming laughable.<br><br>WHAT HE COST SHOULD BE  €75m/5 times 11 WHICH IS €165m</p>
              <p>And this doest not include the factor that CR7 will still get better due to his young age, Say a 29 year old CR7 will be even better than zidane......</p>
              <p>players peak at 27-29, so i guess maybe €165m x 20% more would be a fair like to like PRICE. WHICH IS €198m</p>

              <p>No need to worry lah... Lets the guy continue to make a fool of himself for us to see... Ronaldo is not going. United has said so, Fergie has said so too...</p>
              <p>So we should just sit back and watch how desperate he gets when the transfer window come to a close...</p>
              <p>This guy will try anything he can... Use Ronaldo's mother, Godfather... apparently they didn't pay Ronaldo's sister enough when she said her Brother want to stay... lol</p>
              <p>Whatever happens, even if he is sold... It must be for $65m and above... We must be honest lah, No player is worth $100 million... Ronaldo really worth $100 million meh?</p>

              <p>maybe not so much, but since you are selling something off in such unwilling circumstances, then obviously you sell for a profit, what for you sell something you use until very happy at market price? Only a profit would seem logical to sell RC7,</p>
              <p>If a 29year old zidane can fetch $65m, then i am sure that the level of pricing can be applied to the same buyer- REAL MADRID,</p>

              <p><br>Even at $65m its already a record price liao... Anyway, Ronny is a winger and most wingers are finish at top lever by the time they reach 30... Kewell, Duff... United were one time looking at them to replace Giggs when he reach 29, 30... But who knows he can adjust his game to play a different style without his speed... Ronny's type depend on alot of speed so even more likely to lose his legs by 29, 30...</p>

              <p>funny real madrid said that at most RC7 is worth like 5-10 million more than zidane.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Zidane. He cost €75m FOR PLAY from 29-34YEARS OLD FOR 5 years, ASUMMING CR7 is 23 years old and retires at 34YEARS OLD TOO, that leaves him with 11 YEARS MORE TO PLAY.<br><br>THAT JUST MAKES HIS "cost €5m or €10m more" becoming laughable.<br><br>WHAT HE COST SHOULD BE  €75m/5 times 11 WHICH IS €165m</p>
              <p>And this doest not include the factor that CR7 will still get better due to his young age, Say a 29 year old CR7 will be even better than zidane......</p>
              <p>players peak at 27-29, so i guess maybe €165m x 20% more would be a fair like to like PRICE. WHICH IS €198m</p>
