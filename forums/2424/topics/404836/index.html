              <p><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Sir Alex Ferguson" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/sir-alex-ferguson"><span style="color: #005689;">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></a> believes football is finally beginning to take hold in the United States. The <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester United" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united"><span style="color: #005689;">Manchester United</span></a> manager expects a competitive edge to their matches on the tour – the squad leave on Monday for their training base in Chicago.</p>
              <p>The national side held England to a draw in the World Cup and Ferguson is convinced the standard of <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Major League Soccer" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/majorleaguesoccer"><span style="color: #005689;">Major League Soccer</span></a> is better than ever. "American soccer is starting to make an impact and it is so improved, " he said.</p>
              <p>"I made that point about the United States team before the World Cup. I said they were going to play like real athletes – the guys are fit, committed, they believe in themselves.</p>
              <p>"I think American football is that way – they're all fit, athletic, they've got a good feel for the pitch. You can see that there is improvement in MLS. I have spoken to many people in the last few months about that and there is a big upsurge."</p>
              <p>The veteran trio Gary Neville, Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes will lead the party on the four-match tour beginning against Celtic in Toronto next Friday.</p>
              <p>Edwin van der Sar, Darren Fletcher and Dimitar Berbatov will also travel along with some promising youngsters, including the former Fulham defender Chris Smalling.</p>
              <p>Ferguson added on the MLS website: "Winning is part of what we have to do here, but the main object is to get everyone game time, come back ready, fit to start the season."</p>
              <p>United meet Philadelphia Union at Lincoln Financial Field on 21 July, followed by a match against the Kansas City Wizards at Arrowhead Stadium four days later. They finish the tour against the MLS All-Stars in Houston on 28 July.</p>

              <p><strong>While United have abstained from the summer transfer melee - and may continue to do so - the pair of new arrivals secured earlier this year are causing a clamour in the Reds' camp.</strong></p>
              <p>England youth international Chris Smalling has caught the eye since reporting for pre-season training last week, having agreed a deal to join from Fulham back in January.</p>
              <p>"Chris has been training for a few days and he's a big, strong, tall lad," says Darren Fletcher. "I didn't realise how young he was until he told me, and I think he's got great potential for the future. He's going to be some athlete and when he learns what Manchester United is about he'll become a top player."</p>
              <p>While Javier 'Chicharito' Hernandez will not meet his new colleagues until later this month, his exploits in Mexico's run to the second round of the World Cup have prompted excitement among the squad.</p>
              <p>"He looks really sharp," says Fletch. "He's young, sharp and looks really hungry. He scored a couple of great goals at the World Cup and I think he'll be a good addition."</p>
              <p>"Javier did very well at the World Cup, he played really well when he came on," adds Wes Brown. "Hopefully now he and Chris can fit in nicely and be ready for the new season."</p>

              <p><strong>Summer signing Chris Smalling is itching to be involved in United’s first pre-season clash, against Celtic in Toronto.<br><br></strong>The Reds take on the Scottish giants on Friday night (00:00 BST) and the former Fulham defender admits he’d love to be named in Sir Alex’s starting XI.<br><br>“I can’t wait to pull on the shirt for first time,” he told <strong>ManUtd.com</strong>. “I’m working hard in training and hopefully I’ll get some game time. I’m just really looking forward to getting out there and doing my best for the club.”<br><br>The 20-year-old say’s he’s settling in well and has already made a couple of friends since returning from his summer break.<br><br>“The tour’s been a really enjoyable experience so far. It was great to meet everyone, initially at Carrington and then on tour. It’s been good to get away and spend time getting to know the lads.<br><br>“I’ve spent quite a bit of time with Wes [Brown] and Jonny [Evans], my fellow centre-backs. And I’ve also been chatting to a lot of the younger lads. It’s just great to get to know everybody and be part of such a great club.<br><br>“I can’t quite believe how things have changed for me in the last few years. Going out to Australia with Fulham last summer on tour was a big experience, but to be out here now with the most famous club in the world is fantastic and I’m just looking forward to the games now.”</p>
