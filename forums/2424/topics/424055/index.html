              <p>Manchester United midfielder Michael Carrick has urged officials to get the big decisions right in important matches.</p>
              <p>As the Red Devils now prepare for Sunday's visit to bitter rivals Liverpool, a fresh examination of their Premier League credentials is emerging.</p>
              <p>And with Arsenal breathing down their necks, Sir Alex Ferguson's team can ill afford any more slip-ups.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson criticised referee Martin Atkinson after the final whistle at Chelsea and Carrick agrees that the key decisions went against United.</p>
              <p>The 29-year-old was also frustrated by the way his side lost their way somewhat in the second half after taking the lead through Wayne Rooney's fine strike in the opening period.</p>
              <p>David Luiz equalised for the Blues in the 54th minute before Frank Lampard blasted home a late penalty to seal United's demise.</p>
              <p>"It is disappointing, especially after the first half and the way we played," Carrick reflected on the result.</p>
              <p>"We were in control. Second half we weren't as quick and decisive in our passing as we were in the first half, but we still felt quite comfortable and I still thought we might score again.</p>
              <p>"Some decisions didn't go our way and we're on the end of a defeat, which is very hard to take.</p>
              <p>"That type of decision plays a huge part in the game. Big decisions you've got to get right, especially in a game of this importance, so we're disappointed.</p>
              <p>"You have to get big decisions right in games of that importance."</p>
              <p>The criticism of Atkinson over his failure to send David Luiz off for tripping Wayne Rooney immediately before awarding Chelsea their match-winning penalty for a debatable Chris Smalling foul on Yuri Zhirkov drew a stinging rebuke from Ferguson.</p>
              <p>Although the United boss might have kept his counsel and reflected on the changing fortunes of a game that should have left him playing with just 10 men at Wigan three days earlier, Ferguson opted to let fly with both barrels.</p>
              <p>"You want a fair referee, or a strong referee anyway - and we didn't get that," he said.</p>
              <p>"I must say, when I saw who the referee was I feared it. I feared the worst."</p>
              <p>Given the United boss already has the remaining two matches of a four-game touchline ban hanging over him following scathing comments about Alan Wiley's fitness last season, a further spell in the stands appears inevitable if misconduct is proved.</p>
              <p>The FA have until 6pm tomorrow to charge Ferguson, although that may just fuel a sense of injustice at Old Trafford ahead of what is now a vital trip to Liverpool on Sunday when far more than local pride will be at stake.</p>
              <p>Carrick is confident Manchester United will bounce back from the disappointment of losing to Chelsea when they travel to Anfield.</p>
              <p>"At the moment we feel pretty down, but we can move on quickly. We have to," the midfielder told <em>MUTV</em>.</p>
              <p>"We're used to doing that and we're normally good at that, so hopefully we can bounce back again.</p>
              <p>"We have to get rid of this game, forget about it and move on. It's obviously a huge game on Sunday and we'll be ready for that. We have to be.</p>
              <p>"That's the nature of the beast. We move on and we take a lot of positives from tonight and look to put things right that didn't go well. We'll be ready."</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, United defender John O'Shea has claimed Ryan Giggs could still be playing at 40.</p>
              <p>Giggs has now completed 20 years as a first-team player and even though many of Giggs' team-mates have been around Old Trafford for some considerable time themselves, they are lost in admiration for the 37-year-old.</p>
              <p>And, having signed a one-year contract extension earlier this year, O'Shea feels Giggs could carry on for at least another three years.</p>
              <p>"Without a doubt," said the Republic of Ireland star.</p>
              <p>"His physical shape hasn't changed since I've known him and he looks after himself so well.</p>
              <p>"Depending on injuries he could easily carry on, although I am sure he just wants to take it one season at a time.</p>
              <p>"He is just enjoying it so much at the minute so I can't see why he can't but I'll let him decide on that."</p>
              <p>If nothing else, last night's game allowed Giggs to equal Sir Bobby Charlton's record of 606 league appearances, another record in addition to the scores the Welshman already has.</p>
              <p>Indeed, in the modern era, the only player O'Shea can think of that is remotely comparable is recently-retired Italian legend Paolo Maldini.</p>
              <p>"You see how the manager has built squads and Giggsy has been a vital part of every single one of them," he said.</p>
              <p>"It's just incredible. Maldini springs to mind with AC Milan but I think Giggsy has even gone past him.</p>
              <p>"The speed and the balance he still shows to go past whether it be an old, experienced defender or a new, up-and-coming young strong defender is incredible.</p>
              <p>"Every cliche in the book has been used about the man already and I am sure they will be said many times again.</p>
              <p>"He is an absolute legend."</p>
