            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Ferguson: Anderson is "something special"<br><br>Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson believes that Anderson is the best young footballer in the world.</strong><br><br>Ferguson has described the 19-year-old midfielder as a 'special' talent and compared him favourably with Cesc Fabregas.<br><br>"Anderson has been absolutely superb. The boy has definitely got something special.<br><br>"There was an urgency to get him once we'd scouted him, even though he'd broken his leg and had been out for four or five months," he said.<br>11038<br><br>"The reports we were getting were saying that he was the best young player in the world. At the time, I was saying, 'For God's sake, let's calm down a bit here.'<br><br>lightning quick<br><br>"I knew he had real potential, but I didn't want to put labels on him like that. But we've been delighted with him and he has proven himself to be a true central midfield player.<br><br>"He can tackle, he's lightning quick, he's brave and he can pass the ball. What he's got to prove is his goalscoring ability because that's something that Scholesy has always given us."<br><br>Anderson, a summer signing from Porto, excelled in the recent 2-2 draw against Arsenal, with Ferguson claiming that he outplayed Fabregas during their midfield clash.<br><br>"Fabregas is going through a golden period at Arsenal, but I thought Anderson dominated that position."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah, he is good. All he needs is to get rid of some of his little ways, like to "act act" in the Arsenal match. That really doesnt go very well with a great sportsman.</div>

You seem to be comparing a very establish Paul Scholes and a very new and young Anderson here. I think you are mentioning the Scholes during his 24 to 30 yrs old time period. But the Scholes at 19 wasn't like that at all... Even present day Scholes no longer has the legs to do it, he has changed his game to be more defensive... No longer will you see him going into the box as often as he used to these days...<br><br>Paul Scholes is 33 today and he was a part of the famous FA Youth Cup winners of 1992. He made his League debut against Ipswich Town on September 24, 1994. Scholes became a regular player during the 1994/95 season which made him 20 yrs old.<br><br>Anderson is still very young and he is also very new not just to the club, to the league, to the culture, to the language,  to the people and to the land... Everything in a way. Give him time and he will improve on his game even more. As of now, he has already replace Carrick in the packing order and that is no mere task.<br><br>And as you have said, to you he is an AM... Indeed he is, he passing to the frontman are great, but the wonderful thing about him is his defending and ball winning skills is just as good for an AM. The reason being i guess is as you have said... He is faster than Carrick. Not as injury prone as Hargreaves... And i guess physically stronger than the 2 of them... The best thing about him as you have said, he is still young and raw. But once he has gain enough experience, imagine what he can do in 2 yrs time... Fabregas wouldn't be what he is today if Wenger didn't give him these last 2 yrs in the first team. Same will go with Anderson.<br><br>When Ronny first came, he was alot of show but no substance... These last 4 yrs has done him real good especially in the last season. Before last season, he had a lot of running, beating players but no end results... But now he is more of a complete player than he was at 19 don't you agree?<br><br>Yes, I also hope that he is not just a flash in the pan. But i belief he won't be.<br><br>Nothing personal, just for conversation sake...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
