              <p>Manchester United chief executive David Gill insists there is money available should Sir Alex Ferguson want to dip into the transfer market.</p>
              <p>The Red Devils have not splashed out so far this summer with certain sections of the supporters becoming frustrated that the owners of the club are not freeing the necessary funds for a big-name signing.</p>
              <p>This comes after the Old Trafford outfit opted to sell star man Cristiano Ronaldo for a big fee last summer, but have not used the money to go back into the market.</p>
              <p>United have spent £20million on new players already though, with former Fulham defender Chris Smalling and Mexico striker Javier Hernandez agreeing moves earlier in the year.</p>
              <p>The likes of Germany playmaker Mesut Ozil, Holland midfielder Wesley Sneijder and Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema have all been linked with a switch to Manchester, and Gill has reiterated that manager Ferguson has money to spend.</p>
              <p>"The money is there if we believe there is a player who can improve what we believe is a very good squad," he told the <em>Manchester Evening News</em>.</p>
              <p>"The team has been together for a number of years and done very well. In order to improve it a player has to be of a very high quality."</p>
              <p>Gill would not be drawn on who the club are targeting as possible signings, but revealed United have been on the look-out for new faces.</p>
              <p>"We are always looking at players," he added. "We are looking 365 days a year - it doesn't just start when the transfer window opens.</p>
              <p>"We are looking at it. We studied a lot of players at the World Cup, but we knew about a lot of them before that.</p>
              <p>"Over all I think Sir Alex is very comfortable with the squad composition. That's not to say something won't happen, but I think it is a 'might', not a 'will'.</p>
              <p>"We will see what happens over the next six weeks."</p>

              <p><strong>How pleased are you with how the tour of North America has gone?<br></strong>It’s gone very well and it’s been a trip everyone, including the players, have really enjoyed. Preparations for the new season have gone well on the training pitch and the facilities have been fantastic as they always are in America. So overall we’re very pleased.<br><br><strong>What did you make of the support for the team during the trip?</strong><br>It was great. The fans are very knowledgeable in America and enjoy their football. The fact we played against MLS teams on this trip rather than just British or European teams in the past made for some great atmospheres at the games because you had pockets of MLS fans supporting their team as well as coming to watch ours. So that was another interesting aspect of the tour and it also provided the players with a good test because the MLS sides are halfway through their season so their match fitness was spot on.<br><br><strong>The reception for Chicharito in Mexico was something else</strong>…<br>It was fantastic. Firstly it was great to see him get a goal on his debut. It was the icing on the cake of a superb match in Houston. To have a crowd of that magnitude in such a fantastic stadium witness a game of real attacking football was very enjoyable for everyone. Javier was given a great reception in Houston, but it was an amazing to see the welcome for him in Mexico.<br><br><strong>Despite the adulation, he seems like a very level-headed guy who will fit in well…</strong>Yes, he’s settled in very well already. We always do our homework on a player’s personality and temperament, as well as their ability when we’re looking at possible new signings and Javier fits the bill all round. We saw his talent and eye for goal at the World Cup and under the guidance of Alex and the coaching staff and playing alongside some great players at our club, he’s got every opportunity to do really well.<br><br><strong>How pleased were you to get the deal with Nemanja Vidic agreed?</strong><br>We were delighted to agree the deal with Nemanja. You always want to retain your best players and make sure they’re under contract for as long as possible, as well as look at potential new signings.<br><br><strong>Have you been surprised at the lack of the activity in the transfer market this summer?</strong><br>Well, there’s been one exception obviously! With the World Cup being on not a lot went on in June, but I think there will be more movement in August as clubs look at their squads, and I think there will be some trimming because of the squad limits being introduced in the Premier League. We have to name at least eight ‘home-grown’ players in a squad of 25 by 1 September. It’s something we need to consider from now on when we’re looking at new players to see how they will affect the squad balance.<br><br><strong>Midway through the tour it was reported you flew back to Manchester to sign a player…</strong><br>I have no idea where that came from! I can confirm I didn’t fly back though. As I’ve said before we’re always looking at things and I’m not saying we won’t do any business before the transfer window closes, but at the moment there’s nothing imminent.<br><br><strong>Presumably it’s something you’re talking to the boss about all the time…</strong> <br>Yes, Alex and I are always having discussions. We talk to the scouts and Alex talks to Mick and Rene, so things are continually being assessed. As I said, we’re always looking at things as well as monitoring the young players coming through. We want to go into the season with a squad which is a mix of youth and experience and I think we have that. The World Cup players are back in training and we have added Chris Smalling and Javier to the squad. We’re all looking forward to the start of the season and challenging for trophies once more. Hopefully it’ll be another successful campaign for us.</p>
