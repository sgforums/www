              <p>It will be an extremely good deal, hard for Fergie to reject and for the players to reject too since they are all bit part players.</p>
              <p>United could really make do with the extra cash and slashing down of wages. I remember O'Shea is on a 80k per week contract, no?</p>
              <p>However, having said that, United will definitely have to scout for defensive cover and Phil Jones is a good choice alongside James Tomkins from West Ham.</p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> How confusing can that be? It doesn't change the fact that he was reportedly earning 80k per week through the thread started by you leh.</p>
              <p>80k per week for a fringe player is not ok at all. Not too sure how Michael Owen will feel for his reportedly 20-30k per week + pay as you play wage?</p>
              <p>Wayne Bridge is on Man City books (the money club), Glen Johnson is a first team regular at Liverpool, Joe Cole was supposed to be a first team player until his injuries strikes again. So such comparisons are pointless. I don't see any fringe player earning 80k per week unless you're talking about money-printing clubs like Chelsea, Man City, Real Madrid, Barcelona?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I've mentioned in the previous thread that yes, you should be rewarded on loyalty but not sorely based on loyalty. He went all the way downhill after winning the young player of the year in his first year at the first team! I hope you can recall his budge on Torres in the BPL match that could have so easily resulted in a red card had a United player not be somewhere close by for him not to be considered as a last man?</p>
              <p>All 3 must go. We need new players who are hungrier for success. Look at Chicharito. Remember at the beginning of the season when United faced with defensive crisis? Who are the players that screw things up at the back? 1. Evans. 2. O'Shea. 3. Brown.</p>
