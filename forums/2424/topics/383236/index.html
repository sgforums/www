            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong>Ji-sung Park was delighted to make his return to United's first-team after a two-month spell on the sidelines with a knee injury.<br><br></strong>The South Korean winger started in the 1-0 defeat to Besiktas on Wednesday and gave a solid showing. It was his first appearance for the Reds since the 4-3 win over Manchester City back in September.<br><br>"Itâ€™s good to be back," he said. "My knee is 100% OK now and I feel fully fit."<br><br>Ji has been on a specific training programme recently and Sir Alex admitted he was pleased that he could now select the livewire midfielder. And Park is keen to get back involved as several players have staked claims for United's wide positions.<br><br>Antonio Valencia has pushed himself to the front of the queue with some fine displays this term, while Gabriel Obertan has shown a great deal of promise. "Obertan and Valencia are good players," Park said. "But I think I can also put in good performances.<br><br>"We lost against Besiktas, which was a shame. But, for me, I was ready to play after playing twice for the national team."<br><br>Park was impressed with the performances of some of United's young players, despite the Reds being unable to find an elusive goal against Turkish champions Besiktas.<br><br>"We had many good chances but failed to score," he added. "But the young players showed great potential. They will be much stronger now because of this experience, and hopefully next time out against Wolfsburg we will be able to confirm ourselves as winners of the group."</p></div>
