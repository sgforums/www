              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson keeping close tabs on injured transfer target Steven Defour.</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson has stepped up his interest in Steven Defour, by sending the injured Standard Liege captain a letter reassuring him that he continues to monitor his progress.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Defour, who is under contract until 2013, was heavily linked with a move to a bigger club in the summer with Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City reportedly interested, while Everton had a £9million bid for the Belgium midfielder turned down.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Any hope of a January transfer evaporated when the Belgium midfielder broke a bone in his foot last month, but Ferguson is closely following his recovery.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The letter, which has been released to the media, reads: "Dear Steven, I have just heard about your injury and, in the name of Manchester United, I would like to wish you a full and speedy recovery."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It continues: "I am sure at the moment you must be feeling awful and that you'll have all kinds of questions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Steven, these are natural worries but I have to tell you that modern medicine and treatments are incredible, you have to have confidence in them."I'm going to follow your progress closely and I will remain in contact with your club to have news of your recovery."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Defour was delighted to receive Ferguson's letter, but the 21-year-old was swift to point out that the Premier League club had done everything by the book and had sent it to his club to pass onto him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"One thing I should like to highlight is that Ferguson has followed his interest officially," Defour told Het Laatste Nieuws. "He addressed the letter to Standard.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I think the attention is great, but I do not want people think I am already at Manchester, which is by no means the case. But if they come knocking, then I would obviously not cause problems."</p>
