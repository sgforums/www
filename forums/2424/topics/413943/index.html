              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">GARY NEVILLE has hailed new strike sensation Javier Hernandez as one of the 
              best young prospects he has ever seen at Manchester United.</h2>
              <p>The Mexican hitman, nicknamed 'The Little Pea,' struck twice at Stoke on 
              Sunday to put Alex Ferguson's men back in the title battle.</p>
              <p>And his performance had long-serving Neville, now with 600 United games under 
              his belt, tipping the 22-year-old to become a huge success at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>The former England defender has been a pro at United for nearly 18 years and 
              has seen some top young talent in his time.</p>
              <p>Neville has played alongside the likes of Ryan Giggs, David Beckham, Paul 
              Scholes and even Wayne Rooney in their early days.</p>
              <p>But he insisted: "Javier is one of the most exciting young prospects we've 
              seen at the club for some time.</p>
              <p>"You obviously have talent when you come to this club but his work-rate and 
              his attitude are phenomenal.</p>
              <p>"He's tough, he has grown up in Mexico. But what sets him apart for me is his 
              work-rate every single day.</p>
              <p>"He has the right attributes to go with his talent.</p>
              <p>"He works so hard and has done so well since he came to us. You get rewards 
              for that. He will score lots and lots of goals for this club."</p>
              <p>Team-mate Ryan Giggs also feels the £7million summer signing from Chivas could 
              become an Old Trafford legend.</p>
              <p>The Welsh veteran has been around United for two decades but has been blown 
              away by Chicharito's finishing.</p>
              <p>He said: "There are some players who are just born goalscorers. I've seen them 
              over the years.</p>
              <p>"When they face a goalkeeper in a one-on-one, they're ice cool. And I've seen 
              that in Javier already.</p>
              <p>"With the way he approaches his football and the way he plays, he's going to 
              score a lot of goals for us.</p>
              <p>"I've seen over the years many goalscorers become legends for Manchester 
              United. Hopefully, that can become the case with Javier."</p>
              <p>Hernandez took his overall tally for the season to five with his double at 
              Stoke and his boss is expecting great things.</p>
              <p>Alex Ferguson has been struck by the way the South American has conducted 
              himself off the pitch as well as on it to make sure he gives himself the 
              best chance possible.</p>

              <p>Ferguson said: "He has a good attitude, a wonderful demeanour about life, 
              wonderful manners.</p>
              <p>"He speaks the language well, trains really well and he's working on his upper 
              body every morning. He's coming on great."</p>
              <p>United fans are still getting to know their summer signing but already some 
              are comparing him to fans' favourite Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.</p>
              <p>The Norwegian, now United's reserve team boss, scored 128 goals in his 11-year 
              Red Devils playing career.</p>
              <p>And the old master himself has given Hernandez the thumbs-up. Solskjaer said: 
              "He's a great mover off the ball. He's clever with his runs and his 
              finishing is very good.</p>
              <p>"Since the World Cup, he has probably not had a proper rest. His mind has been 
              on making a good first impression. That's important and he has managed that."</p>
