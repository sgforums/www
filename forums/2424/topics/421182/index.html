              <p><strong>RUUD van Nistelrooy has patched things up with Sir Alex Ferguson.</strong></p>
              <p>The former Manchester United striker phoned his former manager to end their five-year feud.</p>
              <p>Van Nistelrooy left Old Trafford in 2006 after falling out spectacularly with Fergie over tactics and team selection issues at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>The former Dutch international - now with Hamburg in Germany - is not the only player to leave United in unhappy circumstances.</p>
              <p>Others such as David Beckham, Jaap Stam and Dwight Yorke were ushered out of the door after relations with Fergie broke down.</p>
              <p>But van Nistelrooy is perhaps the first player to try to make peace with a manager for whom he scored more than 100 goals.</p>
              <p>Van Nistelrooy said: 'I had been thinking about it for a while and talking it through with my wife.</p>
              <p>'She suggested I sent Fergie a text message to see if he was willing to talk, so I sent him a message asking if I could call and he replied to say, 'OK call me at this date and time'.</p>
              <p>'I rang him and he answered and said, 'OK, go ahead'.</p>
              <p>'I said I wanted to apologise for what had happened and he said, 'OK, I appreciate that, when we meet again it will be OK'.'</p>
              <p>Van Nistelrooy was a huge success at United, winning the Premier League, FA Cup and Carling Cup after joining from PSV Eindhoven in 2001.</p>
              <p><strong>Clash</strong></p>
              <p>But his relationship with Fergie deteriorated at the end as the manager became disenchanted with his star striker's attitude.</p>
              <p>Van Nistelrooy famously clashed with Cristiano Ronaldo in training and was then left on the substitutes' bench as United beat Wigan in the 2006 Carling Cup final.</p>
              <p>'Two or three times every year, I would think to myself what a shame it was that it ended like it did with Ferguson,' added van Nistelrooy.</p>
              <p>'I wanted to do something about it.</p>
              <p>'I was really pleased with the phone call.</p>
              <p>'I said to him: 'Those five years at United were fantastic working with you, and it's unfortunate what happened'.</p>
              <p>'If I encounter Fergie again - and I really hope that will happen - I will embrace him and then it will all be finished.'</p>

              <p>That's the result of his head getting too big la, he was United's only lethal weapon back then when Ronaldo was more interested in stepovers and showboating while Rooney was still a kid.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Anyway, he probably did that because he wants another chance at Old Trafford after seeing the consistency in United's performance over the decade and probably the last shot of getting a silverware. Who knows, he might take over Owen's place at the end of the season.</p>

              <p><br>No lah, don't say like that... He probably realised his mistake and just wanted to set things right with Fergie again cos he was afterall a great player for United and probably regretted that things ended the way it did with Fergie who he was once very close with... and now growing older, I guess it just hit him after looking back, he was probably too unreasonable...</p>
              <p>He probably miss Fergie and realised Fergie played an important part in his successful career... lol.</p>
