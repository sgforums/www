            <div class='col-md body'>This rumour could be true i think... cos Fergie knows he will need another top striker soon and Saha is always quite injury prone and his game depends alot on speed and now he is already 28 yrs old... So it would be a good time to bring in another striker so as to give him time to get use to the EPL first... and also Torres himself is keen to join united and Fergie seems to like Torres.<br><br>What is 26m for a top striker of Torres's class today? To be real, i think 26m is a ok price when you look at his skill and his age... Chelsea paid 30.8m for shev and he won't have any returns, Torres still has a sell-off price even after playing for 6 to 7 yrs...<br><br>Considering that man u suppose to have 20m for this season budget plus the Rvn money 10.5m plus the John guy to chelsea 12m... They have 42.5m transfer fund and they only spent at present 14m for Carrick and 2.5m on a keeper... So they still left with exactly 26m...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  and they will still have money for Owen Hargreaves as Torres's money will be considered as money brought forward from last years...<br><br>If he does join, that would be really cool man... with Rooney, Ronaldo &amp; Torres all between the age of 21 to 23 only... leading the attack!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Atletico Madrid skipper Fernando Torres has told Revista Manchester United DID try to sign him in the summer.<br><br>United, who sold their No. 1 striker Ruud van Nistelrooy to Real Madrid, were hot on the Spanish golden boy, but so were his current employers - and the feeling was mutual.<br><br>Torres could have left the Vicente Calderon and made millions in the process but instead he agreed a 12-month contract extension in a bid to ward off a host of Europe's top clubs - for now.<br><br>Both the player and his club accept he will leave eventually - certainly before his contract is up in 2009 - and Sir Alex Ferguson is said to be in pole position to claim his signature.<br><br>But Torres is in no rush to go and has made it clear he will only depart when it is convenient for all parties involved, which means Fergie and everybody else will have to wait.<br><br>"Well, there was interest (from United) and when there is interest it gets put to Atletico," the 22-year-old said. "They are the ones who have the last word and I don't know anymore about it.<br><br>"I know other players have gone to Italy and England. But I told the club they were the ones who had to decide if they wanted to keep me or not.<br><br>"After the World Cup many teams came in for me but this is a way to show the trust that exists between the club and myself. This should calm things down and hopefully this year nobody will talk about my future."<br><br>The darling of the Atletico faithful, Torres, who came up through the youth ranks, has been the club's leading scorer in each of the last four seasons and is without a doubt their prize asset.<br><br>He had been tracked by a host of sides over the summer, with AC and Inter Milan, Spurs and United all putting serious offers on the table, but still he and Atletico could not be parted.<br><br>In fact, with millions of pounds just a signature away, he was more than happy to commit himself to coach Javier Aguirre's plans and their relatively modest short-term ambition - European football.</div>
