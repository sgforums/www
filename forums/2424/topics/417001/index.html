              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson was tempted to send a joke text to Steve Bruce this week insisting that Danny Welbeck had to return to Old Trafford immediately from his loan at Sunderland.</strong></p>
              <p>It's not true, Welbeck is locked into staying for the whole season, but the fact that the player is so clearly at the forefront of Ferguson's mind shows he is one of the United starlets Ferguson plans to build his next team around.</p>
              <p>Despite Welbeck having a slow start in the north-east, four goals in his last three games justifies the decision to loan him out for experience.</p>
              <p>'Danny is doing brilliantly,' said Ferguson. 'He had problems by growing too fast. It meant he wasn't strong enough and missed a lot of football.</p>
              <p>'He's started to put on muscle now and looks a big lad. He played well against Chelsea and Everton and has shown what he can do in big games.'</p>

              <p>Backup-Backup i think.</p>
              <p>He'll only be called upon unless 2 of the strikers leave in the group of Rooney, Berbatov, Chicharito, Macheda, Owen.</p>
              <p>Don't forget there's still a Mame Biram Diouf on loan at Blackburn. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Diouf is on loan at Blackburn. I don't think they are keen to buy him since he only scored once in 11 appearance. And Rovers are linked to Santa Cruz in recent weeks so Diouf would probably be back at United next season. Unless he's mercilessly sold off like Manucho la. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Actually, Fletcher was a lucky chap. He started out on the right flank and he was crap because he has no speed and no trickery to go past defenders. Slowly he shifted to the middle because of departures of defensive midfield lynchpins Butt and Keane, the failures of purchases like Djemba-Djemba, Liam Miller, Kleberson, the immobility of Carrick (He's super slow and lacks the stamina to track back), the slow emergence of Anderson and the injuries sustained of Owen Hargreaves.</p>
              <p>All these factors jumbled together and his never-say-die attitude to switch his play style finally reap dividends.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I really don't see how Fergie can accomodate so many strikers next season. Someone has to leave and hopefully it's not Welbeck.</p>
              <p>He has impressed me again as I watch Sunderland vs West Ham last night. His off the ball movement and link-up with team mates have improved tremendously under Bruce's guidance and Premiership Experience.</p>

              <p>Well, I think there will always be some lesser clubs willing to take on a United reserved player under their wing... Anyway, if he is not good enough at Blackburn, surely there will be another down the division who would be happy to have him... I guess they might take Welbeck back next season and maybe send out Macheda or Bebe's turn to go out and gain some necessary experienced...</p>
              <p>Fletcher can't be that lucky cos during his time coming up from the reserved, he always had Keane saying he isn't good enough for United and all that stuff... Lesser players might have crack and left like those you mentioned... But he continue to stay in there and fight for it and today, he is more or less accepted to be an ok choice to start... </p>
              <p>Like I said, maybe Owen goes and Welbeck comes back to replace him... But if they buy another big name striker... Then I also not sure how they are going to fit all of them in... Maybe Berba go or Hernandez becomes 4th choice and Welbeck becomes back-up the the first 4... lol.</p>
