              <p><em>Matty James was one of five young Reds included in United's Champions League squad in Wolfsburg. ManUtd.com caught up with the 18-year-old Bacup-born midfielder at the team hotel to discover how he's found the experience so far...</em> <br><br><strong>So, how did you find out you were going to be on the trip?<br></strong>I found out on Sunday, but I certainly wasn’t expecting it. When you find out that kind of news you’re over the moon. It was a really great moment for me and the other lads to be told ‘you’re travelling to Wolfsburg with the first-team’.<br><br><strong>How did your family and friends react to the news?<br></strong>I sent my dad a text when I found out and I’m not sure he believed me! It was a bit out of the blue, I was going in for a normal training session and then found out the news. My family and friends have all been in touch, but I’ve just focused on the game to make sure I’m ready if needed.<br><br><strong>It’s not great for United to have all these injuries, but it’s a fantastic opportunity for you…<br></strong>That’s what happens in football. One person drops out and you have to fill the place. Injuries are part of football, though not usually to the extent United are experiencing at the moment! For us it’s a great opportunity to come to a Champions League away game, it’s a fantastic experience for me.<br><br><strong>When you were training last night in the Volkswagen Arena – did it sink in that you could be playing in front of 30,000 people in a Champions League game this evening?<br></strong>I was looking around thinking, ‘you never know what can happen’. I don’t know if I’ll be on the bench yet, but if I am – and this goes for all of the young lads – you have to think there’s no reason why you can’t get on and make a difference. If the opportunity</p>
              <p>is there you’ve just got to try and take it. Training last night was a bit surreal – everything happened so quickly and all of a sudden I’m training with the first-team squad ahead of an important Champions League match! It’s been great so far.<br><br><strong>Have you been involved much in the first-team set-up before?<br></strong>I was on the bench against Hull for the last game of last season when I was only 17. I was in the Carling Cup squad for the game against Barnsley. I’ve had a bit of a taste of it, but not to the level of a Champions League game. Any time you’re with the first-team it’s a really big buzz so I’m enjoying it.<br><br><strong>What are the key things you’ve learnt?<br></strong>The main thing is seeing how the senior players prepare for a big game. They’re so professional. It just makes you think that while you can enjoy yourself, you’re here to do a job and you have to be really professional in everything you do.<br><br><strong>Reckon you’ll get on tonight?<br></strong>Well, we don’t know just yet. But you just have to prepare like you’re going to play anyway so that if you are called on you are ready. And also we might be asked to play somewhere that’s not necessarily your natural position. But I'd do anything to play in any position at United, I’ll even go in nets if I’m asked!<br><br><strong>Even if you didn’t get the chance to play, how much will this whole experience help you?<br></strong>It’s a massive confidence-boost just being in the squad, being around the team, or even just watching pitchside and getting that view of the game. You learn so much. I’m only 18, and this is another stepping stone to trying to get in the squad and hopefully, at some point, on the pitch.</p>
