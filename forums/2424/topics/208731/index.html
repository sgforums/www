            <div class='col-md body'>Reds midfielder Michael Carrick says the chance to play in the Champions League was a major deciding factor in his move to Old Trafford this summer.<br><br>United shelled out an initial Â£14million for the former Tottenham midfielder. And although United's interest alone was appealing enough, his decision to leave White Hart Lane was made more enticing by the chance to play in EuropeÂ’s top competition.<br><br>"I've come here to win things but everyone expects us to do that," he told Inside United, the official magazine. Â“The squad believes we're capable of it. Whatever competition United are in, we're always going to be contenders. Champions League, Premiership, FA Cup, Carling Cup - we're always looking to win them. That's the big attraction.<br><br>"Playing in the Champions League was a massive factor in coming hereÂ” Carrick added. Â“To be able to take part in some of the huge games I've watched on the telly in the past is very exciting.<br><br>"It's another test, going up against the best in the world. It really is the highest level. Some say Champions League games are on a par, if not better, than the World Cup. I can't wait to be part of it.Â”<br><br>Carrick should make his home debut against his former club Spurs at Old Trafford on Saturday, and he is eagerly anticipating being a part of the team every week and challenging for<br><br>honours.<br><br>"This is one of the biggest clubs in the world and to play in that stadium every week is going to be a great experience,Â” he said. Â“The expectation and the belief within the squad are so high. I'm looking forward to being part of it, improving my game and becoming a better player. It's exciting times."<br><br><a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA%2D9A47%2D47BC%2DB069%2D3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=360525" rel="nofollow">http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA%2D9A47%2D47BC%2DB069%2D3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=360525</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>CHAMPIONS LEAGUE LURED CARRICK<br><br>Manchester United summer signing Michael Carrick claims the prospect of Champions League football was a "massive factor" in his decision to join the club.<br><br>The former Tottenham midfielder, who could cost ?18.6million, could only watch when United demolished Fulham 5-1 in the opening match of the season after picking up an ankle injury in the pre-season clash with Ajax.<br><br>"I've come here to win things but everyone expects us to do that," he said.<br><br>"The squad believes we're capable of it.

No-one could have changed my mind."<br><br><a href="http://www.sportinglife.com/football/news/story_get.cgi?" rel="nofollow">http://www.sportinglife.com/football/news/story_get.cgi?</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>spurs are suffering without carrick. i see carrick and makelele in the same page cos they are fantastic passer of the ball and they guard the defence very well. carrick dosent dive into tackles instead contain the opposition till ppl like ronaldo and rooney track back. his price will be justified this season. better splash out big bucks on a player of this calibre than spend on kleberson , djemba2 or miller</div>
