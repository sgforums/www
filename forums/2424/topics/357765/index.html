              MUTV commentator Stewart Gardner ponders the content of Sir Alexâ€™s half-time team-talk against Tottenhamâ€¦
              
              What exactly did Sir Alex say at half-time on Saturday? At some point in the future, in someoneâ€™s autobiography, all will be revealed.
              
              We do have some clues. Patrice Evra told me after the game â€“ with a knowing look on his face - that the boss had â€œmade a speechâ€� in the dressing room! Cristiano Ronaldo added that the boss had said if we scored early in the second half, United would go on to score four or five. Prophetic or what?
              
              When Spurs went 2-0 up in the first half, TV cameras immediately panned to Sir Alex, searching in his expression for a crack under the pressure. He seemed unnervingly calm, and had the look of a man whoâ€™d seen it all before and knew exactly what to do to sort it out.
              
              Whatever he said at the break worked a treat â€“ just as it did in 2001, also against Spurs. Back then, United were 3-0 down at half time at White Hart Lane and ended up surging to a 5-3 victory. But that was earlier in the season and didnâ€™t have a definitive bearing on the title race. On Saturday, the situation was much more pressurised.
              
              Perhaps the most important thing Sir Alex did at half time on Saturday was to bring on Carlos Tevez. He was like the Duracell bunny when he came on. Full of energy, determination and running, he chased down defenders and hustled and harried everyone. Thatâ€™s why the fans love him so much. He changed the game, simple as that.
              
              Of course, the penalty was the turning point. When Paddy Crerand â€“ surely TVâ€™s most biased pundit â€“ insists it wasnâ€™t a penalty then you really have to wonder about it. I insisted in my commentary that it was a penalty and that
              Howard Webb was quite correct. I even suggested Gomes should have been sent off. Perhaps, on reflection, I was wrong but, in my defence, working with Paddy seems to have affected my judgement.
              
              Blaming the penalty decision on the defeat seems a cop-out to me by Harry Redknapp. OK, it got United back in the game, but what about goals two, three, four, and five? Surely, Harry, your defence and goalkeeper need to take a bit of the blame â€“ not just Howard Webb.
              
              Just imagine all those Liverpool fans making their way back along the M62 after winning at Hull, listening to the radio 10 minutes into the second half. They would have been loving it; United two goals down and struggling. Then 22 minutes later theyâ€™re sat in stunned silence. Hilarious.
              
              I thought Rooney and Ronaldo were outstanding, but so was Dimitar Berbatov. It canâ€™t have been the most enjoyable of weeks for him after his penalty miss at Wembley, but his performance was superb on Saturday, all capped off with a deserved goal.
              
              Letâ€™s hope he gets another one on Wednesday â€“ what a night that could be! The â€œBelieveâ€� mosaic will be making another appearance before the game. And after Saturdayâ€™s drama, you really do have to believe that anything is possible at Old Trafford.
