              <p>this morning's match is excellent..Man Utd played that damn good with the remorseful and hungry attitude to just finish up the rest of the trophies in contention..spurned alot of chances though either via offside or close shots off target..</p>
              <p>but seriously though, the only mistake Man Utd ever made this season is really the purchase of Berbacock..he simply cant make it with any pairing...at least Tevez-Rooney pair made some goals..the best is still Ronaldo-Giggs with Rooney lurking upfront..</p>

              <p>yep, it was nice to see MU win, plus a cleansheet. with this win, MU is slowly driving the nails into Poo's dream of winning their title..</p>
              <p>Anderson seems transform, his passing for the first goal was outstanding, and he simply played tigerish... Only concern is MU's RB with GNV and JOS both sub.. hope brown can step in fast..</p>
              <p>Funnily, MU seems to be playing a 3 pong attack with Rooney,Ronaldo and Giggs inter-changing. With their movement, it just makes the Pompey's defence seems static. Importantly, MU do away the main target man strategy..</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I am still not convince with today's performance.. I think maybe because I have seen MUFC at their deadliest form and thus I expect a flawless performance by them. There were passes made by them that irks the hell out of me. Portsmouth wasn't exactly a threatening opposition yesterday, and I thought MUFC could have won by a much bigger scoreline. The thing that I cannot wholeheartedly put down MUFC is because for every schoolboy errors they made, they make it up with brilliant moments of football. Every single MUFC player that is. But we need consistency in our play to be a frightening force. One thing that I like abt us is our ability to tackle the ball. But we gotta improve our passing and our stamina. Evra everytime looks shagged the last 20 mins of the game ahahs.. just some 2 cents lawls..</p></div>

              <p class="article">A 2-0 win over Portsmouth saw them go three points clear at the top with a game in hand. But Alex Ferguson was unhappy his team did not finish off Pompey before Michael Carrick’s 82nd-minute goal.</p>
              <p class="article">Fergie said: “We were too casual so I’m not taking anything for granted. We have got to put our foot down. “There is no leeway unless you can keep performing properly.

              <p class="article">“In the first half the football was some of the best you’ll see all season. But when you miss chances at 1-0 up you encourage your opponents.” </p>

              <p class="article">“Hopefully we can keep this momentum going and put it to bed as quick as we can.” The game was Paul Scholes’ 600th for United while Ryan Giggs will make his 800th on Saturday against Spurs. </p>
              <p class="article">Carrick said: “They are the perfect example of what it is to play at this club.” The downside for United were foot injuries that could keep out Gary Neville and John O’Shea for the rest of the season. </p>

              Advantage Man Utd now, 3 points ahead of Liverpool with a game in hand.
              
              I dunno whether if ronaldo, rooney and the others played against Everton would have an affect against Portsmouth, but considering playing against spurs this weekend, it sure is taxing, as Man Utd is playing 1 game every 3-4 days till end of season.
              
              Next week CL semi finals against Arsenal is next week after spurs game, so I reckon it must have played in Fergie's mind in the fa cup match with Everton.
              
              You can't have all your way and eat the cake as well. something has to give. otherwise, will end up as nothing.

              Man Utd really is playing a lot of matches this season, with the charity shield, super cup and world club cup, not to mention league cup and fa cup and CL matches.
              
              Something has to give, Fergie made a gamble last sunday against Everton, alas its failed, but considering the overall picture, I think he made the right decision as Man Utd still has the most overall winner in fa cup.
              
              Man Utd still lag Liverpool for European Cup/CL winners,Man Utd won 3 whereas Liverpool has won 5, 2 more to tie with Liverpool. I think he prefer to win CL and BPL title before he retire, that is his wish. If Man Utd retain title this season, Man Utd would tie w Liverpool as 18 titles. Next season, we can surpass Liverpool if we retain the title.

              <p>yeah , Mu better do it soon , very soon .</p>
              <p>Once Liverpool takenover by Arabs ( rumour was to be ) or , at least a merger at least , and with the likes of Man City , and those $$$ coming in , it will be really tough just to hang on in the Top-4 , not just the title alone .</p>
              <p>Which club is rich ?</p>
              <p>Villa , MC and of course Chelsea .</p>

              Fast forward in a few years time when Fergie retire finally.
              
              I shudder to think will success continue after Fergie retired?
              
              think back in the past when Man Utd won the european cup in 1968, Man Utd were relegated in 1974 or something.

              Liverpool 2 much draws already la, 10 draws rite? if they can convert a few draws into wins, it will be quite many points and they are ahead of Man Utd now.
              
              You can't expect to win the title with 10 draws realistically speaking, unless all the other rivals for the title also draw as much.

              <p>i guessed it not possible to play the kind of football we played against Arsenal or against Chelsea week in week out ....</p>

              <p>A style of playing slow controlling football , and a diff style of attacking all the way ..</p>

              probably not a sign of championship material?
              
              you need to win against bottom teams as well. not good to beat the top teams and then lose or draw against bottom teams.

              <p><br>well ...that could be one of Rafa's Sun-Zhi strategies ...........</p>
              <p>Maybe he is thinking , we just do what we can to stay close to the top , and see how it goes ....</p>
              <p>And by mid-march , like last month , when most teams are punctured already , then we burst all out !!!!</p>
              <p>It works if u looked at how tight the title race is going to be .</p>
              <p>Any MU hiccup , in just a matter of mis-concentrations seconds by MU defense , the title might just go the other way round .  </p>

              I dun think so.
              
              Liverpool form was dipped in the January-Feb period wasn't it.
              
              Man Utd form started to dip in mid March - early April after that match against Inter away in the CL.
              
              But now Man Utd is back to form again, although not playing as well as it could.
