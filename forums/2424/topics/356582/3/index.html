              should plot earlier, like quarter final or earlier get knocked out. getting knocked out at semis, when there is like only one game left to juggle, AFTER everything else has been played? I don't think it is intentional lah

              if plotting, it would be based on the reserved playing, not the full team.
              
              Man Utd lineup against Everton showed that Fergie is willing to sacrisfise the fa cup than CL and BPL title.

              <p>imo he is not lacking in confidence at all..i find him abit cocky and fearless actually lol. you can see him directing others on the pitch at times. and the way he takes penalties suggest that he is very confident of scoring. i thk the key is that he is back to full fitness... hopefully he can play a big part in our remaining games. btw he is one of my fave players at united hehe</p>

              Anderson need to improve his shooting. He has still yet to score for Man Utd. If he improve on scoring, he can yet score a few crucial goals per season. I be happy if he can score 4-5 goals per season.
              
              He will be the ultimate replacement for scholes in the long term.

              <p>United's passing was quite poor throughout the match lei, other then the two passes that led to the goals of course.</p>
              <p>Rooney was guilty of giving it away most. lucky got Fletcher to clean things up at the back. He's MoM for me.</p>

              Anderson got potential. He will be the long term replacement for scholes if he can make that his position in future.
              
              He is still 21 years old, still the unfinished article.
              
              I see great future in him. As for Lucas, I can't comment on him cos I dunno him much.

              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Darren Fletcher
              believes someone is going to be on the wrong end of a hiding if
              Manchester United can start converting the majority of their chances. </strong></p>
              <p>The Red Devils outshot Portsmouth 17-4 in Wednesday's
              crucial victory at Old Trafford, but only mustered an early goal from
              Wayne Rooney and late effort from Michael Carrick.</p>
              <p>While Fletcher
              acknowledges the important thing for Sir Alex Ferguson's side was to
              pick up the points, he is unhappy they failed to make their dominance
              count against the Paul Hart's charges.</p>
              <p>However, the Scotland
              international thinks it is just a matter of time before United click
              and really put someone to the sword as the race for the Premier League
              title nears its conclusion.</p>
              <p>"The three points is the most important, but we have to start taking chances," he told <em>Sky Sports News</em>.</p>
              <p><span class="main-content">
              </span></p><p>"I think some team is going to get a hiding from us if we keep playing like that.</p>
              <p>"It's easier said than done. We have to go out there, keep taking chances and winning matches."</p>
              <p>The
              three-point haul over Pompey sees United usurp Liverpool at the top of
              the Premier League and Fletcher believes it is easier being the
              front-runner rather than chasing.</p>
              <p>"It's always great being top of
              the league because that means you're the team to beat," he continued.
              "It's always difficult chasing.</p>
              <p>"We've got ourselves in a position now where we're top. We don't play our game in hand for a while so we're three points ahead.</p>
              <p>"We're just taking each game as it comes. We're just looking to Tottenham which is our next match and we'll try and win that."</p>

              <p>actually if the ball falls to giggs in front of goal, high chance it wouldn't be converted.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Giggs just doesn't have the killer instinct in front of goal, dun u guys tink? Not like rooney or torres.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He's changed his style of play now. He used to do those dazzling runs past defenders and cross into the box but nowadays....well there's still running but he holds the ball up more now and distributes. He's able to control the pace of the game and slow things down.</p>

              <p>ST sports section said that man u is experiencing fatigue. I dun tink so leh.....when man u play against those lesser teams, tempo is always sluggish.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Not like liverpool, always want to score and score....well it's good thing actually but the way they play....attack is their only defence...it can cause a lot of problems when the opponent's attack is as lethal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Carragher....poor chap! he seems non-existent these days...and reina did not save a single of arshavin's 4 shots.</p>

              <p>lol imo, if the ball falls to Giggs in front of goal, <span style="color: #ff0000;">on his right foot</span>, then high
                  chance it wouldn't be converted. but still, he did score the winner against west ham with his right lol.</p>
              <p>But I don't expect Giggs to bang in the goals, he's already done great this season with his assists, got 18 already if i'm not wrong.</p>
