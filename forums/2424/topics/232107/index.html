            <div class='col-md body'>Heinze will stay for now... But i think this could be his last year at united. Should united gets Gareth Bale for next season, Heinze will be sold maybe for about $5m, a decent sum considering that united paid about $7m for him only.<br><br>As much as we won't like to see him go, he is getting on in age and he has slow down a bit this season... Bale is much younger than him about 11 yrs and also taller too and has good potential... He is also said to be quite a decent Free-kick specialist too.<br><br>Anyway, he is only 17... so can last for a very long time...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

I want to wait until June to see what happens. "I am happy in Manchester with my work and I want to try and get back in the team, but it is the coach who picks the 11."<br><br>Juventus and Spurs are two of the other clubs linked with a move for Heinze, and some of Wednesday's tabloids claimed the London club were ready to bid Â£5million for his services. But their manager Martin Jol told Sky Sports News: "There's no truth in that."<br><br></div>

That's wrong, it ends in 2009," stated Ferguson. "When I read that I immediately went diving for my file. I was sure that wasn't right. We don't allow these things to happen."<br><br>Asked whether Heinze had a future at United, Ferguson said: "Absolutely, of course." Ferguson is reported to be targeting Southampton youngster Gareth Bale, but the Scot admits he has made little progress in his bid to improve his squad.<br><br>"We're hitting a brick wall [with bringing players in]," added the Scot.
