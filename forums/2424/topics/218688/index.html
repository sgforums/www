            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Alex: I squared up to Schmeich</strong></span><br><br>ALEX FERGUSON has revealed he once feared for his life at the hands of Manchester United legend Peter Schmeichel. The Old Trafford boss, who celebrates 20 years in charge this weekend, admitted: Â“I had a bust-up with Schmikes once.<br><br>"He was towering over me and weÂ’re eye to eye. IÂ’m looking up and thinking Â‘If he hits me, I know IÂ’m deadÂ’. The other players were almost covering their eyes.Â”<br><br>Fergie, 64, has also blasted back at the calls for him to retire by claiming Â‘I want to work Â— and IÂ’ll keep workingÂ’. Some critics believe the Scot should have gone when he first announced his retirement four years ago.<br><br>But Ferguson hit back: Â“I enjoy working and that is important.Â“It is scandalous that some people think I should retire.Â“ItÂ’s none of their bloody business. Nobody should decry anyone who wants to work.<br><br>Â“It disgusts me that people think that way.Â“Some people do not want to work but I want to continue working.Â”<br><br>It was clear from the outburst that Ferguson has lost none of the fire in his belly and wants to be United boss for some time yet.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>I used to do hairdryer practice</strong></span><br><br>ALEX FERGUSON has finally revealed the sheer hard work that went into creating the hairdryer treatment.<br><br>Mark Hughes gave the nickname to the fearsome decibel-busting rollickings dished out by the boss over his 20 years in charge at Manchester United. But Ferguson, 64, says it was an art honed in his first managerial job at East Stirling 32 years ago.<br><br>Ferguson insisted: Â“There are a lot of myths. One of the papers once claimed that I used to go behind the stand at East Stirlingshire and practise screaming. Â“But thereÂ’s an element of truth in it. The hairdryer thing was started by Sparky, he owned up to it after he left. I can understand that because of my policy in the dressing room.Â”<br><br>Yet Ferguson does not regret one vein-popping flip Â— although he admits <span style="color: red;">he once feared it might cost him his life</span> at the hands of a Great Dane.<br><br>He said: Â“When somebody challenges me in there, I have to go for them. I believe you cannot avoid the confrontation. I had a bust-up with Schmikes (Peter Schmeichel) once.<br><br>Â“He was towering over me and the other players were almost covering their eyes. Â“WeÂ’re eye to eye and IÂ’m looking up and thinking to myself Â‘If he does hit me, I know IÂ’m deadÂ’.<br><br>Â“But although IÂ’ve a quick temper, IÂ’ll get over it quickly too.Â“If I have an argument with a player on a match day, next day itÂ’s all forgotten.Â” Ferguson, who is celebrating 20 years in charge, has brought unprecedented success to United.<br><br>He added: Â“I remember saying to the United board on my first day Â‘Do you know what youÂ’re getting? YouÂ’re looking at my record at Aberdeen but what I did there and at St Mirren was build a football clubÂ’.<br><br>Â“The underlying message was that it would take time. Bobby Charlton understood and said straight away Â‘ThatÂ’s why we want you hereÂ’.<br><br>Â“I donÂ’t think itÂ’s worth over a 20-year period having a look back and regretting it. Â“In a period of 20 years youÂ’re bound to make your share of bad mistakes. But there have been some fantastic decisions IÂ’ve got right so it balances out.<br><br>Ferguson insists he wants the Old Trafford empire to get bigger - starting with the ground. He wants 90,000 there Â— not for him but to see the team.<br><br>Last summer United expanded their ground in a Â£42million development to get another 8,000 spectators in.<br><br></div>
