              <p>"To defend well is great, but we also have to be capable of creating problems too."</p>
              <p>He continued, "If Manchester are at 100 per cent it's going to be very complicated. Manchester are one of the favourites to win the Champions League.</p>
              <p>"It would be logical if they go through, so it'll be a real exploit to knock out this team."</p>
              <p>"I'm convinced the atmosphere won't be anything like it is for a league game," the French legend added. "People come from afar. That's a plus for our players and an added pressure for our rivals, even if United's players are used to this type of atmosphere.</p>
              <p>"People speak of the atmosphere at Old Trafford as an advantage, I don't see why we can't say the same thing about the Velodrome."</p>
              <p>Deschamps also hailed the winning mentality that Manchester United have cultivated over the years and stated that winning is now part of their DNA.</p>
              <p>"United have an important history, they've won an enormous number of titles," explained Deschamps. "Their manager Alex Ferguson symbolises that, he's in his 24th season, that's something exceptional in the world of football.</p>
              <p>"This club has the culture of winning, like all the great clubs. The culture of winning is like a lightning conductor in the big clubs, it's in their DNA.</p>
              <p>"Nani, [Wayne] Rooney or [Dimitar] Berbatov, to name just a few, can make the difference at any moment. I've heard it said many times this team doesn't display a great team style, but I can't help noticing they don't concede many goals - only one in the six group games - they score a lot, and above all they win a lot of matches!"</p>

              <p>Ok, a quick recap at the 0-0 draw (expected that didn't we? Away Match Syndrome.)</p>
              <p>1. United played unconvincing defensive football for 3/4 of the matches with Rooney and Nani out wide and Berbatov without a striking partner. Doesn't seem to neutralised Heinze's run until the formation is switched back to 4-4-2.</p>
              <p>2. We have watched Smalling grow over the past few months and today he puts in yet another impeccable performace. Good in air, blocks and interception and equally well distributing the ball. United has found a natural Rio replacement. Evans are you watching?</p>
              <p>3. United lacked a central midfield general. The combo of Fletcher + Carrick + Gibson is a joke. One has no speed, the other is always missing and the other has all of the above.</p>
              <p>4. I sense Fergie hairdryer coming. The reserves blew their chance against Crawley and the seniors failed to impress at Marseille. With Arsenal's win against Stoke, the lead on top is cut into just 1 point. Is United ready for Chelsea? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="icon_confused.gif"></p>

              <p>I expected that anyway. Fergie's tactics will never change when playing away. What may seem to be a 4-3-3 formation is actually a 4-5-1 formation with Berbatov alone upfront and even us fans knew that he unlike Drogba is useless as a targetman.</p>
              <p>I think United will crash out soon anyway la. They struggled against Marseille so how can we expect them to perform against teams like Madrid, Barca, Arsenal, Bayern, Inter?</p>

              <p>I think this match just shows that why Berba isn't selected when playing important matches like the last derby? He as the targetmen is always at the same place and can only see him in action when defending a corner... -_-. </p>

              <p>such a waste to play Rooney as LW.. but with park/giggs/valencia out, and our 2nd team lacking, this may be the next best.</p>
              <p>I would love to see MUFC progress and play BayerM.. and then SAF/owners will realise, MUFC needs more quality. not some young fledgings that are not even properly scouted.</p>

              <p>I think ManU has really been lucky though this season, OM's frontline was not strong enough, Gignac and co. are out due to injuries, If they are continuing this kind of ai mai form then get ready to be whacked by OM the next round, and the match against chelsea.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Injuries still can accept but with the results are obvious whether you really want to fight for it.</p>
