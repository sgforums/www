              <p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Inter Milan have
              revealed that Manchester United almost lured starlet Davide Santon to
              England as they did with Federico Macheda. </strong></p>
              <p>The 17-year-old Macheda hit the headlines last week
              as he made his United debut in style by scoring the winner in their
              Premier League win over Aston Villa.</p>
              <p>That promoted Macheda's
              former club Lazio to again stress their annoyance at the fact that The
              Red Devils were able to lure him away from Rome when he was 16.</p>
              <p>Italian
              clubs cannot put players onto professional deals until they are 18,
              and, at times, English clubs use this to their advantage as they can to
              this when they turn 16.</p>
              <p>That was the case with Macheda as he
              moved to Manchester at 16 and signed a contract with United. And now
              Inter have revealed that Santon, who has just broken into their
              first-team, almost went the same way.</p>
              <p>Inter's assistant, Giuseppe Baresi, has revealed how Stanton almost joined United, whilst Chelsea also showed an interest.</p>
              <p>"It was a similar case like that of Macheda, that almost happened with Santon," he told <em>Sky Italia</em>.</p>
              <p>"We knew of Manchester United's interest. I know their Italian scout was following him, and like him.</p>
              <p>"And
              with Manchester there was Chelsea, another club who has a scout here in
              Italy and they were watching all our matches to follow Santon.</p>
              <p>"But the (player's) family was important, we have been able to his contract in the way, right sums for a guy aged 16."</p>
              <p>Santon
              is now regarded as one of finest prospects in Italian football having
              broken through into Jose Mourinho's squad this season.</p>
