              <p>Manchester United manager <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=30"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></a> hailed <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=21046"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Wayne Rooney</span></a> as one of the best players in the world and backed the striker to break the 30-goal barrier this season following his match-winning performance against AC Milan. </p>
              <p>Rooney scored twice as United beat Milan 3-2 at the San Siro in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie, taking his season tally to 25, and Ferguson feels the goalscoring aspect of Rooney's game is driving him on to a new level.</p>
              <p>"He could break 30," declared the United boss. "This season in particular, over the last two months, there has been a marked improvement in his game.</p>
              <p>"His overall performance was absolutely devastating. Milan couldn't handle him. They just couldn't handle him. He has to be regarded at the highest level, along with all the other players we know about."</p>
              <p>Rooney's magic appeared to have confirmed United's place in the last eight with the score at 3-1, only for Clarence Seedorf to give Milan a glimmer of hope.</p>
              <p>In fact, Ferguson admitted it was fortunate United had not sustained more damage during a one-sided opening in which Ronaldinho gave Milan a third-minute lead and then both he and Klaas Jan Huntelaar failed to take excellent chances to make matters much worse for the visitors.</p>
              <p>"That first 20 minutes was a bad period for us," said Ferguson. "We could have been two or three down because the bad start gave Milan encouragement. But we were desperate to hang on and thankfully we got ourselves back into it."</p>
              <p>The visitors managed that through <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=8860"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Paul Scholes</span></a>' left shin, which <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=8871"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Darren Fletcher</span></a>'s cross hit after the former England star had failed to make contact with his intended right-footed shot.</p>
              <p>From there it was glory all the way for United until Seedorf struck to set up a nervy last five minutes during which <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=7971"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Michael Carrick</span></a> was shown a second yellow card for time-wasting, ruling him out of the Old Trafford return on March 10.</p>
              <p>"I didn't know what it was for at first but then I was told he kicked the ball away," said Ferguson. "It was a soft red card but when you do something like that you are not really giving the referee any option."</p>

              <p><strong>Wayne Rooney is among the world’s elite players, and he’s still got more to come – that’s the ominous assessment of United’s no.10 from Michael Carrick.<br><br></strong>Rooney scored twice to inspire United’s 3-2 Champions League first knockout round first leg win over AC Milan at the San Siro. Rooney now has 25 goals for the season – his best tally to date – and there are a further possible 19 games this season in which he can add to that total.<br><br>Carrick describes his team-mate as “phenomenal”, marvelling at how the in-form 24-year-old is scoring goals relentlessly, setting them up, and influencing games with his all-round play.<br><br>“Wayne is among the best players in the world,” Carrick said. “He seems to be getting better and better and players like him have the ability to really influence the big games. He’s scoring goals and setting them up and his overall play is phenomenal. I’m sure he can get even better.”<br><br>Rooney’s spike in form of late is by no means coincidental with a more consistent back four and subsequently improved performances in midfield.<br><br>“Wayne was brilliant [against Milan] but I felt we did well as a team,” added Carrick. “We controlled a lot of the game and that gave</p>
              <p>him the platform to perform. He was causing all sorts of trouble for their back four. Being up there on his own is not easy. But of late he has been brilliant.”<br><br>With Rooney heading up a self-assured United team, the Reds are confident of beating anyone and optimistic of booking a place in the Champions League quarter finals when Milan visit Old Trafford in three weeks’ time.<br><br>“We’re playing well at the moment and scoring a lot of goals,” added Carrick. “Even after the bad start we were still confident that we could get a grip of the game. We played some good stuff in the second half and could have scored more. But overall the way we started the game and the chances they had, we can’t be too disappointed.<br><br>“You probably would say we’re favourites to go through, but we know how important the start of the next game is. If we can get the next goal we’ll be in a great position, but as things stand at the moment it’s still in the balance. We’ve got to make sure we perform again at Old Trafford.”</p>

              <p>Wayne Rooney would prefer more medals to accolades for equalling Cristiano Ronaldo's 42-goal tally of two seasons ago.</p>
              <p>Manchester United's star striker is on 28 for the season following his Carling Cup final match-winner against Aston Villa at Wembley.</p>
              <p>With a maximum 16 games to play, Rooney is in line to catch the total that helped Ronaldo become World Player of the Year.</p>
              <p>But Rooney only has eyes for the Premier League and Champions League trophies United will now turn their attention to after successfully defending a cup competition for the first time.</p>
              <p>"Cristiano got 42 but I am just looking to contribute to us winning medals," said the 24-year-old.</p>
              <p>"If that happens (42) it would be great but as long as we win medals it would be even better."</p>
              <p>News that Rooney has picked up a knee injury that makes him a doubt for England's friendly with Egypt at Wembley on Wednesday will only heighten fears that too much is being asked of a man who is so important to both club and country.</p>
              <p>But Rooney insists he is not concerned about burn-out.</p>
              <p>"I don't feel any pressure or burden really," he said.</p>
              <p>"To be honest I have probably had pressure since I was 16 so it is something you get used to and deal with in your own way."</p>
              <p>Rooney's looping header completed a successful comeback for United, who trailed to James Milner's fourth-minute penalty.</p>
              <p>Martin O'Neill found sympathy with his view Nemanja Vidic should have been sent off and had the Serbian gone so early in the contest, United would have been in trouble.</p>
              <p>Instead, referee Phil Dowd took a lenient stance and did not even book the Serbian, so once Michael Owen had limped off with a hamstring injury after he had scored an excellent equaliser, the scene was set for Rooney to finish the hero.</p>
              <p>"I was chomping at the bit to get on," he said.</p>
              <p>"You want to play in finals. Thankfully I have managed to do so and left my mark on the game.</p>
              <p>"I knew on Wednesday or Thursday I wouldn't be playing. I had a little bit of a stomach bug and the manager was looking for an excuse to leave me out.</p>
              <p>"When he found out about that it made his mind up.</p>
              <p>"I was still disappointed but it was the correct decision by the manager."</p>
