The Manchester United left-back, 29, will sort out his future after the Copa America next month.</strong><br><br>The ArgieÂ’s representatives believe United will let him go for Â£5million with Patrice Evra ahead of him in the pecking order. Heinze said: Â“When the internationals are over weÂ’ll see where I will play. I donÂ’t know if IÂ’ll play for Madrid or Barcelona.Â”<br><br>Heinze was in Madrid last week for talks about replacing Brazil legend Roberto Carlos. His brother and advisor Sebastian said: Â“As well as Real Madrid there are other teams showing interest in Gabriel, like Barcelona and Juventus in Italy.Â” Heinze spent four season in Spain at Real Valladolid. He moved to Paris St Germain in 2001 and joined United for Â£6.9m in 2004.<br><br></div>

Heinze is 29, which means there isn't much playing time left for him. It's either he stick to United till he retires or get sold.<br><br>My guess is Fergie wants to recoup back some transfer fund.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Cheers.<br>CK</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I think the thing here is does Heinze want to remain and play as a sub for next season? I think it is quite clear that he is no longer in the first team... He is 29 now and will be 30 by next season... Even if united want to keep him, he could still buy the last year off his contract and have a chance to play in Spain with their 2 biggest club...<br><br>Letting him go is a good thing, Cos firstly he is no longer as good as he was 2 yrs ago... Secondly he has been a good servant to the club therefore they should not block his last chance with the 2 biggest club in Spain... And also, He was bought for only $6.9m and getting back $5m (The buy-out for the last year of his contract) is still good business as he will be 30 soon, the $5m can be use to buy another younger defender...</div>

Even thou his form has dipped, compared to couple of years back, he did fill in Evra's shoes nicely, even more so in some games. Utd can't afford to let him go lah. Must we sell him?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>HEINZE TO BUY OUT MANYOO CONTRACT<br><br>It's old news for regular gossipers, but The Times reports that 'Real Madrid are expected to press ahead with plans to sign Gabriel Heinze.' In case you weren't already aware, 'Barcelona, Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain, from whom United bought Heinze for Â£6.9 million in June 2004, are also understood to be in the hunt for the Argentina defender.'</strong><br><br>What's interesting about the story, however, is the possibility that Heinze will 'buy out' his contract. It's a little complicated, so forgive your bleary-eyed Gossip columnist while he quotes from The Times at length:<br><br>'United will be entitled to about Â£6 million in compensation if Heinze chooses to invoke a clause in Fifa's new transfer regulations allowing him to buy out his contract, although he would not be able to join another club in England if he did so. Under the Fifa law, a contract ceases to be "protected" after a period of three years if the player was under 28 when he signed.<br><br>'A player could then "buy out" the contract, provided that 15 days' notice is given and that a compensation fee - in effect the value of the remaining contract - is paid to the club owning his registration.<br><br>'The only known precedent involves Andy Webster, the Scotland defender, who was given permission by Fifa to leave Heart of Midlothian for Wigan Athletic last September, although, given the ensuing difficulties of that transfer, other clubs and players may be put off going down the same route.</div>
