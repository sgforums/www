              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">WES BROWN'S future at Manchester United is hanging by a thread after a 
              screaming row with Alex Ferguson.</h2>
              <p>Brown had the bust-up on the pre-season tour of America and has not started a 
              league game since.</p>
              <p>And he believes his Old Trafford stay is now in doubt.</p>
              <p>The argument was over a night out organised by United's players. Brown 
              is understood to have been told by boss Fergie he could not go - although it 
              is not clear why - leading to the row.</p>
              <p>The defender, 31 this Wednesday, stood his ground and Ferguson was described 
              as 'incandescent' as they traded verbal blows.</p>
              <p>Since then, Brown has had to make do with a start against Rangers in the 
              Champions League - when Rafael cried off late through illness.</p>
              <p>And he began the Carling Cup third-round tie with Scunthorpe.</p>
              <p>Brown, who joined United as a pro in 1996, did not get off the bench in the 
              Premier League win over Liverpool last month.</p>
              <p>He made the Euro trip to Valencia but was left out of the squad on the night.</p>
              <p>The former England star, who won 23 caps, has made 349 appearances for the Old 
              Trafford giants.</p>
              <p>He is one short of 200 Premier League starts but may not get the chance to 
              reach that milestone with his current club.</p>
              <p>Brown fears being sold in January - with Sunderland keeping an eye on 
              developments.</p>
              <p>The versatile defender, who has 1½ years left on his deal, was diplomatic when 
              asked last week whether he is frustrated on the sidelines.</p>
              <p>He said: "Yeah, a little bit. But I've always had to deal with that situation 
              throughout my career.</p>
              <p>"It's something I've learned to handle. We've got lots of good players in 
              defensive positions.</p>
              <p>"I have to keep training hard and, when I do get a chance, play well.</p>
              <p>"There's no point sulking and letting it get to you.</p>
              <p>"It might be difficult but you have to remember that everyone wants to play 
              every week. Unfortunately, that can't happen."</p>

              <p>Same goes for my office's younger staff, they have the "I want my way attitudes...","I deserved to be rewarded..." They are more self centered or in better term they fight for their rights.</p>

              <p>Wayne Rooney's week of self-contradiction is at an end, but the episode will not be consigned to history that easily. Photograph: Pascal Lauener/Reuters</p>
              <p>When <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester United" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united"><span style="color: #005689;">Manchester United</span></a> sent in the heavy mob on Thursday to dissuade <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Wayne Rooney" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/wayne-rooney"><span style="color: #005689;">Wayne Rooney</span></a> from leaving they noticed a crack in his determination to join Manchester City. Rooney had been shocked by the anger his dismissive comments about the club's lack of "ambition" had aroused among his United team-mates.</p>
              <p>Buckling under the strain, Rooney needed friends but the United players turned their backs. They would not forgive their colleague's insult in suggesting their side had slipped into mediocrity. More money from the Glazers and a failure of nerve at Rooney's end produced the sweetness-and-light statement confirming his signature on a new five-year deal at Old Trafford. But the resentments felt by workmates and supporters will not be easily erased by the most spectacular U-turn in the history of modern transfer sagas.</p>
              <p>As Sir Alex Ferguson and David Gill, the chief executive, bore down on Paul Stretford, Rooney's agent, in a meeting at Old Trafford, an unconditional apology was a precondition of England's leading player remaining at the club. United were at once pleading with Rooney to stay and playing hardball with the terms on which he might do so. Later that day, 40 men in balaclavas gathered outside the player's Cheshire mansion to warn him of the dire consequences should he defect across town.</p>
              <p>"Wayne has apologised to me and the players," Ferguson told a local radio station when the volte face was completed. "He will also do so with the supporters." This, after United fans had unfurled banners at the midweek Champions League game against Bursaspor calling Rooney a "whore" and promising: "Colleen forgave you, we won't". Short of planting a new forest in Cheshire to compensate for all the newsprint he wasted, Rooney must identify a strategy to regain the trust of team-mates at the Carrington training groundand fans who will now see his alarming slump, retrospectively, as proof of self-indulgence.</p>
              <p>His problem is that his recent feeble form has come to look like part of a strategy to get away from a club he accused in a statement two hours before the Bursaspor game of failing to match his own grand vision for talent acquisition. By implication, Rooney was saying some of the recent recruits to Ferguson's squad were not fit to share his air space. This, in professional team sports, remains a complete no-no. The outrage expressed by celebrated ex-United players must have drummed in his brain like heavy rain on his roof.</p>
              <p>Patrice Evra, the team's warrior left-back, was the most explicit in his denunciation. He said: "If one player in the team does not trust the others, he should not play in the team. I trust everyone, I know we can win." Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs and Gary Neville, Ferguson's closest confidantes in the dressing room, are likely to have restated the principle they grew up with: that individual egos should not be allowed to destroy togetherness.</p>
              <p>Even if the senior players forgive him, Chris Smalling, Javier Hernández, Bebé, Gabriel Obertan, Anderson and even Antonio Valencia are unlikely to forget the affront. They will feel Rooney's condescension throughout their time together. They have seen him issue ludicrous statements first justifying his desire to flee and then expressing his fidelity to the cause, all of which is at odds with his reputation for straight-talking and dependability.</p>
              <p>They will see, in other words, a creature of manipulation and self-contradiction: one they will feel they can rely on less. There is also the problem of his rocketing salary, which will eclipse theirs. Some will think Rooney has extorted an unrealistic wage with his brinkmanship and damaged the club along the way. It seemed significant that Nani kissed his United badge after scoring against Bursaspor: a memo, perhaps, to the traitor, as he was seen then.</p>
              <p>Selfish and often myopic by nature, most Premier League players would welcome Rooney back on purely pragmatic grounds. More quality in the side equals more chance of winning trophies and bonuses. Simple. But even here Rooney has a complication. If he returns to last season's rampant form (pre-March, at any rate) colleagues and supporters will take it as incontrovertible proof that he has been half-hearted since August. Conversely, a continuation of the droop would say United have broken the bank for a 24-year-old who has already peaked and may even be in decline.</p>
              <p>Supporters are no less capricious. United's will be blowing a raspberry at Manchester City and will be relieved to escape the stress of not knowing whom the club might find to replace him. Equally, their opinion of him will be lowered. Their willingness to embrace a Merseysider stemmed from the obvious sense that Rooney would run through a wall to wear the United shirt. Will they feel that now? More likely is that they will remember his arrogance for daring to tell Gill and Ferguson they were failing to match his "ambitions".</p>
              <p>Part of United's strategy on Thursday was to persuade him he was about to make an appalling error. Fans and players will probably feel he already has, with his disrespect.</p>
