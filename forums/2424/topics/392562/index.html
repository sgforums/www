              <p>Chris Smalling admits he expects to be star-struck when he pitches up at Old Trafford but is determined not to be nervous around his new Manchester United team-mates.</p>
              <p>The Fulham defender's meteoric rise from Maidstone to one of the world's biggest clubs was sealed in January when Sir Alex Ferguson paid a significant sum to lure him from Craven Cottage, while allowing him to stay in the capital until the end of the season.</p>
              <p>Smalling, who starts for England U21s on Wednesday night against Greece, is touted by many to be a full international in the future.</p>
              <p>Rubbing shoulders with the likes of Wayne Rooney and Rio Ferdinand is a world away from that which he occupied just 18 months ago, when he was earning £5 an hour as a waiter while studying for his A-Levels.</p>
              <p>While his move to United has come sooner than anyone could have anticipated, Smalling concedes there was only ever going to be one answer once Ferguson came calling.</p>
              <p>"It has been a whirlwind and things are happening very quickly," admitted Smalling. "It is very exciting.</p>
              <p>"My move to United came out of the blue. I was just concentrating on doing well for Fulham and linking up with the Under 21s, then suddenly it came up and it is a fantastic opportunity for me.</p>
              <p>"When you have one of the biggest clubs in the world even considering you will be good enough for them, it is a massive compliment.</p>
              <p>"I think at times I'll be star-struck, but I'm not nervous. When I started to play for Fulham I got a few nerves, but I've played now and have started to get used to it."</p>

              <p><strong>Young Reds right-back Rafael would relish the opportunity to test himself against Ronaldinho again, and he’s keen to repay the faith Sir Alex Ferguson has shown in him.<br><br></strong>The Brazilian marked his fellow countryman at the San Siro – a challenge that, while undoubtedly tough, the fearless 19-year-old was never going to shirk. Now, with the more experienced Wes Brown out of action after sustaining a foot injury against Wolves, Rafael is vying with Gary Neville for a place in United’s back four on Wednesday, and another crack at halting Ronaldinho.<br><br>“It was a great privilege for me,” Rafael tells <strong><a href="http://www.manutd.com/programme"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">United Review</span></span></a></strong> about being selected to start in the 3-2 first-leg win in Italy. “It made me feel that the manager really trusts me by giving me the opportunity to play in this type of match. It’s a great feeling knowing that the manager believes in my ability to play at this level.”</p>
              <p>Injury had kept Rafael out of action at the start of this season, which was frustrating for the Reds’ no.21 after a promising debut campaign. Approaching the end of November 2009, his only appearance was as a midfielder in the 2-0 Carling Cup win over Barnsley. But he’s since made 12 outings and looks an increasingly integral member of the first-team squad.<br><br>“Last year I had a lot of good opportunities to play in the first-team, so I was frustrated earlier this season to be injured because I thought that I would have a big chance to try to play in the team a lot this year,” he adds. “But now I have recovered and I am back playing, I feel in good shape.”<br><br>He’ll have to be in very good shape if he's picked up against Ronaldinho at Old Trafford but you can bet he’ll give his all - and he’ll be that little bit wiser for his San Siro experience.</p>
