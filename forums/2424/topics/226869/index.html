            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.teamtalk.com//Images/87684.jpg"><br><br>Sunderland boss Roy Keane has admitted the pressures of Coca-Cola Championship management can be even greater than life in the top flight. The 35-year-old Irishman takes his side to Crystal Palace on Friday night sitting 11th in the table and just four points off the play-off places.<br><br>However, he is quickly having to come to terms with the demands of his job and the hunger for an immediate return to the Barclays Premiership. Keane said: "The Championship is a tough league. It is a bit of a rat race. Everybody is beating each other.<br><br>"We all want to be back in the Premiership, there is no doubt about that. That is the place to be. "You look at the managerial casualties this year, especially in the Championship, and sometimes there is even more pressure on a manager in the Championship than in the Premier League because everyone just wants to get back into that Premiership for whatever reason.<br><br>Keane admits he has made mistakes since accepting chairman Niall Quinn's invitation to launch his managerial career at the Stadium of Light back in August. However, a man who gleaned all he could from Brian Clough and Sir Alex Ferguson during his glittering playing career is avidly pursuing his education with his passion for success undimmed.<br><br>He explained: "You learn every day, you learn every day about each other. "It is brilliant that there is a togetherness. We are all in it together. "There are going to be ups and downs, there are going to be disagreements, but I like that. I like people to say how they feel and to show their feelings. "I have made a lot of mistakes so far as a manager, but you have got to learn quickly, especially in the Championship, because too many mistakes and you are out of a job."<br><br>The Black Cats head for London on the back of a seven-game unbeaten run. And he knows from his Manchester United days in particular that that kind of commitment can help in the fight for a shot at promotion in the second half of the season.<br><br>Keane said: "If you have not got that in your dressing room, you have got no chance. "It will probably make all the difference. That was one of the things I wanted to build among the players, among the staff to connect with the supporters. "There is a togetherness there. We know we are far from the finished article, but we have given ourselves a chance.<br><br>"We keep going to the end and if we can add one or two players to help us, that will be fantastic and hopefully we can have a good second half of the season."<br><br>Keane revealed he has already sat down with Quinn to discuss how they will attempt to bolster the squad during the transfer window. He said: "We have spoken about a few of the players we are hoping to get in, but it is going to be difficult, I have to say."<br><br><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/div2.jpg"><br><br>Actually he is doing quite ok for a new manager... When he took over they were 24th place now 11 already... If they had a better start, they would be in the light green area...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

It proves one thing I think.. That Southend is actually not bad in fact the teams in the Championship are all not bad but consistency is probably the problem.. I'm pretty sure if Man U and Southend were to play over 3 games Man U would win the other 2.. Ball is round anything can happen in the game.. Too bad Man U lost out on that match.. Haiz.. So malu.. Kudos to Southend..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Clinton takes a Keane interest </strong><br><br>Crystal Palace striker Clinton Morrison claims it is no surprise that Roy Keane is starting to make waves in management.<br><br>Keane has had a huge impact at the Stadium of Light, as Sunderland had lost four of their five league matches before he took over.<br><br>Morrison said: "Roy is a leader on and off the pitch. He always wanted players to do it his way. When I go away with Ireland, I speak to some of the Sunderland players, and they are a bit nervous about going into Roy's office to ask why they are not in the team. But they have all said that training has been brilliant."<br><br>The 27-year-old frontman said of Keane: "He is the only person in football to have made me afraid. But I got on well with him when we were with Ireland - surprisingly, because I have a bit of a big mouth and Roy doesn't normally like those types of players.<br><br>"But he is a top bloke and is probably the best player I have ever played with. He helped me a lot with my game."<br><br></div>
