            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Skipper Sam Hewson put Manchester United's youngsters on target for their 10th FA Youth Cup triumph with a late penalty at Anfield in the final's first leg. Holders Liverpool had taken the lead in the first half with a fine header from the impressive Craig Lindfield. But in front of a 19,518 crowd, an own goal from Robbie Threlfall gave United parity soon after the break, before Hewson bagged his fifth goal in this season's tournament to send United confidently into the Old Trafford second leg on April 26. </strong><br><br>The good and the great of both clubs were in evidence at Anfield, both first team managers - Rafael Benitez and Sir Alex Ferguson - plus a galaxy of Liverpool senior talent in Steven Gerrard, Jamie Carragher, Jose Reina and Xabi Alonso, were all there to see the stars of the future. But such were the pressing requirements of Ferguson's senior men, he withdrew youth captain Carl Cathcart from the match to include him in the squad to play Sheffield United on Tuesday, having been on the bench at Villa Park in Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Watford.<br><br>And Gerrard and Carragher were on their feet after just 16 minutes, punching the air, as Liverpool's youngsters took the lead. Ray Putterill, on the left, put United full-back Richard Eckersley on the seat of his pants with a twisting run before crossing for Lindfield to head past German keeper Ron-Robert Zieler. The tall striker had started the season in a first-team friendly at Crewe alongside Robbie Fowler, when he scored, and he caused United's back line plenty of problems.<br><br>The visitors' response was an over-head effort from Febian Brandy, and a low drive from Chris Fagan, well saved by Danish youngster Martin Hansen. United produced some neat, controlled play with 16 year-old winger Daniel Welbeck -described by Ferguson as "an excellent young talent" - a constant danger. And four minutes into the second period they were level, thanks to an own goal from the unfortunate Threlfall, who headed Daniel Galbraith's cross past Hansen.<br><br>It took a while for Liverpool to recover from that body blow, and United continued to have the greater possession. But hard-working Jimmy Ryan in midfield drove them on, and saw one of his own 25-yard shot go wide. Putterill continued to torment United's right flank, cutting inside on 65 minutes to curl a fine effort just over. But on 73 minutes United grabbed the lead from the spot when Liverpool skipper Jay Spearing brought down Brandy in the box, and Hewson stood up to the pressure from a baying Kop to drill home the spot-kick.<br><br>Liverpool fought back gallantly, but United's defence - in which James Chester was outstanding - held out for the crucial first-leg victory.<br><br></div>
