              <p>United's game is also a bit less interchangeable this season without Tevez in the starting line-up. So it may have somehow restricted Ronaldo's game.

              <p>To echo what the commentators said, pound for pound, the Chelsea players are much bigger/taller so to allow Vidic to score the corner must have been hard. And what about Rooney's goal, he put his leg in between ACole to score.. So funny..</p>
              <p>And Vidic and Berba had a plan, Vidic to block Berba's shadow, and Berba to attack near post, and hammer the ball to score..</p>
              <p>Yes, Ronaldo has no real impact, but what about that cheeky backpass to Evra, for Evra to gain that few steps to send in a perfect cross for Rooney to score.Magic.</p>
              <p>And Berba to flick that cross from corner so that Vidic can shake off Terry to score the first goal.</p>
              <p>I think Howard Webb was abit too fast to show the yellows..</p>
              <p>Well, I did not like Ronaldo ona yellow, still leaving his foot in when he was tackling Lampard late in the game. He could have earned a red.</p>
              <p>And how many saw the dive by Ballack, simply retard..</p>

              <h2 id="stand-first" class="stand-first-alone">The winger irradiated a spirit of invention that would  have done credit to any of football's famous free spirits</h2>
              </div>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>It is not the easiest thing in
              the world to feel sorry for a 23-year-old footballer who can walk away
              from a wrecked Â£200,000 Ferrari without a backward glance or even a
              slight ache in the wallet, but <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/ronaldo">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> deserved a measure of sympathy last night as, having played his part in a fine victory for <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchesterunited">Manchester United</a>, he was deprived of two goals of his own to add to the three scored by his team-mates.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo
              will travel to Zurich tonight expecting to pick up Fifa's world player
              of the year award, a reward for his belief that football should be a
              matter of skill and spontaneity. Last night, watched by a crowd
              including Fabio Capello and Jose Mourinho, the winger irradiated a
              vital match with a spirit of invention that would have done credit to
              any of football's famous free spirits.</p>
              <p>Leaving blue-shirted
              defenders lying in the gutter like so many smashed-up supercars, he
              carried a constant promise of danger and had a hand in Manchester
              United's second and third goals, scored by Wayne Rooney and Dimitar
              Berbatov. The two disallowed efforts, however, provided equally vivid
              memories.</p>
              <p>The first came a minute into first-half stoppage time,
              when Rooney and Ryan Giggs played a wonderful trick on their opponents.
              United had won a right-wing corner and Rooney dribbled the dead ball
              gently towards the corner flag. He stopped it in the quadrant, as the
              laws require, and then dragged it back no more than 18 inches with the
              sole of his boot before strolling away, as if to leave it for Ryan
              Giggs, the normal taker of such kicks. The Welsh veteran walked up to
              the ball, turned towards the goal and suddenly set off on a short
              dribble before hitting a cross which Ronaldo raced to meet at the near
              post with a powerful header that arrowed past the dumbfounded Petr Cech.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately
              the linesman was not thinking at the same speed as the United players
              and the goal was disallowed, against the vehement protests of those who
              had engineered such a marvellous piece of training-ground trickery. The
              United trio were thus denied the rewards of the most impudent dead-ball
              routine since Willie Carr of Coventry City flicked a free-kick up with
              the ball between his heels for Ernie Hunt to volley home against
              Everton almost 40 years ago.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo was denied again towards the
              end of the second half, when Berbatov met Rooney's astute flick from
              the right and steered the ball into his Portuguese team-mate's path.
              Level with the last defender when the pass was played, Ronaldo beat the
              goalkeeper from close range with the perfect one-on-one finish, only to
              fall victim once again to a linesman whose perception, as the replay
              showed, was not the equal of the players' execution of a sumptuous move.</p>
              <p>He
              had plenty with which to console himself. His evening started with a
              kick on his shins from Frank Lampard in the third minute, bringing a
              booking for the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/chelsea">Chelsea</a> man as well as giving a broad hint of the uncompromising nature of the
              visitors' challenge. But the backheels, the stutter-step dribbles and
              the weirdly swerving free-kicks took a while to ignite and he earned a
              yellow card of his own when he and his compatriot Ricardo Carvalho
              wrestled each other to the ground on the half-hour.</p>
              <p>Once United
              had scored from the retaken corner on the brink of half-time, however,
              Ronaldo's contribution came into focus. Now facing a visiting midfield
              reduced in numbers by the withdrawal of Deco, he exploited the
              additional space to devastating effect, moving across to the left flank
              and torturing Jose Bosingwa, another fellow Portuguese, while
              demonstrating his gift for delivering lethal crosses without the
              split-second pause that mere mortals need to gather and steady
              themselves before striking the ball.</p>
              <p>It was with a backheel like
              a switchblade thrust in a dark alley that he took Bosingwa out of the
              game and invited the enterprising Patrice Evra to deliver the cross
              from which Rooney stabbed home United's second goal. And three minutes
              from time, having been brought down by Bosingwa's replacement, Juliano
              Belletti, on the left of the Chelsea penalty area, Ronaldo got up to
              drive in a low free-kick which the sprinting Berbatov met with a firm
              shot to complete the scoreline.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo was not alone, however,
              in his excellence and his influence on what felt like a gala evening.
              During a first half of unremitting effort but not much coherence from
              either side, the 33-year-old Giggs put on a command performance in
              central midfield.</p>
              <p>Twice the great man drove into the heart of
              Chelsea's defence, injecting pace and dynamism to lift United's spirits
              and standards. At the other end of the age spectrum, the tall and
              slender central defender Jonny Evans, who turned 21 last week,
              performed alongside Vidic with a composure and a lucidity that would
              have done credit to the absent Rio Ferdinand.</p>
              <p>For these and other reasons Sir Alex Ferguson could leave the ground wearing his biggest smile of the season. The  chase is on.</p>

              </div>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>It is not the easiest thing in the world to feel sorry for a
              23-year-old footballer who can walk away from a wrecked Â£200,000
              Ferrari without a backward glance or even a slight ache in the
              wallet, but <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/ronaldo">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> deserved a measure of sympathy
              last night as, having played his part in a fine victory for
              <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchesterunited">Manchester United</a>, he was deprived of two goals of
              his own to add to the three scored by his team-mates.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo will travel to Zurich tonight expecting to pick up
              Fifa's world player of the year award, a reward for his belief that
              football should be a matter of skill and spontaneity. Last night,
              watched by a crowd including Fabio Capello and Jose Mourinho, the
              winger irradiated a vital match with a spirit of invention that
              would have done credit to any of football's famous free
              spirits.</p>
              <p>Leaving blue-shirted defenders lying in the gutter like so many
              smashed-up supercars, he carried a constant promise of danger and
              had a hand in Manchester United's second and third goals, scored by
              Wayne Rooney and Dimitar Berbatov. The two disallowed efforts,
              however, provided equally vivid memories.</p>
              <p>The first came a minute into first-half stoppage time, when
              Rooney and Ryan Giggs played a wonderful trick on their opponents.
              United had won a right-wing corner and Rooney dribbled the dead
              ball gently towards the corner flag. He stopped it in the quadrant,
              as the laws require, and then dragged it back no more than 18
              inches with the sole of his boot before strolling away, as if to
              leave it for Ryan Giggs, the normal taker of such kicks. The Welsh
              veteran walked up to the ball, turned towards the goal and suddenly
              set off on a short dribble before hitting a cross which Ronaldo
              raced to meet at the near post with a powerful header that arrowed
              past the dumbfounded Petr Cech.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately the linesman was not thinking at the same speed as
              the United players and the goal was disallowed, against the
              vehement protests of those who had engineered such a marvellous
              piece of training-ground trickery. The United trio were thus denied
              the rewards of the most impudent dead-ball routine since Willie
              Carr of Coventry City flicked a free-kick up with the ball between
              his heels for Ernie Hunt to volley home against Everton almost 40
              years ago.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo was denied again towards the end of the second half,
              when Berbatov met Rooney's astute flick from the right and steered
              the ball into his Portuguese team-mate's path. Level with the last
              defender when the pass was played, Ronaldo beat the goalkeeper from
              close range with the perfect one-on-one finish, only to fall victim
              once again to a linesman whose perception, as the replay showed,
              was not the equal of the players' execution of a sumptuous
