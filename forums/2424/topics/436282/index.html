              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>But the presence of Diarra would raise more questions about the future of Luka Modric, as Chelsea prepare to make an improved bid.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The players have different qualities - Diarra is far more defensive than Modric - but Redknapp would still be adding some real quality to his midfield and it would test Levy’s resolve to keep hold of the Croat.</span></p>

              <p><strong>David De Gea, Manchester United’s embattled goalkeeper, will be targeted by a Tottenham team ready to shoot on sight tomorrow night.</strong></p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson will stand by De Gea, insisting: “He’ll get the protection he needs at home.”</p>
              <p>But the visitors are aware that United’s new ­£18.3million goalie will be shell-shocked after conceding soft goals in the Community Shield at Wembley and last weekend’s Premier League opener at West Brom.</p>
              <p>The fact that United won both games has partially ­papered over the De Gea cracks. But Spurs will be ­aiming to exploit any sign of nerves from the 20-year-old Spaniard.</p>
              </div>
              <p style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">Spurs midfielder ­Gareth Bale said: “It’s obviously going to be nerve-racking for him to go to United and be in the first team, but he showed at Atletico Madrid and with Spain that he’s a world-class keeper.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">“If any keeper’s having a bad time, you’re going to test them and it’s going to be no different. We’re going to go to Old Trafford and give our all and test their whole team.”</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">After the soft goal, West Brom followed up with a second-half physical ­assault that had Ferguson and the United players fuming.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">But Ferguson is adamant he has no qualms about keeping his summer signing in the ­firing line against a side ­intent on exploiting any fears or uncertainties.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">The United boss is ­confident De Gea can come through the ordeal, just as his greatest keeper, Peter Schmeichel, did after a mauling at ­Wimbledon.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">Ferguson said: “David will be fine. He just didn’t get the protection from the challenges. He had an elbow in the face, the boy went under him – it was bad.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">“It’s disappointing not ­getting the protection. But he’s at home on Monday, so we won’t have a problem. It’s just away from home he might be subjected to things like that.”</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">Fergie added: “Schmeichel did have the same baptism of fire.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">“At Wimbledon, he was squealing like a pig for ­protection. They were ­battering lumps out of him.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">“But David’s still young and remember Edwin van der Sar was a tall skinny kid when he won his first European Cup.”</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">Ashley Young’s acclimatisation with the champions has been more assured. He played a part in both goals in the 2-1 win at Albion to ­underline his potential for United.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">“He’s settled in quickly, some don’t,” Ferguson said. “It’s not fazed him coming here. He got the maturity last season, so it was a good time to buy him.”</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">While United face all their title challengers in the early weeks, Fergie contends neighbours City have a significantly less demanding programme.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">He said: “For some reason, City have come out at the right side of the easier games. All the other top teams have really tough games against each other.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">“If we get through this spell in a good position, we can kick on and be positive.”</p>

              <p>Evra battle in out with Lennon, nice to watch. I am not sure if Fabio or Smalling or Jones will play at RB, so whoever gets it, will have to shackle Bale on the left.I am sure fergie will ask Nani or Valencia to protect the RB, or assigned Park to do that role.</p>
              <p>I hope De Gea will not made any mistakes. if he continue to make mistakes, then united will have to outscore spurs to win. I am sure spurs defence cannot stop united from scoring, with Rooney helming the attack and Young on the left.</p>

Despite the challenge ahead, Tottenham will at least feel rested after a 5-0 amble against Hearts in the Europa League on Thursday.

              <p>The £17.8m keeper blundered in his first two games for Manchester United.</p>
              <p>And Assou-Ekotto said: "We will try to take advantage of these problems he's had. When you come to England you have to learn quickly how we play here.</p>
              <p>"It is never easy in the first six months."</p>
              <p>Spaniard De Gea, 20, is one of a handful of new signings in Alex Ferguson's squad this season.</p>
              <p>The United chief has also splashed out on defender Phil Jones and winger Ashley Young.</p>
              <p>But Cameroon full-back Assou-Ekotto insists that he is not losing any sleep over the prospect of facing £16m winger Young in tonight's Premier League showdown.</p>
              <p>He said: "We used to play against him when he was at Aston Villa and we did OK against him then.</p>
              <p>"So it will be the same against Manchester United - he's not better just because he has changed clubs.</p>
              <p>"Young and Nani are both good players, but they are still only human. I really don't care who I play against from Manchester United.</p>
              <p>"United have some injuries at the moment and I hope this will help us. But the problem with them is that even when they miss some players and don't play well, they are still good.</p>
              <p>"They never lose. The minimum they do is 0-0 or 1-1, but they don't lose. So it will not be easy for us."</p>

              <p>The old trafford audience was very kind to de gea this morning. They applauded at the most routine of saves and distribution. On the looks of this match, he looks really shaky man.....can't believe how he's the 18m buy.</p>
              <p>On a positive note, phil jones looked superb, fearless and accurate in his timing of tackles. Smalling played as right back...he looked really comfortable taking on defenders while on the overlap, quite surprising given that he only did the simple defending when he was playing in the centre. And 1 year back, who would have imagined that welbeck would be the star of a big match for man u. Before he went on loan, he and macheda both looked like aimless chickens running into the box.</p>
              <p>Entertaining match.</p>

              <p>Very entertaining and really great performance.<br><br>De Gea is still coping, but less mistakes this time. He's improving and a few more BPL games under his belt and he'll be good. Just nerves. At least he's yelling at people now and directing his back four around.<br><br>Jones, Welbeck, Smalling, Cleverly were really really great for me. Anderson was okay and he will need to perform better to hold a place because these kids were spectacular. The way they played yesterday reminded me why I love United so much, if only Sneijder was part of it, they would've spent 99% of the time in Tottenham's half lol.</p>
              <p>I think Macheda might go out on loan again before the transfer window closes.<br><br>All in all, really really good game, keep the momentum going into the next few games against Arsenal, Liverpool, Chelsea and City and there will be little to worry about when CL/FA/Carling games come into the picture.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Side note: VDS and wife was present at the game. Highly likely they're there to facilitate Sneijder and wife's move to England and of course United?</p>

              <p>Good match... Young and Jones are really great buys... Just glad we didn't lose them to Pool...</p>
              <p>Jones reminds me more of a Terry than Rio or Vidic... The only difference is he got good pace. He is brave, he tackles well... Can't belief he is only 19 man! I think Terry at 19 also wasn't good yet...</p>
              <p>De Gea had a better outing making decent stops only towards the last 20mins he spoilt his "better performance" by fumbling again but at least this time it isn't costly... Looking at <span style="color: #000000;">Brad Friedel at the opposite side, the way he plucks the ball out of the air seems routine man while De Gea makes it look so difficult...</span></p>
              <p>Also, Anderson is getting better too...</p>

              <p>Smalling played well in RB too. Both of them has good chemeisty  1 go attack the other stick well behind to cover.</p>

              <p>The block against Pavlyuchenko too after De Gea fumbled... That one also very good, he was very quick to react and brave to close him down and took the power shot from Pavlyuchenko right onto his body...</p>
              <p>And yeah, Young really good... Ever since he join the squad, he looks like he has been there for sometime kind... Totally not out of place and is a threat to opponents whenever he gets the ball... He is like, become the 2nd most dangerous player for United now after Rooney...</p>
              <p>Smalling not bad, has found himself a new position to add to his centre-midfield role...  </p>

              <p>spurs playing actually still not up to title challenger's standard. </p>
              <p>i believe man u will win.</p>
              <p>i hope spurs change a new and better manager.  redknapp is not the right man to bring them forward. spurs wont achieve anything substantial under him.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>He congratulated scott parker after the match for a tireless performance but me thinks he's just so so. Could have released a few killer passes in his position but he didn't. And that direct shot at serchessny shows he has little technique. Good work rate for a mid table team but definitely not a top class one.</p></div>
