              <h3>RIO FERDINAND is in a race against time to be fit for the England's next big games.</h3>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fabio Capello's captain has started rehabilitation work and light training ahead of schedule after the knee injury that kept him out of the team's disastrous World Cup.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But the centre-half will sit out the start of the Premier League season and could well miss the Euro 2012 qualifiers against Bulgaria and Switzerland in early September.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is good news Rio, 32, is back in training and does not need an op to repair ligament damage caused by a challenge in training with Emile Heskey.</p>
              <p>United boss Sir Alex Ferguson will take no chances with Rio on the club's pre-season tour to America if he thinks he needs more time to recover.</p>
              <p>Sources confirmed that Ferdinand had started work at United's Carrington training ground but that he expects to miss the first two or three club games of the season.</p>
              <p>That would make it hard for him to prove his form and fitness before England name their squad on August 28 or 29 for the Bulgaria and Switzerland games. The team will take on Bulgaria at Wembley on Friday, September 2, and then travel to Switzerland for the second game the following Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Before then, Wayne Rooney and the rest of England's World Cup underachievers will have had their first taste of any fan backlash.</p>
              <p>England will play Hungary in a friendly at Wembley on August 11, three days before the start of the Premier League season starts. The size and the attitude of the home crowd will give an indication of the level of disappointment among supporters after events in South Africa.</p>

              <p class="art-txt-first">Manchester United's Owen Hargreaves will miss the start of the season after suffering another setback following a series of knee problems.</p>
              <p>The England international midfielder, 29, made only one substitute appearance in the last campaign after an 18-month absence through injury.</p>
              <p>It was hoped he could join United on their summer tour - they leave for their training camp in Chicago on Monday - but instead he is having further treatment.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson told MUTV: "The bad news is that Owen Hargreaves is back in America seeing a specialist.</p>
              <p>"He will not be ready for the start of the season. I do not know when he will be back."</p>
              <p>Ferguson also fears Rio Ferdinand will not be ready for the first game of the season against Newcastle.</p>
              <p>The England defender suffered a knee injury in training ahead of the World Cup match with the United States and was unable to play in South Africa.</p>
              <p>Ferguson said: "Rio will probably not make the start of the season. It will be close. It depends on his progress over the next few weeks."</p>
              <p>While Ferguson is pleased with Michael Owen's progress following a hamstring injury the striker will skip the tour as he builds up his fitness.</p>
              <p>Ferguson said: "Michael is doing great. He is working in the gym every day. I do not think he will be fit to go to America but he should be ready for the start of the season."</p>
              <p>Antonio Valencia and Nani are expected to available for the Newcastle match, according to the Old Trafford boss, after suffering an ankle injury and broken collarbone respectively.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile Anderson is on course to return in September following a knee injury.</p>
              <p>Ferguson added: "Cruciates are cruciates. He is doing fine and working hard."</p>
