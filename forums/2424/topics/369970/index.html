Federico Macheda, Nicky Ajose and Oliver Norwood were all on the scoresheet as the Reds beat American side South Coast Bayern 3-0 in the final.<br><br>It's a measure of the tournament's standing that Macheda, who scored six goals in Northern Ireland, went on to make a crucial impact on last season's title race, while promising Reserves and Academy performances from Ajose and Norwood earned them professional contracts this summer.<br><br>McGuinness, who has taken in 12 new 16-year-old Academy recruits this year, may have a younger squad to work with as he attempts to retain the trophy.</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong>United have won the Milk Cup premier crown for the second year in a row after an impressive 2-0 win over Sheffield United at Coleraine Showgrounds.<br><br></strong>The prestigious youth tournament is a staple of United youth teams' pre-season preparations. And after wins over County Antrim (3-0), Club Cantalao (4-0), Desportivo Brasil (on penalties) and Fenerbahce 2-1, the Reds faced Sheffield United in the final.<br><br>The Blades are physical and predictably came quickly out of the traps. It was a nervy start for United, which is understandable on such an occasion, but once Paul McGuinness' charges settled they soon moved in front. An attack down the left midway through the half ended with captain Robbie Brady squaring the ball for Michael Ngoo, who kept his cool to stroke the ball into the back of the net.<br><br>Ngoo, a trialist from Southend, was involved in United's second as well, which arrived fifteen minutes from time. Latching onto a pass into the area, the tall attacker flicked the ball back for playmaking midfielder Etzaz Hussain to sidefoot in United's second.<br><br>The Blades pulled a goal back late on, though it was little more than a consolation - albeit deserved for their persistent effort. But United had done enough to retain the trophy.<br><br>McGuinness was delighted his side became the first to retain the trophy. "It's a great achievement," he said. "Quite a few of these players can come back next year, so maybe we'll make it three in a row. The conditions were difficult but we dealt with it well. The second goal was a magnificent team goal, so hopefully we entertained the crowd as well."</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong>Paul McGuinness has laid down the gauntlet to this year's crop of Under-18s: promising young players are given the chance at Old Trafford, now's the opportunity to show what you can do.<br><br></strong>His players have responded well so far, clinching the eminent Milk Cup youth tournament in Northern ireland on Friday, beating Sheffield United 2-1 in the final.<br><br>Last year in the competition, Federico Macheda scored six goals, including one in the final. McGuinness says he hardly needs to spell out what has happened to Kiko in the last year. But the Italian teenager has carved out a potential place among Sir Alex's four strikers.<br><br>"The examples are there in front of their own eyes – Macheda and Welbeck have both done well, but not only them, you’ve got Jonny Evans and Darron Gibson and a host of other young players working their way through the Reserves and towards the first-team," Paul told <strong>ManUtd.com</strong>.<br><br>“If you’re good enough, work hard enough and, most importantly, take your chance when it comes, you can be successful. The Milk Cup was a really good challenge against some very good teams, that’s the challenge we want for these boys."<br><br>United have taken on 12 first-year Academy scholars this year. So it will be a 'young' U18 side this season. That presents its own challenges, but McGuinness is excited by his current crop. "At this age, it’s natural you have a varied group in terms of their physical development. You balance training to suit that. We’ve concentrated on the football, they get their fitness from playing. Now we're ready for the start of the season."<br><br>The Reds kick off the Premier Academy League campaign against Southampton on Saturday 22 August.</p></div>
