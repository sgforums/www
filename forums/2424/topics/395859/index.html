              <p>United have O Shea as first choice RB, Wes Brown deputising, but he is always out injured. when O Shea was out, gary and rafael shared the workload, but due to rafael naivety, gary played and was exposed due to his lack of pace and age. Rafael is young and naive at 19, he got pace to burn, but his defending are as naive as his young age, not to mention his petulance and stupidity for kicking out and fouling, esp when he was already on a yellow. United need to invest and buy a new RB in the off season. also carrick time at united should be up, as he really gave the ball away and loses the ball in the middle of the field, exposing the back 4 to dangers.</p>

              <p>Yes, this is disappointing cause to score 3 and still lose @ home. but hopefully, this is a battle scar that young Rafael will learn and rapidly mature.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Yes, hope he learnt his lesson well, esp in an important match as this. He retaliated after being brought down for his first yellow. retaliation is even worse then fouls to the ref, so he must bear that in mind the next time he is fouled unfairly, just stand out and move on with the game. when you are on a yellow, even if you are being exposed, do not needlessly pull or tackle down the opponent. which is worse, conceded a goal or a man down? I prefer conceding a goal rather than a man less. with 11 men, there is every chance the team will be able to find an equaliser rather than having a player less.</p></div>

              <p>yes with hindsight. need to sink in the reality. when rafael was sent off, I knew bayern would come back and score 1 more to make it 4-4 on aggregate and going thru. my worst fears were realised even before the match, as I have a strong feeling there will be no english teams in the semi finals since 2002-2003 season.</p>

              <p>haha.. Micah to do a judas and move? Given Micah's physical power, why did he never figure regularly for England? Cause Micah's mental focus is poor, rem that led to MU's win over City when he went walkabout and Owen scored.</p>
              <p>No established defenders will come cheap, else they are too old. Maybe this WC may bring one or two surprises but I don't have high hopes. Out of the names U listed, Rafael has the potential to do well. He reminds me of Evra, his speed, dribbling, and willing to attack, but at times, he tries to do too much. Hence he needs to have an old wise head to show him, none better than GaryNeville.</p>
              <p>Seemingly, there are too many holes to plug @ MU at the moment, RB is not the top priority.  IMHO, getting MU back from a one-rooney team to a multiple scoring team is key.</p>

              <p>I think fergie will buy big after the world cup. I think he is
              targeting benzema and angel di maria. if both come next season,
              united will be very strong. sell berbatov and carrick to recoup
              some money for the purchases.</p>

              <p>Might be too late after the WC. Prices will soar by then.</p>
              <p>And you should know money has been a touchy issue of late at Old Trafford. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="icon_sad.gif"></p>
