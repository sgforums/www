              <p>tevez out ron out.. hmm.. can we survive next season? hargreaves when u comin back? nani, can he step up? bbt, can pre-trng season make him thhe key man to watch next season?</p>
              <p>do we need a striker for replacement or can we be contented with macheda and welbeck?</p>
              <p>then perhaps we need a winger? ribery? silva? quaresma? personally, i prefer if we look for english lads then perhaps lennon/downing/bentley? i think with man utd style and training, these players can fit in, if not immediately, then gradually.. im a fave bentley fan but not his attitude..</p>

              <p>something looks wrong in the fact where:</p>
              <p>of course assuming there are many articles discussing his move to madrid, in which, of course, many are inaccurate. now to point out the problem with the article's argument:</p>
              <p>Ronaldo made his feelings clear to those close to him
                                      as recently as last Saturday</p>

              <p>seeing that ronaldo refuses to make a public statement, why would his close ones do so?</p>

              <p>If it's true then he'll regret it in a year or two to come. Teams are looking at him as "worth it to have" rather than "worth it to keep". Which is what SAF is offering him, a good home to grow in.</p>
              <p>When shit happens, RM will sell him to cover losses/profit. Win so many things also so what, might as well retire early if that's the case. Real achievements come with time.</p>
              <p>He's one hell of a player, but I dislike him as a person.</p>

              <h1>Here's a real deal, Ronaldo... there's history to be made at United.</h1>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Should he stay or should he go? Ronaldo has unfinished business at United - even if Sir Alex Ferguson's side triumph in Rome</em></p>
              <p class="article-icon-links-container"> </p>
              <p class="article-icon-links-container"> </p>
              <p><strong>At </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span></a><strong>, as long as Sir Alex Ferguson remains manager, there will always be something for which to aim. A fresh peak, a new page in the history book. That is why, as we prepare to enter another Cristiano Ronaldo debating season, the one argument that can be discounted is that he has done all he can at his present club.</strong></p>
              <p>Ronaldo insists he will be staying, yet the rumours persist. Certainly, there are a number of men who stand to make many millions if they can facilitate the deal that takes him to Real Madrid, and who therefore have a vested interest in perpetuating the idea that he is unsettled, even if it is untrue.</p>
              <p>Yet why should he not wish to do another year at Old Trafford. Indeed, why would he not do another 10? This time last season, the speculation was that Ronaldo wanted to go out on the high of winning the first all-English European Cup final, as if nothing could beat that. Now here we are, 12 months on, and Manchester United stand on the brink of an even greater achievement: to be the first club to retain the trophy in its modern, Champions League, format. First, they must overcome Barcelona, who have been laying waste to their own record books in Spain.</p>
              <p class="imageCaption">Top that? Well, incredibly, United could if next season they become the only English club to win four straight league titles. This would bring their total to 19, the most to be won (although <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Liverpool</span></a> are now claiming two wartime titles to take their total to 20, which seems even more desperate than some of Rafael Benitez’s most recent press conference pronouncements). For this team, at this unique moment in history, there is always a new milestone to be passed. In the excitement at theprospect of United retaining the Champions League, it has almost been overlooked that this season they have become the first club to win three consecutive league titles over two periods in history.</p>
              <p>Real Madrid have won the Spanish league five times on the turn, so too Juventus and Torino in Italy and Porto in Portugal, but three has long been the ceiling in the English game. HuddersfieldTown, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/arsenal.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Arsenal</span></a> and Liverpool have done it, and United twice. And, of course, it is hard for somebody from outside the country to be responsive to the saga of the English game spanning three centuries, but every time Ronaldo stepped on the field this season, each time he helped Manchester United to victory, he was becoming part of England’s sporting folklore.</p>
              <p>That will be true next season, too, if he can inspire a fourth triumph. With the exception of The Wednesday, every English league champion is still a member of the English league, and bearing the same name, today. Yet none have won it four times consecutively. And, yes, football clubs are about more than black and white columns in books on dusty shelves, they are about people and passion and the emotion Ronaldo clearly experiences when he thinks of Real Madrid.</p>
              <p>Yet he may wish to consider why he felt that way, as a boy growing up in Funchal, on the island of Madeira; why he was bewitched by a club that played in a foreign league, in a foreign city, over 900 miles away. And the answer would be that he fell in love with their history, with their achievement, with the legends of special players and special football.</p>
              <p>And, if he would only realise, that is what he is creating at Manchester United now. It is why Ronaldo’s work is not yet done, even if he leaves Rome triumphant once more.</p>

              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson insists that Cristiano Ronaldo will remain at Old Trafford for another season, after further intense speculation over a renewed £70million bid from Real Madrid for the FIFA World Player of the Year.</strong></p>
              <p>But Manchester United's manager is resigned to the probable departure of Carlos Tevez following Wednesday's titanic Champions League final against Barcelona in Rome.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/05/23/article-0-05113348000005DC-700_468x571.jpg" alt="So long: Cristiano Ronaldo appears to be staying at Old Trafford but doubts remain about but Carlos Tevez" width="468" height="571">

              <h4>Ferguson, eager to avoid a repeat of last year's 'will he, won't he?' farce over the future of his Portugal star, yesterday dismissed reports that Wednesday will be Ronaldo's last game for United before he departs for new challenges at the Bernabeu.</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With his team on the verge of an unprecedented quadruple after winning the World Club Cup, the Premier League and the Carling Cup, Ferguson is confident that United's extraordinary success will keep Ronaldo at Old Trafford.</p>
              </div>
              <p>'All I can say is that he has given no indication that he wants to go,' said Ferguson. 'He's happy and relaxed and so am I. And there hasn't been a whisper of contact from Real.'</p>
              <p>But Ferguson is resigned to losing Tevez, despite persistent demands from sections of the Old Trafford crowd that the Argentina striker should be persuaded to stay.</p>
              <p>'It is a difficult situation which we are still trying to sort out,' said Ferguson.'There's not a lot we can do if he decides to go. It will depend on which club can offer the deal his representatives are looking for.'</p>
              <p>Kia Joorabchian, who represents the offshore companies who own the player's economic rights, wants £25million for the player to sign a new contract at the end of his two-year loan deal. United are unwilling to pay that price at a time of such financial constraint.</p>
              <p>Ferguson's optimism over Ronaldo appeared to be supported by an interview the player gave last night. Ronaldo said of the burning question regarding his future at United: 'My heart is here. This is my home now.</p>
              <p>'I think even when I say my heart is here, people are still going to speak and make things up. But this is where I want to play. We are part of an era that can go down in history for the way we are playing and for the trophies we are winning. The boss believes in this team and so do I.</p>
              <p>'And this is where I want to be. Manchester United is now my house. 'Ever since I joined United the manager has been like a father to me.</p>
              <p>'No matter how good I become, I know he is a man who will always be able to teach me that little bit more. And I don't just respect him, I have the affection for him a child has for his father. 'When he gives me advice that is non-football, listen because it will make me a better person.'</p>
              <p>Ronaldo, looking forward to a showpiece European final 'between the two best teams in the world', added: We are full of confidence and believe we can be the first team to win the Champions League back to back.'</p>
