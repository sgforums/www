              <p>Congrats to chelsea, the rightful winner of the 2009/2010 season for winning against home and away over the other so called top 3 sides and also for recording the most goals in a season.</p>
              <p>United did well, considering this is the season wihout ronaldo and tevez, not to mention the injury crisis in December when fletcher and carrick were made to help out in defence in the 3-0 mauling by fulham.</p>
              <p>I believe there will be another 1-2 signings in the off season and maybe 1-2 players will be sold. next season we will aim for the 19 titles that will overtake liverpool and also to win the CL.</p>

              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson was gracious but defiant after seeing his hopes of a fourth consecutive title crushed by Carlo Ancelotti's free-scoring Chelsea side.</strong><br><br>United's title rivals beat Wigan Athletic 8-0 home, to render academic the Reds' own emphatic victory, 4-0 over Stoke City on the Old Trafford turf.<br><br>"I didn't know what the Chelsea score was [during the second half] to be honest. But at half-time I accepted the fact they were going to be champions," Sir Alex told MUTV.<br><br>Gary Caldwell's red card and Frank Lampard's subsequent penalty conversion to put Chelsea 2-0 up after 32 minutes meant the rest of the afternoon's activity in West London and Manchester was largely a formality.<br><br>"We felt it would be difficult for Wigan to get something at Stamford Bridge and when we heard they were down to ten men, all our hopes evaporated then," admitted Sir Alex.<br><br>"We applaud Chelsea in winning the title. We know hard it is to win it - it's the hardest league in the world and we've won it for the last three. I congratulate Carlo Ancelotti on a wonderful achievement. He's a good manager and a good guy."<br><br>Sir Alex will swiftly turn his thoughts to challenging Chelsea for the 2010/11 championship.<br><br>"We won the last three titles before this one. That was fantastic and the players have been great. We'll come back next year, that's exactly what Manchester United do."<br><br>Earlier, the</p>
              <p>manager went on the pitch for the traditional end-of-season speech to the Old Trafford crowd.<br><br>"The players and the supporters have always been magnificent and you've been magnificent again," he said.<br><br>"I think we can be proud that we've challenged hard for a fourth title in a row. Next season we'll go again and bring back the title to the best place in the world."</p>

              <p>need to buy another 2-3 more players but also need to rid of 1-2 players as well. I think carrick and berbatov time is up. this season their form were bad and its time to cash in on them to finance for new players. carrick can get at least 10-12m and berbatov at least 15-18m, as both are 29 before they hit the wrong side of 30 next year.</p>

              <p>Sum up Man U's performance:</p>
              <p>Don't mention about dropping unnecessary dropping points. It was frustrated to drop points, but they had tried the best to shorten the lead when Chelsea dropped points.</p>
              <p>Despite defesnsive crisis, Man U still conceded the less amount of goals in BPL. Once again, they kept the cleansheet yesterdat. If Owen not facing long-term injury, things might be better for Man U.</p>

              <p>soccor is a about sportmanship . but some behave like monkeys
              like to blame this like to blame that. when lose a game</p>
              <p>im sure hope MU get a challenge from other team, and we get to
              see a good battle the next season.</p>
              <p>liverpool will be up to top 4 and let hope that they get their

              <p>no offense here. but given U talk about sportmanship, it is also not nice, names-calling. Most Fans are always ike that, we like to analyse games, and put our opinions. But we certainly don't deserve to be called "monkeys".</p>
              <p>Thanks. Again, no offense.</p>

              <p>hi, given how SAF keep reminding us that MU has got smalling and that mexican stiker, plus diouf, is that meaning MU has got their transfer plans sewed up? And MU do have both Owens making their comebacks, joining our experienced but ageing scholes, giggs N neville.</p>
              <p>Granted, MU did suffer when their established back four plus GK was disrupted, it was still Rooney's impact at the crucial time that break the momentum.</p>
              <p>hope that MU can address that and not march down the path of one man team like pool with torres.</p>

              <p>I believe Fergie has a good enough track record to prove to you that he is one of the best scouts for talent out there. There is no 'going back to the days', because every once in awhile, it might not work out.</p>
              <p>The same can be said for Ronaldo what, the first few years, everyone was laughing at him, doing stupid tricks, always fucking up. What did Fergie say? Give the boy time, and look what happened.</p>
              <p>In the case of Berba, I actually hope he stays for one more season, instead of going for goal, his role should just be supplying balls to others that are more capable of scoring goals.</p>
