            <div class='col-md body'>Sir Alex Ferguson has urged Manchester United not to rely on old rivals Arsenal doing them a title favour this weekend.<br><br>If the Gunners beat Chelsea at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday, United would be crowned champions providing they had collected at least a point from the Manchester derby at City 24 hours earlier.<br><br>The scenario is wholly plausible given the tiredness Chelsea have been showing in recent weeks and the desire of Arsene Wenger's men to at least end a difficult campaign on a high note.<br><br>But equally, Ferguson is aware that if his own side suffer a fourth defeat in five trips to their neighbours this weekend, they will offer Chelsea an opportunity to seize the initiative by beating Arsenal to set up a decisive meeting with United at Stamford Bridge next Wednesday.<br><br>Having abandoned plans to fly to Zaragoza in order to watch young defender Gerard Pique in action for the La Liga outfit, Ferguson probably will now watch the action unfold at Arsenal on television.<br><br>However, the Scot is eager to ensure his own side do their jobs properly rather than plunge him into a situation where he is left to cross his fingers for a favour from Wenger.<br><br>"The name of the game for us is to win our games, that is the only way we can think," said Ferguson.<br><br>"We cannot rely on anyone else. That would be the wrong attitude. I don't know what Chelsea are going to do but if we lose tomorrow and they win their last three games, they will win the league. That is why all we should do is concentrate on beating City."<br><br>Ferguson is still assessing potential changes to his starting line-up, with Rio Ferdinand, Alan Smith, Louis Saha and Patrice Evra all likely to be involved after missing the crushing Champions League semi-final defeat to AC Milan.<br><br>Although it could be argued the hype surrounding a derby clash is exactly what United need to aid their recovery from their dismal showing in the San Siro, Ferguson feels history suggests his team would bounce back strongly no matter what the opposition.<br><br>"No-one likes to lose, especially in the semi-final of a European tie," he said.<br><br>"But it is something we have experienced before. Footballers have defeats, you have to recover from them. Historically, during my time here, we have done that very well.<br><br>"The players know City will want to put one over on us and try to prevent us winning the league.<br><br>"But these are all things that make it a bigger incentive for us."<br><br>United's chances appear to have received a significant lift by the midweek training-ground scrap that has cost City the services of both Joey Barton and Ousmane Dabo.<br><br>With takeover speculation continuing to rumble on and a chronic lack of home goals which will ensure the Blues enter the record books for the lowest number in a Premiership season if they fail to score, City appear to be there for the taking.<br><br>However, as Ferguson has found out to his cost on too many occasions, the Blues can be difficult opponents to overcome.<br><br>"A derby game is never easy," he said.<br><br>"You cannot legislate for some of the things that happen in them.<br><br>"I don't pay a lot of attention to what is happening at City but I don't think it will affect the players that Barton is missing.<br><br>"Once the game starts, what has happened during the week will be lost to them and whoever replaces Barton will be delighted to be playing."<br><br>With their treble hopes gone, Ferguson's team are refocusing on what would be a fourth domestic double.<br><br>And, although the disappointment of their failure to cope with Milan will linger for some time, the United boss is not straying from his pre-season assertion that any season which brings some silverware can be regarded as successful.<br><br>"It is difficult to prioritise competitions given the way our league is," he said.<br><br>"You just hope at the end of the campaign you come out with some silverware. If you win one trophy you should be delighted."</div>
