              <p>Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson has revealed that he is
              surprised by the dismissal from his post today of Chelsea manager Luiz
              Felipe Scolari.</p>
              <p>Chelsea this afternoon confirmed that they had sacked the Brazilian,
              who had overseen something of a slump in form, especially at home, that
              looks like it might prove terminal as far as the Blues' title challenge
              is concerned.</p>
              <p>One might expect the Red Devils' manager, famed for his use of
              psychology and the underhand dark arts of 'mind games', to be rubbing
              his hands with glee as he watches one of United's main rivals for the
              Premier League crown implode.</p>
              <p>Instead, the wily Scotsman, speaking to Manchester United's official
              website, appears surprised by the Chelsea board's decision, especially
              given the Brazilian's relatively brief time at the club.</p>
              <p>"I'm very surprised. It's a shock that one. He only took the job seven months ago," said Ferguson.<br><br>"Scolari's
              a man of great experience. He took Brazil to the World Cup final and
              won it and he was the obvious choice to replace Avram Grant seven
              months ago."</p>
              <p>And the sacking was held up by Ferguson as further evidence of the
              creeping malaise of impatience that is currently infecting football as
              well as society at large.</p>
              <p>"Really it's a sign of the times, I'm afraid. There's absolutely no patience in the world today," he added.</p>
              <p>"Football seems more volatile now. You can't always blame the press
              but they play a part. The way tabloid journalism is today, they're
              competing against the internet, they're competing against <em>Sky News</em> so therefore there is sensationalism every time there's a bad result. We've all been subjected to that over the years."</p>
              <p>Ferguson also pointed to the brief time that Chelsea had actually
              struggled whilst Scolari was at the helm, another factor in the sacking
              that he found surprising.<br><br>"Having lost the European Cup final,
              there were still expectations for Chelsea to do well this year. It's
              really only in the last month that they've had a bad spell. So I
              feel the judgement [to sack Scolari] is really based on the last month,
              not the previous six months. It is a surprise," he concluded.</p>
