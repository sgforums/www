            <div class='col-md body'>Cristiano RonaldoÂ’s growing list of admirers got longer after his starring role in UnitedÂ’s 2-0 victory over Newcastle on Sunday.<br><br>The Magpies appeared powerless to prevent RonaldoÂ’s rampaging runs down the left and Newcastle right-back Stephen Carr was at a loss as to how to stop his skill and trickery.<br><br>Magpies boss Glenn Roeder had nothing but sympathy for Carr and praise for the 21-year-old Reds winger, who he says is as dangerous as Thierry Henry and Wayne Rooney when on top form.<br><br>"Everyone, and I mean everyone, is finding it hard to cope with Cristiano Ronaldo," he said. "He picks up pace so quickly he could be an athlete. I certainly would not like to be a full-back trying to stop him.<br><br>"Along with Wayne Rooney and Thierry Henry, he is undoubtedly one of the most dangerous players in the Premiership,Â” he added.<br><br>"He doesn't appear to have been bothered by anything that went on during the World Cup and it's amazing to think he's going to get even better."<br><br>Cool!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>stop the diving, less selfish makes him a more complete and better player. now he gotta learn how to cross more accurately and higher too. i notice that his corners are always cleared by the first man. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, there is alway room for improvements... He is already better than last season at least from the looks of things currently... and he don't hold up the ball for too long too nowadays.<br><br>He don't dive in the EPL these days too, i don't recall him diving last year. He only do it when he goes back to the Portugal team... Anyway, he is united's best player so far this season...</div>

"We were conscious before the game a win would take us back to the top and we are top of the Champions League and things are going well.<br><br>Ronaldo has won high praise this term and Carrick feels the Portuguese winger could be the man to help him fulfil his dreams.<br><br>"Cristiano is on fire, he improving all the time," declared Carrick.

            <div class='col-md body'>he is indeed less selfish. more willing to create chances. but his crossing and free kicks and corners need alot more work. and he shld stop diving cos if u have a clean reputation, refs will tend to award u freekicks and penalties whereas if u are a diver, refs will tend to be biased, even when its a clear foul</div>
