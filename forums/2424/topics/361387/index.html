              <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br> <br> Manchester United's defender Patrice Evra and Ji Sung Park are best
                  friends. Not only on the pitch but more noteably off the pitch, as Evra
                  frequently likes to visit Park. The interaction between them has
                  brought the pair closer together, almost like brothers. Evra even calls
                  Park's father, Park Sung Jong, Papa. Living in England, the two players
                  have become very dependent on each other as they overcame their
                  difficluties together. Park Sung Jong now reveals the untold stories of
                  the pair.<br> <br> Park Sung Jong-<br> <br> When utd have a game abroad our house becomes a gathering point.
                  Because the parking is expensive at the airport, several players come
                  to our house so that they can catch a ride from me to the airport. Pat,
                  Carlito, VDS, and Berba are the usual customers as well as Ji. I always
                  get nervous when I drive them because I'm escorting a team of
                  superstars and their combined cost is over 40 million!! Therefore, I
                  have to always be alert and at my best and try not to think about
                  crashing! But Evra is always at my side cracking his usual jokes and
                  that gets rid of any worries. When we won the EPL ,Evra was the first
                  one to come and hug me and my wife and take a picture with us. Also, he
                  always calls me papa. Thats how close we are, like a family.<br> <br> Evra is a French international, but he is actually from Senegal. He
                  grew up in the back streets of Les Ulis, a place populated with
                  gangsters. However, it was football that prevented Evra from going down
                  that road. I think Theirry Henry was from that region too.<br> <br> Evra and Park are of same age. Evra is a bit more sociable than Ji, but
                  both don't talk much and both are introspective. Whether its Ruud Van
                  Nistelrooy of the past or Edwin Van der Sar of today, most of Ji's
                  friends are from abroad, outside of Uk. British players usually hang
                  out with each other and so the foreign players usually cluster together
                  and depend upon each other.<br> <br> Two years ago in the summer of 2007, during the Asian Tour, Evra was
                  able to visit Korea. The day before the game, he came over to our house
                  in Suwon. In Machester, he always asked us if he could vist our home in
                  Korea if he had the chance. Therefore, he seized the opportunity when
                  utd came to Korea to come and visit us. Not only did he look around our
                  house, but he also begged Ji if he could take him to a nightclub in
                  Seoul. Ji had never been to a night club in his life until the day he
                  gave in to Evra's wishes.<br> <br> Evra and Ji first met not as friends but as enemies back in 2005. They
                  clashed in the round of 16 in the Champions League, Park playing for
                  PSV and Evra playing for AS Monaco. In the two legs, Ji played on the
                  right side of midfield and Evra played as left back and so both of them
                  were frequently in battle. Eventually, PSV won both games 1-0 and 2-0.
                  Evra sometimes reminisces about that game. He joked "I had my butt
                  kicked around all night by Ji and so I didn't really feel like being
                  friends with him." "I held a grudge over him." Surprisingly, both Ji
                  and Evra remember that game very well. I believe it was destiny for
                  both of them to become best friends.<br> <br> When Evra first arrived back in January of 2006, he had difficulties
                  adjusting to the team. At that time, Mikael Silvestre and Gabriel
                  Heinze cemented their places ahead of Evra and there was no room for
                  Evra to break through. Whenever he had the chance to play, he made
                  mistakes and that cost him his place. He was so into attacking that he
                  sometimes forgot his defensive duties and left his marker free to roam.
                  Unfortunately, he was dubbed the "full back that never returns" by some
                  sections of utd fans. During those difficlut periods, it was Ji that
                  consoled Evra and gave him a shoulder to lean on. Ji told Evra about
                  the difficult times he experienced back in Netherlands and tried to
                  give him the confidence that he needed.<br> <br> We became even closer friends with Evra when we moved right next to his
                  house on February, 2007. Whenever Evra's wife, Patricia (funny Evra's
                  first name is Patrice and his wife's first name is Patricia), takes her
                  kids to visit relatives in France, Evra comes to our house and settles
                  in as if it is his home. Sometimes, he invites Ji to his house and they
                  spend time together. I think thats how Evra repays the kindness Ji has
                  given him. When Ji had a surgery on his left ankle, I remember Evra
                  writing a get well message on his cast. When Ji had a surgery on his
                  right knee in the Spring of 2007, Evra dedicated the goal he scored in
                  the 7-1 thrashing of Roma to Ji.<br> <br> Evra's father lives in Dakar, Senegal. Evra says that, because his
                  father married so many times, whenever he goes back to his home town,
                  there is an Evra here, an Evra there and Evra Evra everyhwere. Evra's
                  father usually stays in Senegal, but he came to visit Manchester one
                  day. Evra was so excited about the prospect of playing in front of his
                  father at Old Trafford. However, Ferguson decided to put Evra on the
                  bench and after the game Evra was extremely upset. He held his anger
                  inside but when he got home he exploded. He screamed and started
                  throwing things to the ground. It was obvious he wanted to make his
                  father proud. I looked and Evra and thought "what if that happened to
                  Ji?" Ji rarely reveals his feelings in front of me. He usually hides
                  it. However, I could tell he was extremely disappointed when he missed
                  out on the chance to play in the CL final last year. Sometimes, I wish
                  Ji would be more expressive of his feelings like Evra.<br> <br> Last year, we moved into the house Evra used to live. It is three
                  stories with seven rooms. Evra also moved about 3-4 minutes away from
                  our house. When Ji goes to training, he and Evra usually share a car.
                  One day it wiil be Ji driving and the next day it is Evra. When
                  training is over, the two of them sometimes go to a Korean restaurant
                  to eat.<br> <br> Evra's love for Utd is strong. He got a highly profitable offer from
                  Inter Milan but he immediately turned it down. Whenever he plays a
                  football video game with Ji, I have never seen him select a team other
                  than Utd.<br> <br> Now they are in the CL final together again. A few days ago, Evra told
                  Ji "Hey friend, last year we didnt get to play with each other, but
                  this time lets do this together. Remeber, if either of us score, we
                  must celebrate together. Evra is a really good friend of Ji.</p>
