              <p><strong>Ji-sung Park insists United will head
              into tonight's Champions League final with more belief than Chelsea
              after pipping them to the Premier League title.</strong></p>
              <p>Chelsea
              goalkeeper Petr Cech suggested an edge may be missing from the Reds’
              game in Moscow following the title triumph, but Park reckons it will
              have the opposite effect.</p>
              <p>The Korean midfielder declared: “We are
              far more confident after winning the title. Having lost the league,
              that might make a difference to Chelsea.</p>
              <p>“We’ve done one job and everyone feels good – now we’re looking forward to the final.”</p>
              <p>Park
              was a Champions League semi-finalist with PSV Eindhoven in 2005 and has
              impressed for United since returning from injury at Christmas, yet he
              admits still has his doubters – although Sir Alex Ferguson isn’t one of
              them.</p>
              <p>The Reds boss paid a glowing tribute to his livewire
              winger’s professionalism last week and said he had a “big chance” of
              being in the side on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Park continued: “I proved my
              ability with PSV but some people still think Asian players aren’t good
              enough to play in Europe. For me it’s always challenging to prove them
              wrong.</p>
              <p>“When I first came to United I had to prove my ability. Now everyone knows I’m not just here to sell shirts!</p>
              <p>“I wasn’t playing at the start of the season because of my injury,
              so that made it hard.  But since I have been back I have improved and
              now I feel 100 per cent. I’m enjoying playing with my team-mates and I
              am so happy to be in the team.”</p>
              <p>Park is his country’s number one
              sportsman but insists the thought of performing in front of millions of
              fans back home won’t affect him come kick-off in the Luzhniki Stadium.</p>
              <p>“It’s
              a huge game and most Korean people will be watching on television, even
              though the game will be on in the early hours of the morning,” he said.</p>

              <h1>Park Ji-Sung: Fergie Said Sorry</h1>
              <h2>After his surprise decision to leave Park Ji-sung out of the squad
              for Wednesday's UEFA Champions League final victory against Chelsea in
              Moscow, Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson apologised to the
              player.</h2>
              <p>The South Korean watched from the sidelines as the English champions defeated the London club after a penalty shootout.</p>
              <p>After appearing in every minute of United’s quarter and semi-final
              matches, it was expected that Park would play at least some part in
              Moscow.  </p>
              <p>“I was told that I wouldn’t be playing just before the match,” Park told South Korean television.</p>
              <p>“After the manager announced the team he told me that he was sorry that he hadn’t selected me.”</p>
              <p>The 27 year-old was philosophical about the decision.</p>
              <p>“The team won so I am happy. Personally it is frustrating not to play in such a big game but there will be other opportunities.”</p>
