              Sir Alex Ferguson is debating whether to hand Federico Macheda his first Premier League start at Middlesbrough.
              
              The Italian teenager has enjoyed an explosive beginning to his United career, scoring winning goals against Aston Villa and Sunderland on his first two substitute appearances.
              
              Although the 17-year-old was not quite as impressive when Ferguson handed him his first senior start in the FA Cup semi-final defeat to Everton earlier this month, the former Lazio trainee is a player of immense promise.
              
              Now Ferguson is considering whether to hand Macheda a start against Boro as he looks to use the full depth of his squad in a week where the battle with Liverpool for the Premier League title - which United lead by three points - is just edged out in importance by a Champions League semi-final with Arsenal.
              
              "I was delighted with Macheda's performance at Wembley," Ferguson insisted. "Playing your first full game somewhere like that is very difficult but he has done fantastically well.
              
              "I am trying to ensure both Federico and Danny Welbeck feel wanted because they both have the physical strength to cope and they will be involved tomorrow."
              
              Paul Scholes, Park Ji-sung and Ben Foster, all unused substitutes in Wednesday's win over the Gunners, are set to be included, along with Nani, who did not make the bench.
              
              Wes Brown will also be drafted into a squad almost certainly denied the services of Rio Ferdinand with a rib injury.
              
              Macheda offers a vision of the future, his last-gasp strike to overcome Villa contending with Wayne Rooney's Champions League hat-trick against Fenerbahce in 2004 as one of the best debut performances Ferguson has ever seen.
              
              "I don't think I have ever seen a better debut goal than that," said Ferguson. "For a young lad of 17 to come on and score a great goal like that was incredible.
              
              "I don't think you can match scoring a hat-trick as Wayne did. But the difference was he had a bit of experience with Everton and England prior to that. Macheda had none.
              
              "He has the instinct of knowing what to do and when to do it. Against Villa he did not just score, he made an impact on the game with his general play. He has certainly proved he is ready."

              With Sir Alex Ferguson looking to shuffle his pack for Saturdayâ€™s lunch-time trip to Middlesbrough, two of United's most promising young talents will hope to get their chance to shine.
              
              It's not so much been glimpses of promise from Danny Welbeck and Federico Macheda as headline-grabbing heroics. Macheda hit the back pages with recent match-winners against Aston Villa and Sunderland, while Welbeck hit a goal-of-the-season contender on his league bow against Stoke, adding two more in the FA Cup.
              
              Both could be in contention for the crucial league match against Middlesbrough this weekend, as Sir Alex looks to rest players ahead of Tuesday's Champions League semi-final, second leg against Arsenal.
              
              â€œTheyâ€™ve both been fantastic,â€� says the boss of Macheda and Welbeck, who have been the discoveries of the season. â€œIâ€™m trying to keep them happy and feeling wanted as first-team players, which is what they are now.
              
              â€œI think they have the quality and physical strength to do it, but it's not easy because when it comes to big games, players start to get fit again. Big games bring out the best of people in terms of not being injured, believe me!â€�
              
              Welbeck, 18, and Macheda, 17, didnâ€™t make the bench for Arsenal match on Wednesday, but they could play a vital role on Teesside, either from the start or as a substitute.
              
              â€œItâ€™s been very difficult with seven substitutes, and everyone available, and I've tried to use one or the other as one of my options. We were delighted with their performances at Wembley against Everton,â€� added Sir Alex. â€œThey have both done really well and they could be involved on Saturday.â€�
