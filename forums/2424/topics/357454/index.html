              Rio Ferdinand is fit for Saturday's tea-time clash with Tottenham, while Rafael will start at right-back following injuries to Gary Neville and John O'Shea.
              
              Ferdinand was rested in Wednesday's win over Portsmouth after playing for 120 minutes in the FA Cup semi-final. The 30-year-old has struggled with a groin problem, but he is to be recalled into the starting line-up.
              
              "After extra time at Wembley, we felt it was best to rest Rio," said the boss. "Jonny Evans never lets us down, so we did the sensible thing in resting Rio. We have Tottenham, a European tie against Arsenal on Wednesday, a Saturday lunchtime kick-off against Middlesbrough, then Arsenal again the following Tuesday.
              
              "Itâ€™s a run of games in which we donâ€™t take chances. Hopefully we manage the whole thing without killing ourselves in terms of players playing too much.â€�
              
              Reds skipper Gary Neville will miss the next two weeks after hobbling out of the Pompey victory with a foot injury. However, there's better news for John O'Shea, who came on for Neville but was later forced off.
              
              "Oâ€™Sheaâ€™s injury isn't as bad as we thought," Sir Alex added. "We sent him for a scan, which came back all clear. He trained on Friday, which is good. We were surprised because when it happened (a tackle from Belhadj) I thought it was a bad one. Fortunately, itâ€™s not serious."
              
              Wes Brown may be included in the squad after coming through his second Reserves game on Thursday. â€œWes played and did OK. Itâ€™s a bit early for him to start a match, but itâ€™s good that heâ€™s back. We've had a great deal of trouble at right back this season. Now we have Wes and young Rafael available. Rafa did well against Portsmouth and he'll start against Tottenham."
              
              United are three points clear in the title race, but Spurs are the league's form team and Sir Alex isn't underestimating the threat posed by his old friend Harry Redknapp.
              
              â€œItâ€™s another hard game," he said. "At this time of the season you donâ€™t get easy games. Harry has got Spurs settled down now. Heâ€™s used his experience and his eye for the right players has always been good. There is a consistency about Tottenham now. Theyâ€™re difficult to beat and theyâ€™re pushing for a European place.
              
              â€œWeâ€™re in a better position today than we were last Friday. But you see the road ahead and it is tricky. Every game is hard now; credit to the league, you never get an easy game. So the only way to deal with it is focus on each match as it comes along, which is what we will do against Tottenham. Hopefully that gets us where we want to be.
              
              â€œAt this stage of the season you play a game and itâ€™s whittled off the list. If you win, itâ€™s a real bonus for you. Itâ€™s an advantage of one less game.â€�

              he is good on the ball, composed and is quick. He is good header of the ball and is tall too and tackle well.
              
              One of the best defenders in the world if not the best.
