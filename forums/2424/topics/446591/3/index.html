              <p>This win is really very sweet I don't know why really... Cos it's not that Pool are fighting us for the title or anything but somehow the dislike towards them just grew in the last year.</p>
              <p>In the past, when we dislike a club, cos they were fighting us for the title kind or chelsea had a manager that create trouble where ever he goes kind, so it's understandable. But now I kind of like chelsea thesedays and somehow dislike Pool very much even though they are not a direct threat to us...</p>
              <p>I be very frank, I don't dislike City as much either even though I think they will win the league title tis year from us...</p>
              <p>It's weird right... lol. But it think Pool isn't one of the most likeable clubs today. In fact i think they are the ones that most people want to dislike nowaday even though they are not winning the league... It's very weird, this Suarez incident along with kenny's behaviour has really damage their club good name...</p>

              <p>yes he was pissed with the interviewer continually asking him the same qns on Suarez refusal to shake Evra hands, coupled with the loss. The stress must have gotten to him that he said what he said yesterday. the whole sorry affair will not cast a good light on liverpool and the way he is still defending Suarez.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 1.05em; FONT-SIZE: 1.05em">MANCHESTER UNITED'S tunnel bust-up with Liverpool on Saturday was sparked by a spitting storm.</h2>
              <p>United keeper David De Gea was spat at as he walked to the Old Trafford dressing room at half-time.</p>
              <p>Players from both sides had to be parted by stewards as the explosive confrontation threatened to escalate into a full-on brawl.</p>
              <p>Police became involved in an effort to calm tensions and keep the feuding sides apart following an explosive first 45 minutes, which saw Luis Suarez refuse to shake the hand of Patrice Evra before kick-off.</p>
              <p>It is unclear who was responsible for the spitting but a source said: "De Gea was making his way to the tunnel and was clearly shocked to be spat at.</p>
              <p>"Obviously the players reacted angrily and both teams became involved, before stewards managed to quieten it down."</p>
              <p>Tempers were frayed again at the end of United's 2-1 victory when Liverpool substitute Craig Bellamy got involved in a confrontation with the Old Trafford head of security as players left the pitch.</p>
