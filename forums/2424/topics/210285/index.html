            <div class='col-md body'>Michael Carrick believes he is going to learn plenty by playing alongside Paul Scholes.<br><br>Although Carrick produced an effective performance on his Champions League debut against Celtic last night, the Â£18.6million midfield man was overshadowed not just by two-goal hero Louis Saha but Scholes as well.<br><br>Just like Wayne Rooney, Scholes has spent the past three weeks kicking his heels in frustration after being banned for his pre-season dismissal in Amsterdam.<br><br>However, while Gordon Strachan's side were largely able to shackle Rooney, they had no answer to Scholes' promptings.<br><br>The 31-year-old set up the last two goals in United's win, with Strachan and Sir Alex Ferguson agreeing he had been the major difference between Britain's best-two supported sides on a pulsating evening at Old Trafford.<br><br>It is not a judgment which would meet with any disagreement from Carrick, who has already discovered what a brilliant player Scholes is.<br><br>"Paul Scholes is just fantastic," said Carrick.<br><br>"When you play alongside him, you realise what a special talent he is.<br><br>"He is so intelligent and clever, he makes the game look really simple and showed it against Celtic by creating those two goals."<br><br>The disguised pass to release Saha for United's second was inspired, while, given seconds to make his decision, the ball which released the Frenchman in the build-up to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's winner was equally impressive.<br><br>"Paul has this ability to make the game look really easy," said Carrick.<br><br>"Believe me, it is a pretty hard skill to be able to slot people through gaps when everything is going on around you. Paul can do that and I felt he was the big difference between the teams."<br><br>Although Ferguson tried manfully to bring in a defensive-minded reinforcement to his midfield before the transfer deadline closed, moves for Owen Hargreaves and Marcos Senna met with no success.<br><br>It means that, while they make lack something in terms of destructive play, the partnership between Carrick and Scholes is set to be extended, particularly as both Ryan Giggs and Park Ji-sung have now been consigned to frustrating spells on the sidelines.<br><br>"It is up to the manager," said Carrick.<br><br>"It worked well against Celtic but who knows what will happen against Arsenal on Sunday.<br><br>"The more I play, the more I will learn about the other lads' games, the more we will get the rhythm flowing and the better our overall performances will be."<br><br>Although defensive frailties and poor passing meant United's performance could not be judged as the best of the fledgling campaign, it was enough to bring them a fifth straight win.<br><br>Even without Giggs and Park, the Red Devils have every reason to approach Sunday's meeting with Arsene Wenger's men in confident mood.<br><br>As a former Tottenham star, it is a game which holds special significance for Carrick.<br><br>However, even if United win and open up a 13-point gap on their old rivals, the 25-year-old thinks it is too early to start writing the Gunners off.<br><br>"It is too early to start looking past the game itself," he said.<br><br>"We have had a super start to the season and we just want to carry it on.<br><br>"It is a huge game and if we win it, we will be in a strong position. But it would still be too early to write them off."<br><br></div>
