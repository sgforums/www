              <p><span id="intelliTXT"> United have a huge amount of support abroad, proven by the support they are receiving on their current Far East tour, but Gill is not looking to cash in.
              </span></p><p>Malaysian supporters booed their own national side in Kuala Lumpur on Saturday, such is the fervour with which they hold United, while supporters have been mounting a 24-hour vigil outside the team hotel in Seoul since Sir Alex Ferguson and his side landed in South Korea on Wednesday night.</p>
              <p>Similar scenes would have been expected in Jakarta if United had not been forced to cancel their visit following last week's suicide bombings, and there is more to come in China at the weekend, when the Red Devils tackle Hangzhou Greentown.</p>
              <p>Little wonder senior football figures believe it is time the controversial 39th game proposal was revived after its initial airing received a hostile reception.</p>
              <p>As the man in charge of England's most profitable club, Gill might have seen the attraction of such a plan, particularly as United have a £700million debt to service.</p>
              <p>However, Gill thinks the plan is unworkable, either as an additional fixture tagged on to the present 38 games, or incorporated within it.</p>
              <p>"It is highly unlikely," said Gill.</p>
              <p>"If you are talking about a 39th game how do you get the symmetry? If it was the 38th whose home game would it be? How do you decide who will play where?</p>
              <p>"The domestic competition is the domestic competition. The Premier League is the Premier League in England.</p>
              <p>"The Premier League should still look at opportunities and ideas but I cannot see an extra game happening. It would be a step too far."</p>
              <p>What is open to possibility, in addition to the lucrative pre-season jaunts enjoyed by the likes of United, Liverpool and Chelsea, are mid-season friendlies when the fixture list allows.</p>
              <p>A couple of years ago, United headed to Saudi Arabia to play a January testimonial and already Manchester City have confirmed they will play UAE in Abu Dhabi on November 12.</p>
              <p>There are even whispers that United and Liverpool might be offered a tidy sum to renew traditional hostilities in India at some point before Christmas.</p>
              <p>"Those games would naturally be more opportunistic in terms of how we are doing in any particular season," reflected Gill.</p>
              <p>"If, for any reason, there is a week or 10-day break in the fixture programme where Alex feels it would be beneficial to take a break, we would look at that.</p>
              <p>"It would all be driven by the football side but we would not rule that out at all."</p>
              <p>It is another example of the Premier League's popularity allowing major clubs to buck the trend of a global recession.</p>
              <p>Gill, meanwhile, insists United were correct to take the trip despite criticism of the schedule following the bombings and claims increased security will not affect future tours.</p>
              <p>"Indonesia is a huge country. We have 28 million fans there," he said.</p>
              <p>"We took a lot of advice, researched it and spoke to the relevant people. No-one said don't go. If the authorities had done that, we would not have gone.</p>
              <p>"Without doubt we made the right decision to go and, regrettable as it was, we made the right decision to pull out.</p>
              <p>"Security will become a more important factor in future but I don't see a point where we will have to stop touring.</p>
              <p>"We survive, take care and move forward."</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>When <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/sir-alex-ferguson"><span style="color: #005689;">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></a> speaks, people listen. The managerial story of the week may have been Sven-Goran Eriksson's unlikely installation at Notts County, but the quotes of the week have been finding their way to the back pages from venues on <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united"><span style="color: #005689;">Manchester United</span></a>'s tour of the Far East.</p>
              <p>Malaysia is certainly a long way to go for a story, yet at least with Ferguson you can be pretty sure you will get one. He answers questions directly – at least when in a good mood and away from the immediate stresses of the season proper – does not mind queering other people's pitches and never resorts to talking in riddles. Get Fergie to chat and you are bound to end up with something interesting. Jose Mourinho used to be the same, whereas reporters packing their bags for long-haul flights in the hope of something snappy from a Rafa Benítez or an Eriksson at the other end would do so with heavier hearts.</p>
              <p>Fair enough, before Manchester City's legion of paranoid fans write in to complain, there is, or ought to be, more to sports reporting than simply copying down what managers say and presenting their opinions as your story. Yet even while regretting the modern obsession with first the quote and then the soundbite, it is possible to acknowledge that some people are better at it than others and the football world will be a duller place when all-round entertainers such as Fergie are gone and every club has an interchangeable coach with a thin-lipped smile, a wealth of statistical information and a deferential attitude to the owners.</p>
              <p>Two things set Ferguson apart from every other Premier League manager, with the possible exception of Arsène Wenger, who took a while to warm to the idea of fighting battles in the press but now finds it comes naturally. The first is that he enjoys talking about football, and will happily deal with sensible questions instead of regarding press conferences as an unpleasant chore. The second is that he has nothing to prove and therefore nothing to fear. Unlike most managers, Ferguson does not have to guard too many of his words. He can say what he likes and frequently does, because he controls Manchester United and not the other way around. Again, Wenger is in a somewhat similar position at Arsenal, though the studious Frenchman is hardly in the same league for Taggart impressions, Glaswegian feistiness or European Cups.</p>
              <p>It goes without saying that Ferguson uses the media to his own ends, just as Brian Clough and Bill Shankly did before him, but every manager is given a press platform two or three times a week and only a few ever manage to pull off the trick. The secret, as pioneered by Shankly and Clough, is to be amusing. Managers by and large do not see the game as the fan sees it, but the best ones sound as if they do. When Shankly introduced Ron Yeats by inviting local reporters to take a walk round his new centre half, he was only making an instinctive, obvious joke, though what stuck in everyone's mind was that Liverpool's new signing was big in every sense. Similarly while it might amuse Wenger to be told by a pensioner that he is too old at 59 to be thinking of leaving Arsenal, the idea is out there now. Count up the number of stories alluding to Wenger's age between here and the end of the season and remember where you read it first.</p>
              <p>Some say Ferguson is nowhere near as clever as people make out, and certainly his reputation for "mind games" has been overstated, yet his managerial ability speaks for itself. Even now it is possible to find Manchester City fans refusing to get excited by any new Eastlands dawn until Ferguson steps down from the Evil Empire. On the other hand, there are City fans persuading themselves that Ferguson must view their team as a threat this season, otherwise he would not be talking about them. That says it all, really. Fergie even has City fans hanging on his every word.</p>

              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson was delighted as United finished the Asia Tour in style - even if opponents Hangzhou Greentown weren’t the hardest nut to crack.<br><br></strong>Speaking to MUTV, the manager described his team’s attacking play as “fantastic at times” as the Reds racked up an 8-2 win with five different men on the scoresheet.<br><br>“You’ve got to measure our performance against the opposition but regardless, you’ve still got to create and have the speed of play to do it. <br><br>“They (Greentown) were all over the place in the second half, but it took us twenty minutes to get the first goal. <br><br>“The first half was probably the highlight therefore in terms of our possession, penetration and patience. I thought we did very well tonight,” summarised Sir Alex.<br><br>Michael Owen and Dimitar Berbatov started together for the first time and the manager was pleased, if not surprised, as both scored in a fine first period.<br><br>“As well as his goals (four in four games), Michael’s contribution to our final third play has been very good,” praised Sir Alex.<br><br>“We’re delighted with what we’ve seen from Michael so far but I expected it, to be honest. The experience he’s got will also be a great advantage to us. He was excited to join us, a club where there’s attacking play all the time. I think he needs that.<br><br>“I also expected the form we’ve seen from Berbatov. Last season was a strange one for him and we maybe didn’t use him in</p>
              <p>the right way, but we know exactly how to use him now – further up the pitch, playing as a centre forward.”<br><br>Left-winger Zoran Tosic was the other scorer in a lively first half, drilling a left-footed shot in off the far post before Owen’s second goal made it 4-0 at the interval.<br><br>Sir Alex enthused, “Zoran scored a great goal. He’s got a wonderful left foot, he’s a very intelligent player with a good work-rate. He’s just got to add some strength to his physique because he has a very light frame at the moment.”<br><br>The United manager now takes his men into the Audi Cup – “that will be good preparation” - on Wednesday and Thursday. He confirmed that the squad will be joined in Germany by three reinforcements in young Irish defender Craig Cathcart, Serbian centre-back Nemanja Vidic and another summer signing, Antonio Valencia.</p>
