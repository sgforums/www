            <div class='col-md body'>Gerrard dubs Ronaldo a 'disgrace'<br><br>Steven Gerrard has branded Manchester United winger Cristiano Ronaldo "a disgrace" for his part in Wayne Rooney's sending-off at the World Cup.<br><br>Gerrard was furious when Ronaldo got involved after Rooney appeared to stamp on Portugal defender Ricardo Carvalho.<br><br>"Sadly a dark side stains Cristiano Ronaldo's game," writes Gerrard in his autobiography, which is being serialised in the News of the World.<br><br>"His part in Wayne Rooney's dismissal was a disgrace."<br><br>The Liverpool midfielder, who was appointed vice-captain of England this week, expressed particular dissatisfaction with the wink that Ronaldo appeared to give to his team-mates on the bench after Rooney had been dismissed.<br><br>"What really [got to] all the England players was Ronaldo's wink to his bench. It was a wink which said 'job done'. How could he do that to his Manchester United team-mate?<br><br>"On the bus after the game Wayne asked me: 'What do you think about the wink?'<br><br>"I said: 'Honestly, Wazza, if we were playing Spain and [Liverpool team-mates] Xabi Alonso or Luis Garcia winked at the referee or gave a signal for me to be sent off, I'd never speak to them again.'"<br><br>When Argentine referee Horacio Elizondo halted play and then brandished a red card, Gerrard initially thought it was for a Portuguese player.<br><br>"Players like Carvalho are damaging football, not Wayne Rooney," writes Gerrard.<br><br>"It's coached into them that when an incident like that happens, they go to work on the ref.<br><br>"Ronaldo was at the front. But the blame does not just rest with him. Five or six Portuguese players were at it."<br><br>Gerrard also believes England's players' cockiness in the World Cup cost them dearly.<br><br>"We are not as good as we think we are. England were guilty of over-confidence. Me and the other players constantly claimed we could win the World Cup - it was stupid."</div>
