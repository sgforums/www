              <p><strong>Manchester United's team bus was attacked as it left Stamford Bridge on Sunday night. Sir Alex Ferguson's side were making their way to Euston for their return journey to the north-west after the 1-1 draw with Chelsea when a bottle was hurled at the windscreen.</strong></p>
              <p>No-one was injured, although the windscreen was cracked. Nevertheless, the team continued on their short trip across London without further incident.</p>
              <p>United officials were eager to play down the incident afterwards. "Yes. There was an incident but the matter is now in the hands of the police," said a club spokesman.</p>

              <p>Sometimes I don't understand the fans reactions to certain matches. Keep blaming the lads out there, either blaming Fergie or the individual.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If CR scored last night, everyone say Ferguson is smart, CR is good. If he don't, everyone question his choice to bring him on and why not Tevez, bla bla bla. Then now people complain why he put 3 DM in the centre. I'm sure you all know Chelsea dominated 2nd half right. Looking at the rate Chelsea came at us he must choked up the midfield to stiffen up Chelsea, aint it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The goal conceded I believe no one was at fault. If you catch the replays clearly again Kalou actually fouled Rio but obviously I'm sure all of you know Mike Riley also played a part in farking up the game.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If anyone is to blame, its the whole team itself for sitting back after the goal just like the previous game against Liverpool. And even our own fans are starting to write off ourselves already. Look at the string of teams we faced recently. Other than Newcastle, we faced 3 of the toughest games in the league. Take heart to what we have done. Don't keep looking at the negatives and start blaming. Look at the positives as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Come on guys, believe in Fergie. Not sure about all of you, but at least I have watched United for at least 10 years. Fergie has brought us this far. Trust the good man.</p>

              <p>got no time to read all postings to see whether anyone point this out.</p>
              <p>for chelsea's goals, it was berba's fault.</p>
              <p>the whole defence moved up to play offsite but berba stayed and U can see there were 3 blues inside waiting for the cross.</p>
              <p>if only we had vidic, then perhaps he can stop this.</p>
              <p>anyway, I felt tevez may have gotten more than berba did from the game.</p>
              <p>alas, twice we score first and lost it.</p>
              <p>but the plus side is how MU players worked hard to cover for each other. and ronaldo is back...</p>
              <p>the only surprise is we got 6 yellows..we should all respect the referees even when they do such a crap job, such an irony.</p>

              <p>well, it was certainly a familiar sight, and brings a laugh to everyone..</p>

              <p>cause he brings speed and bring the ball out of danger and is a bigger threat so chelsea has to commit men to stay with him instead of all bombing the MU goal.</p>

              <p>I don't think they lack hunger, perhaps the one who did N have to bathe after the game was berba. IMHO, tevez may have given a bit more given his tenacity.</p>

              <p>evans is good but he is not vidic. and that's why we got 1pt instead of 3.</p>

              <p>got no time to read all postings to see whether anyone point this out.</p>
              <p>for chelsea's goals, it was berba's fault.</p>
              <p>the whole defence moved up to play offsite but berba stayed and U can see there were 3 blues inside waiting for the cross.</p>
              <p>if only we had vidic, then perhaps he can stop this.</p>
              <p>anyway, I felt tevez may have gotten more than berba did from the game.</p>
              <p>alas, twice we score first and lost it.</p>
              <p>but the plus side is how MU players worked hard to cover for each other. and ronaldo is back...</p>
              <p>the only surprise is we got 6 yellows..we should all respect the referees even when they do such a crap job, such an irony.</p>

              <p><br>Yeah. Take heart from how the players cover each other.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> Perhaps you pointed out one thing I didn't catch. Hmm. But I'm quite sure Kalou kinda fouled Rio too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On another note..</p>
              <p>A personal blame from me would be Mike Riley. Sometimes I really ponder... FA is now becoming too commercialised that they are about to lose the real Footballing code. Referees are now not as firm and sharp as before and are easily influenced by the players and atmosphere. They gotta farking do something about it. Shame.</p>

              <p>Sometimes I don't understand the fans reactions to certain matches. Keep blaming the lads out there, either blaming Fergie or the individual.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If CR scored last night, everyone say Ferguson is smart, CR is good. If he don't, everyone question his choice to bring him on and why not Tevez, bla bla bla. Then now people complain why he put 3 DM in the centre. I'm sure you all know Chelsea dominated 2nd half right. Looking at the rate Chelsea came at us he must choked up the midfield to stiffen up Chelsea, aint it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The goal conceded I believe no one was at fault. If you catch the replays clearly again Kalou actually fouled Rio but obviously I'm sure all of you know Mike Riley also played a part in farking up the game.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If anyone is to blame, its the whole team itself for sitting back after the goal just like the previous game against Liverpool. And even our own fans are starting to write off ourselves already. Look at the string of teams we faced recently. Other than Newcastle, we faced 3 of the toughest games in the league. Take heart to what we have done. Don't keep looking at the negatives and start blaming. Look at the positives as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Come on guys, believe in Fergie. Not sure about all of you, but at least I have watched United for at least 10 years. Fergie has brought us this far. Trust the good man.</p>

              <p>3 dmf to choke of midfield will screw us up u knw ..we never got away with shitty defensive tactics...it never worked for us last year maybe only against barca...and they jus let chelsea come at them so its a huge risk may as well attack rather den defend</p>

              <p>Personally, I don't really agree that we are on a bad start, Its not the best but its not really bad either... I feel that United's start to the season is satisfactory... Why because they have a number of injuries and some bad luck.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo was out all along and is just about to come back in only. He isn't fully match fit yet... Then there is Carrick, out for so long then came back and got injured again for another 6 weeks... very unfortunate... even Rooney who was a doubt in their first match against Newcastle but have slowly come back. I feel that had they played Newcastle now rather than in the first match of the season when Keegan was still around, they would have won that match too... Cos currently Newcastle are in shambles.</p>
              <p>Thats where they were a bit unlucky with the fixture and also denied some penalty decisions... And while the other big sides had lesser team early in the season, they have Pool and Chelsea away already... But I feel one good thing that we can consider is... They have got these difficult away fixtures out of the way already and what will come will be the less difficult ones and those big sides having to come to OT later in the season.</p>
              <p>United are currently not in the best of form no doubt... But I honestly belief things isn't really that bad... They started out the season without Park, Nani, Ronaldo, Carrick, Hargreaves, Teves, Berbatov and maybe even Anderson right... So being 6 points behind with having gone to the difficult away grounds and still have a game in hand, I would feel its still very good cos apart from Carrick, most of their players are back now and Berba only started training with the squad from the 12 of Sep, thats about 10 days ago only... He didn't had a pre-season with them so its understandable but the goals against Pool and Chelsea came from his effort and I belief he will get better when he has played more and get use to his new team mates...</p>
              <p>The very least we can take out of last night's match is... At least they have got 1 point more than they did last season and they taken 2 off Chelsea too at the same time... So there is still all to play for, no need to despair...</p>

Perhaps Fergie made the switch so that Fletcher can move forward. Afterall he's our top scorer lol. In Fergie we trust. :)</p>

              <p>Yup. Fixtures play a part. That's what I mean too. Liverpool took 3 points off us at Anfield, but dropped a most likely 3 points against Stoke.</p>

              <p><br>lol like you say we didn't show the hunger. so nothing to do with 3 dm or 2 dm ma. But still I take heart to the performances. Rooney shows he is most effective and threatening playing behind a striker. And we have our key players returning to the fold. All we need is a little more luck and hardwork, everything will be fine.</p>
