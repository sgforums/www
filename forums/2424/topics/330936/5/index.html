              <p><br>lol like you say we didn't show the hunger. so nothing to do with 3 dm or 2 dm ma. But still I take heart to the performances. Rooney shows he is most effective and threatening playing behind a striker. And we have our key players returning to the fold. All we need is a little more luck and hardwork, everything will be fine.</p>

              <p><br>true but of cos even with 3dm we did not contain them well we did not show the hunger to get the ball instead we let them come against us..so many thats the problem</p>

              <p><br>Actually, I don't quite understand those who said 3 defensive midfielders... I really can't see anything wrong with it, the match was at its end, Scholes was out of wind, unable to keep up with the match already... Who else do they have to replace him?</p>
              <p>Scholes left on the 55 mins and Ronaldo replaced him... Ronaldo went to the left at first, Park moved in to the centre and played there till the 75 mins when he was sub by O'Shea... During those 20 mins, it was Park and Fletcher in the middle with Hargreaves on the right wing spot helping Neville with tracking A cole and Bosingwa...</p>
              <p>Overall, I think Fergie despite putting a very unusal squad out got his tactics right against Scolari... He neutralized a recently very good form Chelsea side in their own backyard... And I thought it was a very brave decision to put Evens in for this match... It could have gone all wrong and many would be questioning him why he left out Brown instead of praising Evens on a fine display...</p>

              <p><br>Yoop. It was just a lapse moment of defensive errors + some weird refereering that opposed us. Tactically we were better initially but there were also times we kena from them la. For example Cashley Cole and Malouda outpacing Neville. But still, I didn't quite 'expect' us to be able to lead them for a large 60 minutes lol. To me it was a point earn than 2 points loss although a little ai wan for the goal conceded.</p>
