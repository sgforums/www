              <h1>Ballack: We'll Make United Suffer</h1>
              <p>The Blues are top of the table after four games and Ballack is looking
              to increase the pressure on their biggest rivals over the past couple
              of seasons, by reminding them exactly who the pressure will be on.<br><br>The
              Red Devils' stuttering start to the season means they are already six
              points behind Chelsea, though they do have a game in hand. <br><br>"It's a big chance for us to make a gap," Ballack was quoted as saying on Sky Sports News.<br><br>"It's
              never easy when you are always behind and you have to close the gap
              from nine to six points, and you are playing a day after your rivals.<br><br>"We dealt with that and maybe we can reverse it this season."<br><br>The
              German international returned to action from a foot injury during the
              Champions League rout against Bordeaux, though has acknowledged that he
              may not be quite ready to start in time for this weekend's top clash.<br><br>"Maybe it is a bit early for me," he added. "I don't know what the coach thinks. I need more training sessions."</p>

              Wednesday night after picking up an injury on his debut at Anfield.<br><br>“We’re working hard with Dimitar,” the manager told <strong><em>MUTV</em></strong>. “We hope he’ll be fit. I think he’s got a good chance.<br><br>“He got a few whacks on Saturday against Liverpool. There were a lot of hard tackles on him and he got a tweak behind the knee.”<br><br>Meanwhile,
              young defender Jonny Evans will have bolstered his chances of appearing
              at Chelsea after turning in a solid performance against Villarreal on
              Wednesday night.<br><br>“Nemanja Vidic is suspended and that’s why I played Jonny,” the manager told <em>Sky Sports </em>on Wednesday night.<br><br>Sir Alex added on <strong><em>MUTV</em></strong>: “He was unlucky to hit the inside of the post in the second half and he had another header that went just by the post. <br><br>“But
              he did very well. He’s a young lad and had good experience on loan last
              season at Sunderland. He’s only 20 but shows great composure, is a good
              passer of the ball and reads the game very well. We’re pleased with his

              O'Shea can play in any of the defence position if really needed and

              <h2 id="ctl00_ctl00_Full_Main_Main_stcArticleBodyNew_hHeader" class="football">Ferguson: Arsenal games bigger than Chelsea</h2>
              <p><img src="http://www.setantasports.com/upload/Sport/Football/2008-2009/Prem/arsenal/wenger_ferguson.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson claims he will never hold games against Chelsea in the same regard as the clashes with Arsenal. </strong></p>
              <p>Manchester United take on Chelsea at Stamford
              Bridge on Sunday as they look to kick-start their season and, after
              battling with The Blues in recent years, it is expected to be an
              important match in the title race.</p>
              <p>But Ferguson believes it will be little more than that as the rivalry with Chelsea does not share the same history.</p>
              <p>Speaking at an LMA Benevolent Trust and
              Community Fund dinner, he said: “If you look back over the last 12 or
              13 years, who has it been? Arsenal v Manchester United, Manchester
              United v Arsenal.</p>
              <p>“Of course we’ve got Chelsea at the moment –
              that’s without question – but the history of Arsenal versus Manchester
              means that you’re not just talking about winning a football match –
              you’re talking about your history against the other team’s history.</p>
              <p>“There’s a dominance attached to that. You
              want to be the dominant team and they want to be the dominant team, and
              we’ve had some volatile matches because of that.</p>
              <p>“But you can’t beat the history and the quality that both teams believe in, and the way they want to play has never changed.”</p>

              <h2>Eight reasons why Manchester Utd will beat Chelsea at the Bridge on Sunday</h2>
              <p>1. Manchester United have a knack of ending unbeaten runs. They
              famously ended Arsenal’s 49-match unbeaten league run but also stopped
              Chelsea in November 2005 when they were on a 40-match unbeaten streak.
              Wayne Rooney also scored the goal that ended Arsenal’s 30-match
              unbeaten run in October 2002 for Everton.</p>
              <p>2. The Red Devils have followed their last nine league defeats on the road with victory in their next away game.</p>
              <p>3. United have only lost at Anfield four times in the Premier
              League. In three of those four seasons they were also victorious at
              Stamford Bridge, drawing on the other occasion. Just a coincidence?
              Perhaps not - United have only won four Premier League games at the Bridge in total.</p>
              <p>4. Sir Alex Ferguson’s side haven’t lost consecutive league away games since April 2005 - away to Norwich and Everton.</p>
              <p>5. Chelsea were top after four league games last season but lost the
              fifth against Aston Villa - kicking off a run of four games without a
              win.</p>
              <p>6. This is also the first time since 2005 where the Blues have got
              through the first eight months of the calendar year without losing. On
              that occasion, Manchester United stopped them.</p>
              <p>7. Chelsea failed to score in either of their two home league games
              last September and won none of their three home games in all
              competitions that month.</p>
              <p>8. When Manchester United make a shaky start to the season, they
              tend to turn it around in big games. Last season United hadn’t won any
              of their first eight games in all competitions by a greater margin than
              one goal - then they beat Chelsea 2-0. In 2004/05, United won just one
              of their first five league games but beat Liverpool in the sixth. And
              in 1996/97, United won just one of their first four then thumped Leeds
              4-0 at Elland Road.</p>
