That is what we are investigating.Â”<br><br>Asked whether he was alleging Liverpool had tapped up Heinze, Fergie replied: Â“We will see how it comes out.<br><br>Â“David Gill is working on that at the moment.

Although Ferguson did not use the words 'tapping up', when he was asked whether United felt that is what had happened, he replied: "We will see." </strong><br><br>Chief among United's concerns is how solicitor Richard Green, who advises Liverpool on much of their legal work, came to be acting for Heinze in his attempt to prove a letter - signed by Gill and stating a fee which would be acceptable for the player - was an agreement to sell.<br><br>A three-man Premier League tribunal rejected the claim on Tuesday but, with Liverpool supposedly having no direct involvement in the case, United want to know how Heinze secured Green's services given the 29-year-old still had two years of his Red Devils contract to run.<br><br>United's unhappiness with Liverpool has only increased following Rafael Benitez's outburst in which the Reds coach, while stressing his amazement at the Premier League's ruling, effectively claimed the Red Devils enjoyed preferential treatment, not just over Heinze but also in the drafting of fixtures and the 'smooth' move of Carlos Tevez from West Ham compared to the deal which saw Javier Mascherano join Liverpool in January.<br><br>It was rant which smacked of sour grapes and could yet land Benitez in hot water with the Premier League. "What Rafa said is a bit churlish," declared Ferguson. "He obviously did not study the Premier League rules because he had no chance of winning the case. "But we are looking at Liverpool's whole role in this.<br><br>"David Gill is working on it at the moment. We will get to the bottom of it and see what comes out because we are not letting them off with it. "I am really disappointed with Rafa. "As for Carlos Tevez, it took about three months."<br><br></div>
