            <div class='col-md body'>England International Owen Hargreaves made his Manchester United debut as the Premier League side beat a plucky Peterborough United side on a gloriously summers afternoon at London Road.<br><br>The final home pre-season friendly ahead of the new campaign was delayed for 15 minutes due to safety reasons but the action was soon under way in glorious sunshine at London Road.<br><br>United started lively pinning posh back in their own defensive third with striker Campbell scuffing a shot inches past the post after a smart turn saw him evade Blackett.<br><br>On seven minutes a glorious cross from Jamie Day picked out fellow winger Chris Whelpdale at the far post but his volley was struck straight at Tom Heaton who made a decent save.<br><br>Darren Gibson challenge Shwan Jalal with a free kick from 25 yards as the visitors continued to dominate.<br><br>On 21 minutes a delightful cross from Dean Keates picked out Mclean although he rose above the defender he couldn't direct his headed goal wards.<br><br>United opened the scoring moments later as a neat 1-2 involving Dong and Eckersley was finished off in style by the latter who fired a left foot shot across Jalal in to the top corner.<br><br>Posh responded well to the set back of falling behind and created a number of chances in a slick move which began on the left with Josh Low. Goalkeeper Heaton initially did well to punch clear under pressure from Mclean but watched helplessly as Boyd fired a shot goal wards, thankfully for United Evans was in the way and Heaton was able to position himself to deny the follow up from Keates.<br><br>On 29 minutes a low free kick from Keates was well held by Heaton moments later he was in the right place at the right time to claim a deflected Whelpdale shot.<br><br>A one time posh target Ryan Shawcross should have made it 2-0 five minutes from the interval as the ball fell kindly to him six yards out but his reflex header crashed back off the cross bar.<br><br>In the 49th minute Posh levelled the scores as subs Rene Howe fires a left foot shot past goal keeper Heaton and into the back of the net.<br><br>Posh came close to a second goal three minutes later after good work from Whelpdale whose cross was headed just wide by Lowe.<br><br>Howe was certainly looking lively as his powerful header produced a uneasy save from Heaton as Posh stepped up a gear.<br><br>Impressive work fro m Lowe down the left presented Boyd with a good opportunity to score but he flashed his shot across goal and failed to test Heaton.<br><br>A half chance fell to substitute Danny Crow on 62 minutes after an intelligent header from Gavin Strachan but the former Norwich City front man didn't connect truly with his effort and Heaton made a comfortable save.<br><br>Dong fired over from long range on 66 minutes before Posh manager Darren Ferguson bought on three final subs.<br><br>Wing wizardry from young Alfie Potter created a decent headed chance for Crow but he couldn't direct his header on target.<br><br>United made it 2-1 on 72 minutes as a deep corner found Bardsley at the far post, his volley rebounded back off Mark Tyler and fell kindly for Richie Jones who swept the ball into the net from close range.<br><br>Midfielder Peter Gain drilled a left foot shot past the post as Posh pushed for an equaliser.<br><br>The visitors made it 3-1 on the 77 minute mark as a fine piece of individual skill from Dong allowed him to find room and curl an emphatic shot past Tyler.<br><br>A snapshot from the promising Potter warmed the gloves of Heaton. Posh continued to press late on but couldn't find another break through as the visitors claimed a 3-1 win.<br><br>Final Score: Posh 1-3 Manchester United<br><br>Posh: Jalal (Tyler 45 mins), Lowe (Potter 67 mins), Blackett (Newton 45 mins), Morgan ( Branston 67 mins), Westwood (Charnock 45 mins), Hyde (Strachan 61mins), Mclean (Howe 45), Boyd (Gain 61 mins), Keates (Crow 61mins), Day (Smith 67 mins) Whelpdale (Lee 61 mins)<br><br>Man Utd: Heaton, Simpson, Eckersley, Shawcross (Bardsely45 mins), Pique (Lea 45 mins), Jones, Gibson (Hargreaves 45 mins), Campbell , Dong, Martin, Evans (S.
