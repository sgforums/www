              <h1><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Huntelaar Would Have Considered Manchester United</span></h1>
              <h2><span style="color: #ff0000;">Klaas-Jan Huntelaar has admitted that Manchester United could have
              scuppered his move to Real Madrid had they shown interest in him... </span></h2>
              <p>Dutch hitman Klaas-Jan Huntelaar will join Real Madrid from Ajax on
              January 2. He's needed to lead the line in the absence of crocked
              countryman Ruud van Nistelrooy.<br><br>Los Blancos will unveil the 25-year-old on Thursday, in order to inject a timely morale boost into the club.<br><br>Before
              the presentation, though, 'The Hunter' has admitted that things could
              have been very different had Manchester United followed up on their
              previous interest in him by challenging Madrid for his services.<br><br>United
              shelled out €30 million to take Dimitar Berbatov from Tottenham Hotspur
              instead, while Carlos Tevez's future at Old Trafford has been unclear
              for some time. Thus, a bid from Sir Alex Ferguson was highly unlikely.<br><br>Still, the Oranje star has admitted that it could have given him a headache.<br><br>Manchester
              City are said to have had a bid rejected for his services during the
              summer - one much higher than the €27 million agreed between Madrid and
              Ajax.<br><br>Expressing a distaste for the cash-rich Citizens, the
              striker said: "There was enough interest in the summer, but these
              weren’t the clubs we had thought about.<br><br>"Manchester City didn’t meet the criteria we wanted. Manchester United? Maybe that would have been another story!"<br><br>Huntelaar's
              words are not what Los Merengues want to hear, as they have a bitter
              relationship with the Red Devils as it is. He's also hinted that City
              may not be able to buy happiness in January.<br><em><strong><br>Greg Ptolomey, Goal.com</strong></em></p>

              <p>Yeah all summer he was waiting for United to make their move giving out statements like he would like to play in the premier league and for United but Fergie only had eyes for Berbatov and wasn't interested on him...</p>
              <p>No real lost... In Fergie I trust...</p>

              <p>For me I feel he is a good player but not great. Real were probably desperate as Ruud is out for the rest of the season so no strikers. And during this time of the window, most top strikers won't be moving cos their clubs wouldn't sell and most top players won't be able to play in the champions league too but he can...</p>
              <p>Another thing is, If Ajax don't sell him now, come Jun he would be left with a yr to go on his contract making it possible for Ajax to get any good price for him...</p>
              <p>Personally I think he is over rated... Maybe he did play well in the Eredivisie but the Eredivisie is not the Premiership or La Liga... And the Eredivisie standard today is not like those 10 yrs ago... Ajax can't even make it into the CL and If I am not wrong, I think they are also not in the Uefa cup...</p>

              <p>Wait you watch him for Real than we know... Berbatov is far better than him... I am guessing Real probably wouldn't buy him had Ruud not got injured and out for the rest of the season... Anyway, Fergie wasn't interested on him so too bad.</p>

              <p>I think if we want to have a rough idea of how good he really could be, we can see how is <span style="color: #000000;">Afonso Alves doing at Middlesbough. He was also top scorer in the Dutch Eredivisie before moving to the premiership...</span></p>
              <p>In 2007, he finished as top goalscorer in the <span style="color: #000000;">Eredivisie</span> with 34 goals, which is a club record. During the 2008 season, he played 8 matches for his dutch club and scored 11 goals but only manage 6 out of 11 games for Boro... And this season so far, he has played 15 games and scored only 3. Huntelaar is maybe better or maybe worse, who knows...</p>
