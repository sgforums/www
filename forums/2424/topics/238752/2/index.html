Ronaldo scored an 87th-minute winner after running from his own half but it was a barely deserved victory after the Cottagers had matched the Red Devils in every department.<br><br>Ronaldo said: "The most important thing is Manchester. Don't think about Chelsea and about being nine points in front." The Portugal international admitted United had been fortunate saying: "After the Champions League I think the team showed it was tired.<br><br>"It was a very tough game and I think Fulham played very well. I'm very happy. "Maybe Fulham played better in the second half. Sometimes football is like that - sometimes you play better and you don't win."<br><br>Ferguson admitted United had been given their toughest test of the season by Fulham. He said: "The performances have been terrific but you are always waiting for a performance that is a bit flat where you have to dig something out.<br><br>"Give credit to Fulham, they made it a real cup tie, they never gave us time to settle on the ball. Coming back from the (Champions League) game in Lille which was really emotional, we were really flat. "It was an uphill fight and we have to thank the two goalscorers for digging us out of a hole."<br><br>Ferguson felt the way his side had won without playing anywhere near their best was of greater significance to their title ambitions than the fact that the win put them nine points above Chelsea at the top of the table.<br><br>"It's signifcant winning the way we played. Fulham will feel very aggrieved and we can look at (goalkeeper Edwin) van der Sar's performance as the reason for winning the game.<br><br><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/42609000/jpg/_42609927_ronaldo203.jpg"><br><br>"Ronaldo was fantastic, he showed such courage and I think he deserved to be man of the match and get the goal."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, Fulham played a better game. At the 80+ min, I thought that's it man. And Ronaldo's the hero again. I think Rooney played a good game too, though the rest of the team was really shabby, especially the defence, excldg VDS.<br><br>Heck, 3 points up  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Was Giggs goal a mis-kick or a class finish? Some people thinks it was a mis-kick, but he didn't seem to put a lot of power to it... He looks like he slice the ball with the outside of his foot with the ball still in mid-air... But whatever it was, the finishing looks really nice...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-f48BvxRDA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-f48BvxRDA</a><br><br>Giggs's goal.<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ocWK0Z9pGU&amp;mode=related&amp;search=" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ocWK0Z9pGU&amp;mode=related&amp;search=</a><br><br>Haha...

            <div class='col-md body'>I think Giggs' finishing for that goal is simply World-Class. I think if Ronaldo were to receive that ball, he would have rammed it against the keeper rather than cooling slicing it past the keeper like Giggs did.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Cheers.<br>C.K</div>

He's getting more assists than goals now. I can't say that's the right tactic, but it seems to be the way Rooney is being used now.<br><br>It might work better if Saha was a better finisher, but apparently he is not.</div>
