              Nemanja Vidic turned in a Man-of-the-Match display at Wembley and scored in the penalty shoot-out, but that is of little consolation to the Serbian as the Reds crashed out of the FA Cup.
              
              â€œWe're disappointed because this is a trophy we wanted to win,â€� he told MUTV. â€œWe played some good football and created chances, but in the end it came to penalties â€“ and thatâ€™s just a lottery. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. In the Champions League final we wonâ€¦ but today we didnâ€™t score our penalties. You have to congratulate Everton.â€�
              
              Vidic dispatched his spot-kick with aplomb, even though it wasnâ€™t enough to prevent a 4-2 shoot-out loss, but he says dealing with the pressure of converting from 12 yards is â€œnothing newâ€�.
              
              â€œI practise in training and I also took penalties for Red Star Belgrade and Spartak Moscow,â€� he said. â€œItâ€™s nothing new, but there's always the possibility you'll miss, especially in games where there is pressure. I scored, but itâ€™s not about me scoring. The team didnâ€™t win. We need to forget this game now.
              
              â€œWe must take it and recover for the next game. Itâ€™s going to be hard, but we have Wednesdayâ€™s match against Portsmouth and we need to be focused. It helps that some players were rested. They are going to be fresh and I hope we have a good game at Old Trafford.â€�
              
              Vidic was proud of the performances of four teenagers in Unitedâ€™s youth-inflected starting line-up. And he says it's the result, rather than the performance, which was frustrating. â€œWe played well, so we donâ€™t need to be disappointed about that,â€� he added. â€œWe played offensively and tried to score. We had young players in our team, they showed some quality. We know they are capable of doing that. We just didnâ€™t take our chances."
