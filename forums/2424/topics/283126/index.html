            <div class='col-md body'>After netting United's winner against Birmingham City, Cristiano Ronaldo insisted his best form is still to come.<br><br>The winger's 52nd minute solo effort at St. Andrews was his second goal of the season and gave United a fifth successive league victory.<br><br>Ronaldo, who bagged 23 goals last season, has been happy with his recent form but says he is yet to hit top gear.<br><br>"My form is coming," he told MUTV. "I always try to work hard in training and hopefully I will keep improving and more goals will come as well.<br><br>"But my main concern is the team - I think only about that. The most important thing in football is getting the three points and I was pleased we did that against Birmingham."<br><br>The 22-year-old admitted United rode their luck at times against Steve Bruce's men, but still felt they deserved the win.<br><br>"It was a very tough game against a good team. They created a few difficult moments for us, but thankfully we managed to keep them out," he said.<br><br>"We didn't play as well as we can, but sometimes you can win matches without playing well.<br><br>"Our good football is coming. We have great players at the club and great staff and we will improve."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think most have recorded and seen how he play.<br><br>and after such a high profile season, he will be even more marked.<br><br>the key is not new tricks, but to be even more efficient, smarter..<br><br>look at Giggs, he was able to extend his "longevity" due to his brain, not tricks.</div>
