              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is preparing to salute the
              fans who adore him - and he is still pinching himself at his amazing
              Manchester United career.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Solskjaer might have been an unknown when he joined United from Molde in 1996 but everyone knows his name now.</p>
              <p>Principally of course, he is famous for the injury-time goal at
              the Nou Camp in 1999 which sent United into Champions League ecstasy.</p>
              <p>However, United fans will be paying tribute to far more than one flick of his right boot.</p>
              <p>In 365 appearances, the 35-year-old scored 126 goals for the Old
              Trafford outfit before a continued knee problem eventually forced his
              retirement 12 months ago.</p>
              <p>He won six Premier League titles, two FA Cups and a League Cup,
              as well as that never-to-be-forgotten night against Bayern Munich.</p>
              <p>And mixed within that are the treasures of a last-minute FA Cup
              goal against Liverpool, scoring four as a second-half substitute at
              Nottingham Forest, getting a standing ovation after chasing the length
              of the pitch to chop down Rob Lee and get sent off, earning United a
              point against Newcastle in the process.</p>
              <p>And there are more, many more memories.</p>
              <p>"I could never have imagined achieving anything like this when I first came to Manchester United," said Solskjaer.</p>
              <p>"I worked for the best manager of all time (Sir Alex Ferguson).
              I played with the best players in the world and in front of the best
              supporters.</p>
              <p>"I am very proud of what I achieved but very humble as well that I was given the opportunity to do that."</p>
              <p>In pub debates about pampered modern-day footballers, Solskjaer is unquestionably one of the good guys.</p>
              <p>He has spent more time with the media over the last few months
              that he would ideally like, yet he still manages to smile at every
              question. Far more willing is Solskjaer to commit his time to
              charitable ventures.</p>
              <p>Cash raised from his testimonial against Espanyol at Old
              Trafford on Saturday will go towards 10 schools being built in Africa
              through children's charity Unicef, for whom he is a patron.</p>
              <p>More time was spent this week working with underprivileged
              youngsters born under the shadow of Old Trafford as part of the
              Manchester United Foundation's Kickz campaign, which is helping cut
              crime in the area.</p>
              <p>"Maybe these kids have some respect for us because they know us from United," reflected Solskjaer.</p>
              <p>"They play with the Manchester United shirt on too and hopefully use us as role models."</p>
              <p>Even as he was putting his pupils through their paces in a
              training session that lasted well over an hour, passers-by sang songs
              in Solskjaer's honour. Not that anyone needed reminding of 'Who put the
              ball in the German net?'</p>
              <p>"I remember sticking my foot out and the ball going in but everything else is a bit of a blur," he said.</p>
              <p>"It was pure instinct. I had never even done it in practice. I
              was not familiar with the feeling when my foot hit the ball, so I
              didn't know it was going in. Thankfully it did.</p>
              <p>"Funnily enough we had done something very similar to Liverpool
              in the FA Cup earlier that season and I got the winner then. So while
              we were surprised to beat Bayern, it wasn't a shock that we achieved it
              in the way we did."</p>
              <p>Solskjaer knows he will never escape the attention of 1999, nor
              does he want to. But he prefers to view his career as a whole, rather
              than focus on that one, dramatic, aspect.</p>
              <p>Ask him for the moment of greatest satisfaction and he will
              tell you the 2007 Premier League title win, a championship he shared in
              the success of despite already undergoing a succession of operations on
              the knee that would ultimately cause him to quit.</p>
              <p>"Three years before I came on as a substitute in the FA Cup
              final against Millwall honestly thinking it would be my last game for
              United," he said.</p>
              <p>"I knew I needed another operation and I just felt that would be it.</p>
              <p>"So to win the Premier League again, one that my eldest son Noah
              was old enough to remember, gave me something I will always treasure."</p>
              <p>Once the weekend's festivities are over, Solskjaer will concentrate on his new job, coaching United's reserve team.</p>
              <p>One trophy has already been secured after a Lancashire Senior
              Cup win over Liverpool, although it is not a triumph he claims any
              credit for knowing Brian McClair was in charge when the hard work was
              done last season.</p>
              <p>But Solskjaer is eager to make his own impact, just as so many
              United old boys have done at various destinations in the last few
              years.</p>
              <p>"I am not surprised at the number of ex-Alex Ferguson players who have gone on to be managers," he said.</p>
              <p>"Something about the gaffer rubs off on you. He knows his
              players. He signs players he sees a little bit of himself in. They have
              the right personality.</p>
              <p>"You can't copy anyone, management is not like that.</p>
              <p>"But you take little bits. But he has seen and done everything and I have tried to learn from the way he never panics.</p>
              <p>"He just takes his time and makes a decision and sticks by it."</p>
              <p></p>
