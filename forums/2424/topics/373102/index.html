              <p><strong>Michael Owen was over the moon to break his United duck after
              firing the Reds' fourth goal in the 5-0 hammering of Wigan Athletic on
              Saturday.</strong><br><br>The 29-year-old striker came off the bench on
              71 minutes and, after being put through by Nani, produced a vintage
              finish in front of United's 5000-strong travelling support five minutes
              from time.<br><br>Having failed to put away a handful of chances on his
              previous two appearances against Birmingham and Burnley, Owen was
              relieved to finally get off the mark.<br><br>"I probably scored the hardest chance I've had!" he joked during an exclusive interview with <strong>MUTV</strong>. "I had two chances at Burnley and one against Birmingham, but this was the fourth real opportunity I've had.<br><br>"I
              don't think I missed a chance in pre-season, but I've missed a couple
              since the season started and as ever everyone is quick to write you
              off. It was as if I hadn't scored for a couple of years! That's
              something I've had to deal with for ten odd years now and I don't think
              that will change until I hang up my boots.<br><br>"It was certainly a
              great feeling to score. I'd got a few in pre-season but there's nothing
              quite like doing it in a competitive game."<br><br>With his first goal now under his belt, Owen is confident more will follow.Â  <br><br>"I'd
              be disappointed if people didn't think I could go on from here," he
              insists. "I obviously believe I can as I have done throughout my career
              and I certainly expect to score more goals in the red shirt."</p>
