              <p>This match is not exactly a comeback for utd. The same shit problems still persist. Rooney's passing in the final third was abysmal. His first goal came about because he wasn't closed down, a poor game overall in my opinion.</p>
              <p>Carrick cannot hold the ball well when under pressure and evans.....sometimes he makes key interceptions, sometimes he's just screwed up. In fact, that wolves goal could have been avoided had he anticipated earlier.</p>
              <p>Even nani was given a lot of space before he got his first goal. Maybe the silver linings were phil jones and valencia.</p>

              <p>Give credit to United lah... It's not easy really, I don't know any team with an injury of 7, 8 players can still perform or not so don't blame the squad. Remember at the start when Arsenal had around that number out? what kind of result they got? So United is actually doing very well considering with so many out.</p>
              <p>I say it here if results go the way it could, United might actually be top of the table sometime in Jan. It's not impossible considering our next 4, 5 fixtures isn't the most difficult while City will play a few of the big guns...</p>

              <p>read this article for a better analysis ..</p>
              <p>http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/opinion/columnists/andy-dunn/Andy-Dunn-column-How-Manchester-United-s-Basel-blow-showed-Alex-Ferguson-s-blueprint-is-way-behind-Barcelona-and-Real-Madrid-article841693.html.</p>
              <p>I think MUFC need a serious overhaul in the MF area. Yes, MUFC has a list of targets, but when comes to crunch, MUFC just can't pay the salary.. So while their noisy neighbour get louder and louder, MUFC will try to squeeze one more time from their depleted squad. And I am afraid will come out dry this time round..</p>

              <p>Give credit to United lah... It's not easy really, I don't know
              any team with an injury of 7, 8 players can still perform or not so
              don't blame the squad. Remember at the start when Arsenal had
              around that number out? what kind of result they got? So United is
              actually doing very well considering with so many out.</p>
              <p>I say it here if results go the way it could, United might
              actually be top of the table sometime in Jan. It's not impossible
              considering our next 4, 5 fixtures isn't the most difficult while
              City will play a few of the big guns...</p>
              <p>So don't lose faith...</p>

              <p>well, real fans never lost faith.. but the question now, is even with a full team, how much would the results be improved??</p>
              <p>I think majority are worried that with the given squads, particularly in MF, moving forward, MUFC will not be able to compete in Europe and seemingly in EPL soon.</p>
              <p>for once, I really hope that the owners do well and able to re-invest the necessary.. as MUFC do needs some injection of quality players.</p>

              <p>united fans will have cause for concern after fergie's retirement. I hope the united board do not make the same mistake after Sir Busby retired. learn from liverpool mistake after mistake, first with souness and evans after daglish quitted in 1991.</p>

              <p>I dun think Alex would retire from Man Utd manager.</p>
              <p>He will become Manager Mentor very soon.</p>
              <p>Jose is having too much fun in spain trying to beat Barca.</p>
              <p>Unless he can claim a Spain League title to his resume, he will not return to BPL.</p>
              <p>As for the players, his hands are tied in buying players unless his US boss got more money to pump in.</p>
              <p>Or else they will be losing more points through injuries.</p>

              <p>well, whoever coming in to replace SAF will initially feel that he is in SAF's shadow la. but to create his own identity and to lead the club to more success will require all fans' backing.</p>

              <p><br>Well, we may not have the best players but are the players any different from the one that started the season? No. So why not even with the same current players?</p>
              <p>Sometime, it's not aboutÂ how good an individual is, but rather how well they play as a team under pressure. We didn't even had the services of Vidic and Hernandez at the start of this season... So anything is possible.</p>
              <p>And didn't I said earlierÂ who knows, if results goes the way it could, United might actually be top of the table sometime in Jan. Actually when i said that, I was thinking more of a late Jan rather than early but United now have a good chance of going top by this weekend... Very much earlier then my expectation... lol.</p>
              <p>So must keep the faith...</p>
