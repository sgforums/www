I agree on Wigan and Sheffield United but not Watford cos they looked strong in the frendlies, winning 6 and drawing 1, of cos with the help of talented keeper Ben Foster of United's fame.<br>LOL!<br>Not only did Wigan sold off Bullard because of a clause in his contract, they also sold Jason Roberts. Who did they buy? Of all people, Emile Heskey. Duh! As if he's a top marksman. He "helped" Birmingham into relegation and he cost a bomb(in Wigan's view).<br>Now Chimbonda is set to leave. I wonder wad miracle Paul Jewell is gonna perform this coming season.<br>I think the last relegation team would be Reading. They don't look impressive even though they finish top of Coca-Cola Championship last season.<br><br>18 Wigan<br>19 Sheffield United<br>20 Reading<br><br>Cheers.<br>C.K</div>

When they were promoted 2 seasons ago, they bought Jason Roberts as well as Henri Camara. Both are experience frontman and boast fine scoring records.<br>Lets take a look at Reading's frontmen: Leroy Lita &amp; Kevin Doyle.<br>Lita is typical strong and fast forward. Does he has any EPL experience? No. And by the way, he was playing in English League One, i.e. 2 divisions down from EPL, 2 seasons ago!<br>Doyle is a young striker who has just been promoted to the 1st team and to ask him to perform in the EPL is somewhat asking too much of him although he does have a good scoring record, 18 goals in 41 games.<br>Reading will have no problem staying up if Lita can perform a "Darren Bent" and Doyle brings his impressive goal scoring form.<br><br>Cheers.<br>C.K</div>
