              <p><strong>Javier Hernandez faces a return to the sidelines after being hurt by a lunging tackle by Ashley Cole during United's 3-1 win over Chelsea.</strong></p>
              <p>Chicharito was caught by the despairing challenge as he fired into the side-netting when looking to profit after Wayne Rooney's shot bounced back off a post with 13 minutes remaining.</p>
              <p>It upset and puzzled Sir Alex, who saw the full-back booked but, as no penalty was awarded, there needs to be some clarity from referee Phil Dowd on the situation and whether the yellow card was for dissent.</p>
              <p>"To me, it was a shocking tackle," protested the boss. "An absolutely shocking tackle.</p>
              <p>"The referee's booked him and, if he's booked him, I don't know why it wasn't a penalty.</p>
              <p>"I must ask him [Dowd]. We don't know how Hernandez will be. We're going to have to wait until the morning but, at the moment, his leg is very numb. He's hardly got any feeling in it so he could be out for a couple of weeks."</p>
              <p>Sir Alex felt Cole's tackle was "reckless" and "over-committed" and could also be missing Chris Smalling for the upcoming matches against Leeds and Stoke.</p>
              <p>"Smalling's got a groin injury so we'll see what it's like during the week," he added.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Wellbeck coming back soon, and Berbatov can deputize for him is not bad after all, with Michael Owen waiting in the wings.</p>

              <p>not sure if I read this correct.. and correct me if I am wrong.</p>
              <p>Chelsea's manager, said that he likes to view it from another angle, Cole's tackle was a result of the two offsite goals which made him tackle JH the way he did. if the two offsite goals were not there, Cole may have not the "fire" and the tackle will not be so.. </p>
              <p>"If it was 0-0 maybe Ashley is a little bit more mentally in control of 
                the situation and doesn't do the red card foul that you mention."</p>

              <p>United boss <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=30"><span style="color: #225fb2;">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></a> feared Hernandez could be out for a "couple of weeks" with ligament damage following a crunching challenge from <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/8054/Ashley-Cole"><span style="color: #225fb2;">Ashley Cole</span></a>.</p>
              <p>Ferguson claimed Cole should have seen red, labelling the Chelsea defender "reckless". But the left-back, who was booked for the challenge, will not face a charge from the FA.</p>
              <p>Despite fears over Hernandez's fitness for United's next Premier League game against Stoke on Saturday, the player's agent claims the striker suffered no more than "just a bump" and will return to training this week.</p>
              <p>"[The injury is] nothing, it's just a bump, nothing more," agent Eduardo Hernandez told Telivisa. "I expect him to be training without incident on Wednesday. It looked like [his absence] was longer, they were looking for a fracture, that's why they ran those tests on him."</p>

              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson has admitted Javier Hernandez has been lucky to emerge from a wild tackle by Ashley Cole unscathed - but revealed skipper Nemanja Vidic is no nearer a comeback from his calf problem.</p>
              <p>The Manchester United manager feared the worst when Hernandez was caught by Cole during the second half of Sunday's 3-1 win over Chelsea at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Hernandez limped off and it appeared he was set for an extended period on the sidelines.</p>
              <p>However, the Mexican returned to training on Thursday and is in contention for Saturday's trip to Stoke.</p>
              <p>"Hernandez is very lucky," Ferguson said.</p>
              <p>"At the time he had no feeling in the leg. There was numbness and we thought there might have been some nerve damage.</p>
              <p>"But he trained very well on Thursday and is available for Saturday."</p>
              <p>Ferguson branded Cole's challenge reckless in the aftermath of the game, although referee Phil Dowd decided it was only worthy of a yellow card.</p>
              <p>The only conclusion the Scot could draw from that decision was the officials did not see it, and he is not entirely sure why his side did not get a penalty either.</p>
              <p>"I am confused," he said. "I don't think the referee could have seen it.</p>
              <p>"It was a spur-of-the-moment challenge by the player, reckless yes. But I don't know how the referee could have possibly seen it and the linesman wasn't in any better position.</p>
              <p>"I don't know what the rules and regulations say about that when the ball is out of play - there seems to have been some discussion about it not being a penalty because the ball was out of play.</p>
              <p>"I wasn't aware of that - I don't think anyone was."</p>
              <p>Ferguson is equally bemused by the state of Vidic's fitness.</p>
              <p>The Serbian limped out of the opening-day win at West Brom with a calf injury.</p>
              <p>At the time, it was estimated Vidic would be out for six weeks.</p>
              <p>However, that deadline is now approaching and the defender is no nearer a comeback.</p>
              <p>"It's slow progress with Nemanja," revealed Ferguson.</p>
              <p>"He's not done any training. He is still getting treatment on the calf.</p>
              <p>"Calves can be troublesome. I remember when Bryan Robson had calf trouble it kept him out for three months.</p>
              <p>"Hopefully it's not as long as that, but he's not making any great progress at the moment."</p>
              <p>Ferguson has no intention of joining the army of critics who have followed the Stoke bandwagon since it arrived in the Premier League four seasons ago.</p>
              <p>Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger was particularly aggrieved when young midfielder Aaron Ramsey had his leg broken in a meeting with the Potteries outfit.</p>
              <p>Chelsea and Liverpool have also had their struggles, as have Manchester City. Indeed, the former two have already dropped points against Tony Pulis' men this season.</p>
              <p>That form is in marked contrast to United, who have secured six straight wins since Stoke came back into the top flight.</p>
              <p>Little wonder Ferguson is not fazed by Stoke's unique threat, not that he feels there is a problem with it anyway.</p>
              <p>"I've never criticised it (Stoke's style of play). It's never been a problem for us.</p>
              <p>"Everyone plays to their strengths. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that.</p>
              <p>"You see the progress the team is making. They have signed two or three players, they are playing European football and having a right go.</p>
              <p>"They have a great attitude and their support is brilliant.</p>
              <p>"I love the atmosphere there. If you don't attend to that you just get engulfed."</p>
