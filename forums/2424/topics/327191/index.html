              <p>The 33-year-old made his first senior start since March 2007 at the
              weekend when United defeated Portsmouth on penalties to claim victory
              in the Community Shield.<br><br>The score may have been 0-0 after 90
              minutes but in truth the Red Devils dominated the FA Cup-holders as
              Carlos Tevez led a forward-line that ran rings around the Pompey
              defence.<br><br>The European champions' performance at Wembley
              highlighted the fluid style of play Sir Alex Ferguson strove for last
              season, which involved four forwards constantly shifting position and
              attacking the opposition goal from every angle.<br><br>Such a system is
              quite a departure from the more rigid yet brutally effective 4-4-2 that
              characterised United's glory days of the 1990s, which saw Ryan Giggs
              and David Beckham patrol the flanks while the likes of Andy Cole and
              Dwight Yorke terrorised goalkeepers across the country.<br><br>This new
              approach is essentially foreign to Neville, who made his debut with the
              club in 1992, but he is nonetheless excited by the direction United's
              football is heading.<br><br>"The way our current players inter-change is definitely different to the United teams I've played for in the past," he said in <em>The Guardian</em>. <br><br>"The
              front of three or four seem able to play in every position across the
              front-line and it's difficult for opponents and defenders of the other
              teams to know who they're going to be playing against from minute to
              minute, let alone match to match. <br><br>"In that sense this is probably the most inventive side I've played in."<br><br>However,
              that is not to say the 10-time Premier League-winners have abandoned
              defensive discipline to focus purely on playing sexy footy.<br><br>For
              a feature of United's strikers - most notably Tevez and Rooney - is
              their work ethic, and Neville readily acknowledged their efforts when
              forced onto the back foot.<br><br>"It is not just the way they attack
              that makes them so special," added the skipper. "Carlos, Nani, Giggsy
              and Wayne Rooney for that matter
              are also fantastic defenders in their own right. They tackle well and
              are all willing to win the ball back."</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>yeah in a way i kinda agree i like the way how the 4 "forwards" keep running all over the place without leaving an area empty.. it makes the opponent's defence a bit confused if they are not well organised and focussed.. but giggs and scholes shld remain as subs lah.. past their prime to be first 11..</p></div>

              <p>I agree on the first point.. sometimes U can see scholes controlling the tempo, and that's important.. As scholes said, he will retire in 2yrs max, and I find that a smart move.. Other than Keano, he is my favourite player.</p>
