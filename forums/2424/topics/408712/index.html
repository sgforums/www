              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson expects <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Rio Ferdinand" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/rio-ferdinand"><span style="color: #005689;">Rio Ferdinand</span></a> to be back in action for <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester United" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united"><span style="color: #005689;">Manchester United</span></a> by the end of September.</p>
              <p>Ferdinand suffered medial ligament damage on the first day of World Cup training in South Africa following a freak accident involving Emile Heskey. There were initial suggestions from United that he would be back for the start of the season but the club eventually pushed that deadline back and Ferguson confirmed the England captain is still progressing in line with the revised schedule.</p>
              <p>"We are still thinking the end of September for Rio," Ferguson said. "It was a medial ligament problem rather than a cruciate, so the recovery time is exactly what we thought.</p>
              <p>"It was a freak. It is nothing to do with his back [which had caused earlier lay-offs]. We just had to treat it the proper way. These things are never easy."</p>
              <p>It seems the midfielder Anderson is much nearer a comeback after returning to training yesterday. The 22-year-old suffered a cruciate ligament injury in February, which ended his season and wrecked his hopes of appearing at the World Cup for Brazil. However, while a comeback for Sunday's trip to Fulham is out of the question, Anderson may be in contention for a first-team spot immediately after the next international break.</p>
              <p>Ferguson reported a clean bill of health from Monday's opening-day triumph over Newcastle, with Patrice Evra showing no ill-effects following a collision with an advertising hoarding late in the 3-0 win.</p>
              <p>The United boss also feels an extra week's training will prove beneficial for players such as Michael Owen and Michael Carrick, neither of whom were involved against the Magpies.</p>
              <p>"It was difficult picking a squad on Monday because some players had not had a lot of time on the pitch," Ferguson said. "They weren't at their proper match fitness but with an extra week's training behind them they should be much better."</p>
