              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black; font-size: 14pt; '>Owen Hargreaves is on the brink of a sensational move to Manchester City.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>After being discarded by arch rivals Manchester United this summer, the injury-ravaged midfielder is set to sign a one-year deal at the Etihad Stadium. He is expected to be unveiled later on Tuesday.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Hargreaves was pictured leaving the Bridgewater Hospital in Manchester at Tuesday lunchtime after three hours of tests.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>He is now expected to join big-spending City in the most astonishing of the transfer window.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Hargreaves exclusively told<em> Sportsmail</em> on Saturday how he was confident of playing 40 games this season and making a late bid for England's squad for Euro 2012.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Tottenham and Aston Villa had joined West Bromwich Albion in the chase for the former England midfielder.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>But it now appears that Roberto Mancini is set to complete his most fascinating transfer of the summer at the Barclays Premier League title chasers.</span></p>

              <p><strong><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>After sealing his £24million move for Samir Nasri last week, Mancini was told he could only bring players in on loan or on free transfers.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>And after failing to lure Holland veteran Mark van Bommel away from AC Milan, he has now turned to Hargreaves.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The Canadian-born man, who joined United for £17m from Bayern Munich in 2007, is expected to fill a bit-part role like the one Patrick Vieira filled last season.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>However, if his predictions given in an interview to <em>Sportmail's </em>Matt Lawton prove correct, he could emerge as the signing of the summer.</span></p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'I hope to be back in the England side for the European Championship next summer. You have to have ambition.' </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>At England training on Tuesday, his former team-mate Wayne Rooney said: 'He's been out for a couple of years now and worked hard to try and get back. Hopefully he does get back playing. He's a great player.'</span></p>

              <p>This could be <span>Hargreaves last chance to prove he can still play and play at its highest level...</span></p>
              <p><span>I feel he had to leave United for his own good cos he became to comfortable that he didn't see the need to challenge for a place or start anymore... He was getting his weekly salary, his medical bills were being covered by United... So there was no serious need or real motivation to step out of his comfort zone...</span></p>
              <p><span>There were just too many times when news of Fergie wanting or expecting to start him but at the end, it came to nothing. And this was mostly due to his own mental state. I recalled reading Fergie said <span>Hargreaves was ok and the United doctors gave him the go ahead only for him to pull out in the last minute cos he felt he wasn't ready yet...</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span>So I feel <span>Hargreaves needed to be push or motivate otherwise he wouldn't dare to step forward again... 2, 3 years of operations after operations, left leg, right leg, and the pain he had to endure as well as not being able to walk properly all these while may put a fear factor into his head. He probably would reconsider going in for those tough tackles or challenges if he was still at United... But now, without a club anymore and no one to foot his medical bills, he is forced to step out of his comfort zone for the first time in a few years if he still wants to play... </span></span></span></p>
              <p><span><span><span>I guess leaving United could be a good thing for him as he needed to get his head in order... Sometimes being force to leave ones comfort zone may be just the thing to get him started again...</span></span></span></p>
              <p><span><span><span>I recalled he was a great defensive midfielder, probably one of the best i have seen... Unfortunely, having reach 30... Even if he wasn't injured, his legs would be gone or almost gone by now especially for someone who is known for his stamina and quick movement around the centre of the pitch...</span></span></span></p>
              <p><span><span><span>Hopefully he will pick himself up and be able to play again... But if he joint City cos he wanted to play in the CL, then i think he will be disappointed as </span></span></span><span><span><span>City didn't include him in their CL squad that means he won't be part of it at least for the group stages for now... And </span></span></span><span><span><span>anyone hoping to see the old <span>Hargreaves back again, I think that would be a little over optimistic...</span></span></span></span></p>
