              <p>John O'Shea cannot believe Manchester United team-mate Nani has not been nominated for the PFA player of the year award.</p>
              <p>The Portugal winger is top of the Premier League assists chart in addition to bagging 10 goals in United's relentless pursuit of the treble.</p>
              <p>He was at it again on Saturday, setting up the Red Devils' opener in a 2-0 win over Fulham by dribbling to the heart of the Cottagers defence before exchanging passes with Anderson, then flicking a pass for Dimitar Berbatov to ram home his 22nd goal of the campaign.</p>
              <p>It was also Nani's shot that was turned into the path of Antonio Valencia by Aaron Hughes that ended the scoring, allowing United to cruise home in exactly the manner they would have wished ahead of such a massive week.</p>
              <p>Yet the 24-year-old has not managed to make the PFA short-list, even though it has been extended to seven names this term.</p>
              <p>"I am pretty amazed by that," said O'Shea.</p>
              <p>"Maybe because he was still eligible for the young player, people didn't vote for him for the senior player.</p>
              <p>"He is a constant threat. Defenders don't know whether he is going to go on his left and his right and his combination with Patrice Evra was excellent."</p>
              <p>United are now in the happy position of knowing five victories from their final six games will be enough to confirm a record 19th league title.</p>
              <p>It is not quite so straightforward given nearest challengers Arsenal and Chelsea are amongst their opponents, whilst a tricky trip to Newcastle follows three days after Saturday's FA Cup semi-final with Manchester City at Wembley.</p>
              <p>The calendar will flood Sir Alex Ferguson's mind as he juggles the hunt for silverware on three fronts.</p>
              <p>However, the United boss will not allow such matters to bother his players, who are now expected to think about Tuesday's Champions League tie with Chelsea and nothing else.</p>
              <p>"It is a classic cliche but we literally are just chalking off one game at a time," said O'Shea.</p>
              <p>"The good thing is we feel so confident, especially at home.</p>
              <p>"We have only dropped two points at Old Trafford this season and that day, against West Brom, was very disappointing.</p>
              <p>"It would be very special if we could finish off the season keeping that record."</p>
              <p>Fulham boss Mark Hughes, who knows as well as anyone the drive that Ferguson brings to his team, was bold enough to declare his old team "champions-elect" as he assessed an incredible 18th defeat from Fulham's last 19 trips to Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>"I think they are going to win it," he said.</p>
              <p>"They have six games left and it is very easy for them because they know exactly what they have to do."</p>
              <p>O'Shea will hope to play a meaningful part after recovering from the hamstring injury he suffered during the second leg of the last-16 Champions League encounter with Marseille last month to make his 26th appearance of the season.</p>
              <p>"I am back a week or two ahead of schedule," revealed the Republic of Ireland international.</p>
              <p>"I just worked very hard with the physios and thankfully, they were able to get me back that bit quicker.</p>
              <p>"I was just a little bit cautious today because I didn't want to go hell for leather so soon.</p>
              <p>"It was a great game to get my confidence back and give the manager an option for the games ahead."</p>
              <p>Having made eight changes to his starting line-up yesterday, a similar number can be expected on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Probably more than any other club remaining in the competition, United will be wary of Chelsea's ability to complete a comeback.</p>
              <p>After all, a repeat of the outcome from the Londoners last visit to Old Trafford, a 2-1 triumph 12 months ago, would be enough to take them through.</p>
              <p>The statistics favour United though.</p>
              <p>On seven of their last 10 meetings at Old Trafford, Ferguson's side gained a result that would put them into the last four, whilst they have never lost a two-legged Champions League tie having won the away leg first.</p>
              <p>"You have to get excited about games such as this," said O'Shea.</p>
              <p>"That is what you train all year for. You want to get to the latter stages of competitions. It is perfect."</p>

              <p class="art-txt-first">Manchester United winger Nani has admitted he is "disappointed" not to have been nominated for the PFA Player of the Year award.</p>
              <p>Nani was a surprise omission from the seven candidates for the senior award despite being nominated for the Young Player of the Year award.</p>
              <p>Nani made it 18 assists for the season after setting up both goals in Saturday's win over Fulham and the 24-year-old admits he is upset not to be in running for the top prize.</p>
              <p>"I think I have been doing well, so I am disappointed not to be there," said Nani.</p>
              <p>"But there's still a lot of work to do this season. I am strong and hope to focus on my improvements every season and I hope to have more opportunities.</p>
              <p>"I don't like to speak about other players or people who make decisions. If I want to be there, I have to show that on the pitch.</p>
              <p>"Of course, everyone has an opinion, and I hope next time people will look more to me and what I am doing, if I am doing well."</p>
