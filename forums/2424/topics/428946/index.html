              <p><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester United" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united"><span style="color: #005689;">Manchester United</span></a> may very well win the European Cup again this year, but they would be without hope in the final if glamour were the decisive factor. There can be no prospect of rivalling Barcelona or Real Madrid on that score. This, however, is a situation very pleasing to <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Sir Alex Ferguson" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/sir-alex-ferguson"><span style="color: #005689;">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></a>. His approach to winning the first leg of the semi-final in Gelsenkirchen was dependent on organisation and maturity, even if that did not stop the side from being <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2011/apr/26/schalke-manchester-united-champions-league"><span style="color: #005689;">greatly superior to Schalke during the 2-0 victory</span></a>.</p>
              <p>In the broad context of football history, it is still a little odd to witness a painstaking United. Over so long a history, the club has had line-ups with all sorts of characteristics, but the sides that stick in the mind were addicted to risk as much as flair. The apotheosis of that came in 1999, when United reversed the whole course of the final in stoppage time to beat Bayern Munich.</p>
              <p>For such a club, the current record-breaking is as disconcerting as it impressive. United have completed all their away matches in this tournament without conceding a goal. In addition, it has been unusual for the opposition even to look as if they are on the verge of such a breakthrough, particularly since the goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar is reliable in pulling off a save after a long stretch in which taking kick-outs has been his main activity.</p>
              <p>Schalke themselves dwindled to being the moderate side that the Bundesliga has known this season. Had it not been for <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/gallery/2011/apr/26/champions-league-schalke-manchester-united"><span style="color: #005689;">the marvellous shot-stopping of Manuel Neuer</span></a> the return leg would have been even more of a formality. United's command soon became entrenched and it depended on combined efforts rather than individualism.</p>
              <p>The side is close to the peak of the sport yet there are virtually no stars. That situation is all the more accentuated because an out-of-touch Nani has been supplanted by Antonio Valencia, whose drive and delivery on the flank has rewarding practicality. Nonetheless, a mental adjustment is needed before it can be accepted that United, of all clubs, rely first on efficiency.</p>
              <p>With Cristiano Ronaldo gone to Real Madrid, there is no glitz. It thereby comes as a relief that <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Wayne Rooney" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/wayne-rooney"><span style="color: #005689;">Wayne Rooney</span></a> is recovering the whole gamut of his skill, setting up Ryan Giggs for the opener before scoring on his own account in Gelsenkirchen. But Rooney, to his likely relief, cannot be a matinee idol in the manner of Ronaldo.</p>
              <p>Giggs himself can cast his mind back to a time when he was young and liable to be mobbed whenever he left the house. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2011/apr/27/javier-hernandez-manchester-united"><span style="color: #005689;">If anyone has a taste for attention it may well be Javier Hern√°ndez</span></a>, and few could begrudge that pleasure in a newcomer agog at his own impact after a relatively cheap transfer.</p>
              <p>United are more of an ensemble now and if there is less individualism to make the audience gasp, there is a wider range of contributions. The much doubted Michael Carrick, for instance, distributed the ball excellently against Schalke, even if the opposition forgot to hassle him.</p>
              <p>It is tricky to tell who will catch the eye next. Ferguson has ample alternatives and can turn to them with confidence in, for instance, the Premier League. Chris Smalling has proved trustworthy there and the presently injured Dimitar Berbatov has contributed greatly to the goals tally on that front.</p>
              <p>Even so, the presence of those squad players is utilised to ensure that the line-up he has in mind for the <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Champions League" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/championsleague"><span style="color: #005689;">Champions League</span></a> gets some rest, particularly the players who run most and hardest. When it counts, there is continuity and an accompanying expectation of consistency. The line-up for the past three European matches has only varied in the right-back berth. Rafael was in the post at Stamford Bridge, John O'Shea took over for the return with Chelsea and Fabio came in against Schalke.</p>
              <p>Even those adjustments do not necessarily reflect ambivalence about the candidates since O'Shea, for instance, is injured at the moment. There is a justified belief that United must still replenish their stock of talent. Poignantly, Paul Scholes looks as if he has reached the moment where no amount of quick-wittedness will compensate for a body slowing down.</p>
              <p>Gary Neville drew his own conclusion about the trajectory of his career and retired mid-season, but there has been little consternation at United and the transitions have not been too disturbing, even if last season was largely forgettable. Rivals will envy the side's current advance, wince a little at the knowledge that the rebuilding is well underway and dread the recruits still to arrive at Old Trafford.</p>
