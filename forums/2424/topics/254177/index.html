            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://i133.photobucket.com/albums/q60/zocos/ryan_giggs.jpg"><br><br><strong>MANCHESTER (Reuters) - Record-breaking Manchester United midfielder Ryan Giggs can play for a further two seasons, manager Alex Ferguson believes. Giggs, 33, became the first player to win nine English league titles when he helped United to clinch their first championship since 2003 last weekend. And after another outstanding season's service for the club where he made his debut in 1991, Ferguson sees no end to Giggs's prolific United career.</strong><br><br>"He's been amazing in terms of having the capacity to keep wanting to do it," Ferguson told reporters. "I think Ryan will play for the next two years because he has looked after himself and the type of physique he has got. "He has retained, I think quite remarkably, most of his pace. "He is maybe not as grease lightning he was as a 17-year-old lad but he is still quick enough and he still retains that great balance to beat men in tight situations."<br><br>Wales international Giggs, whose 714 United appearances place him second behind the record of 752 set by Bobby Charlton, is no longer the out-and-out left winger he has been for much of his United career.<br><br><img src="http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u189/zomanu/GiggsFerg.jpg"><br><br><strong>CREATIVE PLAYER</strong><br><br>But he continues to exert a major influence as a creative player from a more central role, where Ferguson sees his future. "It suits Ryan at his age to be in a far more protected position. For 15 years or so he has been tramping up and down that touchline and there's no players in the Premier League have done that," Ferguson said.  "There have been games I have played him wide left this season but mainly we seem him as a central player, either central midfield or a player who can play off the front."<br><br>Much of United's success this season has been attributed to the attacking flair of Wayne Rooney, 21, and Cristiano Ronaldo, 22. But the new champions have also been well served by their senior players and, like Giggs, Ferguson expects them to continue to lead by example. "He (Giggs) and Paul Scholes and Gary Neville should be no problem for the next two years," Ferguson said. "Nev, as a defender can make it to 36. Paul Scholes has done remarkably well coming back. He has had a great season and should be fine for two years... "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has given me 11 goals this season and if he gives me another 11 next season we will be dancing. There are good contributions there."<br><br>United will receive the Premier League trophy after their final game against West Ham United at Old Trafford on Sunday. Ferguson will have half an eye on next Saturday's FA Cup final against Chelsea but feels an obligation to field a stronger line-up than the one that drew at Chelsea in mid-week with West Ham fighting to avoid relegation, along with Wigan and Sheffield United, who play each other. "It will be a strong team to represent ourselves in a proper way and be fair to everyone," Ferguson said.<br><br>United will again be without injured captain Gary Neville, while Louis Saha looks set to miss the rest of the season along with Mikel Silvestre and Ji-sung Park.<br><br></div>
