              <p>For so long Sir Alex Ferguson has given no clear indication when exactly he shall retire from club management, but earlier today - and as reported by <strong>Goal.com</strong> - the wily Scot expressed that he would sketch his last chalk-board once he has claimed a further two European Cups.</p>
              <p>That
              only leaves the question as to who has the capacity, the nuance, the
              know-how, to succeed a man who has overseen a lengthy period of
              unrivalled dominance in the Premier League. Many have pin-pointed former Manchester United sons Mark Hughes, Roy Keane, and Steve Bruce as noble contenders. Others foresee Martin O'Neill as the man to push the Old Trafford outfit on.</p>
              <p>Former Chelsea manager and current Internazionale boss Jose Mourinho,
              though, could be in line to become the first non-British and non-Irish
              person to command control of one of the most famous names in world
              football, as Ferguson today dropped a hint that it is the charismatic
              Portuguese, who he holds in the highest of regards.</p>
              <p>Regarding his successor, Sir Alex told <em>CNN</em>, "I am glad it is not my decision. But whoever it is, it needs to be someone with experience.</p>
              <p>"Manchester United is a massive club," he said. "The club I joined in 1986 is nothing 
                like the one it is today."</p>
              <p><strong>Something Special</strong></p>
              <p>Referencing specific candidates who could execute the <span class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;"><span style="color: #0464d1;"><span class="kLink" style="color: #0464d1 ! important; font-family: Verdana,Arial; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">job</span></span></span> to a high quality, Ferguson nominated a man whom he has a certain
              amount of affection for. However, he also tempered his words with
              caution.</p>
              <p>"I like Jose Mourinho. He is a good guy and someone I get on very
              well with. But people forget how quickly the game changes. The job of a
              football manager is a pretty fragile one.</p>
              <p>"You can be on the very top of the world and then after two defeats you are 
                the worst team ever. Hopefully I will be here for another two or three years. Who knows what will 
                have happened in that time.</p>
              <p>"Thinking about Jose Mourinho or Arsene Wenger or whoever is going to be 
                impossible."</p>
              <p>Many have speculated that Ferguson will retire once he ensures
              Manchester United succeed Liverpool as the most successful English
              club, although his age have more of a say.</p>
              <p>"I am 67 now," he said. "At the moment I am still healthy and enjoying my job. If that was different I 
                would quit immediately.</p>
              <p>"But winning a specific trophy does not come into it. I would love this
              club to win more European trophies. We definitely should have at least
              a couple more.</p>
              <p>"But just by being in so many semi-finals and quarter-finals, it shows you how 
                hard it is to win," he concluded.</p>

              If Mourinho is to take over, he needs to overhaul his philosophy ie change from defensive to attacking brand of footballl.
              
              one moment you defend, next moment you counterattack, but I doubted so he will change. He only gauge success as trophies won at the end of the season, entertainment or not boring. He might think, whats the use of playing attractive, sexy football if you dun win trophies. he will always play with 2 defensive midfielders to protect the back four.

              <p>it is important that man u continue to dominate english football (as far as the club management are concern), attacking or non-attacking football.</p>
              <p>a lot will be expected of whoever takes over.</p>

              <p>Fergie has mentioned Wenger and Mourinho as the more experience ones... Then there is also Everton's and Villa's managers too... Whatever it is, the guy coming in must be good...</p>
              <p>While I have no doubt Wenger and Mourinho will be good choices, I am just a little concern about Wenger's style... Football wise, tactics, all good but his obsession with trying to win with youngsters by experimenting at Arsenal is rather concerning... Ever since he started his experiment, Arsenal has not won anything... He has to seriously move away from this policy if he joins United...</p>
              <p>Mourinho, well... let put it this way... He is a good manager but a problematic one as well... I remember something very strange during his time at Chelsea... and that is, while he was managing Chelsea, so many fans from other clubs were supporting Man Utd to win the EPL... Even Pool fans... That in itself is just unbelievable... lol</p>
              <p>Their disliked for him was so strong that they were happy to support United just to see him beaten... If Mourinho gets the job, one thing I belief is United won't be out of the top 3 every year... The guy is good right down to little details... Another thing is, United won't have Jose as a rival in the EPL... But the most likely thing I believe will happen again is... He will pissed Rafa and Wenger off again if he comes back... The truth is... The guy is really annoying... He can actually make a dull Serie A more vibrant... Now that is amazing... lol</p>
