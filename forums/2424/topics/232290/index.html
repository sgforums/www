            <div class='col-md body'><strong>IF PREMIERSHIP bosses need answers as to how Paul Scholes became Manchester UnitedÂ’s midfield king, perhaps they should ask a Salford van driver called George. </strong><br><br>George Switzer was part of the famous all-conquering Red Devils youth team of 1992 which included Scholes, Ryan Giggs, David Beckham, Nicky Butt, Gary Neville and Robbie Savage.<br><br>Led by coach Eric Harrison, the United babes destroyed everyone to land the FA Youth Cup, the Lancashire League Division One title and the Lancashire Youth Cup in the same season.<br><br>While the likes of Butt, Becks and Giggs began to prove themselves, baby-faced Scholes struggled to make his mark. Scholes suffered from breathing problems as a nipper and started at left-back with Switzer in midfield. Only when Switzer switched with Scholes did United start to see the birth of a midfield phenomenon.<br><br><strong>The rest is history.</strong><br><br>Scholes went on to become one of the Old Trafford greats and is enjoying a stunning Premiership season Â— while Switzer failed to make the grade and now plays non-league at weekends while continuing his day job as a courier firm van driver. The 33-year-old said: Â“Paul Scholes had a few health problems when he was growing up.<br><br><img src="http://i133.photobucket.com/albums/q60/zocos/YoungManuteam.jpg"><br><br>Â“He had breathing problems and he was quite short. They tried playing him at left-back for a while but it didnÂ’t work out so I ended up playing there. Â“For the final of the FA Youth Cup against Crystal Palace he was on the bench, but before long he was playing in the first-team in midfield and he hasnÂ’t looked back since.<br><br>Â“We didnÂ’t have anyone who was a natural left-back so they tried Scholesy there for a few games. Â“In one game he got a bang on the head and they moved me into the left-back spot even though IÂ’d never played there before.<br><br>Â“I was quite small then but Scholesy was even smaller. And after he got that bang they didnÂ’t fancy him as a left-back any more. They were a bit worried about him because he was very small and they were hoping he would fill out and become a bit stronger.<br><br>Â“He was very quiet on and off the pitch. He would always arrive with Nicky Butt because they lived in the same area, but Nicky Butt was always the one with plenty to say. Â“Scholesy was very shy just like he still is today and you wouldnÂ’t always notice him. Â“Obviously Alex Ferguson obviously saw something in him and they persevered with him.<br><br>It wasnÂ’t just Scholes who appeared anything but a superstar of the future. Switzer added: Â“David Beckham was a good player but not a great player. He never looked outstanding, but look how he progressed. Â“Nicky Butt was the best player in the team. He was like Bryan Robson in his pomp and in many ways he overshadowed Becks at that time.<br><br>Â“We were a really dedicated group of players. Â“Even when we were just starting out we would only go out on a Saturday night after a match. Â“We would have a few beers but nothing serious like some of the young players today.<br><br>Â“They were all desperate to play for the first-team and they made every sacrifice to make their dream happen. It never happened for me, but it wasnÂ’t for the want of trying. People donÂ’t believe me when I tell them IÂ’m not bitter about how things turned out, but IÂ’m not.<br><br>Â“IÂ’m just glad so many players from that team turned out to have great careers and that many of them are still going strong today. Â“Even people like Robbie Savage, who didnÂ’t make an appearance for the first-team, went on to have a great career. IÂ’m genuinely delighted for them all.Â”<br><br>Switzer was released by Ferguson in 1993 after 10 years at the club. He said: Â“I joined Manchester United when I was eight years old. Â“They got rid of me 10 years later and I never even got a testimonial! Â“One afternoon Alex Ferguson called me into his office and told me they were letting me go. He said I was too short to be a left-back. I was devastated. Fergie gave me a hug and his telephone number. Â“He told me that if ever I needed anything to give him a call. He was great, but I was heartbroken.<br><br>Â“IÂ’d supported United all my life and whenever you leave Man United itÂ’s always going to be a step down. Â“But I still support the team, I sometimes go to watch matches at Old Trafford and IÂ’m delighted theyÂ’re doing so well this season. Â“They just keep going and I canÂ’t believe that 15 years ago I was playing in the same team as them. It seems like it was yesterday.Â”<br><br>Switzer still struts his stuff with Irlam FC in the Manchester League. And the dream lives on in his seven-year-old son, Keenan, who is already on Manchester CityÂ’s books. Switzer said: Â“Keenan is a United fan, but I wonÂ’t care if he does well at City.Â” Â“It was the right decision because from about the age of 16 he filled out and developed into an amazing player. HeÂ’s certainly made a good living out of it.Â”<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Scholes seems like the smallest on the team photo... sitting second from last.
