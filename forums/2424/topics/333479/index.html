              <h1>Tevez Deal In Doubt As United Eye Costa</h1>
              <h2>Doubts over Carlos Tevez’s future at Manchester United continue to grow with the latest reports suggesting that Sir Alex Ferguson will attempt to sign Brazilian teenager Douglas Costa instead of tying down a deal for Tevez.</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/36729_news.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The Argentinean striker joined United from West Ham on a two year loan deal in 2007 and, despite both parties claiming a permanent contract would be forthcoming, no contract has yet been put in place.</strong></p>
              <p>This despite the former Hammer enjoying a successful first season at Old Trafford. He was a virtual ever present in the squad and scored 14 league goals as United claimed both the Premier League and the Champions League title last season.</p>
              <p>However, according to the <em>News of the World</em>, Sir Alex Ferguson is determined to sign 18-year-old Costa who currently plays for Brazilian side Gremio.</p>
              <p>Any transfer fee for the young Brazilian is likely to be in the region of £20 million which,  claims the paper, would leave no funds available to secure a deal for Tevez.</p>
              <p>However, United are likely to face stiff competition in the race for Costa. Both Real Madrid and Barcelona are also reported to be interested in signing the teenager who looks to have his pick of the top clubs.</p>
              <p>Yet the Red Devils already have number of Brazilians installed at Old Trafford, including Anderson, Rodrigo Possebon and Rafel and Fabio Da Silva, which means a move to the Premier League could tempt the young Gremio star.</p>
              <p>Of course should he decide to move to Old Trafford, there would be no shortage of takers for Tevez who has proved an excellent signing both at West Ham and Manchester United.</p>

              <p>To be honest, I won't mind if United don't close the Tevez deal... Not that he is not a good player or anything but rather if circumstance makes it difficult for them to settle the deal ($32m) then I would say let Tevez go... $32m is a lot for a player very similar to Rooney. And if I have to choose either one of them, I would go for Rooney without a doubt.</p>
              <p>Sometimes managing a football club as big as United is not just about buying players or keeping them, More importantly, its putting a squad together that is able to win and yet to balance the books...</p>

              <h1>United Expected To Bag Tevez No Matter What</h1>
              <h2>Contrary to worried whispers, reports now suggest that Carlos Tevez will soon be a bona-fide Manchester United player come hell or high water...</h2>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><em>The Manchester Evening News </em>reports that Carlos Tevez will sign for Manchester United on a permanent basis at some point this season for a fee of around £25m.</strong><br><br>The man described by Maradona as and "Argentine prophet for the 21st century" is set to profit from United's financial clout.<br><br>Rumours had suggested that the credit crunch had thrown up all kinds of doubts surrounding his transfer, with Red Devils chiefs keen to negotiate a cheaper fee for the 24-year-old Argentine.<br><br>Now, though, it appears that United will press ahead with the deal, despite the financial fears gripping football and the population at large.<br><br>United have a £32m agreement with the striker's third-party owners Media Sport International and Just Sport Inc. However, it's now understood that money will be deducted from that fee because the Reds have been paying over £3m to register the bullish forward.<br><br>United's interest in £20m-rated Gremio starlet Douglas Costa has been used to fuel rumours suggesting United are having second thoughts over the Tevez fee.<br><br>Problems with AIG - the sinking American insurance giant who sponsor United - are also a cause for concern, but United are now expected to splash out on Tevez regardless.</p>
