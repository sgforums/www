              <p><em>Owen's injury-time winner gave <span style="color: #000000;">Manchester United</span> victory in a staggering seven-goal derby extravaganza against </em><span style="color: #000000;"><em>City</em><br></span><br></p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">MICHAEL OWEN hopes he has proven his dedication to Manchester United with his dramatic last-gasp winner against Manchester City.</h2>
              <p class="article">The England striker played eight years at arch-rivals Liverpool, before his career stalled at Real Madrid and Newcastle. But the 29-year-old, signed on a free transfer this summer by Alex Ferguson, scored his second goal for the club to seal a 4-3 derby win.</p>
              <p class="article">And asked whether that would confirm hero status with the Old Trafford faithful, Owen said: "Yes, if there was any doubt before then maybe.</p>
              <p class="article">"It was always going to create noise when I joined but even if the fans didn't take to me you're never going to pass up an opportunity to play for team like this."</p>
              <p class="article">Despite needing his late intervention to seal all three points, Owen believes the win was richly deserved. He added: "We dominated and the lads played well for a lot of the game.</p>
              <p class="article">"There were individual mistakes but over the years before I was here the defence has been fantastic." Two-goal Darren Fletcher added: "It was an unbelievable match, we showed great character to come back. "The goals were mistakes but we look at the positives — we showed character to the end."</p>

              <p>Pool fans should stop being bitter cos Rafa lost his chance to sign Owen despite Gerrard and Carragher pleading with him to do so... and it would be a greater lost should Torres gets injured... Cos they have no one even decent after him... Owen was just fantastic, as Fergie has said, he has been training very hard trying to get back to his best again...</p>
              <p>Not that he was not good at Newcastle, the club was just badly manage from top to bottom thats all... There is no need to feel sad for Newcastle, cos they deserved it... They had lots of money, paid high salaries to lots of their players... But it still didn't made any difference cos the management was simply too poor. Sacking Keegan was a poor decision, employing Chris Hughton then Alan Shearer 2 totally inexperienced former players as managers during a difficult time was even more worst... And despite being injured during his time at Newcastle, he was still one of their top scorers and had a better goal per match ratio to even Tevez at United...   </p>
              <p>The big difference to Tevez it seems looked rather obvious last night... Tevez had his chances and he didn't take it, Owen just had one chance and he made it count... Tevez is a very good and hard working player, but his finishing is still not at the best, in other words... He need others to create more opportunities than Owen to score...</p>
              <p>Anyway, with this injury time winning goal, Owen will forever be in the history books of United... The number 7 is indeed special...</p>

              <p>well, whether he is a jinx or not, results will show.</p>
              <p>Currently, if not for him, MU won't have 3pts even if the ref decides to go into 100mins. so for all MU fans, we are happy he signed for us.</p>
              <p>Also, given the fact, he was on a free transfer, and willing to even cut his salary, his former club did not want him, and only MU believed enough to sign him, making a mockery of the "u'll never be alone" thingy. So to pool fans, I would just "luf" it, if he does the same thing in anfield. Up yours, Rafa..</p>
