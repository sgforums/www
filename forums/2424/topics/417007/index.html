              <p><strong>Manchester United fans may have nicknamed the City of Manchester Stadium the “Council House” – but the Reds were once offered the chance of making Eastlands their home.</strong></p>
              <p>United were approached about the possibility of ­returning to their roots in the east of the city when Manchester was awarded the 2002 Commonwealth Games, according to a new book.</p>
              <p>It was only the ­intervention of Sir Alex Ferguson that halted the plan – even though Manchester city council were prepared to build an 80,000-capacity stadium to bring the club back to the city of their birth.</p>
              <p>Author Gary James ­unearthed the astonishing blueprint to take United back into Manchester from Trafford for the updated version of his book ­‘Manchester – A Football ­History.’</p>
              
              <div class="news_mpu_article"></div>
              <p>James reveals how United were tempted to quit Old ­Trafford because the famous old stadium could not meet demand for tickets in the late 1990s with its 55,000 ­capacity.</p>
              <p>A contingency plan was even put in place that would allow ­United to only play big Champions League ­fixtures at the new ­stadium.</p>
              <p>Labour MP Graham Stringer, who was leader of Manchester City Council at the time, is quoted as saying: “Discussions with United were serious and went to a high level – the highest level.</p>
              <p>“The view was that if United could move to the stadium then the capacity could be around 80,000.</p>
              <p>“It seemed perfectly logical in the 90s that United should consider the move. Of course, there were some significant issues to overcome.</p>
              <p>“The biggest was ­undoubtedly the significance of Old Trafford to supporters.</p>
              <p>“I fully understand why United decided not to make a permanent move, but Old ­Trafford’s capacity was too small. The idea developed that perhaps European games could be played at the new stadium.</p>
              <p>“United would play at Old Trafford for ­domestic fixtures and move to the new stadium for European games.”</p>
              <p>Ferguson, though, felt the plan would backfire – as it did on Arsenal when they took Champions League games to Wembley from Highbury to attract bigger crowds.</p>
              <p>Stringer adds: “Alex ­Ferguson was involved in the discussions and I think he, quite rightly, considered the impact on players.</p>
              <p>“The possibility of switching venue every few days could possibly disrupt players.” City moved to Eastlands in 2003 after spending 80 years at Maine Road.</p>
              <p>Having such a state-of-the-art stadium was a big attraction to Sheikh Mansour when he instantly made City the richest club in the world with his 2008 takeover.</p>
              <p>But the council plot will come as a big shock to both Reds and Blues in ­Manchester.</p>
              <p>United supporters, who were founded as Newton Heath, ridicule City for having a 48,000-capacity stadium that is still owned by the council.</p>
              <p>But City fans revel in the fact Old Trafford is situated outside Manchester city boundaries – the reason why the ‘Welcome to Manchester’ poster designed when ­Carlos Tevez joined the club from United caused such a stir.</p>
