              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson has denied Javier Hernandez is suffering from a long-term brain condition after the Manchester United striker was hospitalised with concussion.</strong></p>
              <p>Hernandez was taken to hospital and kept in overnight after being struck on the head by a ball during a training session in New Jersey on Tuesday night.</p>
              <p>The doctor at Hernandez's former club, Chivas Guadalajara of Mexico, claimed the forward has suffered from similar problems in the past and had received treatment for them.</p>
              <p>However, United boss Ferguson said this was the first he'd heard of the possibility of a pre-existing condition, but said the 23-year-old would be given as much time as it takes for him to recover.</p>

              <p>"I'm not aware of that," said the Scot, when it was suggested Hernandez had suffered from neurological problems in the past. "This is a straightforward concussion.</p>
              <p>"He was hit on the top of the head with the ball in the early evening.</p>
              <p>"When he was back at the hotel, taking his meal, he felt sick and he <em>was</em> sick. He had headaches, so we removed him to the hospital where he stayed in overnight.</p>
              <p>"They did the MRI scans and that was all-clear. They released him yesterday and he travelled down [from New Jersey to Washington, DC] today.</p>
              <p>"Concussion is something you don't want to happen but usually time heals that and we'll give Chicharito plenty of time.</p>
              <p>"We won't be rushing him back. I'll only bring him back when the doctor tells me I can bring him back."</p>
              <p>In reports from Mexico, Chivas' doctor Rafael Ortega said Hernandez had fallen victim to acute migraines.</p>
              <p>"I remember in his time as a youth player, he suffered from acute migraines," said Ortega.</p>
              <p>"Originally it manifested itself as a headache, but afterwards the symptoms disappeared.</p>
              <p>"We had some studies done on him but that was six years ago and he has done well since.</p>
              <p>"I don't know if there is a connection between the two situations. I'm not up to date with the current situation, we would have to speak to a neurologist.</p>
              <p>"I don't know if this can affect him in the future. I'm sure United will send him to a specialist and the situation will be resolved."</p>
              <p>Hernandez, who scored 20 goals in his debut season last term, was taken ill at the team hotel and was rushed to hospital after he began vomiting.</p>
              <p>After spending a night under medical supervision, and a series of tests, Hernandez was allowed back to the team hotel.</p>
              <p>He missed United's 4-0 win over an MLS All-Stars team on Wednesday and did not fly with the squad to Washington DC yesterday, instead being driven the 250 miles to the final destination of the tour.</p>
              <p>United take on Barcelona tomorrow in a re-run of last season's Champions League final, which Pep Guardiola's Spanish side won 3-1.</p>
              <p>"Barcelona's performances and feats over the last two or three years have elevated them in everyone's mind. They're the best team currently in the world," said Fergie.</p>
              <p>"I'm quite happy to be in second place at this moment in time, because it means we are the nearest challengers to them.</p>
              <p>"Our challenge is to get to that level. It's not just about the football team - it's the philosophy, what they believe in, how they coach, how they produce young players.</p>
              <p>"We have the same drive ourselves to produce young players. If I thought they'd play all their young players on Saturday then I'd play all mine and it would be a fascinating game."</p>
