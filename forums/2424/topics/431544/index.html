              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">MANCHESTER UNITED legend Paul Scholes has retired from football.</h2>
              <p>The midfielder, 36, decided to hang up his boots after growing increasingly dissatisfied with his bit-part role.</p>
              <p>Scholes — who scored 150 goals in 675 appearances — will take up a coaching role at United next season.</p>
              <p>He said: "This was not a decision I have taken lightly but I feel now is the right time for me to stop playing.</p>
              <p>"I can honestly say that playing football is all I have ever wanted to do and to have had such a long and successful career at Manchester United has been a real honour.</p>
              <p>"To have been part of the team that helped the Club reach that 19th title is a great privilege.</p>
              <p>"I would like to thank the fans for their tremendous support throughout my career. I would also like to thank all the coaches and players that I have worked with over the years.</p>
              <p>"But most of all I would like to thank Alex Ferguson for being such a great manager.</p>
              <p>"From the day I joined the club his door has always been open and I know this team will go on to win many more trophies under his leadership."</p>
              <p>The Red Devils have also announced Scholes will have a testimonial match at Old Trafford in August.</p>

              <p>United boss Ferguson praised the ex-England star, who has spent his entire 17-year career at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Scholes will work alongside Ferguson as a coach at United from next season.</p>
              <p>The Scot said: "What more can I say about Paul Scholes that I haven't said before. We are going to miss a truly unbelievable player.</p>
              <p>"Paul has always been fully committed to this club and I am delighted he will be joining the coaching staff from next season.</p>
              <p>"Paul has always been inspirational to players of all ages and we know that will continue in his new role."</p>
              <p>Scholes' former United and England team-mate Gary Neville used Twitter to hail the 36-year-old.</p>
              <p>He said: "Paul Scholes - The best! Great player, person, friend!"</p>
              <p>Current United star Rio Ferdinand added: "Paul Scholes aka Sat Nav went from a scoring midfielder to a dictator of the game (changed his game while still at top of the game). Genius.</p>
              <p>"Going to miss training with him and his cold cutting and dry comments on the bike while warming up next to me on anyone who deserves it!"</p>
              <p>Three Lions starlet Jack Wilshere also gave his thoughts on Scholes' retirement.</p>
              <p>He tweeted: "Sad to hear Paul Scholes is retiring, what a player!</p>
              <p>"Top class and a great role model for any young English midfield player!"</p>
              <p>Barcelona defender Gerard Pique, who also played for United, said: "One of the best players I've ever seen in my life! Spectacular on training!! Playing with him was a joy!"</p>
