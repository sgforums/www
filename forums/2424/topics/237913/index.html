            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;"> Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson believes clubs are being forced to look elsewhere for future talent due to Academy restrictions.<br><br>The Scottish tactician is keen to add Britain's best and brightest to the Red Devils' academy, although travel restrictions limit who the club can sign.<br><br>FA guidelines state youngsters under 12 have to live within an hour's travel time of the club and that is forcing the likes of United, Arsenal and Liverpool to look elsewhere.<br><br>"The academy system I don't think is working, because there's an hour's restriction on travel," stated Ferguson.<br><br>"Manchester United, and, particularly Arsenal have to look somewhere else and other clubs are doing it, now Liverpool too are venturing into Spain in a big way.<br><br>"We're having to look world wide to get the best young players into our club, because the expectation and need for Manchester United to do well, so that's a big problem.<br><br>"That needs a lot of soul-searching from the people who operate the academies. Something has to be done I think. It's in danger of falling apart."<br><br>Arsenal have often been criticised for preferring foreigners over home-grown talent, but Ferguson believes the fault lies with the system - not Arsene Wenger.<br><br>"Your obvious slant is towards Arsenal," he continued on the lack of British talent in the Premiership. "Arsene Wenger is very strong on French football and African players.<br><br>"Why should he not take advantage? The problem doesn't lie with Arsene Wenger, it's with the system.<br><br>"When the academies were set up, Howard Wilkinson said England would win the World Cup within 10 years. Well, they have been going eight now and I can't see it."<br><br>Gary Neville recently hit out at agents and Ferguson has revealed an agent had to be banned from the club's Carrington training ground for 'tapping up' youngsters.<br><br>"In an ideal world he (Neville) is correct. There's nothing wrong with players taking advice.<br><br>"I say investigate the payments they have. They're taking a lot of money out of football, that's obvious.<br><br>"So much so that they are able to buy players. That's a dangerous precedent because then they can control the market.<br><br>"If they have a responsible attitude towards the industry then there's nothing wrong with that.<br><br>"We had a situation recently with an agent coming to the academy and tapping up young players from 12 years of age.<br><br>"We barred him - so he started to wait outside the academy picking out the cars of the parents, stopping them and tapping them up."</span><br><br>So many restrictions for wat??..!!</div>
