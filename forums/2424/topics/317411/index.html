              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson is ready to beat Chelsea and Arsenal - by signing Welsh wizard Aaron Ramsey for £5million.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">The
              Manchester United boss opened talks to land the 17-year-old from FA Cup
              finalists Cardiff City just 24 hours after clinching the Premier League
              title.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">Ramsey's advisers
              are keen and the transfer is expected to be officially announced after
              Cardiff's Wembley date on Saturday. Midfield starlet Ramsey is viewed
              as the long-term replacement for Paul Scholes.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">It
              will be a blow for Arsene Wenger, who wants the superkid to join his
              youthful ranks at Arsenal. And Chelsea have also been looking at Ramsey
              as a squad man and one for the future.</p>
              <div id="mpu1" class="ad0 ad-mpu" style="display: block;"></div>
              <p>But
              Avram Grant has not moved as swiftly as his Champions League final
              opponents. United could offer Cardiff a player or two on loan next
              season as a sweetener</p>

              <p>if any of you watched football focus on tues, you may have your answer.</p>
              <p>due to saha's injuries, SAF has to come out with new playing style, that doesn't require an out and out strikers, and with that, he needs energetic, young midfielders.</p>
              <p>now, we all know how new additions,owen, tevez, anderson, nani adds to the team.</p>
              <p>hey, they weren't suppose to be playing (anderson, nani), but due to circumstances, they were called in. The key is that they are exposed to EPL at this young age, imagine them 2-3 or even 4 yrs later, they will be seasonsed players.</p>
              <p>Same as this ramsey, buy him now, expose him to EPL, and then slowly build him up. Yes, we may have carrick, owen, anderson, fletcher, but none yet has the qualities of our beloved Scholes. I think this Ramsey fella is groomed.</p>
              <p>And what better way to come into team where everyone can impart some skills/knowledges to new guys.</p>
              <p>I totally agree with SAF's mentality of buying young and then grooming them up.</p>

              <p><br>if I Am not wrong, i don't think they can just step into UK and play.</p>
              <p>I believe they have to meet some criteria about number of games played in national teams and thus these two won't qualify.</p>
              <p>I believe they are going to come in next season, be loaned out to feeder clubs and then bring in later.</p>

              <p><br>Yes we have Owen and Carrick but these 2 are in the mid 20s already... Or to be closer, about 27 yrs old... Given that the midfield is an area that need lots of running and energy, in 3 to 4 yrs time, these 2 won't be able to do the business like they used to or worse, together... This boy at 17 won't go straight into the first team now... If they do get him, he will be placed in the team to gain important experience first from the more senior midfielders... then slowly work himself up...</p>
              <p>Anyway, $5m for a potential star player isn't much these days... and if it doesn't work out, they can always sell him off for roughly that same amount like they have with Richardson, Rossi... But if it work out, imagine the savings they would made...</p>

              <p><br>I find him quite good for his age... Definitely a player with lots of potential... He did brought an extra edge to Cardiff's game when he came on...</p>
              <p>But he is indeed more of a Gerrard type than a Scholes...</p>
              <p>Looks like it will be difficult to find another Scholes... <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/cry.png" alt="cry.png"></p>

              <h1>Ramsey To Snub United?</h1>
              <h2>The latest speculation surrounding Welsh wiz-kid Aaron Ramsey is
              that he is set to reject the chance to join Manchester United this
              summer.</h2>
              <p>The 17-year-old is regarded as one of the most promising youngsters in
              English football, which has prompted United boss Sir Alex Fergusion to
              tempt Cardiff City with a whopping £10million offer.<br><br>United are
              also prepared to loan the 17-year-old back to the Bluebirds immediately
              for a season to help Cardiff manager Dave Jones as he attempt to steer
              the Welsh club back to the top-flight after an absence of 47 years.<br><br>Nevertheless,
              there are unconfirmed reports that Ramsey's parents are unconvinced
              that signing for the talent-stacked English champions is the wisest
              move at this stage of their son's development.</p>

              <h1>Ramsey Keeping Feet On The Ground</h1>
              <h2>Cardiff City's teenage sensation Aaron Ramsey insists that he is
              not about to let all the transfer speculation surrounding him get to
              his head.</h2>
              <p>In fact, the 17-year-old midfield gem was far more eager to talk about
              the prospect of debuting for Wales than the rumours linking him to
              Manchester United, Arsenal and most recently Aston Villa.<br><br>"It has been a fabulous season for me," Ramsey beamed.<br><br>"Breaking
              into the first team at Cardiff is a big enough step for me, but playing
              at Wembley twice and being called up by your country is something that
              dreams are made of."<br><br>"If I do make my Wales debut next week, I know the people close to me will be proud.<br><br>"But
              I'm a Cardiff player and I just concentrate on doing my best for the
              club. People close to me help me keep my feet on the ground.<br><br>"I'm level-headed, so I don't let these sort of things affect me." <br><br>Manchester
              United had been regarded as the favourites to capture Ramsey, who is
              rated at £10million by Cardiff. But the player and his family are not
              convinced that going to Old Trafford would be the best move for him,
              which  could strengthen Arsenal's hand but perhaps Villa even more so.</p>
