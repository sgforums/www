Everyone appears to want a piece of the Portuguese and at a raucous King Fahd Stadium here last night it was the turn of 65,000 Saudi Arabians to catch a glimpse of the man whom many believe to be the best player in the world. </strong><br><br>United were here to play a testimonial against Al Hilal Al Saudi FC in honour of Sami Al Jaber, the former Saudi Arabia striker, but at times it seemed as though the locals had turned up to watch Ronaldo and his absorbing repertoire of tricks and flicks. Even the home teamÂ’s 3-2 win was not as warmly received as the Portugal winger.<br><br>There was a long pause before RonaldoÂ’s name was announced before kick-off and the reception that greeted it was even louder than the one reserved for Al Jaber. Ronaldo, in turn, seemed only too happy to play to the carnival crowd, scoring one goal and setting up another for Carlos TÃ©vez before taking his leave at half-time.<br><br>For Sir Alex Ferguson, the hysteria may be more likely to evoke memories of the adulation that David Beckham received, but while that may be a perturbing thought for the United manager, he is desperate to keep his talisman in the long term, which is why the club are making preparations to suppress attempts to unsettle the player. Real Madrid made their intentions known again last week, when Pedrag Mijatovic, the clubÂ’s sporting director, announced that they would not give up trying to sign Ronaldo.<br><br>United believe that RealÂ’s brazen courting of the player is unacceptable, but while the idea of loading a formal complaint to Fifa has been mooted, the club are thought to be ready to target the Â“outside influencesÂ” whom they believe are to blame for stoking the fires, rather than refer the matter to the sportÂ’s world governing body.<br><br>A well-placed source at United told The Times: Â“Real MadridÂ’s remarks about Cristiano arenÂ’t helpful, but they are getting their information from certain people whose credibility we intend to undermine.Â”<br><br>Although Al Hilal took a nineteenth-minute lead through Yasser Al Ghatane, Ronaldo stamped his authority on proceedings when teeing up TÃ©vez for an equaliser before stealing in at the near post to head home NaniÂ’s corner. Al Jaber made it 2-2 from the penalty spot before Bader Al Khoraeshe won the match with an overhead kick in the 79th minute.<br><br>Daniel Welbeck, a 17-year-old forward making his United debut, should have drawn the visiting team level but missed a penalty in the last minute. Ferguson, seemed more concerned with an illness to Ryan Giggs that ruled out the winger. Giggs had a fever but is expected to be fit for the FA Cup fourth-round tie against Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford on Sunday.<br></div>
