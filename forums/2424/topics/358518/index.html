              <p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson has earmarked Wayne Rooney for the Footballer of the Year gong. </strong></p>
              <p>Rooney's Manchester United team-mate Ryan Giggs
              scooped the PFA Player of the Year award last Sunday and now attention
              turns the Football Writers' award and Ferguson has backed the
              23-year-old to land the honour.</p>
              <p>"I don't think anyone could argue
              with him as Footballer of the Year. He's certainly been consistent
              enough," the United boss said in <em>The Observer</em>.</p>
              <p>Rooney has
              caught the eye of late playing in a wide-left role for the Red Devils
              and Ferguson has been impressed with the manner in which the former
              Everton man has taken on the role.</p>
              <p><span class="main-content">
              </span></p><p>Ferguson added: "Wayne is actually starting to enjoy playing on the left now. He's still scoring goals, but in a different way.</p>
              <p>"Where
              he eventually settles down depends on the make-up of the rest of the
              team, but he's capable of playing anywhere in a forward position and
              the great thing is he's happy to make any position work."</p>
              <p>Rooney
              scored his first Premier League goal against Arsenal as a 16-year-old
              and seven years later the England international is set to face the
              Gunners for a place in the final of the UEFA Champions League on
              Tuesday.</p>
              <p>And Ferguson revealed United were tracking the
              Liverpool-born forward when he was in the Everton academy before
              forking out £26 million to land the former Toffee.</p>
              <p><span class="main-content">
              </span></p><p>"When we signed Wayne, it was a bargain at the time. We knew what we were getting," the Scot said in <em>The News of the World</em>.</p>
              <p>"We had identified him a long time before that. We tried to get him at 14 and then again when he was 16.</p>
              <p>"Eventually
              we had to pay that money for him. I said to him if he had joined us
              earlier he could have had the £26million for himself!</p>
