            <div class='col-md body'>Sir Alex Ferguson is confident United can continue to produce young talent that will rival the renowned Class of Â’92, continuing the tradition at the Old Trafford of developing home-grown talent.<br><br>The Reds boss has always adhered to the blueprint laid down by Sir Matt Busby to coach and craft the clubÂ’s own talent through the youth system.<br><br>Even in footballÂ’s current climate, where money brings in ready-made top talent from anywhere in the world, it is a tradition Sir Alex is not only one he is keen to continue, but one he believes is an intrinsic part of UnitedÂ’s ability to remain at the top.<br><br>Interview in the latest issue of Inside United magazine, he was asked if he thought there would ever be a repeat of a group of players coming through the ranks like the famous Class of Â’92. Â“We certainly hope so,Â” he said. Â“This clubÂ’s history is steeped in the production of young players and I think it would be an insult to the youngsters we have here to suggest that we couldnÂ’t find players of a similar quality Â– although it is difficult.<br><br>Â“Looking back down the years, Sir Matt produced a conveyor belt of exceptional young players Â– and I think weÂ’ve done quite well compared to other clubs in England. We have a great academy system here where the lads can also get a good education.<br><br>Â“There are great facilities and there is no reason why we canÂ’t see more and more exceptional talent coming through and breaking into the first team.Â”<br><br>The process for bringing young players through has changed rapidly down the years. And, in a bid to help the players be fully prepared for first team football, Sir Alex is utilising the tactic of loaning out players more frequently to bridge the gap between the Reserves and the first team.<br><br>United currently have 12 players farmed out to other clubs across Europe. Even though the Reds have players in England, Scotland, Belgium, Holland and Denmark, Sir Alex is kept comprehensively up to date with their progress.<br><br>Â“We have a terrific network of scouts who report on how theyÂ’re doing,Â” he said. Â“Jim Ryan (director of youth football) in particular, he went to Antwerp to watch the lads we have there, so we get full reports on how all the boys are getting on.<br><br>Â“We hear about Chris Eagles, who is at NEC Nijmegen in Holland, while Paul le Guen calls me after each game to tell me how Phil Bardsley and Lee Martin are getting on up at Rangers, and we can watch Ben Foster at Watford Â– heÂ’s doing extremely well Â– and Tim Howard at Everton."<br><br><a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=368166" rel="nofollow">http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&amp;newsid=368166</a></div>
