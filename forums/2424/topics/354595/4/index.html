              <p>Football can be unpredictable. It was not too long ago that we saw liverpool demolish Real and Man U....and now they capitulate on home ground. They have been unbeaten in 14 mths and 32 matches at anfield prior to this.</p>

              <p>And guess what? lol Rafa benitez launched another tirade at feruguson again before the match. Hahaha...everytime he goofs off like that, liverpool suffers.</p>

              <p>Seriously, they can play beautiful football with gerrard and torres. I didnt watch the match but gerrard was tired i read. He's tiring from all those matches and something tells me they will screw up the league run-in.</p>

              <p>Man u's defence is also frail now. If ferdinand comes back by nex week, then I still believe that they can win the EPL. </p>

              <p>i don't think Gerrard was tired, he was marked out of the game by Essien. Poo is a two man machine, and get one and U get the other. SAF tried to use anderson to negate, but I would have prefer OwenH to do it but past is past.</p>
              <p>MU defence is frail, importantly, the MF covers is not longer as strong given they are just too tired. As Vidic said it "we don't defend as if our lives depend on it anymore".</p>
              <p>Looking @ porto game, only fletcher is running tirelessly, with a 3 man midfield, Scholes/Carrick were ineffective covering back. Evra seems to have lost his shape.</p>
              <p>When Evans was sub, we dread seeing GaryN, he was trying to play it narrow when the cross came in during the dying minutes, but I guess he never expect another Porto player was behind in,and slotted the goal.</p>

              <p>pardon if I put this wrongly, but I noticed that EDS seems to be covering "wrongly" in the last few goals. For porto game, 1st goal, nothing to say, but 2nd goal, he should have stopped.</p>
              <p>Also in Villa game, when the opposing strikers kicks, instead of diving at the ball + blocking with his upper torso, the lower torso is always facing the ball.</p>
              <p>This means a smaller cross section of his body to block the ball which often results in a goal. Not sure whether anyone else noticed or am I getting this right?</p>

              <p>is it me or VDS is not diving enough....quite a few goals i have noticed him just watch it go in.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In '99, the difference between him and schmeichel was that the latter always in full stretch. Oh well, he was 34 at that time. Now VDS alrdy 39. Can't afford to break those bones.</p>
