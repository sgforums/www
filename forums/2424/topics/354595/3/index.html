              First half they were the better side, second half we improved. Getting
              a goal late in game, we should be seeing that out so it was a bad goal

              <p>Next week looks tricky liao..</p>
              <p>MANCHESTER - SIR Alex Ferguson has challenged Manchester United to keep their Champions League title defence alive by becoming the first English team to win in Porto.</p>
              <p>Ferguson's holders face an uphill struggle to reach the semi-finals after being held to a 2-2 draw by the Portuguese champions in Tuesday's last eight first leg clash at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Porto's two away goals mean United need to win or earn an unlikely high-scoring draw at the Dragao Stadium next Wednesday to stay in the competition. Ferguson admits it is a daunting prospect, especially given the woeful record of Premier League teams in Porto.</p>
              <p>Arsenal lost 2-0 at the Dragao this season, while United have failed to return from Porto with a win twice under Ferguson and Liverpool and Chelsea have also been frustrated there.</p>
              <p>'It's a difficult job now because no British team has won in Porto,' Ferguson said. 'We have to win the game. We've been good at firsts at this club so this is an occasion when we can be first again. We have a job to do.'</p>
              <p>Ferguson admitted United have only themselves to blame for their predicament after another careless display scarred by defensive errors.</p>
              <p>After setting a record for consecutive cleansheets earlier this season, United have conceded 10 goals in four games and suddenly look vulnerable at the back. Porto exposed them time and again and could have killed the tie off with better finishing.</p>
              <p>'We kept giving the ball away, we were nervous and it took half an hour to get going. But Porto were always a threat and they never stopped counter-attacking with numbers,' Ferguson said.</p>
              <p>'The second goal was one we couldn't afford to lose. When you are 2-1 up you have to see the game out. Given the importance of the game it was a terrible goal to lose. We only have ourselves to blame.' 'We can't say it was a great goal. It just emphasises the fragile nature of our defence at the moment. We showed tiredness because we played against Aston Villa on Sunday. It wasn't the best preparation for a European tie lets be honest.'</p>

              <p>Honestly I don't feel very disappointed at all... I am thinking if United can't win it might as well get out of it now or have a fixture problem with another 2 semi-final matches...</p>
              <p>We have to say Porto played really well last night and possibly even derseve to win... I guess they employed Pool's "chased and rush " tactics only thing was they played nicer than Pool did it thats all... They knew United had just played 48 yrs ago only and will find it difficult to keep up with the pace... They overwhelm United with their speed and didn't look like they were afraid at all and continued to attack throughout the match.</p>
              <p>Lets put it this way, this match is not over yet... United got really lucky with a gifted goal from Porto... They can still win it but if they are to exit the CL, I hope its now rather than in the semi-finals or final. Cos this would leave them free to concentrate  on the Premiership... which I hope they win more than anything else... But its looking more difficult with so many matches...</p>

              <p>Next week looks tricky liao..</p>
              <p>MANCHESTER - SIR Alex Ferguson has challenged Manchester United
              to keep their Champions League title defence alive by becoming the
              first English team to win in Porto.</p>
              <p>Ferguson's holders face an uphill struggle to reach the
              semi-finals after being held to a 2-2 draw by the Portuguese
              champions in Tuesday's last eight first leg clash at Old
              Trafford.</p>
              <p>Porto's two away goals mean United need to win or earn an
              unlikely high-scoring draw at the Dragao Stadium next Wednesday to
              stay in the competition. Ferguson admits it is a daunting prospect,
              especially given the woeful record of Premier League teams in
              Porto.</p>
              <p>Arsenal lost 2-0 at the Dragao this season, while United have
              failed to return from Porto with a win twice under Ferguson and
              Liverpool and Chelsea have also been frustrated there.</p>
              <p>'It's a difficult job now because no British team has won in
              Porto,' Ferguson said. 'We have to win the game. We've been good at
              firsts at this club so this is an occasion when we can be first
              again. We have a job to do.'</p>
              <p>Ferguson admitted United have only themselves to blame for their
              predicament after another careless display scarred by defensive
              errors.</p>
              <p>After setting a record for consecutive cleansheets earlier this
              season, United have conceded 10 goals in four games and suddenly
              look vulnerable at the back. Porto exposed them time and again and
              could have killed the tie off with better finishing.</p>
              <p>'We kept giving the ball away, we were nervous and it took half
              an hour to get going. But Porto were always a threat and they never
              stopped counter-attacking with numbers,' Ferguson said.</p>
              <p>'The second goal was one we couldn't afford to lose. When you
              are 2-1 up you have to see the game out. Given the importance of
              the game it was a terrible goal to lose. We only have ourselves to
              blame.' 'We can't say it was a great goal. It just emphasises the
              fragile nature of our defence at the moment. We showed tiredness
              because we played against Aston Villa on Sunday. It wasn't the best
              preparation for a European tie lets be honest.'</p>

              with a leaky defence, man u will surely concede at Porto home ground de.
              
              unless they can also score to make up for the concede of goals, then man u can qualify on away goals if based on 3-3 or 4-4. If 2-2, go to extra time and then pk.
