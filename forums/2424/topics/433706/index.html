But life moves on and, unquestionably, Wes will get the chance to make a real contribution to Steve Bruce's Sunderland, and I'm delighted to be passing him into such good hands.</span></p>

              <p>and.Oshea follows as well.Two of our utility players are gone.Brown's move was imminent as he was reduced to a bit part player last season due to the pre season row,he did not even qualify to get the BPL champions medal for the last time.He was a defender that i really liked,better than Oshea but his relationship with the boss strained and that was it.</p>
              <p>Both a from our youth academy.Always proud that we have players featuring in the first team trained and promoted from the academy.That sets us apart from the other teams especially the big4...They've been great servants to the club,playing their part thru the years when called upon.</p>
              <p>Now we only have.Rafael Rio Vidic Evra Fabio Jones Smalling Evans for our defence..hopefully can see another gd youth product again...</p>
              <p>This end-pre season must be one big clear out for the team.VDS Hargreaves,O Shea, Brown,Scholes,Neville have all left the club..all the best to them.</p>
              <p>My online tour in the manutd forums has seen people in UK discussing about prospective reserve team players that could make it..but it remains to be seen.</p>
              <p>Most notably..Cleverly along with Pogba,Ravel Morrison</p>

              <p>Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson was also quick to acknowledge the fine job O’Shea did at Old Trafford and backed Bruce to continue to get the best out of the defender.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Sir </span><span style="color: #000000;">Alex</span> told United's website: "John has been an outstanding servant to the club, since he broke into the first team almost a decade ago. His versatility, calmness under pressure and his commitment to the cause at United means that fans will remember him with great affection.</p>
              <p>"John has won so many medals - and has deserved every one of them. He epitomises our club’s approach as a team. After so many years of service to United, I’m pleased that John has found a career opportunity which will deliver the number of games he deserves.</p>
              <p>"We wish John every success in his new life. Steve Bruce is a manager that knows how to blend youth and experience and I’m sure he has John earmarked for a senior role in trying to take Sunderland on from their finish last season."</p>

              <p>Sales of Brown and O'Shea prove Fergie's as ruthless as ever</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson may need a buggy to get round a golf course these days, but that concession to age is at odds with the near-70-year-old’s vigour for his job and enduring ruthless streak.</strong></p>
              <p>In offloading Wes Brown and John O’Shea to Sunderland, Ferguson showed he remains as cold as ever in the pursuit of success.</p>
              <p>Just as he has done in the past, most famously with the likes of David Beckham, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Roy Keane and Jaap Stam, the Manchester United manager has eschewed sentiment and jettisoned two of his longest-standing players.</p>
              <p>With Edwin van der Sar, Paul Scholes and Gary Neville having retired, the sales of Brown and O'Shea mean five of the oldest players within United’s squad have now left, making this summer’s exodus and summer overhaul arguably their most significant in more than a decade.</p>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">
              <p>There is a distinct sense of a changing of the guard at Old Trafford as Ferguson looks to assemble the last great team of his remarkable and illustrious United dynasty.</p>
              <p>With Darron Gibson, another home-grown player, also heading out of the door, Ferguson is once again showing there is no room for misty-eyed emotion when he has decreed a player is no longer of use to United, regardless of past success or longevity.</p>
              <p>When the decision is made in Ferguson’s mind, the process of change is swift and it is done with the minimum of fuss.</p>
              <p>“You can’t get sentimental in this job,” Fergie has said. “I love the players I’ve had and I’ve been very, very fortunate to have had great players. And I’ve been fortunate to have had players come through with me for a long, long time.</p>
              <p>“Giggs, Neville and Scholes, even Phil Neville and Nicky Butt - guys who were the spirit of the club. They have remained part of what I see is Manchester United.</p>
              <p>"But when I see something happening, I have to act. In the case of Nicky Butt and Phil Neville, I had to release them because I was getting to the stage where I was terrified of talking to them - telling them they weren’t playing a game. And it wasn’t fair to them. They were good players, who had played a big part in the resurrection of Manchester United.”</p>
              <p>For Brown and O’Shea, the end of their United careers will not have come as a shock to either player, given the peripheral roles they played in the past season.</p>
              <p>Neither even made the bench for the Champions League Final defeat by Barcelona, having been regular United starters as recently as two years ago.</p>
              <p>Injury-blighted Brown, hailed by Ferguson in 2009 as the most naturally gifted defender in the country when fit, established himself as United’s first-choice right-back in the 2007-08 campaign and provided the cross for Cristiano Ronaldo’s goal as they beat Chelsea in that season's Champions League Final.</p>
              <p>O’Shea, the ultimate utility player, was adept at either full-back berth, centre-back and in midfield. He made the right-back slot his own in 2008-09,  starting the Champions League final in Rome, in which United also succumbed to Barca.</p>
              <p>Yet injuries took their toll on both men and, with the emergence of the Da Silva twins, with their pace, boundless energy and youthful dynamism, coupled with the arrival last year of Chris Smalling and Phil Jones this summer, Brown and O’Shea had become surplus to requirements.</p>
              <p>Ferguson paid tribute to Brown, 31, following his switch to Sunderland.</p>
              <p>“Wes has been a great asset to the club during the most successful period in its history,” said the United boss. “He was a product of the youth system and marked himself out from an early age as one of his generation’s most natural defenders.</p>
              <p>“In his time with us, he certainly became a favourite with the fans for his no-nonsense approach to the game and his infectious personality.</p>
              <p>“It’s always the hardest of decisions to let loyal servants go. But life moves on and, unquestionably, Wes will get the chance to make a real contribution to Steve Bruce’s Sunderland.</p>
              <p>“I’m delighted to be passing him into such good hands. Everyone connected with United wishes him a long and happy stay at Sunderland.”</p>
              <p>The United boss was equally effusive in his praise of O’Shea, 30, who made 393 appearances for the club.</p>
              <p>“John has been an outstanding servant to the club since he broke into the first team almost a decade ago,” said Ferguson. “His versatility, calmness under pressure and his commitment to the cause at United means that fans will remember him with great affection.</p>
              <p>“He won so many medals and has deserved every one of them. After so many years of service to United, I’m pleased John has found a career opportunity which will deliver the number of games he deserves.”</p>
              <p>Midfielder Gibson is set to follow Brown and O’Shea to the Stadium of Light if a compromise can be reached on his reputed £40,000-a-week wage demands.</p>
              <p>But by allowing Brown and O’Shea to go, Ferguson has reminded the football world he remains the master of man-management as he remodels his squad for one last tilt at glory before, to use his own words, he “rides off into the sunset” like his film hero John Wayne.</p>
