              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson declared himself satisfied with Manchester United's goalless draw in Marseille even though he realises it is a dangerous scoreline.</p>
              <p>Ferguson admitted it had been poor entertainment for the spectators, with neither side threatening to break the deadlock.</p>
              <p>And, whilst he understands United are vulnerable to the away goal at Old Trafford in three weeks' time, Ferguson is sure his team will come through.</p>
              <p>"On our ground we will be much better," he said.</p>
              <p>"Scoring away from home is always important and we didn't do that tonight.</p>
              <p>"You always worry at this stage of the season because there are no bad teams left in the competition.</p>
              <p>"But we will have two or three players back and whilst we won't be taking anything for granted, this result is fine."</p>
              <p>Darren Fletcher had United's best opportunity, a first-half snap shot from the edge of the area that Marseille keeper Steve Mandanda managed to keep out after originally being wrong-footed.</p>
              <p>Apart from that, it was drab fare, with neither side looking like getting a winner.</p>
              <p>"Marseille made sure they did not lose," Ferguson reflected.</p>
              <p>"It was a poor game for the spectators. Nothing happened."</p>
              <p>Ferguson's words of praise were reserved for central defensive partners Nemanja Vidic and Chris Smalling, who once more produced a mature performance in Rio Ferdinand's absence.</p>
              <p>Wayne Rooney also earned plaudits from his manager after an industrious shift on the left wing.</p>
              <p>"He did what we wanted him to do," said Ferguson.</p>
              <p>"The way we normally set up, with Nani or Ryan Giggs on the left, gives us more natural width.</p>
              <p>"But Wayne worked hard, as he always does. He has great spirit but he was better when we played him through the middle in a 4-4-2 at the end."</p>

              <p><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/2011/0225/siralexfergusonchortle20110223_275x155.jpg" alt="" width="275" height="155"></p>
              <p><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=30"><span style="color: #225fb2;">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></a> has dismissed <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/8931/John-Terry"><span style="color: #225fb2;">John Terry</span></a>'s suggestion Manchester United could crack under the pressure of the title race.</p>
              <p>Reigning champions Chelsea are currently fifth in the Premier League, 12 points behind United, but they will have the chance to reduce the deficit when the teams meet at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Terry admitted that Chelsea have only a "really small" chance of retaining the title but said "a little bit of pressure" could see United lose their grip at the top of the table.</p>
              <p>Having become renowned as a master of mind games during his 25 years at Old Trafford, though, Ferguson has given the comments short shrift.</p>
              <p>"You try things," he said. "We all try things, but it won't be easy to come back from that kind of points deficit.</p>
              <p>"I said some time ago the team that is most consistent would win the league. That is why I stress that we have to keep our momentum going and get that consistency."</p>
              <p>Before heading to Chelsea, United will be looking to take maximum points for a trip to relegation-threatened Wigan.</p>
              <p>"It'll be a difficult game," Ferguson said. "Wigan are a team who play fantastic football, but this time of season they're all difficult."</p>
              <p>He added: "The new pitch [at the DW Stadium] improves the quality of the game, there is no question about that.</p>
              <p>"I believe it was very bad before but that they have done something about it is more in their interests than ours.</p>
              <p>"If they thought it would help them to play us on a bad pitch, they would have left it, but they play in a particular way, where passing is important."</p>
