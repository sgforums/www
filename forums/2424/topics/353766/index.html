              <p>Darren Fletcher says that he and his Manchester United
              team-mates are desperate to prove that their first back-to-back league
              defeats in five years were nothing more than hiccups as opposed to the
              start of a critical collapse.</p>
              <p><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/03/06/article-1160041-03BEECB9000005DC-641_306x725.jpg" alt="" width="306" height="725"></p>
              <p><br>The international break means that
              it won't be until April 5 that United get a chance to start making
              amends, though if it were up to Fletcher they would have suited up
              again straight after their shock loss at Fulham.<br><br>"We would have
              liked another game straight away to respond to a couple of difficult
              games, which are hopefully just a setback," Fletcher said to <em>Sky Sports News</em>.<br><br>"It's easy to talk about it, but you've got to go out on to the pitch and prove it is only a setback.<br><br>"We would have been desperate for another league game, but unfortunately the internationals have come about.<br><br>"Liverpool
              would have been wanting the league to continue really and not wanting
              the international break, so you never know, it might be something that
              we just have to deal with," the Scottish international added.<br><br>"I'm sure we'll be back to winning ways, we've got to be.<br><br>"It's easy for me to say it's only a blip, but we've got to go out on to the park and show it's only a blip.<br><br>"I
              think it's easy talking about it, it's hard to go and do it. We'll all
              be desperate to go out and show when we get back that it is only a blip.<br><br>"As I say, it's easier talking than it is to go and produce results."<br><br>The
              Red Devils will be looking to get their title defence back on track
              with a win at home to Aston Villa in 10 days time, though they will
              have to do so without their talismanic front-man Wayne Rooney as well
              as Paul Scholes, both of whom picked up red cards at Craven Cottage
              last weekend.</p>
