              <p>Last night for me, Carrick was the MOTM who controlled the midfield really well. He's willing to attack, and track back to defend. His passing was very accurate as well!</p>
              <p>One thing that amaze me was he manage to chest the ball, and shoot it with his left leg! Anderson should learn from him!</p>
              <p>We clearly missed Evra from the left, who can penetrate into opponent's defence. Oshea was just waiting and waiting behind Ronaldo to cover him, but other than that Oshea did well~</p>

              <p>yep, i think with WesB, he effectively stamped out Everton's attack down that flank, with his speed and size.. he just "kill" them off..</p>
              <p>with Evra and Brown back, the back 4 should be settled..</p>

              <p>zocoss is not denying what Tevez has done for us, but he just doesn't want him to turn into Nani-type where instead of playing the ball to a better positioned player, they just want another shot.</p>
              <p>as per nani, where he is facing pressure to perform, tevez may also face pressure to perform to secure another deal, and the fear is that he may over-do things and harm the team in the running.</p>
              <p>So I think SAF has to balance given Rooney is currently injured.</p>
