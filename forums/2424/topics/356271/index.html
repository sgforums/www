              Dimitar Berbatov has no doubt Manchester United will come through their all-English Champions League semi-final with Arsenal.
              
              United set up the meeting of minds between Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger with their win over Porto in Portugal. 
              
              Cristiano Ronaldo's wonder goal has revived talk of an unprecedented quintuple, as well as ensuring there will be a trio of Premier League clubs in the last four of Europe's most prestigious competition for the third season running. 
              
              It promises to be an intriguing battle, contested by arguably the two most exciting teams in England. 
              
              And at the end, Berbatov expects United to be the ones booking a trip to Rome on May 27. 
              
              "The Arsenal games are going to be great for everybody to watch and I know it is going to be difficult," said the Bulgarian. 
              
              "They are a great team. But we are Manchester United, so I think we are going to win." 
              
              Berbatov has not been an unqualified success since his arrival from Tottenham in a club record Â£30.75million deal last summer. 
              
              The Bulgarian's languid style is not to everyone's taste and supporters who love the all-action approach of Carlos Tevez, the man who has been squeezed out by Berbatov's arrival, accuse the new-boy of not working hard enough. 
              
              Yet there has never been an indication Sir Alex Ferguson is unhappy. 
              
              Indeed, he has been positively effusive in his praise of Berbatov's economic style. 
              
              However, Berbatov is aware he needs to put some major medals on the table, to prove he is the equal of his illustrious team-mates. 
              
              "It is very close but things can happen, so it is best not to think too far ahead," he said. 
              
              "We are determined to defend this trophy and the fact we now have to face another English team makes it a little bit different. But we should still be confident." 
              
              Berbatov has become used to superstar status during a career that included a successful spell with Bayer Leverkusen before he joined Tottenham, where he became a fundamental part of a side that won the Carling Cup last season before his relationship with the London outfit turned sour. 
              
              Even he had to play second fiddle to Cristiano Ronaldo, whose wonder goal will be talked about for years to come, having been delivered from exactly 39.1 yards. 
              
              "It was a very special goal," said Berbatov. 
              
              "Cristiano gives everything he can in every game. Sometimes you need a special player to do something out of the ordinary. Cristiano delivered." 
              
              While the enthusiasm for a meeting with Arsenal will see memories of past clashes between United and the Gunners - on and off the field - rekindled, both sides have more immediate priorities. 
              
              Arsenal face Chelsea in an all-London FA Cup semi-final, with the Red Devils in action at Wembley 24 hours later when they tackle David Moyes' Everton. 
              
              If recent history is anything to go by, United can expect a stern examination, even if they have tended to come out on top against the Toffeemen. 
              
              But they will head south buoyed by the return from a groin injury of Rio Ferdinand, who proved once again last night why his partnership with Nemanja Vidic has been so successful. 
              
              Ferdinand has missed the last three of the five matches United had not kept a clean sheet, with Vidic not completing the other two, having been suspended for the defeat at Fulham following his dismissal against Liverpool. 
              
              But, so tight were United at the back, Porto barely created a chance of note, with Berbatov among those leading the praise. 
              
              "Our defence is incredible," he said. 
              
              "They have been tremendous for us all season and deserve so much credit for their performances. 
              
              "The major reason we are in the position we are at the moment is because of our defenders and I want to thank them."
