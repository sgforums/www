That's despite doing the double with two 1-0 victories last season.<br><br><strong>Club Form</strong><br><br>Highest achievable after Saturday's matches: 1st<br>Lowest could fall: 2nd<br><br>1. Won 19 of 23 in all competitions, and lost one of 17.<br><br>2. The only club to have won 14 Premier League matches this season; but lost twice as many league games as Arsenal (two to the Gunners' one).<br><br>3. Boasting the tightest defence in the highest league; just nine goals shipped in 19 outings, at one every 190 minutes (three hours nine minutes) of Premier League football played on average.<br><br>4. Won 14 of the last 16 Premier League matches, losing just one of the 16.<br><br>5. Kept clean sheets in 10 and failed to score in one of the last 16 league outings; the blank being the 1-0 loss, away to Bolton on 24 November.<br><br>6. Not lost in any league game this term in which they have scored; won 14 and drawn two of 16.<br><br>7. Scored first in an unequalled 15 Premier League matches; won 13 and drawn two.<br><br>8. Conceded only two goals in the last 15 minutes of Premier League matches this term; only Arsenal and Liverpool can match that.<br><br>9. Beaten Everton, Birmingham, Aston Villa, Liverpool and Sunderland on their league travels, and been beaten by Manchester City and Bolton on the road.<br><br>10. The New Year's Day fixture is home to Birmingham.<br><br><strong>Key-Player Notes</strong><br><br>Cristiano Ronaldo is Manchester United's top scorer with 17 goals.<br><br>Ronaldo is also their leading Premier League marksman with 12, and leads the race for the Barclays Golden Boot.<br><br>Ronaldo, who has scored three times in two games and is the only United scorer in double figures, is a hat-trick shy of 50 Premier League goals - all for Manchester United.<br><br>If selected:-<br><br>Darren Fletcher will be making his 100th Premier League appearance - all for the Red Devils.<br><br>Michael Carrick, Rio Ferdinand and Carlos Tevez will all be facing their former club; the first two started their professional careers with the Hammers.<br><br>If on the field from the outset:-<br><br>Louis Saha will be making his 50th Premier League start for Manchester United.<br><br><strong>Last Season's Corresponding Game</strong><br><br>West Ham United 1-0 Manchester United<br>17 December 2006 - Ref: Phil Dowd<br>West Ham scorer: Reo-Coker 75</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Boss: Tevez deserves respect</strong><br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson is unsure what reaction Carlos Tevez can expect to receive on his return to West Ham on Saturday, but the United manager feels the Argentine striker should command gratitude at Upton Park.<br><br>Tevez's goalscoring was an integral part of the Hammers' against-all-odds Premier League survival last term, and Sir Alex is hopeful that the Upton Park faithful recognise his services.<br><br>"When players leave a club and go back, they don't always get the reception they deserve when they go back," he told his pre-match press conference. "We've got Rio Ferdinand and Michael Carrick who'll probably be involved tomorrow too, and I don't think they get a great reception going back there. It'll be interesting to see.<br><br>"Deep down they must be thankful to him, because I think he kept them up last year, his performances were fantastic for them. There must be a grudging admiration for what he achieved at West Ham in a short period."<br><br>Tevez is set to start against his former side after being rested for the Reds' convincing 4-0 victory over Sunderland on Boxing Day.<br><br>"We gave him a break on Saturday, it was a bit of luck for us that we didn't have to use him in the game," said Sir Alex. "He got a couple of bad knocks against Liverpool that he was carrying, just bruises really on his ankle and his knee, but after the Everton game we decided to freshen him up and I'm sure he'll be ready for tomorrow."<br></div>

How can I?<br><br>"This is a strange feeling for me, going back to my old club. It is the first time in my career that this has happened and I am not sure how I will feel. Manchester United and their fans have made me feel at home.
