              <p><span><strong>Michael Carrick has signed a new three-year deal which will see keep the midfielder at Old Trafford until 2014.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>The 29-year-old joined United from Spurs in 2006, and since then he has helped United to three Premier League titles and one European Cup.</span></p>
              <p><span>Carrick said: 'I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at this great club. There is fantastic team spirit within the squad and I'm pleased to have committed my future to United. We are in a very good position at the moment and I am confident this team will be successful for many years to come.'</span></p>
              <p><span>Sir Alex Ferguson said: 'I am delighted Michael has signed a new contract. He has been outstanding since joining us from Tottenham Hotspur in 2006, he is a true professional and it’s great he has committed his future to the club.'</span></p>
              <p><span>The news came just after Sir Alex Ferguson was charged with improper conduct by the Football Association following comments made about referee Martin Atkinson immediately after United's 2-1 defeat to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday.</span></p>
              <p><span>That game marked Carrick's 218th United appearance and his new three-year deal will offer the opportunity to make many more.</span></p>
              <p><span>With Paul Scholes' future undecided and Anderson struggling with injuries, Carrick's playmaking abilities are likely to come in very handy on the run-in, with Carrick joining Ryan Giggs and Patrice Evra, who have also recently signed contract extensions.<br></span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Darren Fletcher has signed a new four-year contract with </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Manchester United</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> that will keep him at Old Trafford until 2015.</span></strong></p>
              <p>The Scotland captain follows team-mates Michael Carrick, Ryan Giggs and Patrice Evra who have all recently committed their futures to the Premier League leaders.</p>
              <p>Fletcher has become a key player for boss Sir Alex Ferguson and his absence through suspension was cited as one of the reasons why United performed so badly in the 2009 Champions League final against Barcelona.</p>
              <p>Ferguson said: 'Darren has been at the club since he was 15.</p>
              <p>'I am extremely proud that he came through the ranks of our youth academy and am delighted Darren has signed a new contract.</p>
              <p>'He has developed into a top-class midfielder.'</p>
              <p>Fletcher has now made 288 appearances, scoring 21 goals. He has won three Barclays Premier League titles, the FA Cup, two League Cups, the Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>In addition, he is the current Scotland skipper, having inherited the armband from Barry Ferguson.</strong></p>
              <p>Although a Celtic fan born in Dalkeith, Fletcher moved south in his teens and was prevented from making his debut as a schoolboy due to FA regulations.</p>
              <p>He has never made any secret of his passion for the Red Devils and is one of the players Ferguson will look to carry on the United traditions once Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes have accompanied Gary Neville into retirement.</p>
              <p>'I take great pride in playing for Manchester United,' said Fletcher.</p>
              <p>'I have won many trophies in my years playing here and I am looking forward to winning many more in the seasons to come. I would like to thank everyone at the club.'</p>
