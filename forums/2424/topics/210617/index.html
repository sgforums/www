            <div class='col-md body'>Sir Alex Ferguson believes this weekend's round of Premiership fixtures could prove significant to the eventual outcome of the title race.<br><br>The four heavyweights of British football come face-to-face on Sunday afternoon as United entertain Arsenal and Chelsea host Liverpool.<br><br>United will be aiming to extend this season's 100 per cent record and keep a step ahead of the other three at the Premiership summit.<br><br>"This weekend has an extra significance given that the top four will all be meeting each other," acknowledge Sir Alex. "We need to continue our good form and make sure we pick up another win on Sunday.<br><br>"We won't be underestimating Arsenal and we'll have to play to the best of our capabilities. But I'm very encouraged by the atmosphere and team spirit within our squad."<br><br>Sir Alex is expecting another feisty encounter when the Gunners pitch up at Old Trafford on Sunday. Clashes between the pair are never short of controversy and the Reds' boss doesn't expect there to be anything out of the ordinary this time round.<br><br>"Our games with Arsenal are always going to be feisty and competitive, I don't think you can avoid that," reasoned Sir Alex who saw his side run out 2-0 winners in the corresponding fixture last season. "What you want is to make sure the game is played in a fair manner.<br><br>"Arsenal are going through a bit of a transitional period at the moment because they've lost big figures like Vieira, Pires, Bergkamp and Ashley Cole.<br><br>"We've been through the same thing and have lost big players, but you just have to be patient for the next stage of development," he added.<br><br>The Reds will be without injury victims Ji-sung Park (ankle) and Ryan Giggs (hamstring), but Sir Alex is confident his squad has the strength and depth to cope without the absentees.<br><br>"Of course it's a bit of a blow but it's something that we have to cope with and I believe we have the maturity within the squad to do that," insisted the boss.<br><br>"We have Wayne and Paul back and Cristiano is available [after a European suspension]. That will give us a boost. So we should be in good shape for Sunday.<br><br>"I've got my team in my mind," added Sir Alex. "Ole Solskjaer will figure at some stage, while Rooney will be better for his game against Celtic.<br><br>"I've been very happy with our attacking play and I think Louis Saha is benefitting from playing regularly.<br><br>"He's a terrific goalscorer who has everything in his game - marvellous movement, pace, two good feet and an excellent spring. We're enjoying what we're seeing from Louis and he's coming on all the time."<br><br><a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=363346" rel="nofollow">http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&amp;newsid=363346</a></div>
