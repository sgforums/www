              <p>Manchester United defender Jonny Evans intends to remain grounded - as he wants to stay on the right side of Sir Alex Ferguson.</p>
              <p>At 21 Evans is making giant strides at Old Trafford but the Northern Ireland international will not rest on his laurels.</p>
              <p>He is fully aware Ferguson is constantly looking for young players to improve and not be distracted by off-field activities.</p>
              <p>Evans, who gives an insight into life behind the scenes at United on BBC Northern Ireland's Season Ticket programme on Wednesday, has enormous respect for the United manager.</p>
              <p>He said: "It is very rare for him to say anything bad about his players. He always gives them 100% backing. It is great to have that from a manager.</p>
              <p>"You have to be on your toes as well as you cannot upset him. You have seen what he has done in the past. If you you are taking your eye off the ball, he will get rid of you.</p>
              <p>"He treats everyone as men. Everyone has got to deal with certain situations but if you need to go to him, he is there for you. He just wants you to enjoy your football.</p>
              <p>"I played over 30 games last season, which was more than I expected. It is great to get those games under your belt. But I know I still need to improve as there are some fantastic players here."</p>
              <p>Ryan Giggs, the most decorated player in United's history, is convinced Evans has a glittering future in the game.</p>
              <p>"The performances he has put in, he looks as though he has played there 10 years," said the Welsh veteran.</p>
              <p>"He has come into a team that has a centre-half partnership of Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic.</p>
              <p>"If one of them is not playing and Jonny comes in, to say you don't miss one of those players, is a great compliment to him and it is true as well."</p>
              <p>Evans' family, who moved from Belfast, keep a watchful eye on him.</p>
              <p>He said: "If I am at not at my house, I go around to their house, maybe having dinner and spending the day with them.</p>
              <p>"They tell me I don't have to be flash. People see footballers and have this perception they are all flash and throwing money around. They have always encouraged me not to be like that."</p>
              <p>Reserve team coach Ole Gunnar Solskjaer does not think Evans will get big-headed.</p>
              <p>"He is a great lad who has come through the ranks and the system," said the former United striker.</p>
              <p>"He realises that when you go into the first team you don't suddenly change your character. He knows where he comes from."</p>
