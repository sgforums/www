            <div class='col-md body'>I think 3 yrs more lah... When Ronny is no longer as fast as he is right now... Ronny's game depend a lot on speed, like how fast he can twist and turn... By 26, he is sure to slow down a bit... The thing is some players, especially wingers peak at 22, 23 and start to go downhill by the time they are 27, 28...<br><br>There are so many examples where a winger before 20 or in his early 20s is in superb form but once after his mid 20s... start to lose it... Players like Harry Kewell, Damien Duff, Marc Overmars...<br><br>Kewell was a great winger during his early 20s but today at 29, he has not really played the way he used to for Leeds for the past 3 yrs... Then there is Duff... a brilliant player in his early 20s too... Today at 28, you can say after 25, he seem to have lost that ability to run and beat players with ease like he used to for Blackburn and earlier Chelsea days...<br><br>Not everyone is a Ryan Giggs... At the end of this year, he will be 35. When a winger known for his speed and ability to run and beat players loses his speed... they will find it very difficult to adjust to the new ways... Giggs united's career seems over a few yrs back but he has manage to learn and readjust his game to maintain his stamina to be effective for the full 90mins... Something which is not easy for a winger to learn in mid-career...<br><br>Today we are seeing players like Ashley Young, a good young left winger... But how long can he maintain at this level... Thats anyone's guess...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>why the hell, you need awards for?<br>it is not like a job resume where you need plentiful of awards to up your pay.<br><br>even if he doesn't win anything, RM already begging for his signature.<br>so what will a few 'world-class" awards do?<br><br>Awards doesn't equate to pay.<br><br>okie, recognition, so what if George Weah was one of the best players, if he win nothing on the big stage like a world cup, I don't think he will be remembered as compared to a Ronaldinho or a Kaka..<br><br>someone mentioned winning the CL Cup with alot of goals, did Gerrard win major personal awards for bringing pool back? I think he scored alot of goals too.<br></div>
