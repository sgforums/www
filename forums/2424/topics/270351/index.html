That is the real advantage of having someone like him on board.<br><br>"Of course, Wayne can also drop in and give defenders a problem, so between the two of them I think they can become a real handful."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Gill patient for Tevez solution<br><br>Reds chief executive David Gill remains hopeful that transfer target Carlos Tevez will complete his drawn-out move to Old Trafford from Upton Park, although he admits a resolution to the dispute is now out of United's hands.</strong><br><br>The impasse between West Ham and businessman Kia Joorabchian over the ownership of Tevez appears headed for the High Court, despite world governing body FIFA's recommendation that it should go to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).<br><br>FIFA said on Tuesday afternoon: "[We] have recommended that West Ham and Carlos Tevez seek arbitration at CAS. Under the present circumstances this was deemed to be the best approach and in the interest of all parties."<br><br>Hours later, lawyers acting on behalf of Joorabchian initiated legal proceedings.<br><br>Although staying positive that the 23-year-old striker will join United, Gill says patience is now required.<br><br>"I have not been involved in this and it is not Manchester United's decision," he was quoted as saying on Sky Sports. "Clearly, it is a dispute between Tevez, the owners and West Ham.<br><br>"Hopefully, that can be solved relatively quickly and he can come to join us. I would have thought they have taken this decision in the belief that he can join us."</div>
