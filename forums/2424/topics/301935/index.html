Utd want him to spread the word</span><br><br><strong>MANCHESTER UNITED hope David Beckham will become their global ambassador when he retires from playing. His old club want him to take over the role now held by 70-year-old Sir Bobby Charlton. The LA Galaxy star, 33 in May, is still held in high esteem at board level at Old Trafford. And the move will be given its blessing by boss Alex Ferguson, who long ago patched up his differences with the player.</strong><br><br>Beckham would be expected to earn around Â£2million a year in the role, which would take him all round the world aiding the commercial arm of the club. United feel Becks would help to rake in millions in advertising and sponsorship, as well as winning them millions more fans.<br><br>Senior club figures have been impressed at how he has refused to say anything negative about United, despite his acrimonious departure in 2003. That followed a series of bust-ups with Ferguson, who infamously kicked a boot which hit Beckham on the head in a dressing-room rage.<br><br>Becks joined United as a kid and played 265 games, scoring 61 goals, in a 10-year career before moving to Real Madrid.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually United can always have Beck, Giggs and Solskjaer as ambassadors. Afterall, they are a big club, and the world is such a big place for one man to be going around to promote them right... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>These 3 have their own strong points... Giggs, will probably be the player that played the most matches for united, and that FA cup goal he scored against Arsenal will probably still be the talk of FA Cup matches for the next ten, twenty or maybe more yrs down the road.<br><br>Solskjaer will be remembered as the best super-sub united had and the players that scored that historic injury time goal that won them The Treble... He can also double-up as their striker coach (as what he is doing now) when he is not travelling around the world. And Beck... Himself is already the most famous footballer on this planet... So what else does he need to do, Just turn up and meet the Press...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>All 3 were part of that Historic Treble winning team...<br><br>On another note, Scholes cannot cos he is not a good PR man and he don't like the limelight. Gary Neville also not a very good choice too cos he was never the fans hero type... So that 3 are the best choice i feel...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
