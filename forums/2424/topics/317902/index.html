              <h2>Manchester United legend Sir Bobby Charlton has slammed Real Madrid for their courting of Cristiano Ronaldo.</h2>
              <p>The Portuguese phenomenon has been linked with <em>los Merengues</em> for
              over a year now, with club president Ramon Calderon and sporting
              director Predrag Mijatovic declaring on more than one occasion that
              they would wish to sign the player.<br><br>They have been criticised
              from various quarters for doing so, with Sir Bobby the latest to join
              the chorus of critics, as he believes Ronaldo will see out the
              remaining four years on his contract.<br><br>"Ronaldo's on a long-term
              contract with us. I don't have to say we expect him to honour it
              because he will honour it unless something tragic happens," declared
              Charlton. "Do I think Ronaldo will be at United next season?
              Absolutely. <br><br>"It really irritates me how people can set rumours going and undermine people through the media. It's unethical. <br><br>"They
              have not got the right to undermine the way we have helped this lad.
              Everybody seems to think that Real Madrid or Barcelona are the two
              greatest clubs in the world. I don't think I have to tell Cristiano
              that Manchester United is the biggest club in the world."<br><br>Ronaldo
              himself has, on numerous occasions, declared that he is happy at the
              club, but also moved to add that he wishes to play in Spain at some
              point in his career.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>i think its a matter of time lol.. sell now aso good.. i had a feeling fergie knows and hence he tried getting nani to replace ronaldo in future too bad nani is developing slowly.. yes ronaldo is effective and that is proved by statistics.. but his overall game is not really commendable.. his ratings are backed by statistics but if you look at most of his games, you would think he is over rated.. so my opinion is to sell him.. either now or next season.. but the deal has to be carried out subtly and carefully so as not to inbalance the current harmony..</p></div>

              <p>Nani will never be as good as Ronaldo.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And why should we sell Ronaldo now as he is only 23, he can wait later in his career if he really want to join Real, personally I still believe he be with us as long as Fergie is around at the club.</p>
