            <div class='col-md body'>Louis Saha has been ruled out for four weeks with a hamstring strain.<br><br>The Manchester United striker suffered the injury in training yesterday and was immediately sent for a scan by Sir Alex Ferguson.<br><br>Ferguson received the results today, with confirmation Saha will be sidelined for almost a month.<br><br>While the period does include the two-week international break, the Frenchman will miss Saturday's FA Cup tie at Middlesbrough, the Premiership clashes with Bolton and Blackburn on March 17 and 31, and, almost certainly, the first leg of the Champions League quarter final at the beginning of April should the Red Devils progress.<br><br>``Louis has a hamstring strain and will be out for around four weeks,'' said Ferguson ahead of tonight's Champions League clash with Lille.<br><br>The injury could not have come at a worse time for United given Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has been ruled out until the end of the month following a minor knee operation.<br><br>In addition, Henrik Larsson is due to return to Sweden next week at the end of his loan period.<br><br>So, unless Ferguson reverses his stated intention to let Larsson leave without making any attempt to keep him, even for a short period, it means United will head into the Bolton game on Saturday week with only Wayne Rooney as a fully fit forward.<br><br>Alan Smith is also likely to be available but the former Leeds man has not made a first-team appearance since the Carling Cup defeat to Southend in November.</div>

Seems like Man U needs someone like Saha. The fact that they seldom do those fast, pacey counterattacks as compared to last, last time (during their glory days) is due to the lack of fast and pacey players. Only few are pacey. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>(italics) And yup!

With Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Louis Saha both sidelined and Henrik Larsson set to return to Sweden, the United boss is faced with a selection dilemma.</strong><br><br>But with Smith making his latest comeback from a broken leg and dislocated ankle as a late substitute in Wednesday's UEFA Champions League win over Lille, Ferguson is pinning his hopes that the former Leeds man can fill the void.<br><br>"We are asking questions about how we rotate the squad and who should play up front. Alan Smith comes into that," said Ferguson. "As soon as we scored I knew it was effectively the end of the game, so it was a great opportunity to give Alan a share of it. "He will be involved again at Middlesbrough on Saturday and is certainly back in the frame."<br><br>Smith made his name at Elland Road as a prolific striker, but has found goals hard to come by since his move to Old Trafford. Last season he scored once but has failed to find the net in any of his five appearances this season.<br></div>
