Rossi spent the second half of last season on loan at fellow Italian club Parma, where he played a vital role in keeping the team in Serie A.<br><br>The Daily Mirror continue to link Kieran Richardson with a move to Everton, who apparently value the United winger at Â£3million. The paper claim Richardson has been told he is surplus to requirements at Old Trafford.<br><br>Tucked away in The Guardian's transfer column is a line or two suggesting United are closing in on 18-year-old Brazilian midfielder Rodrigo Possebon. He currently plies his trade at Internacional.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think Man Utd have targetted him all along since the season ended , and this will be the longest negotiation cause of all the regulations...thus the other signing were completed first, and as usual  they wanted to keep things quiet as always.But somehow Tevez cant hide his exhilaration and declared it out loud on national TV..oh wells <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
