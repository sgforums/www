            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson believes Gabriel Heinze owes to the club to stay at Manchester United.</strong><br><br>Heinze is currently at the centre of a transfer tug-of-war between United and Premier League rivals Liverpool.<br><br>Liverpool are keen to sign the Argentine defender and have tabled a bid for the former Paris Saint Germain star.<br><br>United are adamant they will not sell Heinze to their bitter rivals even though Heinze's agent reputedly has a letter which gives the defender permission to leave Old Trafford for the fee that Liverpool have offered for the South American.<br><br>Liverpool have instructed their lawyers to pursue the move for Heinze, but Ferguson remains determined to stop the player making the switch to Anfield.<br><br>The Scot feels Heinze should show loyalty to United because of the way the club helped him recover from his serious knee injury two years ago.<br><br>"He is still our player and that is the most important thing," Ferguson told Sky Sports News.<br><br>"He still has two-years left on his contract and I think we have stood by Gaby very well.<br><br>"He had his cruciate knee operation, we looked after him and we let him him do his rehabilitation in Spain which he wanted to do.<br><br>"We conducted ourselves in a way that suited Gaby perfectly and he was delighted the way we looked after him.<br><br>"I think if we take away the agent's role in this I don't think there is an awful lot wrong with Gaby's position at the club."<br><br>Ferguson also believes Heinze may have helped United's cause in their bid to sign Carlos Tevez by recommending the Premier League champions to the West Ham forward.<br><br>United remain hopeful of signing Tevez despite the move being held up because of a wrangle over his ownership rights between West Ham and the player's representatives.<br><br>Tevez is determined to join United and Ferguson believes Heinze may have persuaded his fellow Argentine to make the move to Old Trafford.<br><br>"I think the fact they have been in the Argentine team the last few weeks I am sure Gaby has told him how good a club Manchester United is, because there is no other thing you can say about Manchester United from his own experiences," added Ferguson.<br><br>"Maybe that in some way has helped Carlos Tevez to know he is coming to the right club."</div>
