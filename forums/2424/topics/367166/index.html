            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong>Back in the Hunt</strong><strong><br></strong>Alex Ferguson is preparing to make a £20million raid for Real Madrid striker Klaas Jan Huntelaar. The Manchester United boss had his eye on the Dutchman before he joined the La Liga side from Ajax in January. But Huntelaar, 25, has struggled to make an impact after scoring 113 goals in 136 games in Holland. He failed to make Real's Champions League squad. And he has fallen further down the pecking order following the arrivals of Cristiano Ronaldo, Kaka and Karim Benzema. Now Fergie, who had the player scouted all last year, is ready to make a new bid to land him after losing out on Benzema. United will have to match the £20m Madrid paid for the hitman. An Old Trafford source said: "Huntelaar is somebody we have known about for a good while. There was more than a passing interest last time out." <br><em>Phil Thomas, The Sun<br><br>The Sun </em>also claims United will wrap up the £8million signing of French winger <strong>Gabriel Obertan </strong>from Bordeaux post-haste. The 20-year-old will allegedly sign a four-year contract today, after passing a medical at Carrington yesterday.<br><br>In <em>The Times</em>, Matt Dickinson argues "there is surely no more pressing concern for Sir Alex Ferguson than the heart of his midfield". With Owen Hargreaves looking increasingly doubtful to start the season, Dickinson says "serious money" should be spent on a top-class holding player.</p></div>
