              <h1><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Laurent Blanc lined up to succeed Sir Alex Ferguson as Manchester United boss</span></h1>
              <p><img src="http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/incoming/article221663.ece/ALTERNATES/gallery-large/90725859.jpg" alt="" width="639" height="322"></p>
              <p>Laurent Blanc has emerged to top the Manchester United short-list of managers to succeed Sir Alex Ferguson.</p>
              <p>Sunday
              Mirror Sport can reveal that the Frenchman’s incredible record at
              Bordeaux has put him firmly in the frame to follow Fergie – ahead of
              Jose Mourinho and Carlos Queiroz.</p>
              <p>The belief at Old Trafford is that Ferguson will remain in charge until at least the end of next season – health permitting.</p>
              <p>But
              Blanc, who ended his glittering playing career with a two-year stint at
              United, is now firmly established as the club’s No.1 choice.</p>
              <p>Chief executive David Gill and United legend Sir Bobby Charlton have
              been tasked with selecting candidates capable of filling the massive
              void that will be left when Ferguson steps down.</p>
              <p>They will call
              on Ferguson’s massive wealth of football knowledge in that hunt – and
              the United boss is a big admirer of his former centre-back.</p>
              <p>A United insider said: “Replacing Sir Alex will be the toughest job since Matt Busby left the club.</p>
              <p>“It isn’t just about winning at United. It’s about playing the game the right way and upholding the traditions.</p>
              <p>“There is a lot of admiration at Old Trafford for the job Blanc has done at Bordeaux and the style of play he has imposed.</p>
              <p>“It
              is no secret at the club that he became close to Sir Alex when he was a
              United player. There is still a lot of mutual respect.”</p>
              <p>Ferguson has twice tried to lure Blanc to work alongside him at United.</p>
              <p>In
              the summer of 2008, after the Frenchman had guided Bordeaux into the
              Champions League by finishing second in Ligue One in his first season
              at the Parc Lescure, Ferguson asked him to replace Portugal-bound
              Queiroz as his No.2.</p>
              <p>Blanc opted to remain at Bordeaux – and decided to do the same when Ferguson came calling again last January.</p>
              <p>Bordeaux won the French League for the first time in a decade last season and are top of the table again this season.</p>
              <p>Blanc
              has enhanced his reputation further by taking Bordeaux into the
              knock-out stages of the Champions League despite a tough group.</p>
              <p>But
              when United came calling for a second time, in the New Year, the
              Frenchman said: “Two years experience isn’t enough for the top English
              jobs.</p>
              <p>“My ideal career path would be to start in France, then manage abroad, and then return to head the French national team.”</p>
              <p>Ferguson,
              who will celebrate his 68th birthday on New Year’s Eve, failed three
              times in efforts to sign Blanc when the Frenchman was recognised as one
              of the most gifted defenders in world football, before finally
              succeeding in 2001.</p>
              <p>Blanc’s final season as a player saw him take
              the 2003 Premier League title with United, but he had spells at
              Barcelona and Inter Milan, and with France he lifted the World Cup and
              European Championship.</p>
              <p>During his time at Old Trafford he would have regular talks with Ferguson about coaching methods and tactics.</p>
              <p>Blanc
              signed a two-year contract extension with Bordeaux earlier this year –
              but the deal is believed to include a get-out clause that would allow
              him to leave if he</p>
              <p>was offered a big job from abroad.</p>
              <p>He
              will turn 44 on Thursday – the same age Ferguson was when he arrived
              from Aberdeen to become the most successful manager in United’s history.</p>

              <p>But ever since Carlos Queiroz left, MANU has been playing shitty footbal for this season and the previous season. I miss the free flowing attacking football in 06/07 and 07/08. CQ is no manager but he has a wealth of tactical knowledge from his experience in Europe. He complemented Fergie very well. After his departure, we became a one trick pony depending primarily on
              the brilliance of rooney and ronaldo and a strong back four.</p>
              <p>Now we have lost ronaldo and the back four hence our weakness is so terribily exposed. People are saying we played well against Chelsea but how so? We played for a draw by clogging up the midfield and playing one striker up front. Goes to show how pathetic the midfield has become over the past 2 seasons.</p>
              <p>Whole-sale changes is needed. Firstly, we need a tactician like CQ instead of the current non-person who acts as the Ast Manager. Giggs, Scholes and Neville replacement must be found. Our young players - Anderson, Evans, Obertan etc must stand up.</p>
              <p>The glory days will return. In fergie we trust.</p>

              <p>if guardiola ever gets sacked or moves on, i'd want him as the manager.</p>
              <p>he's
