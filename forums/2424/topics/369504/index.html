"People like me in Korea because I’m a good friend of Ji-sung Park so I always look forward to coming here. I’d love to score again but I know the most important thing is that we win."<br><br>Evra, Park, Zoran Tosic and Federico Macheda assisted Manchester United Soccer Schools coaches in training sessions with aspiring footballers on Thursday afternoon. And while the local players were undoubtedly pleased to see all four Reds, there was one man who stole all the limelight.<br><br>“When we arrive in Seoul you can see that Ji is the King of Korea!" said Patrice.<br><br>“They shake, they cry, they scream when they see him. It’s amazing. He’s like the David Beckham of Korea. I’m very happy for him because he’s a really good friend and on the pitch he always gives 100 per cent. That’s why fans love him.”</p></div>

              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Patrice Evra refuses to believe Manchester United are any weaker after losing Cristiano Ronaldo and Carlos Tevez this summer.</span><span><span id="intelliTXT"> </span></span></p>
              <p>While manager Sir Alex Ferguson has admitted replacing Ronaldo, who scored 26 goals last season, is going to be difficult, he will surely be buoyed by the performances of Antonio Valencia, Anderson and Nani during the Audi Cup over the last few days.</p>
              <p>Valencia and Anderson both opened their accounts for the club in Wednesday's 2-1 win over Boca Juniors while Nani stood out in Thursday night's penalty shoot-out defeat to Bayern Munich.</p>
              <p>And Evra believes United have nothing to worry about in compensating for the loss of two key members of their team from last season.</p>
              <p>"They are two big players, but the star of the team is the team," he said. "Two players alone do not make a team. We have signed some good players and, like I say, Manchester United are a team and not only about two players.</p>
              <p>"I can already see a good team coming along and we are all confident about doing well with this team as it is."</p>
              <p>Evra believes United have made good progress since waving goodbye to Ronaldo and Tevez.</p>
              <p>Although there has been much criticism of their tiring tour of the Far East, Evra believes it has played an important role in preparing for the upcoming season.</p>
              <p>It has allowed Ferguson to take a look at new options in attack following the arrival of Michael Owen, who probably should have scored his fifth goal in as many games at the Allianz Arena last night.</p>
              <p>And Evra is confident the team will be firing on all cylinders come the start of what he is predicting to be another successful season for the Red Devils.</p>
              <p>"We worked really well in Asia and played some good games, it was a good tour," he said. "We are moving along bit by bit in preparation for our first match of the season on August 9 against Chelsea.</p>
              <p>"We want to at least defend the titles we won last season and try to win the Champions League."</p>

              <p>Manchester United defender Patrice Evra is confident the side can cope without Cristiano Ronaldo this season.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo has left Old Trafford for Real Madrid in a record-breaking move after two years of speculation over his long-term future at United.</p>
              <p>Sceptics have questioned that United will struggle without the Portuguese star, but Evra insists the reigning champions will not miss Ronaldo and have enough quality in their squad to compensate for his loss.</p>
              <p>"It is important to be clear that Ronaldo did not make Manchester United," Evra told the <em>News of the World</em></p>
              <p>"Ronaldo was never the star at Manchester United. We are all stars and the boss would never let any one person believe he is the star.</p>
              <p>"He was a good player for us and a very important one. But Manchester United was Manchester United before him and it is still Manchester United after him."</p>
              <p>Carlos Tevez has also departed United this summer, but Evra has backed Sir Alex Ferguson to lead United to further glory starting with Sunday's Community Shield clash with Chelsea.</p>
              <p>"I am confident of a good season without Carlos and Cristiano. This is the start of another special United team," added Evra.</p>
              <p>"My focus is to win the Premier League and the Champions League, but we will be looking to win the Community Shield first.</p>
              <p>"People need to remember that the boss is the master of building new teams. Anderson and Nani will be big players in this new team."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>Huge loss</h4>
              <p>Meanwhile, Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard believes the departure of Ronaldo will hurt United and boost their rivals' chances of taking their Premier League crown.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Ronaldo is a huge loss," Lampard told the Sunday Mirror. "In losing him they've taken 70-odd goals over two seasons out of the team.</p>
              <p>"He single-handedly won games for United at times.</p>
              <p>"You look across their team and they have fantastic players across the board. But they are going to miss Ronaldo. Simple as that."</p>
