            <div class='col-md body'>the thing is that if the joke or the post is a direct provoke in bad taste that'll trigger a bad flamming or if the intention of the thread starter is to find fault out of nothing at other clubs which i'm sure all of us or at least most of us here would be able to differentiate then the post should be closed but the thing is the few sentences from the threadstarter reflect what is happening currently.. its sad to hear but plain truth... its like when ppl says Man Utd has got more fans outside Manchester there is 2 ways of looking at it, 1 is that joker is trying to suan us Man Utd fans that over in Manchester their folk support Man City more then they support Man Utd, the other way is, the guy is telling the truth even with 70 over thousand fans on every Man Utd's home game there are indeed more not being able to enter the stadium to give then vocal support..so you're what you want yourself to be or look like.. its like the 1st post, you can choose to translate what you want to interpret but dun just close a thread for the sake of closing it...<br><br>BR..</div>

Cos this Man utd forum have always been a Â“cleanÂ” forum and as much as we like others to join in our discussion, we donÂ’t encourage creating a flame war with other club supporters.

On the contrary we are more mature here and sensitive to others as well. This is a Man utd forum, its main purpose is to bring to all man utd fans in here their news, as well as to share our views amongst us as it happens to be our favourite football club.<br><br>We donÂ’t go around flaming other on purposeÂ… I wouldnÂ’t just say ourselves actually but perhaps you care to take a look at the Pool forum too. Over there their news are pretty much only about themselves, they donÂ’t go around flaming anyone or us for that matter and like I said earlier to you, what seem like Â“a small issueÂ” to one may not be to a hundred.<br><br>It doesnÂ’t matter how many man utd forum one goes throughÂ… If that forum purpose is just to make fun or flame other club supporters then I guess its rather childish wouldnÂ’t you think so? Cos that is nothing really to be proud with... i think.<br><br>That thread starter may or may not have the intention of flaming them I wouldnÂ’t know but I donÂ’t see how mature one must be to accept foul words to be used on them to be consider mature and acceptable? I did say cracking a couple of light hearted joke at other teams is ok, everyone does it once in a whileÂ… But where do you draw the line? Foul words, Names calling, personal attacks are all fun to you?<br><br>I have been to other soccer forums tooÂ… and some of them are quite disgracefulÂ… The language usedÂ… makes you just donÂ’t want to go back againÂ… About a year ago I came across a forum called Sammyboy and till now i havenÂ’t been back because I didnÂ’t find it worthwhile to, I have seen members swearing at each other with every few posts. Do you find all this fun?<br><br>It really doesnÂ’t concern my likes or dislikes to be honest but as I am in a position to do a job here, I still have to do so cos the majority of people here still prefer it to be an informative forum/folder rather than a confrontational one. But of course should the majority of people here feel they would prefer it to be a hostile forum towards other club supportersÂ… I will let it be so too. There is no need to go around cryingÂ… we are all here by choice, not by forceÂ… and serious, there is nothing really mature about going around criticizing and making fun of others over in sportsÂ… especially threads started by clones for that purpose. If anything, its rather immature or childish I feel. But of course, that is only my opinionÂ…<br><br>Your concern for this forum is really appreciated. I am glad that you have taken some time to bother about it. There is nothing restrictive about here apart from foul words being used on fellow members thatÂ’s all. Its important to progress but I rather remain where we are or lower but decent rather than higher but through unnecessary meansÂ…<br><br>This forum doesnÂ’t belong to me, it belongs to all the man utd supporters in here. I am just helping out thatÂ’s all. Actually I hope you would consider being a moderator in here too. This forum has the potential to be the highest club football forum very soon. I have been a mod here for only 2 months but...<br><br><strong>I am prepare and more than happy to let you have my moderator place in here, its no big deal i know... And I hope you will accept it cos I believe you have the interest to keep it going too. As for me, I am still a man utd fan and will continue to support this forum mod or no mod.<br><br>Hope to hear from you again and hope you will accept it too.</strong></div>
