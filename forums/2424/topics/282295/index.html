            <div class='col-md body'><strong>BIG-MATCH FACTS</strong><br><br>* Sir Alex Ferguson plots tactics against one of his former players, not for the first time this season. He'll be hoping for three points against Steve Bruce's Birmingham, 28 days after gaining three over Roy Keane's Sunderland.<br><br>* Both clubs return to league business after midweek defeats in the Carling Cup. Birmingham's was 3-0 at Blackburn; United's more of a shock, as a young inexperienced line-up were defeated 0-2, home to Championship Coventry.<br><br>* United are chasing a fifth successive league win and clean sheet, and could go to the top of the table.<br><br>* Birmingham have won half as many league games as the Red Devils, but scored one more goal.<br><br>* The Midlanders have won one, drawn one and lost one of their three home Premier League matches, scoring three goals and conceding three; United have won one, drawn one and lost one of their three away Premier League matches, scoring two goals and conceding two.<br><br>* It's 29 years since Birmingham last beat Manchester United. They've drawn six and lost 12 league games against them since an emphatic 5-1 top-flight victory on 11 November 1978, when Kevin Dillon, Alan Buckley (two), Don Givens and Jimmy Calderwood were their scorers.<br><br>* This is the Brummies' third of seven consecutive league fixtures against north-west opposition. One of only two defeats in 11 Premier League games against north-west clubs was 3-0 away to Manchester United on 26 March 2006.</div>

Wednesday's defeat to the Sky Blues ended a five-match winning sequence in league and cup, in which no goals were conceded.<br><br>2. On their longest winning sequence in the Premier League, since completing seven in a row on 31 March.<br><br>3. Not conceded in 419 minutes (six hours 59 minutes) of Premier League football since Geovanni scored the winner for Manchester City on 19 August.<br><br>4. Sunday's 2-0 win over Chelsea is the only time in 15 league and cup games more than a single goal has been scored in a match.<br><br>5. The fourth lowest scorers in the Premier League; just six goals in seven matches. Their Premier League matches have yielded fewer goals than any other club - just eight (six for, two against).<br><br>6. Keep more Premier League clean sheets than any other club (five).<br><br>7. Boasting the joint meanest defence in the Premier League with Liverpool. Both clubs have leaked just two goals, at one every 315 minutes (five hours 15 minutes) on average.

Look at their movement, their ability. Rooney is coming back, Ronaldo is coming back - they're worldclass players.<br><br>"So it's only a matter of time. At the moment they're still getting the results even when they don't deserve them.<br><br>"They are so efficient at the moment. They are also rocksolid at the back.<br><br>"To win anything you need a decent defence. It's all right having fantastic players up the pitch, don't get me wrong, but you still have to have a sound base."<br><br>Ferguson conceded it was another three points stolen - like the wins over Tottenham and Everton.<br><br>Ironically, the only game in which they have really played the attacking football that is their hallmark came in the derby defeat at Manchester City.<br><br>While Tevez and Rooney are rare talents, they have not gelled yet. Even so, the United players feel it is only a matter of time.<br><br>Ronaldo, who marked his 100th league start with his 36th Premier League goal just after half-time as he made Queudrue pay for what Bruce term a "horrible mistake", said: "Both are fantastic players and I'm enjoying playing with them.<br><br>"Tevez is a new player and doing a fantastic job for us. Rooney has played all the time and everybody knows how he can play. They are both great players."<br><br>And Ferdinand agreed. "I am not leaving this club to go to any club to play against those two!" said the defender. "I play against them enough in training.<br><br>"Carlos got stronger as the game went on. He and Rooney are similar in that they work hard for the team.<br><br>"Carlos gets in the holes between their midfield and the defence and if he can keep doing that and slipping the ball through to Wayne, it will be a formidable pairing.<br><br>"If you add Louis Saha in there as well, I think we have got something really special if we can continue to keep everyone fit. They all offer different propositions."<br><br>The warning was unmissable. The message was clear: Be afraid. Be very afraid.<br><br>43% POSSESSION 57%<br><br>6 SHOTS ON TARGET 3<br><br>10 SHOTS OFF TARGET 7<br><br>4 OFFSIDES 5<br><br>4 CORNERS 4<br><br>14 FOULS 11<br><br>3 YELLOW CARDS 1<br><br>0 RED CARDS 0<br><br>ATTENDANCE: 26,256<br><br>Man Of The Match: Vidic<br><br>TEAMS AND RATINGS<br><br>Birmingham: Taylor 6, Kelly 6, Djourou 7 (Schmitz 76), Ridgewell 7, Queudrue 5, Larsson 7, Nafti 6 (O'Connor 85), Muamba 6 (Palacios 70, 5) McSheffrey 7, Kapo 6, Jerome 6.<br><br>Man Utd: Van der Sar 7 (Kuszczak 46, 7), Brown 7, Ferdinand 6, Vidic 8, Evra 7, Ronaldo 7, Carrick 6, Scholes 6, Giggs 5 (Saha 64, 5), Rooney 6, Tevez 6 (O'Shea 90).<br><br>Referee: STEVE BENNETT<br><br>Man Utd have won 65 corners this season, more than any other side<br></div>
