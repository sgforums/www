            <div class='col-md body'>Manchester United's striking options for the FA Cup final have been reduced after Sir Alex Ferguson confirmed Louis Saha will not be fit to take on Chelsea at Wembley.<br><br>The forward has scored some important goals for The Red Devils this term, but has made just two appearances since March.<br><br>He looked to have put his problems behind him when making a substitute appearance against Milan in the UEFA Champions League earlier in May, but a knee problem has flared up again.<br><br>He was assessed by the club's medical team and they do not expect him to be fit for the Wembley spectacular.<br><br>"He picked up an injury in his knee during training last week," said manager Sir Alex Ferguson. "He was pencilled in to face City last week, but got an injury."<br><br>Asked if Saha will be available for the cup final, Ferguson added: "I would say not, no."<br><br>Gary Neville is making progress in his battle to overcome an ankle injury, but Ferguson is unsure as to whether his captain will be fit to lead the team out at Wembley.<br><br>"Gary has been doing some light running this week, and did a bit more aggressive work this morning," Ferguson told the club's website.<br><br>"Obviously he's up against it for the final but we're going to give him a chance because he deserves to be fit.<br><br>"He'll have to do some serious work with the football next week as we've not introduced that part yet. Whether it will be soon enough, I have my doubts - unfortunately."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Saha wants to stay</strong><br><br>Louis Saha insists he has no plans to quit Manchester United.<br><br>The French striker's future has been the subject of speculation in recent weeks with Lyon admitting they would be interested in the player.<br><br>Reports have suggested United boss Sir Alex Ferguson is looking for a new striker as he grows increasingly frustrated with his injury problems.<br><br>Barcelona ace Samuel Eto'o is believed to be a transfer target for United and should a new striker arrive at Old Trafford over the summer it will raise a question mark over Saha's future.<br><br>However, Saha is not worried about any increased competition for places in the United side and he has played down rumours linking him Lyon.<br><br>"I want to stay," Saha told L'Equipe. I have just won my first title with Manchester United and it is really great.<br><br>"I want so much to win other titles with the club.<br><br>"Interest from other clubs? I don't know anything. I love my club and I don't want to leave it.<br><br>"If they are saying other good strikers are coming to United I find that good, if that helps us defend our title and win others next year."<br><br>Should Lyon fail to lure Saha back to France they are drawing up a list of alternatives to bolster their attack.<br><br>The French champions are believed to be keeping tabs on West Ham's Carlos Tevez, Bayern Munich's Roy Makaay and Milan forward Alberto Gilardino.<br><br>Makaay could be the best option for Lyon as the Dutchman looks likely to leave Bayern in the summer with the German club planning a major rebuilding plan after a disappointing season this term.</div>
