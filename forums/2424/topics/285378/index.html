But the advantage is that there is a clear run after November.'<br><br>England do have a confirmed friendly against France in March and are also expected to announce a February meeting with Switzerland in February, so the international diversions are not over for Ferguson just yet.<br><br>But non-competitive midweek internationals in the spring do not bring the same problems as the mass call-ups at present, which leave Ferguson with hardly any players to work with.<br><br>'There is a stupid friendly week in March, but I assume it will be limited teams because you are talking about a really important time of the season for league clubs,' added the United boss.<br><br>'Once this next international break is out of the road in November, there is a run to the end of the season. It will help with the consistency.'</div>
