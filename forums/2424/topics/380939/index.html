              <p><strong>Igor Akinfeev is understood to have opened talks over a move to </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span></a><strong> after impressing for CSKA Moscow against the Barclays Premier League champions.</strong></p>
              <p>The Russia goalkeeper's representatives met officials from the Old Trafford club this week with a January move on the agenda.</p>
              <p>United have scouted a number of keepers amid concerns that Ben Foster and Tomasz Kuszczak are not ready to step into Edwin van der Sar's shoes.</p>
              <p>The Dutch veteran is expected to announce soon that this season will be his last. United boss Sir Alex Ferguson praised Akinfeev after both Champions League matches against CSKA - a 1-0 United win Moscow and a 3-3 draw at Old Trafford. But the Scot has refused to confirm United's pursuit of the 23-year-old.</p>
              <p>Akinfeev also says he is paying little attention to reports linking him to United, but that does not stop him speaking in glowing terms about his potential employers.</p>
              <p>Despite holding a two-goal lead in Manchester on Tuesday, he was still happy with the draw.</p>
              <p>'We are satisfied,' he said. 'Not every team scores three goals at Old Trafford. At 3-1, of course you need to think about winning, but we have to be realistic. We played one of the best clubs in world football.</p>
              <p>'Moreover, they had the crazy support of 74,000 fans who drove the team forward.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>'How often have I seen United home games where in the last minutes they're not winning and they practically always score. Unfortunately, this was no different in our match.</strong></p>
              <p>'They were coming at us with some crazy energy in the last 10 minutes. Even in our memorable match against Arsenal (a 0-0 draw in 2006), when the Londoners had lots of chances in the last 10 minutes, we stepped up.'</p>
              <div id="ext-gen11809" class="moduleHalf"> </div>
              <p>Akinfeev clearly enjoyed playing in the Old Trafford atmosphere and has spoken in the past about his love of English football grounds.</p>
              <p>In contrast, he dislikes how the Luzhniki Stadium, CSKA's temporary home, is often two-thirds empty and has a running track between the fans and the action.</p>
              <p>CSKA have signalled they are likely to cash in on some of their stars if they fail to progress from their Champions League group and finish outside the top three in the Russian League.</p>

              <p><strong>They are fifth domestically and would not stand in the way of star players seeking opportunities at bigger clubs, but they would seek more than £10million for Akinfeev.</strong></p>
              <p>New CSKA boss Leonid Slutskiy praised Akinfeev's performance at Old Trafford. 'This is a rare case when a goalkeeper concedes three goals, but, for me, is the man of the match.'</p>
              <p>Akinfeev has 37 caps and a Euro 2008 semi-final outing with Russia, as well as three League titles, four Russian Cups and the 2005 UEFA Cup with CSKA.</p>
              <p>He is constantly compared to the great Lev Yashin and has won the goalkeeper of the year award named after the Soviet legend four times. </p>

              <p class="article">Kuszczak 27, said: "I must say this, Edwin doesn't help me. Maybe he doesn't like me. "He's got more experience and many more games under his belt. So I say, 'You have to give me something more'. "I like to know what I do wrong and like to watch other people. "You'll have to ask him if he doesn't like me."</p>

              <p class="article">"I know what I give to this club even though I do not play regularly. It's a team sport." Van der Sar was recently hailed by boss Alex Ferguson as the best goalkeeper in the game.</p>
