Either at soccer court or field...<br><br>I do.. Now training my left leg too.. Cause right leg is my dominant leg..</div></blockquote>Same, I am totally dependant on my right leg and I'm frustated because its restricting my gameplay. Been trying to train my leftie but not working so well. At least now a bit better in a sense, I can kick the ball using my left leg but I can't juggle the ball with my left leg. Not more than 2-3 touches and the ball drop. If my right leg, I can juggle and even hop around for don't know how long haha..<br>So far I have started to play field soccer with my friends arranging mathes and all. Won 1st game, lost next 2 games. All of us no fitness, and play like 5hiet on the field haha. Maybe too used to playing on court. I prefer playing on basketball courts than on street soccer courts. Because want to kacau the basketball people  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  Hehe no lah but because to score the goal more challenging. Shoot between the 2 long posts. Street soccer so easy to score.<br><br>Share leh the rest of you...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
