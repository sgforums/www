the rebound almost bouncing in off Niemi's head.<br><br>Saha went close either side of the interval, by which time Fulham had at least grabbed an early consolation when Heidar Helguson's shot cannoned in off Rio Ferdinand's shoulder.<br><br>But, clearly, the potential for humiliation was all too much for Michael Brown, who should have been sent off for an appalling stamp on Giggs yet somehow escaped with a yellow card which brought an angry reaction from the home bench.<br><br>On his last appearance for club or country before the middle of next month, Rooney drove home his second from Wes Brown's cut-back, then set up Ronaldo for what would have been United's sixth had the winger not drilled his shot just wide.<br><br><strong>Â• Rooney bemoans ban after star show </strong><br><br>Wayne Rooney described himself as 'devastated' with his three-match ban from the Football Association for his red card in a pre-season friendly.<br><br>He said: 'I was devastated with the ban, especially with the start we've had today.'<br><br>Rooney also dismissed the suggestion there was any lingering tension between him and Portugal international Cristiano Ronaldo following the Englishman's red card when they were on opposite sides in this summer's World Cup.<br><br>The two combined well today with Rooney setting up Ronaldo for United's fourth.<br><br>'People say things who don't know the pair of us and we let our football do the talking today,' Rooney said.<br><br>He added: 'It was a good start for us - getting four goals in the first half an hour was good for us because we could afford to relax.'<br><br>United manager Sir Alex Ferguson is confident his team can survive while Rooney serves his ban.<br><br>He told Sky Prem Plus: 'Unfortunately, we don't have him for the next three matches but we'll cope with that.<br><br>'That's why we've got a squad of players.'<br><br>Ferguson confirmed United are still pursuing Bayern Munich's England midfielder Owen Hargreaves.<br><br>'We're trying hard but Bayern Munich are very stubborn and resistant - and I can understand that - but we'll do our best,' said the Scot.<br><br>Ferguson believes his side - featuring young talents like Rooney and Ronaldo - are ready to mount a serious title challenge.<br><br>'The younger players are getting better so I'm happy about that,' he said.<br><br>Ferguson added: 'It's probably our best start to the season. The making and taking of the goals was excellent. Throughout the match we played with great confidence and belief.'<br><br><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=199091&amp;cc=4716" rel="nofollow">http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=199091&amp;cc=4716</a></div>

Our attack was devastating and defensive wise, Evra was brilliant and Scholes, didn't look his age... That tackle on Giggs was totally uncalled for..
