              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson wants to sign no fewer than three Borussia Dortmund players after watching their 5-2 German Cup final win over Bayern Munich on Saturday night. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span>The </span><span style="color: #000000;">Manchester United</span><span> manager is favourite to land attacking midfielder Shinji Kagawa but is also lining up moves for Poland striker Robert Lewandowski, who scored a hat-trick, and Germany defender Mats Hummels. </span> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Contract talks with Lewandowski have broken down and his agent Maik Barthel said: 'The offer from Dortmund is not enough and I can confirm there is interest from Manchester United.' </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">It is also understood Hummels's father Hermann, who acts as his agent, has been invited to Manchester for talks. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">United would have to pay close on £50million for all three, but Dortmund managing director Hans-Joachim Watzke struck a defiant note by saying: 'We expect Kagawa to go, but no amount of money will persuade us to sell the others.'</span></p>

              <p>Yes really need Hummels. Sorry but think Rio is way way past his prime.</p>
              <p>But really no confidence for Kagawa. Unless he comes in cheap. Don't have confidence for asian players because they don't see to be able to play passing game. Park Ji Sung is hardworking but they never pass the ball to him and he run around like Michael Chang the tennis player - like an aimless bull.</p>
              <p>Good thing Park only cost $ 4 mil. THis Kagawa - $50mil???? Too costly.</p>

              <p>Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson has made a bid worth £5million for Crewe whizkid Nick Powell in an attempt to beat off his rivals.</p>
              <p>United have put in the first serious offer for attacking midfielder Powell, with around £2m guaranteed and potentially more than double that to follow, based on appearances.</p>
              <p>Fergie has been on Powell's trail for weeks - <span style="color: #000000;">as Football Spy revealed</span><span style="color: #000000;"> - and </span><span style="color: #000000;">his play-off display at Wembley only confirmed their faith in him</span><span style="color: #000000;">.</span></p>
              <p>The 18-year-old scored a brilliant opening goal last Sunday as Crewe beat Cheltenham 2-0 to clinch promotion to League One.</p>
              <p>Powell may be given permission to speak to Ferguson this week, but will not jump into the move as he wants to be sure he will be playing regularly at his new club.</p>
              <p>United may agree to send him out on loan - even back to Crewe for a year - as they want to secure his signature because Tottenham, Chelsea and Arsenal are hovering.</p>
              <p>Alex <em>will</em> sell if they get the right amount of money up front.</p>
              <p>They wanted £3m guaranteed and expect to agree that figure in the next few days.</p>
