              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"> </p>
              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7">CRISTIANO RONALDO has proved he is simply the Best — now he can show he is ‘Law-some’ by smashing through the 40-goal barrier.</p>
              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7">The Manchester United star beat George Best’s record for goals in a season by a winger when he took his tally to 33 with a double against Bolton on Wednesday.</p>
              <p class="article">With at least 10 matches still to play — and possibly as many as 13 — the Portuguese ace now has his sights set firmly on shooting down more Old Trafford legends.</p>
              <p class="article">Assistant boss Carlos Queiroz sees no reason why his countryman cannot find the net in all of the remaining eight Premier League matches.</p>
              <p class="article">That would mean he matches Dennis Viollet’s record of 32 league goals for United, set in 1959-60.</p>
              <p class="article">And if he sends United to the Champions League final and scores in the remaining five European ties as well, his season tally would be 46 — the same as Denis Law notched up in 1963-64.</p>
              <p class="article">Queiroz said: “Beating Best’s record is a fantastic achievement. Since the beginning of the season we started to feel that something special was in Cristiano’s sights.</p>
              <p class="article">“But I am sure most of us didn’t expect that this year he could go so far. We are happy with him but let’s see if he can get more before the end of the season.</p>
              <h4>Ronaldo is closing in on that target</h4>
              <p class="article">"Maybe in the next eight games he can score one per game and that will give us a big chance to win the Championship.”</p>
              <p class="article">Only Law and Ruud van Nistelrooy five years ago have ever reached the magical 40 mark for United.</p>
              <p class="article">Ronaldo is now closing in on that target. But the 23-year-old reckons scoring in every game is a tall order.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: “I’m very proud of what I’ve achieved but I don’t expect to score every game, to be honest. I just try game by game to play good, not think about scoring goals. If you think too much that you’re going to score then you don’t.</p>
              <p class="article">“My confidence is high and I feel very good, in good form. The team is playing nice football — when the team is playing good, wingers and strikers feel more comfortable.</p>
              <p class="article">“My team-mates help me a lot with good passes and great opportunities to score goals.”</p>
              <p class="article">Ronaldo was made skipper for the night by boss Alex Ferguson and repaid that faith by leading United to a comfortable 2-0 win over Bolton.</p>
              <p class="article">He netted both goals in the first half, with his second one of his trademark free-kicks, which he has nicknamed ‘The Rocket’.</p>
              <p class="article">It gave United a three-point cushion over second-placed Arsenal and he has issued a rallying call to his team-mates not to throw away their advantage. He said: “Being captain was a pleasure and an honour — it’s marvellous for me to be captain of this massive club.</p>
              <p class="article">“The lads knew how important it was to beat Bolton. We wanted to make sure we stayed top and it’s good.</p>
              <p class="article">“Now we have a small advantage. But now we need to think about Sunday’s game with Liverpool and if we can do that then we’ll have a good chance.</p>
              <p class="article">“We have to take it game by game and if we play like that we’ll have a good chance of winning the title.”</p>
              <p class="article">Ferguson was full of praise for his star man.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: “Beating Best’s record is a phenomenal achievement. There won’t be a winger in this world that can do that. It’s a measure of the quality of the lad and his scoring ability.”</p>
