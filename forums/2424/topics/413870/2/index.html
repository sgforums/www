              <p>Exactly. And even if it was to be a freekick, it should be where Nani was lying, not so much further in front. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Let me explain what happened... And for the fact that it should have been a penalty, I do not think it's poor sportsmanship since the defender manhandled nani. The slow replay clearly showed the defender tugging nani back and given nani small frame, the tugging is alot of force pulling him back.</p>
              <p>Anyway, here's what happened. The goalkeeper thought it was a free kick. So he rolled the ball out. BUT, it's NOT a freekick. Since it's not a free kick, it has to be a GOALKICK. So goal kick means if the goalkeeper roll the ball out, it's resumed into play. Nani simply went to tap the ball into the net and since it's in play, it's a goal.</p>

              <h1 class="storyTitle" style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px; font-size: 2.8em;">Ferguson: Gomes to blame for bizarre Nani goal</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson believes Tottenham goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes was to blame for Manchester United's controversial second goal in their 2-0 win over Tottenham, claiming the Brazilian "should have known better''.</p>
              <p>Nani
               poked home the goal after 84 minutes after Gomes had placed the ball 
              down, seemingly thinking his side had been awarded a free-kick in his 
              area.</p>
              <p>Nani, who had appealed for a penalty moments earlier, then 
              swooped to score and, after referee Mark Clattenburg consulted with his 
              assistant, the goal was awarded to spark furious protests from the 
              Tottenham players.</p>
              <p>"It was bizarre," Ferguson told <em>ESPN</em>. 
              "No-one knew at the time what was wrong. One minute the goalkeeper had 
              the ball in his hands and next it's in his net. Nani looked back and 
              looked at the referee and the referee said play on, so what can he do 
              but put the ball in the net.</p>
              <p>"You can look at the referee and look
               at the linesmen and blame them, but the goalkeeper should know better. 
              He's an experienced goalkeeper. I thought he made a mess of it. I 
              thought it was a penalty first of all and I think Nani felt he handled 
              the ball. But the referee didn't blow for it.</p>
              <p>"The referee played 
              on because the goalkeeper took possession of the ball. He then went to 
              take a free-kick thinking it was a foul. He made an error.''</p>
              <p>Tottenham
               boss Harry Redknapp vented his anger at referee Clattenburg, claiming 
              the official had failed to spot a handball by Nani, which led to Gomes 
              believing Spurs had won a free-kick.</p>
              <p>"It was handball. He put his 
              hand on the ball and dragged it down,'' Redknapp said. "He should have 
              been booked. The referee didn't see him handball it, that's why he's 
              allowed play to go on.
              The assistant referee has seen it, that's why he's flagged.</p>
              <p>"He's
               (Clattenburg) gone over and he's told him what he did, he should 
              disallow the goal. He's handled the ball. If he's handled the ball he 
              should be booked and it's a free-kick. So Gomes put the ball down for a 
              free-kick.</p>
              <p>"If you look at (Darren) Fletcher he's called Nani to 
              get back into position because he thinks we're going to counter attack 
              from the free-kick. Gomes puts the ball down to take a free-kick. It's 
              obvious. Why would he stand there and leave the ball there after he saw 
              him handball it?''</p>
              <p>Redknapp said his side may have been able to 
              claim a point if the goal had been disallowed, despite the fact they had
               already trailed to Nemanja Vidic's first-half header.</p>
              <p>"You never 
              know, the game lasts 90 minutes,'' Redknapp said. You dont know, we're 
              one down we may get another opportunity to score. You don't know.''</p>
              <p>Fletcher
               offered a third viewpoint - from on the pitch - saying that the referee
               had failed to whistle for a foul. As a result he said Nani was left 
              with no option but to tap the ball into the unguarded net.</p>
              <p>"The 
              referee never blew. I don't know whether the goalkeeper thought the 
              referee had seen a foul for simulation, but he never blew his whistle,''
               he said. "The goalie puts it down and then Nani puts the ball in the 
              net.</p>
              <p>"It's one of those where nobody really knows what's 
              happened, but Nani has no option other than to put the ball in the net. 
              He's got the opportunity to score - he's got to score. We are always 
              told to play to the whistle.''</p>

              <p>this is my take:</p>
              <p>referee was in two minds when he saw Nani go down.....to award a penalty or not. He chose the latter. He saw Nani handle the ball as he went down and by right, he should award Nani a yellow and a free kick to Spurs. Perhaps he wasn't sure if he had made a wrong decision on not awarding the penalty, so he felt hesitant to book Nani too.</p>
              <p>Imo, the first person to cork up is mark clattenburg. He didnt award a legitimate penalty and when he's made his decision not to, he failed to book Nani for clear handball. This also confused Gomes, who subsequently screwed up by not playing to the whistle.</p>
              <p>I have often seen players getting fouled and putting their hands on the ball while still on the ground. Then the ref upon seeing that, blows for foul in favour of that player. It's that little bit of the game which the ref normally turns a blind eye to. By right, the whistle should be blown before anyone handles the ball.</p>

              <p>Having said that, i think carrick must be suffering a loss of confidence. And he disappears from the game as usual, doesnt stamp his mark the way he should as a midfielder. Berba seems to be recapturing the form he had last year lol, pun intended of course.</p>
              <p>I think from now, hope i'm correct, man u will stop leaking goals on evidence of their defensive performance over the last two games.</p>

              </span></p><p>I thought Rafael handled Bale very well... Which I was quite surprised... He matched Spurs man of the moment flying winger Bale every step of the way... What a great defender considering the price they paid for him... And Spurs seem to lost the way once Vdv left the pitch...</p>
              <p>And on the Nani's goal which everyone seem to have an opinion... lol.</p>
              <p>Well, mine is... From all the different angles of the camera... First of all, that was an obvious penatly and a yellow card offence which the referee not sure why didn't see or gave... Nani had his hand on the ball for a very short moment which Gomes quickly scoop it up into his own hands... All this while that ref didn't blow his whistle to indicate anything for I think he was hoping to get the game going as soon as possible so as to move away from a penalty appeal from the United players... But Gomes strangely drops the ball then push it a little further then step a long way back... Nani got up and went towards the ball not having heard any whistle being blown by the ref... And this part I think it's very important, from the back angle of the tv camera, the ref could clearly be seen putting both his hands up in a fashion like asking what's going on or something and why is the match not continuing? Nani was clearly seen asking the ref is the match still live or has it stop and the ref seemed to indicate he never stop the match...</p>
              <p>I have seen a lot of times when a referee not wanting to give a penalty rightly so or not, wants the match to continue so as not to have players coming up to him to protest... So in this case, United actually deserved a penalty but was deny and Spurs keeper read the match wrongly... On hindsight, Gomes could have waited for Nani to move away before dropping the ball or taken it as soon as he drop it down onto the ground...</p>
              <p>I think it's very unfortune for United to even be in this stupid controversy in the first place... If anything the referee did poorly was, a good United display against Spurs was rob by a moment of confusion by a referee's interpretation of the situation... A penalty and a sending off for the Spurs defender would have gone quietly into the night and I don't think many could argue with it... Instead this will now be talk about for years to come...</p>
