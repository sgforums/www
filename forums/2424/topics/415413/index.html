              <p id="story_continues_1" class="introduction">(from BBC)</p>
              <p class="introduction">Manchester United's 
              American owners are to pay off their high interest payment-in-kind (PIK)
               loans, estimated to be worth around £220m.</p>
              <p>The loans were borrowed from three US hedge funds to help finance the Glazer family's £790m takeover in 2005.</p>
              <p>The BBC understands the club's joint chairman Joel Glazer has
               written to the lenders and said the loan would be paid in full on 
              November 22.</p>
              <p>The football club's total debts are estimated at more than £720m.</p>
              <p><span class="cross-head">Reduced loans</span></p>
              <p>It is not yet clear how the Glazer family were able to raise the money to pay off the PIK loans.</p>
              <p>They are understood to have given the Citadel, Och Ziff and Perry Capital hedge funds seven days' notice of the repayment.</p>
              <p>The PIK loans were significantly reduced as part of a 
              refinancing in 2006 but since then have been accruing interest at 
              extremely punitive rates.</p>
              <p>Earlier this year the rate rose to 16.25% and although the 
              Glazers are liable for the debt, supporters have long suspected money 
              from the club would eventually be used to start paying them off.</p>
              <p>As part of a £526m bond refinancing in January, the Glazers 
              were given the freedom to take up to £70m from the club's revenues to 
              pay down the PIKs.</p>
              <div class="caption body-narrow-width"><span style="width: 304px;">The Glazer family borrowed the money from three hedge funds</span></div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By notifying the lenders they intend to pay them off in full 
              next Monday, the Glazers will reduce a lot of the financial pressure on 
              the club.</p>
              <p>The club's parent company, Red Football Limited, is due to 
              publish financial results for the first quarter on Tuesday, but those 
              figures are not expected to include details of how the PIKs, which sit 
              on the accounts of Red Football Joint Venture Ltd, have been redeemed.</p>
              <p>Despite making a £79.6m pre tax loss for the last financial 
              year, mainly due to one off interest and debt charges, United generated 
              revenues of £278m and have over £100m of cash reserves.</p>
              <p>But taking money from the club at a time when many supporters
               feel there should be more investment in the team will only add to the 
              opposition to the Glazers at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>If the money hasn't been taken out in that way then the 
              Glazers may have borrowed the money from other financial institutions at
               more affordable rates to refinance the PIKs.</p>
              <p>good news or bad?</p>

              <p>Though others may have doubts about them, I always felt the Glazers were good for United... The timing and the period they came into the club was the second best thing the fans could get apart from... of course, a rich sugar daddy kind. But even than, rich sugar daddies may used the club to play football manager with their purchase, which may not be a good thing too...</p>
              <p>Anyway, The Glazers will serve their time until a period where a better owner comes along. But for now, I think they are still the right people...</p>

              <p>well, I reserve my views.. no owners are good if they pile debts on their new purchase.</p>
              <p>sugar daddies aren't all bad, but of course, not all good too.</p>
