              <p>Fergie will need to grapple with the problem of fielding a strong team against City and resting sufficient players against Arsenal.</p>
              <p>My ideal first XI  with</p>
              <p>VDS - Brown, Rio,  Evans, Evra - Flecther, Carrick, Nani, Valencia - Rooney, Diouf/Owen</p>
              <p>We should try 4-2-3-1 against a weaker team soon. I feel United has the pace to play in this formation if Diouf, Rooney, Nani and Valencia are in the team.</p>

              <p>so which is more important to fergie, a place in the league cup finals or the 3 points against Arsenal? its a hard one to choose, as it is against your hatred rival and neighbour.</p>

              <p>ya fergie need to strike a balance. I think its better to rest Rooney, as he has been playing non stop in mid week and on weekends.</p>

              <p class="article">And while United contemplate another Wembley final, City will have to shelve plans to take over as the No1 club in the city.</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">
              </span></p><p class="article">Goals from Paul Scholes and Michael Carrick put United 3-2 ahead on aggregate.</p>
              <p class="article">First-leg hero Carlos Tevez looked to have forced extra-time with a 76th-minute reply.</p>
              <p class="article">But Rooney popped up in the second minute of injury time to break City's hearts.</p>
              <p class="article">United keeper Edwin van Der Sar was the slightly busier keeper in a first-half which although had a feisty edge to it, failed to really spark.</p>
              <p class="article">Van der Sar made routine saves from headers by Craig Bellamy and Carlos Tevez.</p>
              <p class="article">At the other end, Shay Given had to be alert to get down to a Ryan Giggs drive after a neat United move.</p>
              <p class="article">Perhaps the major talking point was whether Rio Ferdinand illegally pushed Tevez off the ball as the Argie striker surged into the box.</p>
              <p class="article">The second half got off to a storming start as Micah Richards ran from halfway before forcing Van Der Sar into a superb fingertip save from his left-footed curler. From the corner, Giggs failed to clear but Bellamy's half-volley only found the midriff of Van der sar.</p>
              <p class="article">Bellamy was then subjected to a torrent of abuse as he went to take a corner. And the incident turned ugly when bottles were thrown at the Welshman before he was hit on the head by a coin.</p>
              <p class="article">Play continued and immediately United broke through Wayne Rooney. He played in Giggs with a glorious 50-yard pass, with the Welshman's first touch equally devastating. He was forced wide and Nani then looked to have wasted the chance before Michael Carrick touched the ball to Scholes who hammered home from just inside the box.</p>
              <p class="article">Richard saw a shot diverted over by Jonny Evans but United took the lead on 71 minutes.</p>

              <p class="article"><strong>Nani's cross found Fletcher and although he could not get a shot away, he kept his cool to touch the ball to Carrick who passed the ball into the net.</strong></p>
              <p class="article">Rooney should have killed the tie two minutes later but he somehow stabbed wide from inside the six-yard box.</p>
              <p class="article">And City took advantage as they quickly got back on level terms, with Tevez getting ahead of Ferdinand to cleverly flick home Bellamy's curling centre.</p>
              <p class="article">Carrick was left cursing himself after dragging a shot wide from eight yards having seen his first effort blocked.</p>
              <p class="article">But the real drama was still to come as first Fletcher's header was kept out by Given before Rooney stole the glory by popping up to head home Giggs' centre.</p>

              <p>A pity we couldn't get to watch this match on Tv... The way the match went and especially how it ended (Rooney with injury time winner) must have been a fantastic game to watch...</p>
              <p>Personally, this match was so important unlike other Carling Cup matches, beating City after the way the first leg ended makes it so much more sweeter... Actually, Beating City last night was probably more sweeter than winning the Carling Cup itself... lol.</p>

              <p><strong>The banner at the Stretford End mocking Manchester City's lengthy wait for a trophy will not be torn down just yet.</strong></p>
              <p>City boss Roberto Mancini vowed to tear it down, while their cocksure chief executive Garry Cook had predicted an imminent power shift in Manchester.</p>
              <p>Yet all their bold rhetotic proved premature, as United put their "noisy neighbours" firmly in their place by reaching Wembley at their expense and prolonging their 34-year wait for silverware.</p>
              <p>On the eve of the game Sir Alex Ferguson accused City of getting "carried away" with their plans for world domination, and mocked the hapless Cook's delusions of grandeur.</p>
              </div>

              <p><strong>Wayne Rooney quietened 'noisy neighbours' Manchester City with an injury-time winner which sent Manchester United to Wembley.</strong></p>
              <p>Last week, in a New York bar named Mad Hatter, City chief executive Garry Cook delivered the best team-talk Sir Alex Ferguson could have wanted as he declared this Carling Cup tie as good as over with the Blues leading 2-1 from the first leg at Eastlands.</p>
              <p>If Cook knew much about Manchester United, it is this - never write them off.</p>
              <p>So, after Carlos Tevez had threatened to take the semi-final into extra-time when he quite brilliantly turned home Craig Bellamy's cross 14 minutes from time, up popped Rooney, who nodded home Ryan Giggs' cross to secure a Carling Cup final meeting with Aston Villa on February 28.</p>
              <p>In fact, the Red Devils thought they were already there.</p>
              <p>Controlling possession against a City side which sat too deep, they had carved out a decisive lead thanks to two precise finishes from Paul Scholes and Michael Carrick.</p>
              <p>Only Tevez's refusal to bow at the feet of his old club kept the Blues going, but it was not enough. And though Rooney inexplicably failed to grab a third before Tevez struck, he is too much a part of United's fabric to merely accept defeat.</p>
              <p>City were attempting to "change history" in Mancini's words.</p>
              <p>In pure domestic and European terms alone, United had made 21 cup final appearances and won 11 league titles since the Blues last reached Wembley in 1981.</p>
              <p>Tevez was the clear focal point for City from the start. The South American flung himself at a Bellamy cross and Edwin van der Sar needed Jonny Evans' help to ensure there was no trouble after he had dropped what seemed to be a routine save.</p>
              <p>Rio Ferdinand got away with a despairing lunge at Tevez that left the former United man on the deck. If referee Howard Webb had been feeling in a stricter mood, the gamble of playing Ferdinand this evening and leaving the consequences to be faced tomorrow when he goes before an FA disciplinary panel could have backfired disastrously.</p>

              <p>In the spotlight: the game was bound to focus on United old-boy Carlo Tevez whose comments after the first leg had couased such controversy...</p>

              <p>Top man: Wayne Rooney quietened 'noisy neighbours' Manchester City with an injury-time winner which sent Manchester United to Wembley</p>

              <p>So close: Mancini saw City denied their first Wembley appearance since 1981</p>

              <p>United players celebrate meeting Aston Villa at wembley Stadium on Feb 28th in a repeat of the 1994 Carling Cup final.</p>
              <p><strong>As the teams trooped in for their half-time pep talk, the feeling persisted that the game was destined to explode.</strong></p>
              <p>The firecracker went off seven minutes after the restart and following a brief stoppage after Bellamy had been hit on the back of the head by a coin as he went to retrieve the ball for a City corner.</p>
              <p>United quickly countered as City conceded possession. Rooney delivered a superb pass for Giggs, who would have had a clear sight of goal if City goalkeeper Shay Given had not been so quick to react and push him out wide.</p>
              <p>The veteran Welshman did not panic and delivered the ball back into the City area and, after, Nani had run into a wall of defenders, Michael Carrick prodded the ball back for Scholes, who drove his shot into the bottom corner.</p>
              <p>United had the scent of Wembley in their nostrils and when Nani flicked a superb pass through to Darren Fletcher inside the City box, the Scotland star had the awareness to lay a pass off to Carrick. The England midfielder does not score many, but he is an accurate striker of the ball and his shot was perfectly placed into the bottom corner with the aid of the post.</p>
              <p>If Rooney had tapped home Patrice Evra's cross when he was completely unmarked three minutes later, the tie would have been over. Inexplicably, he put it wide.</p>
              <p>It was virtually certain Rooney would be made to pay almost instantly. After playing a pass out to Bellamy, Tevez continued his run and somehow managed to squeeze the ball beyond Van der Sar from the most unlikely angle.</p>
              <p>United could feel aggrieved but relief should have arrived 10 minutes from time when Vincent Kompany's block offered Carrick a second chance. On this occasion though his snap shot flew wide.</p>
              <p>But Rooney still had one more trick up his sleeve. And with it came a very large slice of humble pie for Cook.</p>
