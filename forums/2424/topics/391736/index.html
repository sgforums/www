              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Brazilian midfielder Anderson has admitted that he has considered whether he has a future at Old Trafford since falling out of Sir Alex Ferguson's team in the last month.</strong></p>
              <p>Along with returning defenders Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic, Anderson is in contention for a place in the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Manchester United</span></a> team for Tuesday's Barclays Premier League home game against <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/west-ham-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;">West Ham</span></a>.</p>
              <div class="floatRHS">
              <p class="imageCaption">He has not featured at all since the 2-1 Carling Cup defeat at <span style="color: #003580;">Manchester City </span>more than a month ago and during that time the 21-year-old disappeared to Brazil after skipping a training session.</p>
              </div>
              <p>'I went to Brazil to think about my future,' admitted Anderson. 'I didn't go there to negotiate with other clubs, though.</p>
              <p>'It's been a difficult season for me as I haven't played enough games. 'The coach has asked me for more effort and I accept that but I need more chances to play in the first team. I have explained my situation in private to him.</p>
              <p>'I am not a machine. It is impossible to function at 100% in each match. I accept that my work was not good during some matches but those were not significant enough to stop me playing for a long time I hope.</p>
              <p>'Sincereley, I am not finished at United. I insist that I can offer much to this team in the decisive moments of the season.</p>
              <p>'I am happy here. I want to stay.'</p>
              <p>Ferguson will reshape his team for tonight's match after Saturday's defeat at Everton, with Ferdinand certain to play at the back after serving a suspension and Vidic also hopeful of a game after recovering from injury.</p>
              <div class="clear">
              <p>Whether Anderson plays remains to be seen by the former Porto player admitted last night he must return to action soon if his place in Brazil's World Cup squad isn't to be seriously threatened.</p>
              <p>'One of the my dreams this season is to be in the Brazil squad for the World Cup but if i do not play for United then the coach Dunga is not interested in me,' explained Anderson.</p>
              <p>'This is very hard for me because I need minutes on the field during the coming matches.</p>
              <p>'I have won titles here but still the people have not seen my real performance on the field. 'I am a professional footballer and my responsibility is to United. Am I happy? I am optimistic but if I play more then I will be more content. That is normal.'</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong>United midfielder Anderson has been ruled out for six months with a cruciate knee ligament injury.<br><br></strong>The Brazilian was forced off in the first half against West Ham on Tuesday and will undergo an operation in Portugal in a fortnight, but Sir Alex Ferguson hopes the 21-year-old will be fit for the start of the 2010/11 campaign.<br><br>"The real bad news we have got is that Anderson has suffered a cruciate knee injury and he’ll be out for rest of the season," confirmed the boss on Thursday. "It’s unfortunate for the boy. It’s a bad blow.<br><br>"We’ve assessed the situation, we know he needs an operation. That will be done in two weeks’ time when the swelling has gone down. We’re going to let him go to Portugal to do it. Sometimes we send them to Colorado and to Dr Richard Steadman, but on this occasion he is comfortable with the specialist he has dealt with at Porto in the past. He will deal with it. We made these decisions yesterday once we had assessed the damage. But hopefully, six months, should have him about right for the new season."<br><br>The incident itself against West Ham seemed innocuous enough, Anderson stretching to reach the ball to make a pass. "With these types of injuries, it’s usually something simple. He stretched to pass the ball and his knee just popped," added the boss.<br><br>"It’s a bad bit of news for him. He was just getting back into the first team after being out for a few weeks. He was looking forward to it and he was showing great energy in the match.<br><br>"So that is a blow to us, particularly with the Milan game coming up, because Michael Carrick is suspended for that one."</p></div>
