              <h2><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/34162_news.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="288"></h2>
              <h2>All the talk has been of Rafael da Silva, but his brother Fabio could be just as precious a talent.</h2>
              <p>Due to the outstanding manner in which Rafael da Silva has tackled
              his way into household conversation with his eye-catching displays in a
              Manchester United shirt, it is easy to forget that he has a twin
              brother - also at the club.  </p>
              <p>Fabio is equally as comfortable playing the short pass as he is
              sending a ball over the top from the first to the final third in route
              one style. He keeps his eye on the ball and tackles well, and cleanly.</p>
              <p>Like his brother Rafael, Fabio likes to get forward, and has even
              been known to pull the strings when representing Brazil at youth level.
              He is also a specialist from a dead ball situation.</p>
              <p>The reason why he is yet to feature for Manchester United's first
              team is because he is recovering from a complicated shoulder injury,
              and Patrice Evra is also maintaining a firm stranglehold on the left
              back position.</p>
              <p>Cries in England have been heard claiming that Fabio is the more
              talented of the twins, but reports in Brazil suggest it is more
              balanced.</p>
              <p><em><strong>Sensation</strong></em></p>
              <p>Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson though believes Fabio can easily equal the early success of Rafael.</p>
              <p>"Rafael and Fabio are identical twins," Ferguson is quoted by the Mirror as saying.</p>
              <p>"I can hardly tell them apart, except that one is married and wears a ring.</p>
              <p>"It will be interesting to find out if their football ability is
              identical too. There's every chance it is because Fabio captained the
              Brazil team at every youth level."</p>
              <p>He continued: "Rafael has been a revelation this season. He's
              impressed us a lot and justified being picked whenever he's played.</p>
              <p>"Some people might have been a bit surprised I've picked him over
              Wes Brown and Gary Neville at times, but I feel the boy has something
              special.</p>
              <p>"But all the players, Gary and Wes included, are supportive of him.</p>
              <p>"They think he's fantastic. Rafael doesn't speak English that well
              but his understanding of football is marvellous and we have high hopes
              for him."</p>
