                                      really strong attachments to home, family and domestic scene. The 1
                                      and 5 equalling 6, provide the sort of energy that makes you an
                                      excellent parent or teacher. You are very responsible and capable.
                                      This is an attractive and an attracting influence. You like harmony
                                      in your environment and strive to maintain it. You tend to learn by
                                      observation rather than study and research. You may like to cook,
                                      but you probably don't follow recipes. This number shows artistic
                                      leanings and would certainly support any talents that may be
