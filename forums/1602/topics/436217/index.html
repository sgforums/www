              <div class="format_text entry-content" style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5em;"><img class="post_image alignright" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em; float: right; padding: 0px;" src="http://cdn.adventofdeception.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/20121-2.jpg" alt="2012,deception,fluke, new age" width="458" height="225">
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">Most people around the earth still view the disasters of 9-11, the earthquakes, airplane deaths, the death of popular people such as Michael Jackson as a part of life, it just happens. The Terrorists did it—9-11, “God” is causing the earthquakes—Haiti, an airplane malfunction—AF447. However, very few people are aware, nor do people consider the numerology behind the <a style="text-decoration: underline; color: #2410de; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" href="http://adventofdeception.com/evil-earthly-organization">Illuminati</a> of the Occult and the usage of Black Magic.</p>
              <blockquote style="padding-top: 5px; padding-right: 5px; padding-bottom: 1px; padding-left: 20px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 30px; border-left-width: 2px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: #343436; color: #4f4c43; background-image: none; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: initial; font-family: Verdana; font-style: italic; font-weight: 700; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">Please note: this article is not about the belief in the Occult, it is about the numerology and how the combined powers of the darkness use the numerology of the Occult to accomplish its agenda. The Occult does exist and is a very powerful entity for the governments and its agencies, secret societies, masonry, and all offshoots of the powers of the darkness. This can scare many people, but just understanding that the Occult uses numerology and symbolism all over the world can assist to comprehending the agenda of the NWO.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">From researching the prime numbers of the occult in relation to 2012, there is a paramount reason why the world is popularizing the date of 12/21 2012 and the time 11:11. Without understanding the number system of the occult religion, the numbers of 2012 look innocent, we indeed don’t view the number 666 within the date. Well, this post will analyze the numbers of 12/21 2012 11:11.</p>
              <h3 style="margin-top: 1.8em; margin-bottom: 0.6em; font-weight: 400; font-family: 'Arial Black', 'Arial Bold', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1.25em; line-height: 1.2em;">The Numbers of the Serpent Occult Religion.</h3>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">The most venerated occult numbers are: 3, 6, 9, 11, 13, and multiples thereof, especially 22, <strong style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">33</strong>, 44, 55, 66, 77. A triplication of numbers is also considered sacred (possibly even more sacred) to the occultist: 111, 222, 333, and so fourth. The number 5 is the number of Death; also, an extremely scared number is the double 11, as in 11:11, or 11/11/11.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">The number 7 and 12 are also an extremely important number universally. Seven is a number of complement and is considered a Divine number. Seven days in a week, seven colors to the rainbow. The occult will also use this number 7, but their favorite numbers are 11 and 6. The occult avoids using the numbers and multiplications of 4, 8, 10, and 12, unless they correlate with their numbers.</p>
              <h3 style="margin-top: 1.8em; margin-bottom: 0.6em; font-weight: 400; font-family: 'Arial Black', 'Arial Bold', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1.25em; line-height: 1.2em;">The 2012 Numerology?</h3>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">The winter solstice in 2012 will occur 12/21 2012 and at 11:11 universal time.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">The time is 11:11 that adds to 22.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><span style="color: #ff0000; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><strong style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">The entire date: 12/21/2012 = 1+2+2+1+2+0+1+2= 11!</strong></span><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><strong style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><em style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">The date according to the Occult is really 11:11:11.</em></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">WOW, that means the date and time correlates with the triple power sacred number of <strong style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">11:11:11</strong>.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">The number 11 correlates with the letter K as in KKK = 11:11:11.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">1+1+1+1+1+1 = 6; 11+11+11 = 33.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">Also, 6+6 = 12, 3×7 = 21; the day and month 12/21 or, = 1+2+2+1 = 6 which adds 666 to the mix, from the month of 12.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">The day of 21 is a multiple of 7×3 that signifies a time of complement.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">2+1+2 = 5, the number of death; the year 2012. But, not the “end of the world” but the death of an old age into a new—the new world order.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><strong style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">All the numbers of the Occult are related to 2012; 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 22, and 33 = 11:11:11.</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><strong style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">So the day and month relate to 6 and to 666 (covertly), the year relates to 5 (death), and the time of the solstice relates to the power number of 11 doubled (activation). And, the day relates to 7 (time of complement). And, most importantly the entire dates adds to 11 that creates the triple 11:11:11 and adds to 33 (Illuminati Mason Pyramid of the 33*).</strong></p>
              <blockquote style="padding-top: 5px; padding-right: 5px; padding-bottom: 1px; padding-left: 20px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 30px; border-left-width: 2px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: #343436; color: #4f4c43; background-image: none; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: initial; font-family: Verdana; font-style: italic; font-weight: 700; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">All the numbers of the Occult are involved with the 2012 syndrome. But, what is the meaning, and the deception behind 2012?</p>

              <h4 style="font-family: 'Arial Black', 'Arial Bold', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1em;">11:11</h4>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">11:11 signifies the activation of a “new beginning”. Aquarius is associated with the astrological 11th house, the “water bearer”, a possibility of entering into the “Age of Aquarius”. The current age of Pisces, the two fish, possibly representing the battle between the darkness and the light of the last two thousand years. The Occult Serpent religion views a “death” and a new beginning as very important. Throughout the centuries the fertility worship of the spring equinox has held in place that dates all the way back to Sumer of 3500 BCE. Considering this history, the death of an old age, into a new age is extremely important, and this age will be the age of the dominance of the New World Order and the rise of the occult agenda. So considering the occult numerology about 12/21/2012 11:11, or more importantly, <strong style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">11:11:11</strong>, we can be assured that startling events will take place around this time.</p>
              <h4 style="font-family: 'Arial Black', 'Arial Bold', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1em;">2012 and 666</h4>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">Using the numbers of 2012 dividing by 666, the number is 3.021021021021. 2+1 = 3, the prime numbers of the Occult.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">2012 divide 6 = 335.33333333.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">2012-666 = 1346; Interesting, the date when the black death plague began. In Europe the date of the Black Death is said to have commenced between 1346 and 1348 from many different sources. Even of the plague started in Europe in 1347, the virus migrated from the East.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">Let’s go back further, 1346-666=680.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">October 10 680 CE: or 22nd Safar, 61 Hijra [680 CE].<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Battle of Karbala: Shia Imam Husayn bin Ali, the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad, was decapitated by forces under Caliph Yazid I. This is commemorated by Shi’a Muslims as Aashurah. The event caused a division of Islam.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">10/10=11, 6+8=14 a multiple of 7, 22nd Safar = a double 11, and 61 Hijra 6+1=7, which signifies a completed agenda.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">And further yet: 680-666=14.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">14 CE is the year the Augustus died, the Roman Ruler of 40 years (possibly murdered) on 8/19, 14 CE<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">8+1+9=18 which correlates with 666.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">14 CE = 1+4=5, the number of death, or 1-4=3. It is said he died at 3.00pm which is 1500 = 3×5=15 or 1+5=6, but we don’t know if that was universal time.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">The people of the Roman Empire worshipped Augustus as a god, including after his death.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><a style="text-decoration: underline; color: #2410de; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" href="http://cdn.adventofdeception.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/11NumberElevenInCircle.jpg.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-473" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 0px; float: left; padding: 0px; border: initial none initial;" title="Eleven " src="http://cdn.adventofdeception.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/11NumberElevenInCircle.jpg-300x300.png" alt="11NumberElevenInCircle.jpg 300x300 The Occult Numerology of 2012 | Illuminati Deception!" width="200" height="200"></a></p>
              <h4 style="font-family: 'Arial Black', 'Arial Bold', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1em;">11 Correlates with the letter K.</h4>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">Before 12/21 2012 11:11 occurs, the date 11/11/11 will present itself. Correlating with the letters KKK.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Thus, while 11 is very important, multiplication’s are also important, such as 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, and 99. If you multiply 1111 by 1111 you get 1234321, representing a pyramid, and number 11 is a sacred number of the pyramid with the proportions of the great pyramid being of the ratio 7:11. So 11/11/11 which in on a friday will occur, and 12/21 2012 11:11, which correlates with 11:11:11 which is also on a friday the 6th day of the week according to the western calendar.</p>
              <blockquote style="padding-top: 5px; padding-right: 5px; padding-bottom: 1px; padding-left: 20px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 30px; border-left-width: 2px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: #343436; color: #4f4c43; background-image: none; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: initial; font-family: Verdana; font-style: italic; font-weight: 700; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">The Occult Satanists believe that a carefully planned event must be carried out according to the correct numbers, or it may not be successful. They go to great lengths to make an event occur according to the correct numbers. 11 is the essence of all that is sinful, harmful, and imperfect.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">9-11 caused dramatic change and initiation of a war 11-01 = 111. It also transpires that 111 in numerology is a ‘power number’ related to fresh modes of thinking applied to new cycles in life‘s play. 111111 maybe a super power number doubling 111. 11/11/11 = KKK.</p>
              <blockquote style="padding-top: 5px; padding-right: 5px; padding-bottom: 1px; padding-left: 20px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 30px; border-left-width: 2px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: #343436; color: #4f4c43; background-image: none; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: initial; font-family: Verdana; font-style: italic; font-weight: 700; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">Take note, possibly nothing will occur on 11/11/11, although something occurring around this date is possible. Nothing occurred on 6/6/6. Occult behavior is based on deception and covert action.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">November 1st is called “all saints day” or All Hallows, just after the Halloween (Hallows Eve) celebration where people put on masks, which is the celebration of the <a style="text-decoration: underline; color: #2410de; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" href="http://adventofdeception.com/man-of-lawlessness-antichrist/who/">master (Baal)</a> of the <a style="text-decoration: underline; color: #2410de; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" href="http://spiritentities.com/lower-entities-demons">Lower Entities</a>.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">10/31 = 1+3+1 = 5, five is the number of death that correlates to Baal’s death of the spirit, and demotion (or new life) into the darkness. November 1st is a major day for the Occult, 11/1 = 111.</p>
              <blockquote style="padding-top: 5px; padding-right: 5px; padding-bottom: 1px; padding-left: 20px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 30px; border-left-width: 2px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: #343436; color: #4f4c43; background-image: none; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: initial; font-family: Verdana; font-style: italic; font-weight: 700; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">Understanding the importance and perception of how the Occult values “Death” and “New Life” is pivotal to understanding the agenda of the combined powers of the darkness.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">The number 11 is extremely significant in 9-11; you can visit the Cutting Edge.org for more information on the<a style="text-decoration: underline; color: #2410de; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.cuttingedge.org/NEWS/n1756.cfm">numerology of 9-11</a>.</p>
              <h3 style="margin-top: 1.8em; margin-bottom: 0.6em; font-weight: 400; font-family: 'Arial Black', 'Arial Bold', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1.25em; line-height: 1.2em;">2018: The Complete of 70 years of Jewish Exile.</h3>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">With so much focus on 2012, the date of 2018 is pushed into oblivion. <strong style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">2018 is the 70 year complement of the Jewish exile</strong>—defining as—possessing a nation but no temple. For more information on this subject you can visit <a style="text-decoration: underline; color: #2410de; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" href="http://adventofdeception.com/time-table-antichrist">Time Table of the Antichrist</a>.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">May 14, 1948 the Jews proclaimed independence. 5 can stand alone, 1+4 = 5; 1+9+4+8=22, or add the entire date 5+5+22 = 33.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">33 and 22 are the power numbers of 11. So two power numbers that relate to 11 from the date Israel proclaimed Independence.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">The month of 5 may signify death—defining as death of the old and the 11′s signifies activation of a new birth.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">The day 14 is a multiple of 7 that signifies a time of complement.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">Israel’s flag is the six pointed star, or two pyramids, one standing upright and the other facing downward, the symbolism of the Occult such as the back of the American One Dollar Bill.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">1948-2018 = 70 a time of complement correlates with exile of 586 BCE.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">2018 = 2+1+8 = 11; The year of 18 = 6+6+6<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">2018 divide by 666 = 3.03003003003.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">2018 divide by 6 = 336.33333333, instead of a 5 as in 2012 divide 6, there is the 6 with all 3′s.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">Counting 2013 through 2018 = 6 years.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">2018 is more of a significant date than 2012, but since 2012, possibly, is the death of an old age and birth into a new age, the occult is popularizing the event. In doing so, 2018 is pushed aside. The movie, The Terminator that debuted in 1984, and since then created three more movies, coined 2018 as judgment day. Yet, within the context of the movie “the judgment day” was only a beginning, this context may correlate with 2012.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">From 9-11 destruction 9/11/2001 to 12/21/2012 = 11 years and 101 days, From 9/11/2012 to 12/21/2012, began counting on the 9/12 equals 101 days. 11 years and 101 days = 11:11 the power number of 22.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">1111 days before the 2012 solstice is the date 6-12-09. The fact that 6, 9, and 12 are sequential multiples of 3 of perhaps the most highly regarded number of the date is 3 can be a notable fact or the power number of 33 = 11:11:11 the occult date of 12/21/2012 11:11.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">The number 11 link returns when we divide 33 by 3 which of course give us 11 once again.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">In 1991/1992 the number 11:11 was issued to humanity as an activation number. <strong style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">The 9-11 destruction of the twin towers in New York activated the preparation era pointing the activation of the New World Order—the new age.</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">When we review the way in which the attacks of 9/11 occurred by the “11′s” and review the significance of “11″ in history there should be no doubt that 12/21 2012 11:11 is a significant date. The Twin Towers symbolized the number 11.</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">9-11 activated the preparation stage of the New World Order. 11 years and 101 days = 11:11, to 12/21/2012. 2012 is the activation key to the reality of the New World Order.</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">The Deception of 2012 is propaganda of an ideology from the occult that the world media is teaching. <strong style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">The truth to unravel is the occult definition of “end-of-the-world saga”, or an “awakening”. The occult definition is the old system of government duality into the beginning of the New World Order, and possibly the Age of Aquarius—<span style="color: #ff0000; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">the reference is of death and rebirth</span></strong><strong style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">.</strong> The mind-set to to cause fear and panic and deluded humanity from the true agenda. From the numerology that is presented—the occult is using 2012 as an beginning to their “New Age” of fascist domination of the New World Order, however; the illuminati could cause a <strong style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">false reality that perceives that the world will end</strong>, but then <strong style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">generate a “savior”</strong>and strong possibly of an alien presence. Producing an alien savior, then causing manipulation between the aliens and humans that generates are war is highly possible—then the Antichrist can arrive and save the world from the alien war, although the entire situation is staged. Then in 2018, the end of the 70 year exile, the Jews can build their temple (or possibly before), because the aliens will have bombed the temple area. The New World Order will be in full swing establishing their “One God” the antichrist, and possibly the complement date could be 2020.</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">2020 = 22—a power number of 11.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">By counting 2013 through 2019, but not counting 2020 = 7.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">2020 divide 6 = 336.666666<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">2020 divide 666 = 3.033033033033</p>
              <h4 style="font-family: 'Arial Black', 'Arial Bold', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1em;">Defining the Numerology of 2012</h4>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">There should be no doubt that 12/21 2012 11:11 is a doorway to the beginning of the Age of Aquarius and the New World Order. The Delusion of the New Age Movement was designed to deceive spiritual seekers from the truth. The truth of the matter is that “the change of age” will be the powers of the darkness dominating and enslaving humanity. It is a New Age for the Illuminati and the combined powers of the darkness. The New Age perception of “ascending or awakening” is a delusional form of deception; the awakening will be the separation of the light from the darkness. The ideology of the New Age syndrome is deceptive falsehood. The Age of Aquarius is negative for this earth, however; for the people that are truly spiritually awake this change is positive because it means freedom from the clutches of the darkness. The separation of the light from the darkness will require death for people with a disposition to the light, but through that death the person will be saved from the enslavement of the darkness and enter the kingdom of the light: the only requirement is Faith.</p>

MJ was a summer solstice sacrifice for the darkness. The combined powers of the darkness thrive and gain energy from the emotional energetic attachment of humanity. It was the same case with Princes Diana; a major outcry of grief, sorrow, depression, sadness, and anger of the collective consciousness of humanity sends emotional energy to the powers of the darkness.</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">When the Illuminati ended the First World War, they had just successfully completed the first war of the occult plan to produce the Antichrist. Thus, they deliberately ended World War One on the 11th Month [November], the 11th Day, at the 11th hour. The signing of the Armistice agreement was thus undergirded by three elevens!<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">When the Illuminati assassinated President Kennedy, he was killed according to the occult number signature of eleven [11]. He was killed in the 11th month, on the 22nd day, and on the 33rd parallel. He was also killed in the Masonic Dealey Plaza.</p>

              <li>September 11, 1609 — The explorer Henry Hudson sailed into New York harbor and discovered Manhattan Island and the Hudson River, the very location on which the Twin Towers were constructed!</li>
              <li>September 11, 1941 — Construction officially began at the Pentagon. [Ibid.] Thus, 60 years later to the day, the Pentagon is attacked. The number “6″ is an important number to the occultist. The number of man is “6″; the number of man’s “perfect” government is “66″ and the number of the perfect leader of all time is “666″.</li>
              <li>September 11, 1972 — The world was introduced to terrorism at the 1972 Munich Olympic Games. . There were 121 participating countries (11X11=121), and 11 Israeli athletes were killed. Exactly 29 years (2+9=11) after this terrorist horror ended, another more despicable horror occurred – the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.</li>
              <li>September 11, 1772 — About 300 Indians and 50 British soldiers began the siege of Fort Henry. Researchers and historians of this siege are puzzled by the meaning of a comment in a document describing these events. It was recorded in a letter written by Lydia Cruger (11 letters), and it seems a fitting comment to this section. She wrote, “The siege commenced about sun an hour high, Monday, 11th, at all events, the 11th.” [Ibid.]</li>
              <li>September 11, 1776 — A failed peace conference with the British was held. The war that had begun on April 19, 1776 [the first day of the 13-day Satanic celebration, "The Bloody Sacrifice of the Beast"] continued. [Ibid.] After the fall of New York to the British, a Peaceâ€¨Conference was held between General Howe and three prominent representatives of the Continental Congress – Benjamin Franklin, John Adams and Edward Rutledge. After taking the Americans key city, Howe thought he was entitled to a peace settlement. The Americans, having declared independence in July, considered separation from England as non-negotiable. The conference of Sept. 11, 1776, ended and the war continued for seven years.</li>
              <li>September 11, 1777 — The first day the American flag was used in battle at the Battle of Brandywine. [Ibid.] The British defeated the Americans, led by George Washington, but Old Glory flew for the first time!</li>
              <li>September 11, 1922 — Despite Arab protests, a British mandate is proclaimed in Palestine on September 11, 1922. The mandate came into effect at the end of September 1922. [Ibid.] Not only was this proclamation made on a September 11, but the year formed a twice “11″ — (11×2)</li>
              <li>September 11, 1941 — The US 1st Army crosses the border into German territory. Also, the Quebec Conference was held between England’s Prime Minister, Winston Churchill. [Ibid.]</li>
              <li>September 11, 1973 — Chilean President Salvador Allende is killed in a brutal, violent military coup led by General Augusto Pinochet. [Ibid.] Henry Kissinger was strongly implicated in this attack, and if he were to ever stand trial in an International Court, he would be charged with masterminding this coup and ordering the assassination of Allende.

              <p>Hey... Thanks for sharing... Feel like debating with u but ur post got 5k+ so i think i will go straight to my point...</p>
              <p>Well... First of all, you may be right or you may not be right in ur interpretation though i assume u get those from elsewhere... But dont forget... 2012 is not the End of the World, is people mis-interpret it. If you know about the Mayan Calendar, its not talking about the end of world but the end of the Mayan Calendar for that generation or something into a whole new Chapter in the Mayan Calendar.. Its something like our Calendar in 1999, where people say year 2000 will be the end of the year, the millenium... Something like this kind if u dont know what i mean by going into a whole new Chapter in the Mayan Calendar... Its a important day for them but after the year 2012 come out, people mis-interpret it as DDay (Dooms Day), End of World, Armaggedon or whatever crap...</p>
              <p>And i find no point debating thats why i say straight to the point in according to my view... Dont be offended, i mean no harm... Just wanting to clarify this...</p>
              <p>Let me ask u a question... Now Singapore Government are into problem such as Youth-At-Risk.... But let me ask u... Is Singapore expose to Occult? If u notice carefully, Singapore Government have already ban witchcraft, and even if there are occultic practices, its all underground (secretly)... And u can see alot of young people in Singapore act cute called themself demon name as their Game character name, or anyhow assume they are devil worshipper... But let me ask u... Are they expose even to occultic, or lets say blackmagic?? No, they have no knowledge, even if they have, its all the little knowledge that other people say and they presume thinking that is the truth without going into it... And trust me, if any door is open publicly in the area of Occult, be it wicca, blackmagic, Satanism... The country will be in havoc...</p>
              <p>Coven in Singapore is all underground... I am not trying to show off or what, but i am here to tell u, do not look at things from one point of view or one source but try looking it in different point of view and different source... If looking at one point of view is so easy, there wont be different arguement on topic...</p>
              <p>Anyway no point debating... I write these, i risk getting myself into trouble too... If you want, we can chat at msn... If u truly want to know... But i say first, dont play with fire...</p>
              <p>A quote for u - The grass on the other side looks more greener but wait till u r on the other side then u will realize its not as green as its seem...</p>
