              <div>Using ur birth date (eg. 25 December 1998  and  25 December 1999) to find ur Life Path no -&gt; <br><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><em>The Life Path is the sum of the birth date of an individual. This number represents who you are at birth and the native traits that you will carry with you through life. The Life Path describes the nature of this journey through life.</em></span></span></div>
              <p><em></em> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #942828;">This is a number that is derived from all the numbers in your birth date. The Life Path number is established from the date of birth. First, convert the month to a single number, then add this individual digit, the birthday, and the individual digits of the birth year. The individual digits are again added together, as necessary to reduce the sum to a single digit 1 through 9, <strong>or</strong> to the numerology "master numbers," 11 or 22. These master numbers are not reduced any further.</span></p>
              <div><br><em><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #8b0000;">E.g. for above date -&gt; 2+5+1+2+1+9+9+8=37 -&gt; further combine the 2 digits into 1 ( 3+7=10  -&gt;  1+0=1)</span></span></em><br><br><em><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #8b0000;">so ur life path no is 1.</span></span></em></div>

              <p><br><br><em><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #8b0000;">Then check ur Life path number descriptions from below:</span></span></em></p>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>No: 1 </strong></span></span></div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Life Path 1 drive in this life is characterized by individualist desires, independence, and the need for personal attainment. The purpose to be fulfilled on this Life Path is that of becoming independent. This is a two part learning process; first, you must learn to stand on your own two feet and learn not to depend on others. After you are indeed free and independent, you must learn to be a leader. Many of our Generals, corporate leaders, and political leaders are men and women having the Life Path number 1. The 1 always has the potential for greatness as a leader, but they may fail as a follower. Many 1's spend most of their lives shaking off their dependent side. When this happens, there is little time left for enjoying the rewards to be gained through independence. The individual with Life Path 1 has to overcome an environment in which it is very easy to be dependent, and difficult to be independent.</span></span> <br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Positive Traits : </strong>A person with positive 1 traits abounds in creative inspiration, and possesses the enthusiasm and drive to accomplish a great deal. Your drive and potential for action comes directly from the enormous depth of strength you have. This is both the physical and inner varieties of strength. With this strength comes utter determination and the capability to lead. As a natural leader you have a flair for taking charge of any situation. Highly original, you may have talents as an inventor or innovator of some sort. In any work that you choose, your independent attitude can show through. You have very strong personal needs and desires, and you feel it is always necessary to follow your own convictions. You are ambitious, and either understand or must learn the need for aggressive action to promote yourself. Although you may hide the fact for social reasons, you are highly self-centered and demand to have your way in most circumstances.</span></span><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Negative Traits : </strong>When the 1 Life Path person is not fully developed and expressing the negative side of this number, the demeanor may appear very dependent rather than independent. If you are expressing this negative trait of the number 1, you are likely to be very dissatisfied with your circumstances, and long for self-sufficiency. This is defined as the weak or dependent side of the negative 1 Life Path. On the strong side of this negative curve, the 1 energy can become too self-serving, selfish and egotistical. Over-confidence and impatience mark this individual.</span></span><br></div>
              <div><strong></strong></div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong><br>No: 2</strong> </span></span></div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">In many ways, you are a creature of habit and routine, and you like to your path and pattern well worn and familiar. A natural collector, you rarely dispose of anything that may have a shred of value.The positive attributes of the number 2 Life Path produces extremely sensitive people who generally have the most delicate ability to be balanced and fair. You clearly see the full spectrum of viewpoints in any argument or situation, and because of this people may seek you out to be a mediator. In this role you are able to settle disputes with the most unbiased flair. There is sincere concern for others; you think the best of people, and want the best for them. </span></span><br><strong><span style="color: #ffff00;">Positive Traits : </span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">You are totally honest and open in thought, word and deed. You are apt to excel in any for of group activity where your expertise in handling and blending people can be used effectively. Manners and tact mark your way with others at all times, and you are not one to dominate a group or situation. You are the master of compromise and of maintaining harmony in your environment, never stooping to aggravate or argue.</span></span> <br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Negative Traits :</strong> The negative side of the 2 is hardly a problem. The biggest obstacle and difficulty you may face is that of passivity and a state of apathy and lethargy. The negative 2 can be very pessimistic and accomplishes very little. Needless to say, the negative 2 doesn't belong in the business world and even the more positive individual with the 2 Life Path may prefer a more amiable and less competitive environment.</span></span><br></div>
              <div><strong></strong></div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong><br>No: 3</strong> </span></span></div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The number 3 Life Path is one that emphasizes expression, sociability, and creativity as the lesson to be learned in this life. Here we are apt to find the entertainers of the world, bright, effervescent, sparkling people with very optimistic attitudes. A truly gifted 3 possesses the most exceptional creative skills, normally in the verbal realm, writing, speaking, acting, or similar endeavors.Typically, the life path 3 gives an above-average ability in some art form. This can encompass painting, interior decorating, landscaping, crafts, writing, music, or the stage, or all of the above. You are apt to be a happy, inspired person, constantly seeking the stimuli of similar people. Your exuberant nature can take you far, especially if you are ever able to focus your energies and talents. </span></span><br><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Positive Traits :</span></span></strong> <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The bright side of this path stresses harmony, beauty and pleasures; of sharing your creative talents with the world. Capturing your capability in creative self-expression is the highest level of attainment for this life path. The characteristics of the 3 are warmth and friendliness, a good conversationalist, social and open. The approach to life tends to be exceedingly positive, however, and your disposition is almost surely sunny and open-hearted. You effectively cope with all of the many setbacks that occur in life and readily bounce back for more.You have good manners and seem to be very conscious of other people's feelings and emotions. Life is generally lived to the fullest, often without much worry about tomorrow. You are not very good at handling money because of a general lack of concern about it. You spend it when you have it and don't when you don't.</span></span> <br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Negative Traits :</strong> On the negative side, a 3 may be so delighted with the joy of living that the life becomes frivolous and superficial. You may scatter your abilities and express little sense of purpose. The 3 can be an enigma, for no apparent reason you may become moody and tend to retreat. Escapist tendencies are not uncommon with the 3 life path, and you find it very hard to settle into one place or one position. Guard against being critical of others, impatient, intolerant, or overly optimistic.</span></span><br></div>

              <div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong><br>No: 4</strong> </span></span></div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Life Path 4 produces the most trustworthy, practical, and down-to-earth of individuals; the cornerstone members of society. The goal of this life path is learning to take orders and to carry them out with dedication and perseverance. You always demand as much from yourself as you do from others, and sometimes a lot more. You have the kind of will power that is often mistaken for sheer stubbornness. Once a decision is made, it will be followed through to the conclusion, right, wrong, or indifferent; you are very set in your ways and determined to handle things the way you are so certain that they should be handled. Your tenacity of purpose and ability to get the job done borders on obsession.</span></span> <br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Positive Traits : </strong>You are an excellent organizer and planner because of your innate ability to view things in a very common sense and practical way. You are a wonderful manager with a great sense of how to get the job done.Loyal and devoted, you make the best of your marriage, and you are a dependable business partner.

The number 4 is solidly associated with the element of earth from which it gains it strength and utter sense of reality. You are one of the most dependable people you know. If patience and determination can ever win, you are sure to achieve great success in life.</span></span><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Negative Traits :</strong> The negative side of the 4 can prove dogmatic to an excess, narrow-minded, and repressive. A lot of skin-deep people turn you off, and you lack the tact to keep your feelings from being totally clear to all around. Additionally, the negative 4 has a bad tendency to get too caught up in the daily routine of affairs and often misses the big picture and major opportunities that come along once in a while.</span></span><br></div>

              <div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong><br>No: 5 </strong></span></span></div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">A Life Path 5 person is usually very versatile, adventurous, and progressive. With a 5 life path, you are one of those people who is always striving to find answers to the many questions that life poses. You want to be totally unrestrained, as this is the sign of freedom and independence. You abhor routine and boring work, and you are not very good at staying with everyday tasks that must be finished on time. You are, however, a good communicator, and you know how to motivate people around you, perhaps inclining you to be a teacher of some sort. A love of adventure may dominate your life. This may take the form of mental or physical manifestation, but in either case, you thrill to the chance for exploration and blazing new trails. You are apt to be multi-talented, but just as likely to suffer from some lack of direction, and there is often some confusion surrounding your ambition.</span></span> <br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Positive Traits : </strong>The number 5 personality is rather happy-go-lucky; living for today, and not worrying too much about tomorrow. It is important for you to mix with people of a like mind, and try to avoid those that are too serious and demanding. It is also important for you to find a job that provides thought-provoking tasks rather than routine and redundant responsibilities. You do best dealing with people, but the important thing is that you have the freedom to express yourself at all times. You have an innate ability to think through complex matters and analyze them quickly, but then be off to something new.</span></span><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Negative Traits : </strong>In the most negative application or use of the 5 energies, you could become very irresponsible in tasks and decisions concerning your home and business life. The total pursuit of sensation and adventure can result in your becoming self-indulgent and totally unaware of the feelings of those around you. In the worse case situations negative 5's are very undependable and self-serving.</span></span><br></div>

              <div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong><br>No: 6 </strong></span></span></div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Life Path 6 indicates that very prominent in your nature is a strong sense of responsibility. You are idealistic and must feel useful to be happy. The main contribution you make is that of advice, service and ever present support. This is the Life Path related to leadership by example and assumption of responsibility, thus, it is your obligation to pick up the burden and always be ready to help. The Life Path 6 is one who is compelled to function with strength and compassion, a sympathetic and kind person, generous with personal and material resources. Wisdom, balance, and understanding are the cornerstones of this Life Path. Your extraordinary wisdom and the ability to understand the problems of others is apt to commence from an early age allowing you to easily span the generation gap and assume an important role in life early on. While the 6 may assume huge responsibilities in the community, the life revolves around the immediate home and family, for this is the most domestic of numbers.</span></span> <br><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Positive Traits : </span></span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Most with Life Path 6 are the positive types who willingly carry far more than their fair share of the load and are always there when needed.

The natural burdens of this number are heavy, and on rare occasions, responsibility is abdicated by persons with this Life Path 6. This rejection of responsibility will make you feel very guilty and uneasy, and it will have very damaging effects upon your relationships with others.</span></span><br></div>

              <div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>No: 7</strong> </span></span></div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">A Life Path 7 person is a peaceful and affectionate soul, and by nature rather reserved and analytical. The overwhelming strength of the number 7 is reflected in the depth of thinking that is shown. Intellectual, scientific and studious, you don't accept a premise until you have dissected the subject and arrived at you own independent conclusion. This is a very spiritual number and it often denotes a sort of spiritual wisdom that becomes apparent at a fairly early age.</span></span><br><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Positive Traits : </span></span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">You are very thorough and complete in your work, the perfectionist who expects everyone else to be a meet a high standard of performance, too. You evaluate situations very quickly and with amazing accuracy. . You aren't one to have a wide circle of friends, but once you accept someone as a friend, it's for life. You really aren't a very social person, and your reserve is often taken to be aloofness. Actually, it's not that at all, but merely a cover up for your basic feeling of insecurity. You actually like being alone, away from the hustle and bustle of modern life.</span></span><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Negative Traits :</strong> In the most negative use of the 7 energies, you can become very pessimistic, lackadaisical, quarrelsome, and secretive. A Life Path 7 individual who is not living life fully and gaining through experiences, is a hard person to live with because of a serious lack of consideration and because there is such a negative attitude. The negative 7 is very selfish and spoiled. If you have any of the negative traits they are very difficult to get rid of because you tend to feel that the world really does owe you a living or in some way is not being fairly treated. Fortunately, the negative 7 is not the typical 7, at least not without some mitigating positive traits. This number is one that seems to have some major shifts from highs to lows. Stability in feelings may be elusive for you.</span></span><br></div>

              <div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong><br>No: 8</strong> </span></span></div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">With the Life Path of the number 8 you are focused on learning the satisfactions to be found in the material world. The Life Path 8 produces many powerful, confident and materially successful people. You are apt to be very independent, forceful and competitive. Your routine is involved in practical, down-to-earth affairs, and there is relatively little time for dreams and visions. You will want to use your ambitions, your organizational ability, and your efficient approach to carve a satisfying niche for yourself. Most of your concerns involve money and learning of the power that comes with its proper manipulation. This Life Path is perhaps the one that is the most concerned with and desirous of status, as an accompaniment to material success.</span></span><br><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Positve Traits :</span></span></strong> <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">If you are a positive 8 you are endowed with tremendous potential for conceiving far-reaching schemes and ideas, and also possessing the tenacity and independence to follow them through to completion. In short, you are well-equipped for competition in the business world or in other competitive fields of endeavor. You know how to manage yourself and your environment. You are practical and steady in your pursuit of major objectives, and you have the courage of your convictions when it comes to taking the necessary chances to get ahead.</span></span> <br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Negative Traits :</strong> The negative 8 can be dictatorial and often suppresses the enthusiasm and efforts of fellow member of the environment. Often, the strength of their own personality excludes close feelings for other people with whom they come in contact. Material gains and rewards often become issues of utmost importance, even to the neglect of family, home and peace of mind. Dedication to success can become an obsession. Emotional feelings are often suppressed by the negative 8, resulting in isolation and loneliness. All Life Path 8 people must avoid discounting the opinions of others.</span></span><br></div>

              <div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong><br>No: 9</strong> </span></span></div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The keys to the nature of a Life Path number 9 person are compassion, generosity, and a very humanitarian attitude.. Usually this number produces an individual that is very trustworthy and honorable. You tend to be quite sensitive, as you see the world with much feeling and compassion. The 9, being the highest of the single digit numbers, holds an elevated position and poses certain responsibilities. The purpose of life for those with a 9 life path is of a philosophical nature. Judges, spiritual leaders, healers and educators frequently have much 9 energy. </span></span><br><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Positive Traits : </span></span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Material gains are not overly important, although the quality of some life path 9 people is such that they are materially rewarded in very significant ways. Often, the number 9 life path requires a very selfless attitude and the giving up of material possessions for the common good. Even the very average of those with life path 9 possess extremely compassionate tendencies. The desire to help others, especially the troubled or underprivileged, is strong. You are apt to frequently find yourself being used and let down by others, as your generosity is misused and abused.</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The number 9's very deep understanding of life is sometimes manifested in the artistic and literary fields</span></span> <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">.You have the ability to make friends very easily, as people are attracted to your magnetic, open personality.</span></span><br><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Negative Traits : </span></span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">As do all the life path numbers, the 9 has its negative side, and because of the demanding nature of the truly positive 9, many tend to fail in this category. It is not uncommon for persons with the 9 life path to fight the realities and challenges of purpose imposed here because selflessness is not an easy trait. You may have difficulty believing that giving and a lack of personal ambition can be satisfying. It must be realized and accepted that little long-term satisfaction and happiness is to be gained by rejecting the natural humanitarian inclinations of this path.</span></span><br></div>

This is the number associated with spiritual awareness. As one of the two master numbers, the 11 yields understanding and knowledge beyond the grasp of others. The attitude toward life of those possessing this Life Path is somewhat extreme; extremely intuitive, avant-garde, idealistic, visionary, and cultured. These extremes make you an interesting, if unusual person, with much to offer society.</span></span><br><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Positive Traits : </span></span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Life Path 11 person is deep-thinking, and you are no doubt interested in understanding many of life's mysteries and more intriguing facets.

              <div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The keys to the nature of a Life Path number 9 person are compassion, generosity, and a very humanitarian attitude.. Usually this number produces an individual that is very trustworthy and honorable. You tend to be quite sensitive, as you see the world with much feeling and compassion. The 9, being the highest of the single digit numbers, holds an elevated position and poses certain responsibilities. The purpose of life for those with a 9 life path is of a philosophical nature. Judges, spiritual leaders, healers and educators frequently have much 9 energy.</span></span><br><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Positive Traits :</span></span></strong> <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Material gains are not overly important, although the quality of some life path 9 people is such that they are materially rewarded in very significant ways. Often, the number 9 life path requires a very selfless attitude and the giving up of material possessions for the common good. Even the very average of those with life path 9 possess extremely compassionate tendencies. The desire to help others, especially the troubled or underprivileged, is strong. You are apt to frequently find yourself being used and let down by others, as your generosity is misused and abused.</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The number 9's very deep understanding of life is sometimes manifested in the artistic and literary fields</span></span> <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">.You have the ability to make friends very easily, as people are attracted to your magnetic, open personality.</span></span><br><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Negative Traits :</span></span></strong> <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">As do all the life path numbers, the 9 has its negative side, and because of the demanding nature of the truly positive 9, many tend to fail in this category. It is not uncommon for persons with the 9 life path to fight the realities and challenges of purpose imposed here because selflessness is not an easy trait. You may have difficulty believing that giving and a lack of personal ambition can be satisfying. It must be realized and accepted that little long-term satisfaction and happiness is to be gained by rejecting the natural humanitarian inclinations of this path.</span></span><br></div>

The misuse of this Life Path produces tendencies towards exaggeration, over-expansiveness, and self-righteousness. Imposing one's views in an interfering or meddling way must be an issue of concern. The natural burdens of this number are heavy, and on rare occasions, responsibility is abdicated by persons with this Life Path 6. This rejection of responsibility will make you feel very guilty and uneasy, and it will have very damaging effects upon your relationships with others.</span></span></div>

                                      leaders, healers and educators frequently have much 9
                                      energy.</span></span><br> <strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Positive Traits :</span></span></strong> <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Material gains are not overly important,
                                      although the quality of some life path 9 people is such that they
                                      are materially rewarded in very significant ways. Often, the number
                                      9 life path requires a very selfless attitude and the giving up of
                                      material possessions for the common good. Even the very average of
                                      those with life path 9 possess extremely compassionate tendencies.
                                      The desire to help others, especially the troubled or
                                      underprivileged, is strong. You are apt to frequently find yourself
                                      being used and let down by others, as your generosity is misused
                                      and abused.</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The number 9's very deep understanding of
                                      life is sometimes manifested in the artistic and literary
                                      fields</span></span> <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">.You have the ability to make friends very
                                      easily, as people are attracted to your magnetic, open
                                      personality.</span></span><br> <strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Negative Traits :</span></span></strong> <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">As do all the life path numbers, the 9 has
                                      its negative side, and because of the demanding nature of the truly
                                      positive 9, many tend to fail in this category. It is not uncommon
                                      for persons with the 9 life path to fight the realities and
                                      challenges of purpose imposed here because selflessness is not an
                                      easy trait. You may have difficulty believing that giving and a
                                      lack of personal ambition can be satisfying. It must be realized
                                      and accepted that little long-term satisfaction and happiness is to
                                      be gained by rejecting the natural humanitarian inclinations of
                                      this path.</span></span></div>
