            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote> When I see couples with their love ones together,<br>I envy, whenever people ask me what is love? Have I<br>ever met someone I love or do I ever experience true<br>love, I would say I have a true love once, and it goes<br>like this :-<br><br>I am just an ordinary guy in my early twenties, I am a<br>conservative and cautious person where love is<br>concern, I had a girlfriend who was about the same age<br>as me, everything was fine until this girl came into<br>my life...<br>let's call her Joey. Joey was an ordinary looking girl<br>and was a few years my junior. She was very lively,<br>cheerful and fun loving, the type of so called<br>"sunshine girl" that would be ideal girlfriend for<br>most guys but not me. I always look upon her as a very<br>shrew and easy girl because of her amiable character .<br><br>Beside I am already attached, why confused myself with<br>another girl who I think might have more than one<br>boyfriends with her all the time. So whenever I was<br>with her, I will distanced her mentally and<br>emotionally because I don't want to get myself burnt<br>by her.<br><br>Of course she was still good to me despite knowing I<br>am attached, I began to have this feeling that she<br>likes me, to think that I am actually in such a great<br>demand ! I began to feel proud with myself, physically<br>and mentally, boasting to my friends, although they<br>make no comments, I can tell from their eyes that they<br>were jealous, their heart filled with envy.<br><br>Joey would called me now and then and we would always<br>go out together ,actually I enjoy her company too,<br>what I can say was I treat it as a form of leisure. I<br>am very certain and told myself, she was only a friend<br>to me and nothing else just because I am attached and<br>she knew it ! If she is still fond of me, it can't be<br>help.<br><br>Although she never express to me her feeling before,<br>I just knew confidently that she likes me, hence I<br>often compare my girlfriend with her and criticized<br>her. To me I treat it as a comment and I don't think<br>she will feel bad, awful or embarrassed because she<br>don't seems to bother with my remarks at all and gave<br>me a silly wide grin instead. So she was unserious and<br>uninterested in what I say! Of course that certainly<br>convinced me she just treat me like one of her<br>boyfriends and I dare not put too much of my feelings<br>too. So life continues and this goes on and years<br>passed so quickly before we even realized.<br><br>Then one day, I realized that she hadn't called me for<br>weeks. I began to panic. What is there to panic?<br>You may ask, well, what I mean by panic is not I am<br>scared but I have the kind of fear that I am afraid I<br>will be losing her, every time I want to pick up the<br>phone, I just don't have the courage to call her,<br>perhaps it was my ego, she used to call me, and I was<br>in great demand, I can still have my girlfriend to<br>call thinking she was throwing tantrums at me, why<br>should I initiate. Why will she be angry when she<br>likes me in the first place? Better still, so I can<br>concentrate on my girlfriend, I convinced myself.<br><br>My ego stood me for about two months that I finally<br>melted down because somehow, deep inside I missed her,<br>maybe, something has happened to her that discontinued<br>her daily routine, persuading myself with valid<br>reasons to suppress my ego in order just to give her a<br>call.<br><br>The person who picks up the call was her mother,<br>"h..ellooo.."? I stumbled, fearing her mother knew who<br>I am.<br>"Yes, who are you looking for?" she reply in<br>mandarin".<br>"Joey please" I answered.<br>"Joey? She has gone abroad to further her studies one<br>month ago! Are you her friend? How come you don't<br>know?"<br><br>The news struck me. She didn't even bother to tell me<br>about her trip, I thought we were so closed and she<br>was fond of me all the while. Why did she leave<br>without a word?<br><br>"hello...?" came the voice from the other end that<br>interrupt my thought"<br>"yes, I am listening..." I replied.<br>"do you know someone by the name of Steve?"<br>"yes.....I...am." I stumbled once again.<br>" she left a letter for you the night before she set<br>off, can you come and collect? "<br><br>When I got the letter from her, it read,<br>Hi Steve, I did not tell you about my decision to<br>further my studies because I don't know what you treat<br>me as.<br><br>I afraid you will cause me to abandon my thought to<br>the States, wasting my parents hard earned money and<br>continue living a meaningless life as someone you have<br>been taken for granted.<br><br>It took me so long to make this decision because I<br>couldn't bear to leave you. But there is nothing much<br>more I can do to salvage the situation since you did<br>not make any effort.<br><br>The reason I did not tell you I am fond of you is<br>because I don't want to put you in a difficult<br>position understanding your present situation. But by<br>being so considerate is as good as killing myself, I<br>suffer all the grievance and anger in the end without<br>you realizing. You always give me this feeling that<br>you will leave me one day, and I hate to feel that<br>way.<br><br>Seeing couples together makes me so envious and<br>depresses my moral wondering who your mind is always<br>with. Words that you say hurts me yet I have to put a<br>strong front because I don't have anyone to fall back<br>on. What I want you to know is I am only just an<br>ordinary girl having normal feelings like others do.<br><br>Please spare a thought for me, I hope I am making a<br>right decision to stay away for a while, maybe if we<br>are fated to meet again someday, we will be together,<br>last of all, there is something I have always wanting<br>to say and have no courage, I hope that it is not too<br>late, " I still love you".<br><br>Take Care,<br>Joey<br><br>Upon reading that letter, I felt the sharp pain in my<br>heart, she makes me realized that I am fond of her all<br>this while, it was a fact that I refused to admit.<br>She was right, I have taken her for granted all this<br>while. She was a great person to be with actually, the<br>feeling with her was so different, it can't be found<br>in anyone, not even my girlfriend.<br><br>I shouldn't have treated her so distantly.</blockquote>saw tis email.. tink it's v meaningful.. heehee.. well.. tink u tell him wad u feel lorz.. *although i'll react e same way as u - wun sae anything, mi no guts wan*<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  heehee..if i were u.. i'll probably be like e Joey in e story..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
