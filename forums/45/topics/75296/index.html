            <div class='col-md body'>Fellow NYPians...<br><br>Have you ever encountered not being able to get a seat in the canteens during lunch time? I'm sure we all do, especially in the North canteen for my case as i like the food over there. When my lunch break is only 1 hour, i find it really frustrating when most of the seats are occupied by not by our fellow schoolmates but outsiders such as those working nearby in factories and students, especially from Anderson Junior College.<br><br>I understand that NYP has installed the automated "entry barrier" which requires us to scan our student card. Now, we have it at North Canteen and Mac canteen as far as i know. I remember the system was up when it was the SARS period. So, the purpose of the "entry barrier" is to keep track of the people going in and out of the canteen during SARS and not to prevent unauthorised people from taking precious seats away from hungry students? Isn't that a waste of resources? Since the system is there, why not use it?<br><br>The worst thing is i always see groups of AJC students (i mean at least 10 plus) coming to our school to have lunch mostly at Mac canteen as we all know that our sch's MAC prices is cheaper than outside by almost a dollar. (Should we call them cheapskates?)<br><br>They are not even our students and they do not pay $1,000 per semester school fees, so why are they enjoying subsidised prices? I feel even more angered when i hear people talking about how JC students look down on Poly students as they think that they are smarter and superior than we are just because they are in a JC and going to local University soon. Fellow students of NYP, look closely at how these AJC students act so "superior" the next time you see them.<br><br>The fact that they always gather at Mac canteen is because its nearest to the entrance of NYP and they feel less "shy" over there as compared to the further North or South canteens. Once, i tried to enter AJC to see what type of food their canteen was offering  when i was deciding to enter Poly or JC and i was not allowed to purchase food from the stall vendors as outsiders are actually not allowed. But why are AJC students invading NYP and buying food from our canteens freely in their obvious school uniforms?<br><br>Do you think that the school will do anything about it? Will they be willing to use the "entry barrier" permanently just to ensure that the students are protected from outsiders competition when looking for seats to have lunch? Is there any way that we can address this problem to the authorities in NYP?<br><br>What i feel is that they may not do anything as long as they pose no security problems and the stall holders are not complaining as it will only bring more business for them. Though i may sound pessimistic, but i'm still hoping for the best.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well...all the canteens now have entry barriers but they are not in use since the Sars period was over.<br><br>Besides that, the temperature screening machine and the entry barriers are now "white elephants", can be used only if Sars strike again.
