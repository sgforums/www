Hmm, I happen to come across this situation before. This ger really treat me nice and somehow during my chalet, she was there and somehow everyone turn up at the chalet though we were an item. But things doesnt turn out wat was expected when I told her I like her. All the while she only took me as a frd? In fact, till now, I still have no idea wat the relationship between both of us.<br>I guess it would be good if u explain thing or do something to hint him / inform him.</div>
