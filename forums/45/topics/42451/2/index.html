            <div class='col-md body'>I don't see a big difference between Malaysian girls and Singaporean girls. A Singaporean girl can be different from another Singaporean girl. It just depends on the way that they are brought up, the experiences that they are exposed to and especially the society they live in. It's all about adapting to the environment and 'survival'.<br><br>Personally, I feel that most Malaysians are very nice and hospitable in general. As for the girls, I feel that they have very sweet personalities. But I prefer being a Singaporean girl anytime!=)</div>

And look so totally contented'.<br><br>And  she goes to write in defence of SG women..&amp; I agree with what she says...<br><br>She wrote tt : <strong>But, yes, the Singapore woman - especially if she is better educated - is a confident and assertive creature.<br><br>She is pragmatic and, hence, materialistic. (Money talks, right? Both Singapore women and men know that).<br><br>She is articulate (well, more so than the Singapore man) and will fight to defend herself and her loved ones.<br><br>She goes out to work and tries to excel in her career because (a) it is expected of her; and (b) the money she brings home makes life easier, for herself and those she loves.<br><br>She is frank and has no time for mind games, making her, in fact, naive at times. There is little pretence and guile. What you see is what you get.<br><br>She is also a product shaped by her society.<br><br>Singapore is small, cosmopolitan and competitive. There are no fields or farms where uneducated women are relegated to toil in.<br><br>Instead, much stress is placed on education - for both sexes - because every pair of hands counts in the urban workplace.<br><br>When they go out to work, women are judged by the same standards as men. In fact, one of Singapore's earliest female role models is Mrs Lee Kuan Yew, the wife of the Senior Minister, who has proven to be a successful lawyer.<br><br>And because homes and cars are so expensive, women have to work - and work hard - if they (and their husbands and families when they get married) want to enjoy the finer things in life.<br><br>Can you blame us, then, if we tend to be businesslike and are uncomfortable with displaying more feminine traits like flirting, or feminine skills like prawn-peeling?<br><br>I, for one, can't see myself peeling prawns for anyone at a public meal, except perhaps my niece, who's small and helpless.<br><br>I mean, why does a man need a woman to do that for him if he can do it himself? Unless he is out to prove to others around him that he has control over her, that she is 'his woman'?<br><br>And why would a woman want to peel prawns for an able-bodied man unless she wants to make a show that he belongs to her?<br><br>Either way, the mind games being played here turn me off.<br><br>It's another matter if the prawn-peeling is done in the privacy of the home, of course, for couples do share all kinds of intimate displays of affection, be it the woman putting on the man's socks or the man fetching her a cup of tea or the newspaper.<br><br>So, yes, the Singapore woman may not be the most charming and flirtatious of women, and she may not always make her man feel good.<br><br>Still, if you think about it, Singapore women show they care for their men by going out to work and helping to bring home the bacon, and often a large slice of it, too.<br><br>And when they are upfront about their feelings, they are actually showing respect for their men, for they are being honest. They are not treating men as idiots by trying to fool them through saying one thing and meaning another.<br><br>Now, if this isn't good enough for Singapore men, can you blame some Singapore women for turning to foreign men who can appreciate them for what they are?<br><br></strong><br><br>Yeah.. great article, which was dated Jan 6th, 2002, and I kept it...<br>So <strong>U GO GIRL, SINGAPOREAN BABES RULZ!!! </strong>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>[/b]</blockquote>i hv a couple of m'sian friends....... guys n gals.......<br>for the gals i known..... they r fashionable, true, hardworking n can be good soul mates then most sg gals......<br><br>maybe u hv nt encountered them.... n u hv a wrong impression of them.... they r more true then sg gals..... towards friendship n relationships......<br><br>every country has good n bad girls..... depend on wat friends u befriended wif.....<br><br>as for the M'sian guys...... they r more mature, hardworking, gentlement, thoughtful n adore their wife veri much...... unlike most sg guys.....<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div>
