            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>[[[[ Â»Ã�Â­nÂ¦rÂ¨Ã¥Â®Ã‰ &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br><br>need translation, try this WWW. tiger NT . com / dict. s HTML ]]]]<br><br>it is almost as ferocious as the real life environment that the British University put me into.<br><br>My parents are not working for the civil service or working for any universities, so I did not enjoy the heavy subsidy that the Government used to provide to the SINGAPORE children who studied in overseas universities. My parents have to pay the expensive high fees in the UK university for all foreign students. What I get in British University were man-made hardship and negligence + denial by University Officials. Pretty much like in that Korean TV Drama, there is a nasty step-brother who tried to exploit the new-comer sister[SINGAPORE studentS in British Universities or High School] everyway that he could.<br><br>However, it could get even worse and more extreme and total rip-off, the British universities are even worse than the gangsters, in the way that they exploit and extort SINGAPORE students in terms of Basic Rights and Family Fortune. Even more recklessnessly.<br><br>Since I was young, my parents provided all I need, like a bicycle and a computer etc. I have been a nice, well-behaving, hard working and brilliant student for all my academic subjects. I went for one of the most intensive medicine course in an UK university (in order to become a Family Doctor or a Bright Surgeon in the Operation Theater). But the bigot, arrogant British put me into a nousy, tiny storage area underneath the staircase and call my room the spare room. Â¡V Usually, occupied by no-one and no students will be allocate to that tiny under-the-staircase space anyway. The space is so tiny; I could not even extend my arms there. The furniture was old, humiliating, and wobbly. It is just more ironic when comparing to all other British students on the same floor who also got their own single room --- all their room is big enough space to park 2 normal size cars inside (except2 long long limousines). We are all paying the same standard single room fee Â¡V highest among the university.<br><br>There is really no evidence of a relationship between the amount of money thrown into university education and genuine educational accomplishment. For university course, British University cost more than double than a same degree course that held in one of the universities in Singapore. Beside the difference in the price tag, there are employment restrictions as well. Nowadays, British University charges the whole year tuition in advance even the students might have scholarship and loans coming in. In Britain, Singapore Students are simply the MILK COW for the British Economy. The local student only paid one-third of what the Singapore student paid. Furthermore, their Local Education Authority (LEA) will lend them all the tuition fees and let them have some living expenses too. On the other hand, it cost the Singapore parents an arm and a leg to send their kids away. The situation is even more ridiculous for Secondary School Education. The average cost is more than 200,000-00 SINGAPORE dollars per year. It is enough to cover the construction cost of a front yard swimming pool in many countries. Why it worth so much money? It is never justifiable. It is simply because of their parents studied in English in the past, it is incomprehensible for their children to take an exam in Chinese.<br><br>When we look at the top-notch education around the world, Germany and Japanese use their own mother-tongue language to teach. Their English is not the best but the quality of their products is the highest quality with very clever engineering that many countries admire. As a conclusion, the next generation should able to use Chinese to demonstrate their knowledge in examination. No doubt about it.<br><br>For any uninformed parents or prospective university students who are studying for their Advanced Level. Do not bet all your salaries on your children UK education ( It could crash as much as the peak of the Housing Market here and there)<br><br>The Sunny picture in British Universities Prospectus never do any justice to the real foggy weather in Britain. I sincerely donÂ¡Â¦t want any decent human being to try out university and deprive over there Â¡V in Britain.<br><br>Finally for those devoted and dedicated parents considering British School for the Beverly-Hill budget type of education. AUSTRALIAN AND AMERICAN STUDENTS pay the same fees as the overseas students for their University Education, they are much friendlier (with a real heart, just like any good human should have) than the arrogant British. In those countries, Chinese students are considered to be smart in science subjects; however, they are all right about that. Unlike UK, jealousy is not an issue when fair competition IS THE FUNDAMENTAL DRIVE OF THEIR ECONOMIES for centuries.<br><br>Why the Singapore parents would pay a fortune to some mysterious old school in Britain for an uncertain academic attainment that they knew little about while certain that British would be NASTY and DEPRIVE against Â¡Â§Chinese KIDSÂ¡Â¨ (they look down on us as worse than house maid Â¡V in British Mind)<br><br>Will it be better to save up those money and buy a Real House with a real big garden.<br>British secondary school place is just over-priced, the education service has not even seen before such commitment of purchases. Does it make any sense, at all????<br><br>Since I was young, I do the best that I can, being hardworking in all my exam and project.  Recently, I also volunteer to provide free on-line tutor in an official web site: etvonline.tv  come and have a look<br><br></div>
