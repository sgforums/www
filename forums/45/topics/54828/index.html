            <div class='col-md body'>tis is a story of contradiction and irony.....the star of this story seems to be in a rather serious dilema.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  too confused about her identity....i have somehow managed to get hold of her online diary....the story begins.....<br><br>Once upon a time in NYP, a gal from TEP at blk d lvl 4.......<br><br>"Dear ah... me gg to work liao hor... I love you.. Miss u alot... constantly sms me k? *Muaks...* (pause) [Hopeful small boy tone] Can u gimme a kiss?" Haha... sweetie.... How to resist such a plea... after that me went to bed...

I used to use even more high-end products... Estee Lauder, Chanel etc... Juz the eye makeup I apply cost up to $150. I collect branded perfumes in dozens... Lol.. I'm super materialistic? Haha.. get a life.. And for that gal (u noe who u r), dun worry chick, u r no less materialistic then the girl next door... u're normal. Tat idiot is not...<br><br>For a woman, spending money is like..................... Well... just a good bra cost $60, a good mascara cost $35..... not to mention the other bits and pieces... Being a woman is so................... expensive.. High maintenance fee man... Haha...<br><br>Anyway, another funny thing happened. In that shop I bought the halter dress, I tried it then came out to see the mirror.... this is what one lady said... (In chinese but I try my best to translate accurately)<br>Her: You mei you ren shuo guo ni xiang Zhong Li ti? (Anyone ever told you that you resemble Zhong Li Ti)<br>Me: Shui shi Zhong Li Ti? (Who is Zhong Li Ti?)<br>Her: Err... na ge Marie France de lor.. (The one from Marie France..)<br>Me: Err... shui? (Err... who?)<br>Her: Err... Ni qu kan Marie France de guang gao...

            <div class='col-md body'><br>I am attached! Goodness gracious.. Yes I am, as in belonging to someONE... finally I might add... To who? Mr. Ronvin 4 hours 30 mins ago at Clarke Quay. Goodness.. Still can't believe it. Not to mention that he's my best friend's brother... Wow... I'm in love............ It feels soooo good.... I'm still smiling stupidly... Are you dear?Dear is tired and so am I. Long and exciting day today....Trashy proposal is done and I know I'll have a sweet sweet dream......<br>Ok... the story.....<br>I got to know Ronvin on 14-06-03 during his 21st birthday chalet. My best friend, his sister, invited Bee and me there. Hmm.... what to say leh? Well... spend the night having fun etc... always heard abt him since I'm 13 coz his sis and I are classmates and his name has always been dropped occasionally into our conversation. I know him to a certain extent but it was that day that I really know him. He taught me to play cards and tried to teach me mahjong but his best friend beat him to it. He was quite sour during that time. =) Anyway, I spend the night at the chalet and we just fooled around. He said that since that night, he'd been fond of me. (o'_'o)Well... he got my number from his sister the next day when we went back.... It was a Sunday. His best friend went home together with me. He said he did not feel good about it. Lol. He smsed me the next day to ask me out. We went for a movie... Finding Nemo. Very very nice.... So thats how it began........... a shorter version for u guys... Bee, tell u abt it when I meet you... Cindy and Zila.. thx for the support when I'm confused... Emily.. Woah... your brother and me??? I'm still in a daze... Well.. that should be all to cut my private story short for the public... =)I'll update soon..... I'm going back to eating my sandwich (see dear, I'm eating.. are you?)...<br>I still can't believe I'm attached after so long... Feels weird... A little funny but I think time will solve that... =)<br><br>Believe me, it is.Anyway, I have something to look forward to every Saturday already. Derrick took permanent leave every Saturday to go out with me. Hmm.. he gets his pay on every Sat (weekly) and he wanna spent it on me. -_-"<br>I dun noe lar. I asked him not heart pain meh? He say no leh, you happy I happy.. -_-""<br>Haii.. dunoe lar. not comfortable spending ppl's money.... well.. my wallet to collect dust meh? Anyway, first Saturday went by nicely. Met at 2 pm after my "work". Went to Cityhall. We went up to Raffles City first coz he wanna buy some chocs. Went to Chocolate Box. Not bad... bought like 8 pieces... 1 piece for like 2 bucks... Then went up to see some stuff, he bought me a stuff dog. Oh, when he met me earlier, he gave me a stuff bear. -_-" A lot of plushies on my bed now... Well well, will be getting even more I think. Dun noe lar... Then went to Citylink, Godiva Choc. This one is ex. Goodness... 4 to 5 pieces for $18+. I think thats the most exp. choc I ever eaten. Nice yah... but then.... $$$<br>Ok, went to Suntec, ate lunch at the Sky Garden, Swiss Culture. Not bad... Cheesy stuff... very bloated after that. Saw his colleagues at Citylink.... seems that I've become famous in his company now. By Sunday. even his boss knows about me. and words by mouth spread like wildfire. At first it was comments like "Your gf (i'm not his gf) sibei chio" and things like "She very beautiful ah, where you find one?" got 1 guy even dare to say "Hey, your friend ah? Can xian?", "She model ah?" Well I'm not his gf, I'm not a model, not chio or sibei chio, not beautiful juz normal typical girl you see ard town. Anyway, the point is by sunday, I became "Very very very very beautiful and somehow became a model." Hmm... aiyah.. dunoe lar... Ppl's mouth....... damn effective mean of communication sia.... Anyway, after that we went Orchard, bought a charm bracelet. Nice.... I'm currently looking for nice bracelets thats value for money. Lol. After that went walking ard Wisma...nothing much to see also... Dun feel like shopping coz I can't open my wallet before him. He really refuse to let me pay AT ALL. -_-" Anyway, I found a black shawl. The material is really good and I like it.. finally, after searching for so long... Hmm... We were bored at Orchard so went to back Cityhall... Walked at Carrefour and bought some groceries. He bought lots of snacks and stuff for me to eat when I'm bored... Fruits etc.... Haii... cannot eat finish. After that took cab home.... So tired.... Then got to rush a report for Monday... rush rush rush... nearly forgot all it... Slept late.. damn tiredOn Sunday, I met up with the lady whose wallet I picked up, She was definitely grateful. We went for dinner at "Sweet Recipe" at P.S. The cheesecake was damn damn good.. To die for man.. Muz try.... Well.. after eating... we went separate ways..<br>Other then my spendings. People spend on me too. Ronvin brought me out for dinner on Friday. His treat coz he failed to meet me twice when he asked me out. Anyway, kinda guilty, he spent more then $100 that day. Met him at abt 5 pm after my dentist at Pacific Brewery. Was wearing this Greek-influenced dress and I think he really liked it coz he couldn't stop complimenting me. Chat a little, had coffee then went to Esplanade. He brought me to Library at Esplanade. Its a really cool place... We had sushi for dinner at Colours by the Bay. I realized that everytime he ask me out, he'll do homework first by scouting around for whats nice and all. He went Esplanade on Monday to check it out. Woah... After that we went to Citylink coz he wanna go Ig's Heaven. Looked around then we went off. I went past this boutique and somthing caught my eye. It was this shawl thingy. Kinda cool Anyway, I tried it and I notice he kept smiling to himself. Thought it was me looking bad but he assured me I look great. Hmm.. bought it. He said he was smiling coz seeing me trying something and modeling for him and asking his opinions made him feel really warm inside. Well well... whateva that means. He'd been dropping hints around that day.... Geess..... Well... he showed me the Sky Garden at Suntec, cool place... Anyway, I realize tat he kept walking behind me. I asked him why. He say I walk really well, like a model. Hmm... 2nd time a guy said tat. Derrick also like walking behind me coz he too like the way I walk. Thanks to years of drill? Good posture.. GB girls reading this? See... drill isn't all abt suffering... you have guys complimenting the way you walk soon. Lol. No promises though. Well, later we walked over to the Merlion where we went to this cafe. Drank, chat and ate till like 12.30 am then walked our way to Suntec where he sent me home by cab. Home at 1.30 am.<br><br>I realize guys are getting similar nowadays? In the past month, 2 guys said wanna bring me for a cable car dinner for something special and both always owe me dinners somehow... Hmmm... other then those other similar compliments... Esplanade are always on their mind as well..... Been spending more and more time at Cityhall. Haii... confusion confusion...<br><br>****take note.....check her out and u will find out wat a contradicting gal she is......semms to be praising herself...using reverse psychology....i tink she is rather pitiful or should i say.....damn B.H.B, DAMN HAO LIaN.....she is from Biz mgmt, currently at TEP....at BLK B level 4.....check her out <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
