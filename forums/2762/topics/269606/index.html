            <div class='col-md body'>Introduction<br><br>Whether you're just starting to run, or coming back from an injury or a long break from running, there can be, at any given time in your entry-level process, a mixture of excitement, anxiety and anticipation going through your body.<br><br>Once you have set the goal to get in shape and reclaim your health, there is a real sense of purpose. Â”IÂ’m going to do this. IÂ’m going to get myself out there and run for a fitter and healthier me!Â”<br><br>Many running beginners like to give the following excuses:<br><br>Â“Why the heck am I planning on running? Everyone knows you shouldnÂ’t run after your 40. IÂ’ll ruin my knees.Â”<br>Â“Running is just too hard.Â”<br>Â“IÂ’m too old to start running.Â”<br>Â“IÂ’m too out of shape. I get tired running down the block.Â”<br>Â“People who run all seem like fanatics.Â”<br><br>But by coming into this thread, youÂ’re intrigued nonetheless, by running. Maybe it's because you remember that great feeling you had when you used to run. Or, maybe you're just looking for the quickest and easiest way to reclaim your health/fitness.<br><br>For most people, running is a safe and effective way to get some great exerciseÂ… at any age. When you learn to run properly, you can significantly reduce the possibility of hurting yourself. It doesn't have to be hard to get started, but it is wise to get started carefully and with a plan.<br><br>A tip: when you're beginning a running program, run for minutes, not miles. Do not over-exert the first time round. Build up your stamina slowly but surely.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Running Posture<br><br>From <a href="http://www.dummies.com/WileyCDA/DummiesArticle/id-1711.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dummies.com/WileyCDA/DummiesArticle/id-1711.html</a><br><br>Running posture is similar to the posture that your mother nagged you about when you were growing up: It's how you hold your back, shoulders, and neck. What position is your back in when you run? To find out, have a friend take a video of you (straight on and from the side). If that's not possible, ask someone to take a picture of you, from the side, as you run by. Although not as effective, you can also run in place, sideways, next to a full-length mirror and look at your posture. Either way, evaluate what you see and determine which of the following categories you fall into:<br><br>* Your back is perfectly straight up and down. Running with your back perfectly straight can make for good running posture, as long as it doesn't indicate that your body is as tight as a violin string. Be sure that, in keeping your back straight, your body isn't rigid, such that your neck and arms are tensed instead of relaxed. If running with a perfectly straight back is natural to you and you feel relaxed, don't try to change it. But if you feel tense, try to lean forward just slightly from your waist as you run.<br><br>* You lean just slightly forward from your waist. This is the most common Â— and most efficient Â— way to run, with a slight lean forward. With just a slight lean, your arms, back, neck, shoulders, and diaphragm relax. See Figure 1.<br><br><img src="http://media.wiley.com/assets/124/90/0-7645-2510-7_0801.jpg"><br><span class="small">Figure 1: Correct running posture inclines an ever-so-slight forward lean. </span><br><br>* You lean far forward at the waist. Although this posture is unusual, some runners do lean so far forward that they look as though they may fall. This posture puts quite a bit of pressure on your lower back and doesn't allow you to keep your eyes up and on the back of the person ahead of you in your marathon. It can also interfere with your breathing. Although changing your posture may seem awkward at first, try pulling yourself back to perfectly straight or a slight lean forward for at least three runs.<br><br>* You lean back at your waist. Leaning too far back makes you unable to fully fill your diaphragm, which means that you can't breathe as well as you would if you leaned a bit forward. Instead, you want to lean forward slightly at the waist. Also think about bringing your chin down, because it's likely tipped back.<br><br><img src="http://media.wiley.com/assets/0/29/remember.gif"><br>The main reason people run with a slight lean back is because they're fatigued in their arms and upper body. If you begin to lean back at the end of workouts or races, consider adding pushups or an entire circuit routine to your training.<br><br><img src="http://media.wiley.com/assets/0/27/tip.gif"><br>When running uphill, lean forward, so that you're leaning into the angle of the hill. Thrust your elbows back hard as you run up the hill. In this position, you run hills powerfully, instead of letting hills conquer you.<br><br>Two other common mistakes in running posture are as follows:<br><br>* Scrunching your shoulders so that they're up near your ears. This makes running far more difficult than it needs to be. Instead, relax your shoulders and hold them slightly back Â— just like your teacher told you to stand when you were a kid. Efficient running is all about relaxation, and you can't relax your body with your shoulders all scrunched.<br><br>* Tilting your chin up so that it points to the sky. Ideally, your neck stays perfectly straight; your chin is neither tilted down toward your chest nor tilted up. Many runners, however, do tilt their chins up, especially as they become fatigued. Practice keeping your neck perfectly straight as you run.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For your first run:<br><br>From <a href="http://www.dummies.com/WileyCDA/DummiesArticle/id-1713.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dummies.com/WileyCDA/DummiesArticle/id-1713.html</a><br><br>Whether you're taking the first run of your life, returning to the sport after a long layoff, or coming back from an injury, a great way to get into running and quickly build your mileage is to start with a combination run/walk. The idea is fairly simple: After you put on yourrunning clothes, shoes, hat, watch, sunscreen, or whatever else you may need, head out the door and do the following:<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1. Run at a comfortable pace until you begin to feel fatigued.</span></strong><br><br>The amount of time this takes varies greatly from person to person, but just run until you're pretty tired but not exhausted. That may be 5 minutes or 15 or even more, depending on your current fitness level.<br><br><img src="http://media.wiley.com/assets/0/27/tip.gif"><br>Keep in mind that, eventually, you want your training runs to consist of all running (and no walking), so the farther you can run each of your first few weeks (instead of walking), the more quickly you'll get into the meat of your training.<br><strong>For now, don't focus too much on how good Â— or how poor Â— your running technique is. Getting out the door and starting to run is what's most important.</strong><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2. Slow down and start walking Â— briskly.</span></strong><br><br><img src="http://media.wiley.com/assets/0/35/warning.gif"><br>Don't stop and take a breather between the running phase and the walking phase. In order to build your endurance, you have to keep your heart rate up during the entire run/walk.<br><br>The amount of time you walk Â— like the time that you run Â— varies, based on your fitness and ability. You may need to walk only a minute or two, or you may walk just as long (or even longer) than you run.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3. When you feel like you can begin running again, start running.</span></strong><br><br>Again, don't rest between the walk and the run. Simply speed up your walk and begin running.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4. Repeat as needed.</span></strong><br><br>Don't worry about the ratio of running to walking; instead, think about the total time you're out there training. Try starting with a total of 15 to 30 minutes per day for 4 days of the first week, taking 3 days off but not 3 days in a row. (You may decide never to start back up again!) If 30 minutes seems long now, keep in mind that a marathon is 26.2 miles and will likely take you from 3 to 5 hours to complete!<br><br><img src="http://media.wiley.com/assets/0/35/warning.gif"><br>Be sure that, while running, you keep your pace consistent. Don't start off each running phase running much faster than you can maintain and then slowing down as you begin to get tired. Keep in mind that your training prepares you for your racing, and the key to success in marathon racing is running a consistent, even pace, regardless of how good or how tired you feel.<br><br><img src="http://media.wiley.com/assets/0/29/remember.gif"><br>The beauty of a run/walk is that it allows your first few runs to be fairly long Â— say, 20 to 30 minutes Â— without putting excess stress on your body the first time out. If you started out with just a run (no walking allowed), you probably wouldn't be able to last more than about 10 minutes, unless you have amazing natural ability.<br><br>Your first week of training is your honeymoon. Just get out there and do what you can. In the next few weeks, work on gradually increasing the percentage of time you spend running instead of walking and your speed.<br><br>Added by eagle: What is meant by honeymoon is that you will feel great increases in stamina and great losses in fats. However, this will get harder and harder as you get fitter, but by then, you will be different from where you have started <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Starting too fast will make you give up again. Perhaps you could start with 1km, and then slowly increase your distance.<br><br>I have been through periods where I have no place to jog... Just 1 month is enough to destroy a lot of your stamina. What I always do is to start with 2km each time, and slowly build up speed and distance.<br><br>But bear in mind that jogging is not the only way to keep fit.</div>
