              <p>We all know that men love to show-off muscles of the arms and chest more than anything else. Any man who is fit and fine feel proud of the way they look, starting from a flat 6-pack abs to well tone back, arms and chest. Honestly nothing looks better than a thick brick chest and a pair of guns hanging from the shoulders down. The muscles on the chest or Pecs that you see on both sides is fan shaped and is one constant muscle running though it may be called different names like pectorals major, pectorals minor and clavicle head to identify the different parts of the same muscle. <br><br>If you have been trying to build your chest muscles and getting no results then its time you go back to the basic of weight training and apply to your plan the three top tips to help you get there. These will help you to get back in shape and have those Pecs bursting out of your short or tee.<br><br><strong>Tip 1 ~ Focus on compound exercise</strong><br>This is the foundation for any chest workout. It will not help you to start off with your routine of dumbbells, flyes and cable crossover as it is too early and are isolation and moves for shaping up. You need to start from the basics instead. Start with the flat bench and incline bench press as your main stay exercises. Move over to your secondary isolation moves at times and swap barbells for the usual dumbbells combining with your benching to add variety and a more effective stretch. <br><br><strong>Tip 2 ~ Train to failure</strong><br>This sounds like the thing to do but there are so many cases of wimping out of this in the last few reps. These are those reps that actually tear down your tissue for growth. It is best to do this with a training partner to spot you and if you don’t have one then you may ask somebody in the gym for help. You may also add an element of shock factor to those Pecs sometime by doing some forced reps or drop sets as this will speed up your chest development more effectively.</p>
              <p><strong>Tip 3 ~ Build A Bigger Chest Fast </strong><br>Every movement has 2 actions associated with it, a positive and a negative. You should not be one of those guys who you see mostly all time letting gravity drop the weight down fast and bounce the bar off the chest. That is performing half the exercise which will have a big effect on your chest development. The negative should be performed in controlled and very slowly without arching the back from the bench. If it means you need to drop the weight a little, please do so. Bad exercise form has never built a great physique.<br>There are many other things apart from the core muscle training that you can do to help you build muscle mass, These 10 things are the absolute bare essentials which means that they are absolutely necessary for a successful muscle build-up program.</p>
