              <p>If you pay much attention to the history of bodybuilding you've probably
                                  heard of the name Charles Atlas. Back in the early part of the 20th century
                                  Atlas was known as the worlds best built man. Starting in 1929 and continuing
                                  throughout the century he sold hundreds of thousands of his muscular
                                  development courses using a form of training he called "dynamic
                                  tension".</p>
              <p>His courses sold through magazines and the advertising depicted caricatures
                                  of a scrawny kid on the beach getting sand kicked in his face by a big guy. The
                                  next caricature would show the scrawny guy coming back to the beach after
                                  completing the Charles Atlas workout. He'd come back big and buff and whip the
                                  bully and run off with the girls. If you look hard enough you'll still be able
                                  to find some of those ads in magazines today.</p>
              <p>The exercises described in the course didn't use weights, rather they used
                                  bodyweight exercises and dynamic tension exercises. The course called for
                                  certain types of movements done in isometric fashion like pushups, where you
                                  hold yourself in a pushup position for a given time. I don't know how much
                                  muscle people have gained over the years using these programs, but what I do
                                  know is that certain concepts and training methods taken from his program can
                                  be extremely effective for the bodybuilder of today.</p>
              <p>It's been said that in the iron game, nothing new is really ever invented,
                                  rather we just keep putting new twists on the same effective things and more
                                  effective ways of arranging and performing training methods that our founders
                                  discovered years ago.</p>
              <p>It's also interesting how outdated training concepts, like <span style="color: windowtext;">kettlebell training</span>, continue to resurface
                                  and are brought back to life and how these concepts are often found very
                                  effective today. One training concept that fits that bill is isometric
                                  training. It can be a very effective training style for you, but unlike the
                                  Charles Atlas programs, you will need to use weights.</p>
              <p><strong>What is an isometric movement</strong></p>
              <p>An isometric is a movement in which no movement occurs. An example
                                  is holding a weight in a semi-contracted and motionless state for a period of
                                  time. Another example is pushing on an immoveable object for a given period of
                                  time. Many of you have probably done the trick where you stand in a doorframe
                                  and with your hands by your sides, you press out again the doorframe as if
                                  you're doing a partial lateral raise.</p>
              <p>You continue to push against the immoveable door frame for 30-45 seconds,
                                  and upon releasing the pressure, your hands tend to "float" up into
                                  the air. This is an example of an isometric movement.</p>
              <p>It turns out Isometric exercises have several benefits for both strength
                                  athletes and bodybuilders.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Benefits Of Isometric Exercises:</strong></p>
              <ol type="1">
              <li class="MsoNormal">Isometrics are purely
                                       "muscle" movements that place the stress entirely on the muscle
                                       fibers, eliminating reactive contribution, and even so they increase
                                       muscle motor unit recruitment above and beyond what you get from eccentric
                                       or concentric reps. </li>
              </ol>
              <p style="margin-left: 36pt;">Activation refers to the recruitment of the
                                  motor-units in a muscle. One can recruit nearly all the muscle fibers during a
                                  maximal isometric contraction - something that doesn't happen with regular
                                  eccentric and concentric (down and up) repetitions. Basically, the more muscle
                                  you can recruit the more damage you can inflict and the more growth can occur.
                                  Not surprisingly, this dramatically enhances <span style="color: windowtext;">strength</span>. Strength gains of 14-40% were
                                  found over a 10-week period using isometric action training.</p>
              <ol type="1">
              <li class="MsoNormal">Isometrics also allow you
                                       to prolong the Time under tension of a particular area or sticking point
                                       and thus add to the time the muscle is under tension as well. If you think
                                       about it, when performing the large majority of movements in the gym the
                                       actual working effect of those movements are over a very short range so a
                                       lot of the time spent completing repetitions is just wasted. </li>
              </ol>
              <p style="margin-left: 36pt;">For example, when you do a bench press your
                                  pectorals are really only maximum tension in the range from just off your chest
                                  to ½ of the way up - the rest is all shoulders and triceps so if you consider
                                  the pause at the top you spend nearly 2/3 of the entire set working muscles
                                  OTHER than your chest.</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 36pt;">The average set duration is something like 20-30
                                  seconds. That means your chest may only be under tension for 10 seconds or less
                                  per set. With isometric training you can isolate a specific area of a movement
                                  for a given time thus prolonging the time the muscle is under tension which is
                                  largely responsible for the hypertrophy response.</p>
              <ol type="1">
              <li class="MsoNormal">Isometrics not only cause
                                       muscle breakdown themselves, but also cause an immediate increase in
                                       subsequent dynamic work as well, which basically means you can perform an
                                       isometric exercise and stimulate strength, growth, and actually have a
                                       strength carryover or an increase in strength with your next movement.
                                       This is something that has to be experienced but it is a welcome change.
                                       You can actually get stronger as the workout continues instead of having a
                                       loss in strength typical of most <span style="color: windowtext;">routines</span>. </li>
              <li class="MsoNormal">Isometric training done at
                                       a disadvantageous joint angle in a movement like near the bottom of a
                                       bench press or squat will have a strength carryover throughout all ranges
                                       of the movement. </li>
              <li class="MsoNormal">Since isometrics stress the
                                       muscle vs the tendons, fascia, etc, they are useful for rehabilitation or
                                       training around <span style="color: windowtext;">injuries</span>. I had a case of biceps
                                       tendonitis the for several months, and basically the only biceps movements
                                       I could do without pain were partial range lying cable curls and isometric
                                       preacher curls (stressing the bottom 1/3). </li>
              </ol>
              <p style="margin-left: 36pt;">Not only is my tendonitis almost healed but my
                                  biceps have not lost any size and experimenting the other day I found out I am
                                  a good 15% stronger on every bicep movement due to the isometric preacher curls
                                  i've been doing.</p>
              <ol type="1">
              <li class="MsoNormal">Isometrics build muscle
                                       mass. In a recent experiment found an average size improvement of 12.4%
                                       for heavy isometric training and 5.3% with isometric training using
                                       weights equivalent to 60% of 1rm weight after a training period of 10

              <p><br> <strong>Using Isometrics For Strength</strong> <br> <br> To strengthen your <span style="color: windowtext;">bench press</span> you could either get in a power
                  rack and press the bar against an immoveable pin for a certain length of time,
                  or hold a supra-maximal weight in a ¼ rep range for 6-20 seconds.</p>
              <p>The first type of isometric movement, pushing against an immoveable object,
                  is used only for strength, whereas the 2nd type, holding a weight and
                  preventing it from moving, is best for strength as well as muscle growth.
                  Personally, I prefer the 2nd type where you simply hold a weight in place for
                  both strength and muscle growth.</p>
              <p>Some say that when performing isometrics you will only strengthen the part
                  of the movement you're training. For example if doing isometrics in a ¼ range
                  bench press position you'll only strengthen that part of the movement. The
                  truth is you will strengthen the part of the movement you're training, but you
                  also get a 15-30 degree carryover and if you train at the most disadvantageous
                  joint angle (like the bottom of a bench press or point in the squat where your
                  thighs are parallel) you actually get a 100% strength carryover through the
                  rest of the movement.</p>
              <p>Strengthen <span style="color: windowtext;">your weak links</span> and everything else
                  strengthens as well. In other words, if you perform an isometric contraction a
                  few inches off your chest in the bench press you'll tend to increase the
                  strength of your entire bench press and the size of your entire chest! But if
                  you only do isometrics over the easiest ¼ or 1/3 range in a movement you only
                  get a 15-30 degree carryover.</p>
              <p>If you really want to increase strength in a movement, using the bench press
                  as an example, you'd simply use 3 different positions (bottom, mid-range, and
                  top) and perform an isometric in each position. You'd perform isometrics in the
                  contracted position near your chest, the midrange position, and then the
                  extended position up top. A sample workout would be 2 sets of 10 seconds at
                  each position with the lower position done first. For strength, each isometric
                  contraction should last 20 seconds or less and ideally under 10 seconds.</p>
              <p><strong>Using Isometric Training For Muscle Growth</strong></p>
              <p>When using isometrics to increase muscle growth, you're able to put a muscle
                  under high amounts of tension for a very long period of time. The total length
                  of time a muscle is under tension is largely responsible for the amount of
                  muscle growth stimulated from a workout. You will know just how effective this
                  method is once you try it!</p>
              <p>There are 3 ways to implement isometrics for muscle growth. The 1st in my
                  opinion is the most effective form.</p>
              <p><strong>Isometrics For Time</strong></p>
              <p>You simply hold a weight equivalent to 50-80% of your 1-rep max in 3
                  different positions per exercise for anywhere from 30 seconds to 1 minute.
                  Let's illustrate an example.</p>
              <p>Say you're doing preacher curls. You load up the bar with 60-80% of your
                  1-rep max and execute your set by holding the bar in a slightly flexed position
                  near the bottom of the movement for anywhere from 30 seconds to 1 minute.
                  Obviously, the heavier the weight in relationship to your 1-rep max the shorter
                  you'll be able to hold it.</p>
              <p>After this set you rest a minute and then repeat in the same extended
                  position. Next you complete 2 sets in the mid-range position, followed by 2
                  sets in the upper 1/3 of the movement. Follow this up with 1-2 sets of full
                  range preacher curls and your bicep workout is over. Try this and I'm sure
                  you'll find it's the most effective workout for muscle growth ever! The
                  guidelines for this method are:</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 36pt;"><strong>Load:</strong> 50-80% of your 1
                  repetition maximum <br> <strong>Length of time per set:</strong> 30-60 seconds <br> <strong>Number of sets per position:</strong> 1-3 per position <br> <strong>Number of positions per exercise:</strong> 3<br> <strong>Rest intervals:</strong> 1-2 minutes</p>
              <p><strong>Isometric Stops</strong></p>
              <p>The next method of using isometrics for hypertrophy can be done on any
                  exercise, but it is more effective for exercises like pull-ups, rows, and curls
                  unless you have a spotter. This isometric training method involves using
                  isometric stops. Isometric stops allow you to increase the duration of a set
                  and thus put more strain on a muscle.</p>
              <p>Say for instance you're doing a set chin-ups and you've knocked out 8 reps
                  and struggled on your last rep so you know you won't be able to complete
                  another repetition. Most people would simply relax their arms and terminate the
                  set. However, you can increase the duration of the set and place more strain on
                  the muscle by lowering yourself under control and stopping the negative motion
                  for 6 seconds at different positions on the way down.</p>
              <p>So, using our chin-up example, after completion of your last positive rep
                  you'd hold yourself near the contracted position for 6 seconds, lower yourself
                  down about to mid-point and hold for 6 seconds, and then lower yourself down
                  near the bottom and once again hold for 6 seconds. Do this and you'll
                  definitely notice a difference!</p>
              <p>I recommend you use isometric stops on your last set of an exercise where
                  applicable. You can get good results just doing 1 six second isometric hold on
                  the last rep of the set, but if you're up for it go for all 3.</p>
              <p><strong>Isometric Supersets</strong></p>
              <p>You can also superset an isometric with a full range movement. This will
                  boost the working effect of the full range movement big time. For example:</p>
              <p>Isometric bench presses*<br> Dumbell flyes x 10-12 reps <br> Repeat 3 times</p>
              <p>* Hold near the bottom position for 10 seconds with heavy weight.</p>
              <p><strong>Explosive Variety Supersetting</strong></p>
              <p>You can also superset an explosive movement with an isometric movement. This
                  variety is great for athletes who need to maintain explosiveness while packing
                  on the mass. Pick a movement, any movement and using 50% of your 1rm perform 10
                  fast and explosive reps as quickly as possible. Next, without resting simply
                  hold the weight in your weakest position for as long as possible.</p>
              <p>Repeat 3 times</p>
              <p>Give some of these training methods of the past a try and watch them elevate
                  your muscle growth years into the future. I predict we will see a
                  reintroduction of "Charles Atlas" type training into the programs of
                  bodybuilders in the next year or so.</p>
