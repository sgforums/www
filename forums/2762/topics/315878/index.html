              <p><span id="intelliTXT"> SHAPE Run goes regional to Malaysia and Thailand.<br> <br> <br> <strong>SHAPE RUN SINGAPORE RETURNS FOR THE THIRD YEAR TO LEAD REGIONAL SERIES</strong><br> <br> <br> Singapore, 25 April 2008 – Shape Run 2008, organised by SPH Magazines
              Pte Ltd (SPH Magazines), is bigger and better. SHAPE Singapore will be
              bringing its signature event, Shape Run, to Malaysia and Thailand this
              year, making it the region’s first series of women-only competitive
              runs. To kick-start the series, Shape Run 2008 (Singapore) will happen
              on 20 July 2008, Sunday, at The Padang. This is followed by Shape Run
              Malaysia in August, and the Thai edition in November this year. The run
              in Malaysia will be organised by Magazine World Sdn Bhd, and in
              Thailand, by Amarin Printing &amp; Publishing Public Company Limited in
              partnership with SPH Magazines.<br> <br> The Singapore event will be made more exciting as well with the
              addition of the new 5km Corporate Category. Employees from the same
              organisation can compete in teams of three to five, or in the 5km and
              10km individual categories. The team with the lowest accumulated time
              of the first three finishers will be the winner. <br> <br> Khoo Bee Khim, deputy editor of SHAPE, says: “It is evident from the
              last two years that Shape Run has motivated many women to get off the
              couch, and lead a more active lifestyle. Training and participating in
              a race is a great way to bond with your friends and colleagues. With
              the introduction of the Corporate Category, we hope even more women
              will be inspired to pick up running. As a complete mind and body guide,
              SHAPE continues to help more and more women live healthier and fitter
              lives. What better way to take charge of your life, and kick-start your
              way to better health than with Shape Run”.<br> <br> Allen Loh, Managing Director of SPH Magazines, added: “We are extremely
              pleased and encouraged to know that Shape Run’s popularity has filtered
              to neighbouring countries. Working with our partners in Malaysia and
              Thailand, we hope to reach out to more like-minded women in the region
              through this annual flagship event of SHAPE.”<br> <br> Registration for Shape Run 2008 (Singapore) will open on April 26, 2008. Runners can register online at <a href="http://www.shape.com.sg/">www.shape.com.sg</a>,
              or at the Shape Run 2008 launch event (12pm – 9pm) at Wisma Atria’s
              outdoor area on April 26. With last year’s 6,000 slots snapped up in
              just 12 days, a strong response is expected again this year with the
              8,000 slots available. In fact, with the Run’s regional presence this
              year, foreign runners are also expected. Interested participants are
              encouraged to sign up early to avoid disappointment.<br> <br> The registration fee for the Run is $30 for the Individual Categories,
              and $150 for the Corporate Category. All individual runners can top up
              $10 and receive a six-month subscription of SHAPE, the complete mind
              &amp; body guide for women. All participants will receive a fabulous
              kit filled with running essentials, including a limited-edition Shape
              Run Nike tee, and a race certificate with personal timing upon
              completion of the run.<br> <br> For the first time, Shape Run 2008 is proudly presented by Japanese car
              maker, Subaru. “Singaporeans are becoming increasingly health conscious
              and active. We are pleased to be part of an initiative that aims to get
              women even more involved in exercise. Whether they stroll, jog or run,
              I hope that women of all ages make their commitment to a healthier
              lifestyle by participating in this event”, said Mr. Glenn Tan, Group
              Chief Executive, Motor Image Enterprises. Shape Run 2008 is
              co-presented by Nike Women, who has been supporting the event for three
              years since its inception.<br> <br> Other sponsors include AIBI, CITISPA, Dunlopillo, H-TWO-O, Kellogg’s,
              MARIGOLD Yoghurt, Marina Square, ParkwayHealth, StarHub, Sunplay, True
              Yoga, and VITAGEN Collagen. The event is supported by Singapore Sports
              Council (Sport A New You), Tote Board and Singapore Pools. <br> <br> All runners and readers of SHAPE can check out the latest health,
              beauty, and fitness products and services at the exciting Shape Run
