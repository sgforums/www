              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">I have a friend who plans to have a baby but the problem is that she has not been having menes since several years back. She went KKH for a check-up and doc gave her 6 cycles of the 21-day pill (also known as THE PILL) for regulating menes. Her menes came whenever she finishes 1 cycle of the pill (during the 7-day pill-free period), which is how it’s supposed to be. After finishing all 6 cycles, her menes stopped coming. Several months later, she went back for follow-up and doc gave her yet again another 6 cycles. Her menes started again after finishing 1 cycle. After finishing all 6 cycles, her menes stopped. Seems like she needs the pill in order to have menes. But the prob is that as the pill is a contraceptive pill, she is not able to get pregnant while on it. If she stops taking, she would not have menes (hence, cannot get pregnant). </span></p>

              <p>Hi Jacquelyn, </p>
              <p>IVF does not guarantee that your friend will definitely have babies. The success rate is only about 40%, though my friend manages to get a pair of twins on her first try. Another important factor to note is that the chances of having a baby will be lower as one gets older.</p>
              <p>It is good that your friend is trying out alternatives such as using Traditional Chinese Medicine first, as IVF is by no means cheap, and may require multiple cycles.</p>
