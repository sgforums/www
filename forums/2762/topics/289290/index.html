            <div class='col-md body'>To me, exercising to keep fit and making sure you eat healthily or is healthy is a self responsibility. Why? It is your own body, your own life, and it is you to suffer when you regret not having do all the "punishments" to your body earlier in your life.<br><br>True, some may say that they do not have time; they have to work; they have to study. I myself is a perfect example now: I'm in my final year in uni, and I overload myself to the maximum number of modular credits; I have to spend time with my girlfriend, my family and my friends; I have to meet deadlines for projects and homework in uni, not to mention facing many tests in the semester; I have time for leisure (sgf posting, tv, etc, no time for outings yet only). Yet I can manage the time for exercising 5~6 days a week. When you claim you do not have enough time for exercise at least twice a week, just think and ponder: Do you have more or less time as compared to me. Is just taking at most 2 hours of your time a week (7*24 hrs) for exercising too much to ask for? If so, why?<br><br>When I mean exercise, it can be either intense or not intense. Intense are those that make you feel extreme tiredness when after you are finished with your exercise. Not intense are the opposite; this includes perhaps a chin-up training session, where you just do 3 or more sets of your max rep. It can even include just doing 50~100 bodyweight squats at home while you are watching your TV.<br><br>All said, it is all about time management and nutrition. Time management is where you plan all that you are going to do. For me, since my time is almost always filled, I planned fixed time slots for my exercise. Suppose I missed it, I will try to plan another time slot on another day. Plan your time so that you have enough time for sleep. Sleep is extremely important for recovery so that you can continue with your work.<br><br>Nutrition is also important for recovery. In my opinion, if you cannot recover fast enough, you won't have the energy to do your work. Make sure your meals consist of a balance of fibre, protein and carbohydrates. In addition, eat fruits whenever possible; the antioxidants help minimize damage to your body by oxidants, and they assist you in your recovery.<br><br>So, start planning, start exercising, and start being responsible for your body. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

The nearby fitness corners with chin up pars and parallel bars are free. Even if it is rather far, one can do with a short jog to the bars to play, and then have a short jog back.<br><br>Furthermore, there are many other ways in which one can do some mini workout at home, saving the need to even leave the doorstep</div>
