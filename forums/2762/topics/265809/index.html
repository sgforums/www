            <div class='col-md body'>Exercise FAQs<br><br>1.<br>How do I know if my weight is ideal?<br><br>The simplest method is to use the body mass index (BMI), which is weight in kg divided by the square of height in metres. A value of BMI above 25 is considered overweight (and in most cases over-fat as well).<br><br>2.<br>If I am underweight, what should I do to gain weight?<br><br>Regular exercise helps you to keep fit and healthy. In addition to your regular workout, ensure that you are on a well balanced diet that is sufficient in calories. You may want to see a dietician to help plan a healthy diet for you.<br><br>3.<br>If I am overweight, how can I reduce my weight effectively?<br><br>If being overweight is your only problem and you are healthy otherwise, then you should do exercise like walking and swimming (low impact) to minimise injuries or aches and pains. You should also exercise at a rate that makes you feel warm, sweat, and breathe harder, but not to the point that you get breathless. If you start to feel breathless while exercising, you should slow down before you continue. You can also stop for a short while (eg 30 seconds) to catch your breath, then continue at a lower intensity (eg walk slower). Each exercise session should be 30-60 minutes in duration, as continuous as possible, and sessions should be regular (three to five times a week). As you get fitter, you would be able to exercise harder without becoming breathless.<br><br>4.<br>Is there a best time of the day that proves to be the most effective to do exercise?<br><br>The best time would be one that is most convenient for you to exercise regularly. For example, (and this is not a fact) scientists suggest that exercising in the morning is more effective. However, being able to exercise three to five times a week, for 30-60 minutes each time is more important than the time of the day during which you exercise.<br><br>5.<br>What is considered regular exercise?<br><br>On average, we should exercise at least three times a week, at least 20 minutes each time*.<br><br>6.<br>What types of exercises are recommended for weight control?<br><br>The exercises which are more effective for weight control are the aerobic exercises (also known as cardiovascular exercises) like jogging, swimming, cycling, brisk walking, racket and ball games.<br><br>7.<br>Other than exercising, is there any other way to reduce weight? Will those special weight-loss diets sold in the market help?<br><br>To reduce weight, especially fat weight, you would need to use up more energy (calories) than you are taking into the body (as food and drink). A combination of judicious dieting (cutting down on total energy intake, especially from fat, oil and sugar) and regular exercise (three to five times a week, 30-60 minutes* each time of moderate intensity aerobic exercise like brisk walking, cycling, swimming) would be recommended. Special diets sold in the market may work for some people but not for others. Some of these diets adopt a low-calorie approach. Such diets will result in quick weight loss, but are unsafe if carried on for long periods of time; they also tend to make you feel weak and can cause significant loss of muscle mass. Losing muscle mass reduces your basal metabolism, making it easier to regain the weight you lose. For safety, it is best to control weight through a healthy diet and regular exercise.<br><br>8.<br>How can I achieve a leaner tummy?<br><br>Sit-ups and crunches help to tone up the muscles. However, if you have too much body fat, the abdominal area will look flabby and the muscles will not show as they will be hidden by excess fat underlying the skin. So which contributes more depends on the individual concerned - if there is too much fat, there is a need to reduce through a low-fat diet; if muscles are not toned, you need to do more sit-ups/crunches. You also have to consider genetic factors, as well as posture (a "hunched" posture can make the abdomen look "fat").<br><br>9.<br>How do I avoid knee problems that are often caused by long term jogging?<br><br>Most people develop joint problems because they overuse their joints - which can occur with distance running - or injure them (eg with twisting injuries). The best way to avoid such problems is to listen to your body. If the knee hurts while running or after (including next morning), it is your body telling you that you have overstrained/overused the knee. Worse if there is swelling and limitation of movement. You need to find out what is causing the pain and make the necessary changes before continuing with the activity - in the case of running, the terrain plays a part, as well as the running shoes. For frequent runners, it would be advisable to change your shoes every 6 months or so, and also to ensure that the shoes are suitable for your type of body and feet. A well-drawn up training programme will also help reduce the risk (there should be gradual increases in training loads), as well as to ensure that the muscles which are used in running are kept strong and flexible (through strength training two to three times a week and stretching especially after workouts). Running on the treadmill or on a softer surface such as a running track at the sports stadium would also reduce the impact strain on the knee.<br><br>10.<br>Why do muscles feel strained after exercise and sometimes the pain won't go away for days? Is it due to insufficient stretching before exercise or is it because I have overworked myself during the exercise?<br><br>When your muscles are stressed beyond their capabilities, they will be damaged. This will result in pain, which can last for days (or even weeks if the damage is more than microscopic). The common aching after unaccustomed activity is due to micro-tears in the muscles used. To avoid such aching, it is important to gradually build up your fitness to cope with your intended activity. Stretching before and after activity can also help to minimise such aching. If pain persists over a long period of time, you should consult a sports doctor.<br><br>11.<br>When I lose weight, how do I know if I am losing fats, muscle or water?<br><br>If you drink sufficient water to replace that lost in sweat and urine and you exercise regularly, any loss of weight is likely to be loss of fats. If you go on diet and restrict water intake as well, then weight loss would be from a combination of water, muscle and fats.<br><br>All diets that are low in calories will cause weight loss, including muscle loss. When you lose muscle, your body's metabolic rate will drop - you will then find that you put on weight very easily. With loss of muscle, you will become weaker, and this will affect your ability to do physical work and exercise. Muscles will respond with strength training, provided nutrition is adequate.<br><br>12.<br>Is there any exercise that can help me grow taller?<br><br>If you are still growing, you can increase your height by exercising regularly and maintaining a balanced diet. However, do note that your genes will also affect your height so if your family members are short on average, chances are high that you will be of a similar height.<br><br>13.<br>Why do I get backache when I run?<br><br>Backache during distance running could be due to the following causes:<br><br>Posture - if you have a hunched posture, excessive stress to the back can result in backache<br>Impact - lack of shock-absorbing footwear when running on hard surfaces. Style of running may contribute to high impact forces.<br>Terrain - running on routes with many up-hill (requiring more hip flexion) or down-hill (causing more impact) tracts can also result in backache.<br>Inadequate flexibility (which can result from inadequate stretching before and after running) especially of the hamstring muscles can result in excessive pelvic movements resulting in backache.<br>Running long distances only once or twice a week may also contribute to backache - the body is "deconditioned" for most of the week and is then subject to relatively high intensity exercise, which can result in backache as well as other aches and pains.<br><br>Taken from<br><a href="http://www.hpb.gov.sg/hpb2/qna/hpb_faqmain.asp?strItemChoice=200511803814&amp;strSubItemChoice=20052151749&amp;action=SHOWTOPICS" rel="nofollow">http://www.hpb.gov.sg/hpb2/qna/hpb_faqmain.asp?strItemChoice=200511803814&amp;strSubItemChoice=20052151749&amp;action=SHOWTOPICS</a><br><br>More info, please visit <a href="http://www.hpb.gov.sg" rel="nofollow">www.hpb.gov.sg</a></div>
