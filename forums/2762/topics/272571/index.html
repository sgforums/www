ItÂ’s used here to break up the monotony of traditional workouts,Â” he told Reuters.<br><br>He estimates that one session of Wii boxing, tennis or bowling equates to going for a brisk walk and can burn between 75 to 125 calories.<br><br>Â“All of our clients get great results, but the biggest result we see is the smile on their faces. People have to understand that fun is important,Â” said Mellalieu.<br><br>Improving fitness<br>Clients at the health club are encouraged to use the Wii as part of circuit training, warm-up or cool-down, with the system set up in a 400 square-foot theater room with a large projection screen.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s pleasing to see people play video games who would have never played video games before,Â” Farjad Iravani, marketing manager for Nintendo Canada, told Reuters.<br><br>Since the Wii was released late last year, various studies have highlighted its ability to improve fitness and even lead to weight loss by getting armchair athletes moving.<br><br>A study conducted by researchers at the Liverpool John Moores University in England found that regular use of the console could burn up to 1,830 calories a per week Â— the equivalent of  almost four Big Macs.<br><br>Nintendo is also currently developing Wii Fit, a 2008 video game with an array of activities, from yoga to aerobics.<br><br>Kim Bey, a former Olympic swimmer, was among the first to take a shot at the virtual workout at Studeo 55 when it was first introduced two weeks ago, adding it was an easy learn.<br><br>Â“You get what you put into it and you can make it a pretty difficult workout for yourself. I broke a sweat in the boxing for sure and as far as incorporating it into your workout, itÂ’s like taking a slight break and yet still working out,Â” Bey said in a telephone interview.<br><br><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19936667/" rel="nofollow">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19936667/</a></div>
