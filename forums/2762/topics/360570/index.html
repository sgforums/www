            <div class='col-md body'><p>I have just shed a little under 5kg in about 3 weeks and thought i'll share here on how i managed to do it.<br><br>Trust me when i said i've tried many many ways(that means slimming pills, diets, slimming centers) to lose weight in the past and it seems like this is the first time i've managed to drop those weights. I wanted to lose the weight badly as i was in a desperate need to pass my IPPT so i tried various means, to no avail. That is until my friend recommended me this particular slimming sanctuary which uses acupuncture and a planned diet from a nutritionist.<br><br>I shan't ramble about that particular slimming center as this post is not an ad for them. rather, i'd like to share about the planned diet that the nutritionist told me. <br><br>I was told that when it comes to losing weight perhaps the number one most common misconception is that one must: <strong><em>EAT LESS.EXERCISE MORE.</em></strong><br><br>Now, 'the eat more, exercise less' concept is correct... only when applied with the right mentality. I'll explain what i mean.<br><br>It WILL definitely help you to lose weight, <strong>water retention</strong> weight that is. Which obviously will give you a false sense of losing weight based on the end result. But know that the sudden lost of "weight" is only temporary, and its the most common trick in the book that SOME slimming centres, dietitians, etc etc, used.<br><br>[A little info about water retention: The easiest way to stop water retention is..... TO DRINK MORE WATER. haha ironic but true, since water retention a natural body process of conserving fluid in our body whenever we're dehydrated.]<br><br>So, i have friends saying that they've tried this method that method to shed x amount of kilos, was very satisfied and only to be hugely disappointed when they start piling back those weights <strong>twice as fast</strong>.<br><br>Over the years, due to the luxury indulgence of the variety of food we can choose from, from fast food, to MSG food, etc etc.. and environment we are in, toxins inevitably will build up in our body. What i need to do was to <strong>unclog my system</strong><em>.</em><br><br>There are many ways to do it but what i did was to take supplements(au natural, no less). It speeds up the detox process and i was ready to lose weight asap.<br><br>As for my diet, im sure you have heard of good carbs and bad carbs that you should take note, bread being one of the good carbs, but cut down intake on rice especially. <em>Rice contribute nothing to your nutritional profile except calories</em>. Thus, i merely cut back on [B]bad carbs[/B] and replace with more veges or fruits. Oh, and also i blend a concoction of vegs/fruits juice every once in a while.(i know some ppl hated this kind of juice but it really helps in flushing out toxins and clearing complexion too)<br><br><strong>Exercise regularly</strong>. And i dont meant that you hit the gym everyday and workout 3-4hrs straight. Exercise regularly means routine based. Set yourself achievable target for the workout day. DONT DONT DONT ever slack. this it probably the hardest part to sustain. I know some ppl would go," Ah, im feeling tired today, maybe i'll workout 2x as hard tml.."<br><br>All efforts would be negated and we dont want that. Even spending 1hr of solid, consistent workout in the gym is good enough.<br><br>Maintain this routine, and i could see myself dropping the kilos fast! =))<br><br>If you're really interested in losing weight, you could pm me and i'll explain what i can to you in greater detail.(It too lengthy to explain everything here, i dont want to bore ppl off)<br><br>ps.: those curious about how the acupuncture comes into play for my diet is that it actually helps with that detoxification of the body and 'jump-start' the body's immune system.<br><br>Take care and to all trying to lose that weight...NEVER GIVE UP! =)) and yes, i've gotten silver for ippt. =)</p></div>
