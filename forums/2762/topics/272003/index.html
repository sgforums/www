But the overweight and obese volunteers gained 4 percent to 17 percent less than those of normal weight.<br><br>Differences could be genetic, the researchers said.<br><br>Â“People with overweight and obesity have alterations in skeletal muscle structure and function compared to those who are normal weight that could also contribute to variability in the exercise response,Â” they wrote.<br><br>Supplements no help<br>In a second study in the same journal, Jacob Baty and colleagues at the University of Texas found that carbohydrate and protein supplements prior to and during exercise did not help people exercise more efficiently.<br>But their 34 male volunteers who drank a high-protein, high-carbohydrate supplement did show less muscle damage, BatyÂ’s team reported.<br><br>Â“By consuming a carbohydrate-protein supplement similar to the one used in our study at a similar schedule during exercise, athletes can significantly reduce the amount of muscle damage produced in a given resistance exercise bout,Â” the researchers said.<br><br>That could mean competitive athletes might reduce the time they must rest between workouts, they added.<br><br><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18868005/" rel="nofollow">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18868005/</a></div>
