Initially was about 70kg (that was 1 yr ago when i ORD - quite fit). So now vacation about 3 months i hope to shed some fats and train into leaner and toner bodyframe. <br><br><br>Food i have no issues - i adopted high protein high fibre diet plans and in addtion had been talking hydroxycut tablets. First week has been good and disipline. However question is can i do gym while doing cardio -high and low intensity (during the same day or alternate days)? i heard rumours when you have high fat % in your body, doing gym will make ur body even bigger? or rather i dun do any gym at all and focus all on cardio? <br><br><br>On top of that is there any gym to recommend in singapore - in terms of price ( not those sportshall type)<br><br><br>PLS help! <img class="inlineimg" title="Confused" src="http://www.hardwarezone.com/img/forums/styles/hwz/smilies/confused.gif" border="0" alt=""> </p></div>

              <p>Gym, just go for Clubfitt. It is sufficient. Others are overpriced; you pay a lot for their location, facilities and their classes (yoga, etc etc).</p>
              <p>You should do weight training. Fat loss comes easier with more muscles. However, focus on full body workouts with compound movements</p>

              <p>Hi bryan</p>
              <p>I think i needa clarify something, having high fat % in your body doesn't amount to making your body bigger if you adopt weight training. A lot of people have the misconception that if you're fat you can convert fats to muscles which is ENTIRELY WRONG.</p>
              <p>If you wanna decrease your body weight you should instead adopt a weight and cardio training regime. Studies have shown that doing weight training aids in raising your metabolism and enable the body to burn more fat throughout the day.</p>
              <p>What i suggest you to adopt the training of having 3 days cardio 3 days gym (gym/cardio/gym/cardio/gym/cardio). Try lifting weights that are light and compound excerises that enable you to complete 20 reps for 4 sets and resting for 30secs-1min no more than that. After your gym you may input a 20mins light cardio into a program. During cardio days try doing 2 days cardio for 30-45mins each and 1 day high intensity training using interval training</p>

But if you really want swimming i suggest you to introduce interval training into your swim. Remember to watch your diet after swimming as people tend to over eat after swimming due to thermal events in our body as our body experience cold due to evaporation  we tend to eat to introduce warm into our body thus causing over eating. If you're really hungry you can take a meal after 1hr from the swim.</p></div>
