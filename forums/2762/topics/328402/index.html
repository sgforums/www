              <p>well you can try whey protein.</p>
              <p>if possible, drink it before and after trainings.</p>
              <p>meaning sandwich your trainings in between your shakes. of course you don't drink two bottles but rather drink half before training and the other half after training <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/sad.png" alt="sad.png"></p>
              <p>drinking before you sleep after a hard day of workout helps too <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/sad.png" alt="sad.png"> (not drink than sleep tt is. must wait awhile)</p>
              <p>of course if you want to drink after training is up to you. individual preferences <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/sad.png" alt="sad.png"></p>

Coz when u intake so much protein, your kidney had to work very hard to break them down. have a healty diet, more fruits/vegs and protein based food like milk and eggs, less carbo should do the trick. Not neccessary need protein shake.</p>

              <p><br>Not entirely true. Protein shake is to help u/yr muscles recover fast so they wont ache or that u can train everyday. it does make them grow big or anything. as you know protein shake has steriods, it is best to avoid it when possible.</p>
              <p>the thing about different brands is they have slightly different ingredients, which will determind how many of scoops of powder u put in one shake.</p>

              <p>And protein shakes doesn't really help muscles recover faster; it is just a convenient form of ingesting it. You can get the same results drinking a lot of milk or eating a lot of meat. No protein powder is necessary.</p>

              <p>For a fact, doctors give protein powder/whey powder when for old folks who cannot take in solid food properly. Happen before to my gf's grandma.</p>
              <p>Even the Nestle milk powder I bought today showed whey powder as an ingredient.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So if protein powder (whey powder) contains steroids.... hmmmm....</p>

              <p>1) Which protein powder are you talking about that contains Ma Huang and Yohimbe??? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"><br>Pardon me for being ignorant, but I really dunno any protein powder that contain those.</p>
              <p>2) Ma Huang and Yohimbe are more of stimulants that are used in fat-loss products like Hydroxycut. None of us here advocate taking such fat-loss products at all.</p>

              <p>Ma Huang aka Ephedra is not a steroid,it is a stimulant used for fat loss.</p>
              <p>Anyway,Ma Huang is banned in Singapore.That is why Hydroxycut hardcore is banned by the health authorities.</p>
              <p>I tried finding these two on my ON Whey protein just now,can't seem to find them leh...Can you tell me specifically which protein has these two components?</p>

              <p>Did someone delete my posts?</p>
              <p>I do have an extra tub of whey protein .<br>Can contact me if interested.</p>
              <p>Anyway, Whey protein helps in the recovery phase. True we can get protein from eggs, meat,etc, but whey protein is easier  for the body to absorb. Hence you can even get from from baby's milk powder.</p>
              <p>Of course take everything in moderation. Too much and you will overstrain your kidney.</p>
              <p>What I do is take it before  a work out. Depends on the intensity, I might take 1 more after. That's all. Although on the label it indicates take 1g of protein for 1lb of weight. I think if just for normal exercise, that might be too much (personal view).</p>
              <p>I found with the protein shake, my recovery is faster (muscle don't ache so much) than when I don't take.</p>

              <p>Bulk &amp; Muscle helped me achieve my lifelong dream!”<strong>By Gustavo P.</strong> <br></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“I was skeptical about Herbalife,” says Gustavo P. “But after using Bulk &amp; Muscle just three days, I felt much more strength and much less difficulty lifting weights.” In fact, when he began adding Bulk &amp; Muscle to his fitness routine, Gustavo knew he’d achieve his dream of becoming a bodybuilder.* “With a lot of work and dedication,” Gustavo says, “I sculpted the body I’d wanted for years. And what’s funny these days,” he jokes, “is that even though I’ve maintained this physique for almost three years, many people who see me in magazines still don’t believe that’s really my body–until they meet me in person!”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Here’s How:</strong></p>
              <ul>

              <p>If u wanna take protein, all normal protein shakes in GNC can provide u the protein u need. Of course, you may want to take a look at the nutrition table as diff brand offers different amy of protein per serving.</p>
              <p>GNC is also a branding. If you happen to know any friends who is selling protein shakes, buy from them. They are like at least 30 - 40 bucks cheaper than those selling in GNC.</p>
              <p><br>I assume u r building muscles. My advise is dun take so much. Coz when u intake so much protein, your kidney had to work very hard to break them down. have a healty diet, more fruits/vegs and protein based food like milk and eggs, less carbo should do the trick. Not neccessary need protein shake.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>please do not buy from GNC. they inflate the price by 3 times and give peopple 50% discount which is still expensive.</p>
              <p>for any shakes or supplements you want, you can visit nutrifirst.org. it is singapore's largest online supplement company.</p>
              <p>Whey Protein 5lbs - $65 - 80 servings of 22g protein.</p>
              <p>It is a "no frills" product, meaning it comes in a bag, there is no scoop or fancy design.but it is sure as reliable.</p>
              <p>also for protein intake, the ideal is 1g per pound of bodyweight.</p>
