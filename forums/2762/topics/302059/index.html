            <div class='col-md body'>So much talk about Green Tea, so I shall post something on Oolong tea too<br><br>Oolong tea is sometimes referred to as semi-green tea. Unlike green tea, oolong tea is fermented; however, the fermentation process is stopped before the leaves begin to change color as they do with black tea. As a result of its production process, Oolong tea combines the health benefits that are found in both green and black teas.<br><br>One of the chief health benefits of Oolong tea compared to green and black teas is that it contains polyphenols, which act as antioxidants. Antioxidants help to keep free radicals in check, which have been linked to a host of health problems. There is evidence to suggest that the free radicals are linked to some cancers, signs of aging, and cardiovascular disease.<br><br>What Are the Health Benefits of Oolong Tea?<br>The presence of polyphenols has itself been linked to many health benefits. It has been found to reduce the presence of markers associated with inflammatory diseases, including coronary artery disease. In addition to polyphenol, Oolong tea also contains two other antioxidants. It has more catechin than black teas and more thearubigin than green teas.<br><br><a href="http://www.casteelcoffee.com/health-benefits-of-oolong-tea.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.casteelcoffee.com/health-benefits-of-oolong-tea.html</a><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What is it and where does it come from?<br><br>Oolong tea is a popular family of teas grown in Taiwan and China.<br><br>Oolong teas are partially fermented teas. Oolong blends include: Wu Yi - Da Hong Pao (Big Red Robe), Song Zhong Dan Cong (SONG Species Lone Bush), Feng Huang - Shui Xian (Water Fairy), Yong Chun - Fo Shou (Buddha's Hand) and An Xi - Tie Guan Yin (Iron Guan Yin goddess of mercifulness).<br><br><strong>What does it do and what scientific studies give evidence to support this?</strong><br><br>Oolong teas were first grown by ancient Chinese emperors and were highly valued for their rich flavor and apparent health boosting abilities.<br><br>Long consumed to enhance health, oolong tea is an excellent source of antioxidants, vitamins and minerals. The antioxidants in oolong tea scavenge the body for free radicals - molecules that can damage muscle tissue, hinder immune system function and more - and prevent oxidative stress.<br><br>Oolong tea contains caffeine. Caffeine stimulates the central nervous system and causes fat to be released into the blood stream for use as fuel. Thermogenesis is the process of fat being used for energy, and an increase in body temperature is the result of this process (heat is the waste product of fat being converted into glucose). In this way oolong tea provides energy, sheds excess water, and helps to burn bodyfat. For this reason, it is a common ingredient in over-the-counter nutritional fat-loss supplements.<br><br>Oolong tea can enhance focus because of its caffeine content. Caffeine helps to stimulate the frontal cortex of the brain and this results in intense focus, improved memory function, and enhanced thinking abilities. Persons who supplement with oolong tea report an increased desire to train.<br><br>By causing fat to be burned for fuel, oolong tea can help maintain long-term blood pressure levels.<br><br>Oolong tea may also help maintain healthy glucose utilization and insulin regulation<br><br><a href="http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/oolong.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/oolong.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>What Makes a Tea an Oolong Tea?</strong><br><br>There are 3 main distinct types of tea which can be generally categorized as follows:<br><br>a) Green Tea: is treated or boiled following picking to prevent the leaves from oxidizing and retaining their natural colour.<br><br>b) Black Tea: is left to oxidize following picking, thatÂ’s how it gets their distinctive colour.<br><br>c) Oolong Tea: the raw leaves are sun-wilted and then bruised, which exposes their juices to the air, so the leaves oxidise and start to turn brown like a cut fruit. They are allowed to oxidise only partially, giving them a rich, floral flavour. The tea is then dried fully; locking in the rich flavors that oolong tea is known to offer. OolongÂ’s unique drying process creates a tea that has many metabolic stimulating attributes<br><br>Oolongs range from bright green and slightly fermented to dark-leafed and hearty. The greener varieties are less fermented. Oolong tea therefore comes in a wide range of tastes and aromas from teas very close in taste to green tea to those very close to black tea.<br><br><strong>Health Benefits</strong><br><br>Oolong tea burns over 157% more fat than Green Tea Â– and therefore becoming the most popular teas designed to accelerate weigh loss.<br><br>Drinking two cups of Oolong tea every day not only helps shed stubborn pounds by boosting your metabolism, but also blocks the fattening effects of carbohydrates.<br><br>Wulong tea promotes beauty and health - Oolong tea contains a large quantity of polyphenol which:<br><br>Â• promotes strong, healthy teeth;<br>Â• improves cognitive functioning and mental well-being;<br>Â• preventing eczema, allergies;<br>Â• clarifies your skin, giving it a healthy, radiant glow and<br>Â• strengthens your immune system.<br><br><a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?Oolong-Tea---The-Weight-Loss-Tea&amp;id=358220" rel="nofollow">http://ezinearticles.com/?Oolong-Tea---The-Weight-Loss-Tea&amp;id=358220</a></div>
