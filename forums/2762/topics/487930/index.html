(Visit to casino/TOTO, Hello Kitty toys from McDonalds, Korean Boy band at Airport, Gold certificate/ Land-banking ponzi schemes, tution classes sufficient to make any kid go berserk?)[reference: <a style="color: #005688;" href="http://scene.sg/top10/top-10-things-singaporeans-will-willingly-queue-for/">Top 10 Things Singaporeans Will Willingly Queue For | scene.sg</a>].<br><br>Amongst all this queueing for what is deemed 'ideal',<strong> isn't personal health an important asset too?: both for country and self</strong> (as in the context of medishield-life: Singapore's planned compulsory national health insurance plan whereby those who fail to pay premiums could well find themselves in jail (even after paying up hefty fines)): falling sick early could well raise premiums for all: so shouldn't medishield-life incentivise healthy lifestyles: not least disincentivise smoking/ unhealthy lifestyles/ the avoidance of health check-ups (as is the current situation) so as to keep overall premiums/ health care costs low.<br><br>A simple heart attack risk calculator available at <a style="color: #005688;" href="http://cvdrisk.nhlbi.nih.gov/">10-year CVD Risk Calculator (Risk Assessment Tool for Estimating Your 10-year Risk of Having a Heart Attack)</a> readily proves the point, with a wide age scale (20-99yrs) to allow all to estimate their 10year risk of suffering from a heart attack: for which one could end up unfit for any productive work (that is if one survives the heart attack at all).<br><br>The picts below (in sequence) show the 10yr- heart attack risk tool in raw form, of a fit/healthy 40 yr old and the converse if he were sedentary and obese (plausible measurements used (inspired somewhat by my own IPPT FFI screen results as available on NS.sg portal)).<br><br>6 easily obtained input parameters required (Age, Total-Cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, Smoker status, Systolic Blood Pressure, Presence/absence of hypertensive medication use):<br><img id="vBCodeIMG" src="http://i.imgur.com/FiNIEkY.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br><br>Fit and healthy 40yr old (&gt;150 mins of exercise/week, healthy mediterranean/ paleo-diet, non-smoker etc ):<br><img id="vBCodeIMG" src="http://i.imgur.com/67Yi31D.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br><br>Unfit 40yr old smoker who does zero exercise, hates vegetables and loves beer with deep-fried-fatty-food:<br><img id="vBCodeIMG" src="http://i.imgur.com/seYwXoI.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br><br>The healthy 40yr old has a 10yr heart-attack risk of &lt;1% whilst his unhealthy twin (unwilling to lift his butt/ stop smoking/ eat wisely) has a &gt;30% risk (his result could actually be worse since the max of the scale is '&gt;30%'): aka: a walking time bomb waiting to blow the national healthcare budget, if not medishield-life premiums, right through the roof.<br><br><strong>The best way to promote healthy-living (exercise, healthy diet, non-smoking et. al.) amongst kiasu Singaporeans would thus be to offer Singaporeans who have medical screening results to prove</strong> (e.g. those who go for SAF IPPT FFI after age 35) a discount off medishield life premiums based upon their cardiovascular risk strata: since the scheme is a compulsory one (like a form of NS) and incentivising good health amongst all Singaporeans would be essential to keep premiums across the board low (like giving IPPT awards of up to $500 for IPPT gold). Opting into the premium discount scheme for good screening test results will of course be optional, however, with the risk stratum so divergent (&gt;30x difference in the presented example, premium discounts shouldn't be anything less than truly rewarding). Each Singaporean (of either sex) should be entitled to a free IPPT FFI like screening at the polyclinic annually after age 35: with all subsequent assessments covered as they do in SAF (treadmill/ further assessments): those with special exercise restrictions (knee pain, irregular heart-beat etc) shall be sponsored free counselling by dietitians and physio-therapist so that they too will have good opportunity to perform well in the annual '10yr-heart attack risk score'.<br><br><br>A common sight in Singapore: queues for anything rumoured to be good.<br>Searched Google for 'queue sg', result:<br><img id="vBCodeIMG" src="http://i.imgur.com/XooVhF3.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br><br>Singaporeans queueing for Krispy Kreme Doughnuts (some=overnight even):<br><img id="vBCodeIMG" src="http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/singaporeseen/sites/default/files/public/article/images/featured/2013/10/queuemain.jpg" border="0" alt="">info source: <a style="color: #005688;" href="http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/singaporeseen/this-urban-jungle/singaporeans-queue-overnight-for-krispy-kreme-dougnuts">Singapore Seen | Singaporeans queue overnight for Krispy Kreme dougnuts</a><br><br>PS: <a style="color: #005688;" href="http://scene.sg/top10/top-10-things-singaporeans-will-willingly-queue-for/">Top 10 Things Singaporeans Will Willingly Queue For | scene.sg</a><br><br>Even PM Lee Hsein Loong queued 30 mins for chicken wings at Redhill: <a style="color: #005688;" href="http://www.soshiok.com/content/chicken-wings-even-pm-would-queue">Chicken wings even PM would queue for | The Straits Times SoShiok</a><br><br>Me finds it very sad that despite Medishield-life being even more compulsory than NS (even PRs have no way out), good health isn't one of the top 10 things that Singaporeans feel eager to queue for.<br><br>Maybe the Singapore gahmen is feeling a bit too rich for their own good, maybe the seeds of failure of Medishield-life have already been sown.<br><br>Whatever the case, according to PM Lee HL, fried chicken wings at Red Hill Food Centre sure do taste very good...<br><img id="vBCodeIMG" src="http://www.soshiok.com/sites/default/files/public/styles/article_main_image/public/article/images/featured/pmlee-chicken-yan.jpg" border="0" alt="">[<a style="color: #005688;" href="http://i.imgur.com/u362eyr.jpg">Alt Pict URL</a>]<br><br>Projected Singapore State of Public Health, Year 2020:<br><img id="vBCodeIMG" src="http://img.blesk.cz/img/1/full/699342-img-donna-simpson.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br><img id="vBCodeIMG" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/11/17/article-2508985-1977506F00000578-41_634x424.jpg" border="0" alt="">Source: <a style="color: #005688;" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2508985/Cigarette-smoking-toddler-Aldi-Rizal-quits-habit-hes-addicted-food.html">Cigarette-smoking toddler Aldi Rizal, quits habit but now he's addicted to food | Daily Mail Online</a></div>
