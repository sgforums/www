              <p>nope. GNC products are too expensive. they inflate the prices by 3 times and give you 30% discount, so ultimately you still pay like 200+% of the original price. Obtain your supplements from Nutritionpark or Nutrifirst. They are online supplement stores, much cheaper.</p>
              <p>buy the following products (in terms of importance)</p>
              <p>1) Whey Protein. For long-term growth and maintenance</p>
              <p>2) Creatine. For immense strength and endurance in the gym</p>
              <p>3) Glutamine. For fast recovery after workouts</p>
              <p>4) Nitric Oxide. For the quick burst of strength and pump in the gym.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Forget things like CLA and mass gainers. They don't work as effectively.</p>
              <p>besides the above supplements, you must ensure you have a healthy diet in order to lose weight. Eat boiled stuff, not fried, avoid Oreos, ice-creams etc.</p>
              <p>Ultimately it is the total calories you ingest that determines whether you lose weight.</p>

              <p>just try to follow this routine:</p>
              <p>lift weights 3 times a week. during each time, take the supplements. maybe, you should avoid creatine as it causes short term weight gain due to excess water retention in the muscles.</p>
              <p>do cardio 3 times a week. sprint intervals. this is to help lose fat.</p>

              <p>if you want to lose weight.best way is to start jogging!! everyday jog around 15mins to 30mins. cut down on your diet too.</p>
              <p>its really simple.if your output is more than your intake.you will definately lose weight.</p>
              <p>on top of that, hit the gym every 2 days. usually i workout in the gym for about 2 hours. work out every muscle of your body.=D.esp pecs,wings,chest,arms and thigh.</p>
              <p>and when u start doing weights,do at least 50% of your weight( that is if u can take it ah).then slowly increase the weight after each set(but down the reps too). e.g. im 80kg.i start off bench press with 40kg at 14 reps.then i increase 5kg after each set by minus 2 reps off it.=D.</p>

              <p>don't jog. jogging spoils your knees cos you're pounding your feet on the ground more frequently than sprinting. jogging also burns more muscle than fat. do sprinting. it helps you conserve muscle, burn fat, build power and speed.</p>
              <p>i think you might want to lose weight first then bodybuild. i guarantee you one way to lose weight.</p>
              <p>you don't have to hit the gym for weight lifting or cardio.</p>
              <p>just google Air Alert 3. print out the 15 week schedule and stick to it. if you can manage to finish it, i guarantee you you will lose 15 kg.</p>
              <p>personally for the S-league players, they can make it to week 14. As an ectomorph-mesomorph, I made it to week 7 without creatine and with creatine hit week 11. You should try it. It trains your jumping power and stamina solely. In week 15, you will have to hop like 1000 times without stopping for one set.</p>

              <p>If jogging burns muscle, if you complement that with weight lifting.</p>
              <p>With weight training, you burn fats and gain muscle mass, then you lose it through jogging. Isn't that also a good way albeit less than ideal if you wanna look really really beefed up.</p>

              <p>Because their output is more than input.</p>
              <p>I had lost 15kg through eating lesser and jogging 2.4km everyday before.</p>
              <p>But ideally if you not only want a ectomorph body but a mesomorph body as well, ideally jogging isn't best due to it's muscle burning nature.</p>
              <p>By the way, I did some research on Air Alert 3 and actually tried it just a while back, being someone who regularly does barbell squats and running, it's embarrassing to say but it's taxing on my calves. Seems like a good call to try it, kudos to mrvictor.</p>

              <p>try nutrifirst. for nutritionpark, unless you order above $100, transportation fee is $12 compared to nutrifirst $5.</p>
              <p>if you insist on nutritionpark, try the Promax Protein bars, 20g protein. $2. Cheaper than nutrifirst.</p>
              <p>what supplements you take depend on your body type and what you plan to achieve. maybe you would like to elaborate more for me to give better recommendations. don't always follow your friends, they might be mesomorphs and you might have a different body type.</p>
