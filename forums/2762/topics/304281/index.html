AA=amino acid, the building block of your body/muscles. Dump the supps first (isobolic isn't exactly cheap), get your normal diet down. I was eating 6 meals a day when I started lifting (3 big meals, 3 snacks). Basically how it goes is: breakfast&gt;snack1&gt;pre workout&gt;post workout&gt;snack2&gt;snack3. Timing changes, but that's mainly how it goes. My big meals were breakfast, pre workout and post workout/</div>
