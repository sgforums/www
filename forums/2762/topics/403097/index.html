              </p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>-Why is it not possible to be a MMA fighter?</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'> </span>-Your BMI indicates that you are underweight. So it
              is either you have been overtraining or you have been malnutrition.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>- You need to take some protein supplements; they can help to
              build muscles. Else you can choose to eat lots of eggs and chicken. But do you
              know that Whey proteins are actually just milk power? If you are training
              seriously (really serious), you can take 6 meals a day. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>- There are different weight categories in a fight. You just need
              to go your weight cat. And most fighters are trying to lose their weight so
              that they can go for a lower weight cat. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>- Weights wise, yes you are weak. I can bench 25 kg and squat 50
              kg</span></span> <span><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>each side at 19 years old. I am 173 cm, and 60 kg plus then. So I
              would suggest you to slowly increase the weight. You should be feel that the
              last few reps, you squeezing all your muscles to pull it up and if you feel
              like you can do some more after 10 reps then the weight is too light. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>- Smoking wise. Actually most fighters that I know are heavy
              smoker. So I don’t see the problem in there</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>-Technique wise. You mentioned about MMA , are you training in any
              gym? Like every day or at last 3 times a week?</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>- You should gain speed, size and power. You should increase your resistance
              training weight, mileage (run about 10 km 3 times per week ), eat more and get protein
              supplements(from online nutrition store). </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'> - Martial Wise, you can learn Muay Thai or Boxing for MMA for standing. take down - BJJ, or wrestling. </span></p>

              <p>uhm.. i can't say much about BMI's or bodybuilding, but I can give my 2 cents worth on the martial arts question you asked? LOLs!</p>
              <p>I posted a reply sometime before, somewhere in this forum, so don't mind if I repost it here ok. Everynow and then, there are people who send questions in the mail to ask questions, so this guy, I think he was a reader of the forums and posted this question:</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"I'm looking to train but what is the best martial arts? There seems to be a hype all around and each seems to be the best by what they are saying." Question posted by: KY Ong.</span><br><br>There are different opinions and views. People do different Arts for different reasons.<br><br>In short, Train for what end result you want. What are you training for?<br><br>The modern martial arts are neither bad or wrong, some arts are pure SPORTS with lots of rules, others are there to preserve TRADITIONS and DOCTRINES.<br><br>Most martial arts teach their students to defend against their own styles.<br><br>Example: Judo against Judo<br>TKD against TKD etc<br><br>Boxers are trained to BOX, not fight against street assailants or grapplers. etc You won't see for example, TKD teaching you how to defend against some mystical arts people made up in their mind or to keep up with the times, MMA?<br><br>Though there are many benefits from these arts, most won't really work for real self-defence.<br><br>And often the training leaves them very ill-prepared for a real street confrontation.<br><br>The answer is simple : You must train for what you WANT! Makes sense?<br>If you are looking to train and prepare for real street encounters, ask yourself these questions:<br><br>What are the elements and compositions of a true street or violent confrontations?<br>What would I encounter in a a true street or violent confrontations?<br>Whatever I might be training in, would it address these issues and not just  a group of techniques that might falter?<br><br>Finally:<br><br>Would you go to a 100 meters sprint training to improve your StandChart Marathon? NO WAY!<br><br>But both teaches you to run right? Same as in the DT and SD world. If you wish to improve your chances of surviving or disengaging violent confrontations, you must prepare yourself for THAT eventuality.</p>
              <p>This was what I replied accordingly, do hope it helps in you choosing a martial art that you want.</p>
