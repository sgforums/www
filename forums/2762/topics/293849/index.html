            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Tone up with the ultimate at-home workout.</strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">By the Editors of Prevention</span><br><br>You don't need many tools to strengthen your whole body while torching fat. Trainer Jari Love designed an at home workout where all the moves do double duty Â— so you're saving more than just gym fees. &amp;You're using multiple muscles with each exercise, so you'll work harder and burn more calories in less time,&amp; Love says.<br><br>What to do: If you're a beginner, complete one set of each move and repeat the workout twice a week. More advanced exercisers can do three sets of each move, repeating the work-out three or four times a week, with at least 1 day off between sessions.<br><br><strong>BENT-LEG DEAD-LIFT BAND CURL</strong><br><br>Works back, hamstrings, glutes, and biceps<br><br>Stand on a resistance band with your feet slightly apart, holding the handles with your palms facing forward. Bend your knees slightly, and keeping your back straight, lower the handles toward the floor.<br><br>Squeeze your hamstrings and glutes to pull yourself back up to start. As you rise, curl the handles to your chest. Lower your arms and repeat the sequence 12 times.<br><br><strong>STABILITY BALL LEG LIFT</strong><br><br>Works core, back, glutes, and shoulders<br><br>Place your shins on a ball and walk your hands out until you're in the plank position. Pull your abs tight to keep your body stable.<br><br>Raise your left leg, squeezing your glutes to lift it a few inches above the ball. Release and repeat with your right leg, alternating for 10 reps.<br><br><strong>BRIDGE CHEST PRESS</strong><br><br>Works thighs, chest, and arms<br><br>Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Hold an 8 to 12 pound dumbbell in each hand, keeping the weights directly above your chest with your palms facing away from you. Press your hips off the floor until your torso forms a straight line, and contract your abs to hold yourself still.<br><br>Press the weights straight up above your chest and then lower them, repeating for a set of 12. Lower your hips after each set.<br><br><strong>TRICEPS LEG EXTENSION</strong><br><br>Works triceps, thighs, and core<br><br>Stand with your feet a few inches apart, holding an 8 to 12-pound dumbbell with both hands. Contract your abs, lift the dumbbell overhead, and drop your hands behind your head, keeping your elbows next to your ears.<br><br>Push the dumbbell back up toward the ceiling and simultaneously extend your right leg to the side. Release to start and do 8 reps with each leg.<br><br><strong>UNILATERAL PULSING PUSH-UP</strong><br><br>Works shoulders, chest, and core<br><br>Get into a push-up position, keeping your hands below your shoulders, and pull your abs tight. Lower your body until it's about an inch from the floor and pulse down for three counts.<br><br>Push back to start, and as you rise, cross your left hand over your right. Then move your right hand out to the right and do another push-up, pulsing down again for three counts. When you push up, cross your right hand over your left and repeat to the left. Complete 5 total reps.<br><br><strong>STANDING LUNGE SHOULDER CROSS</strong><br><br>Works legs, glutes, and shoulders<br><br>Hold a 5-pound dumbbell in your right hand and bend your right elbow 90 degrees and raise it so that it's in line with your shoulder, with your palm facing forward.<br><br>Step forward with your left foot as if you're about to lunge. Sink down until your left thigh is parallel to the floor. As you lower into the lunge, bring the dumbbell down and across your body to the outside of your left thigh. Press up with your leg, and raise your arm to start. Do 10 reps before switching sides.<br><br><strong>PLIÃ© SQUAT UPRIGHT ROW</strong><br><br>Works legs, shoulders, and glutes<br><br>Grab a pair of 5 to 8-pound dumbbells and stand with your feet wider than hip-distance apart, your toes turned out about 45 degrees. Squat until your legs reach 90 degrees, keeping your weight on your heels and your knees behind your toes.<br><br>As you return to start, lift the dumbbells to your chest, letting your elbows lead and keeping your palms facing your body. Release your arms and repeat 12 times.<br><br><strong>AB CHOPPER</strong><br><br>Works shoulders and abs<br><br>Lie on your back with your hands clasped straight overhead and knees bent.<br><br>Contract your abs and crunch up, bringing your hands over to the outside of your left thigh. Lower to start and repeat to the right, alternating sides for 30 reps. As you get stronger, grab a 3 to 5-pound dumbbell with both hands, and do 12 reps per weighted set.<br><br><a href="http://health.msn.com/dietfitness/articlepage.aspx?cp-documentid=100177218" rel="nofollow">http://health.msn.com/dietfitness/articlepage.aspx?cp-documentid=100177218</a></div>
