              <p><strong><span style="font-size: large;">20 tips for permanent weight loss<br></span>Permanent weight loss — These 20 ideas can help you keep the pounds off for good.<br><br></strong><em>From MayoClinic.com</em><br><br>Weight maintenance is much like weight loss. The principles are essentially the same: Eat healthy foods, control your portion sizes and exercise regularly. And to keep the pounds off permanently, you need to incorporate the new, healthy behaviors into your routine so that they become a natural part of your daily life.<br><br>Here are 20 ideas to reinforce your healthy lifestyle and to keep you committed to permanent weight loss.<br><br><strong>1. Exercise 30 to 60 minutes each day.</strong> <br>If time is limited, exercise for several brief periods throughout the day — for example, three 10-minute sessions rather than one 30-minute session.<br><br><strong>2. Eat three healthy meals during the day, including a good breakfast.</strong> <br>Skipping meals causes increased hunger and may lead to excessive snacking.<br><br><strong>3. Focus on fruits and vegetables. </strong><br>Top off your morning cereal with sliced strawberries or bananas. Stir berries or peaches in yogurt or cottage cheese. Liven up your sandwiches with vegetables, such as tomato, lettuce, onion, peppers and cucumber.<br><br><strong>4. Weigh yourself regularly.</strong><br>Monitoring your weight can tell you whether your efforts are working and can help you detect small weight gains before they become even larger.<br><br><strong>5. Don't keep comfort foods in the house.</strong><br>If you tend to eat high-fat, high-calorie foods when you're upset or depressed or bored, don't keep them around. Availability of food is one of the strongest factors in determining how much a person eats.<br><br><strong>6. Plan a family activity.</strong><br>Get the family together to go for a bike ride, play disc golf or kick the ball around in the yard.<br><br><strong>7. Eat healthy foods first.</strong><br>Eat foods that are healthy and low in calories first so that when it comes time to enjoy your favorites — sweets or junk food, for example — you won't be so hungry.<br><br><strong>8. Pay attention to portions.</strong><br>Serve meals already dished onto plates instead of placing serving bowls on the table. Take slightly less than what you think you'll eat. You can always have seconds, if really necessary.<br><br><strong>9. Create opportunities to be active.</strong><br>Wash your car at home instead of going to the car wash. Bike or walk to the store. Participate in your kid's activities at the playground or park.<br><br><strong>10. Sit down together for family meals.</strong><br>Avoid eating in front of the television. TV viewing strongly affects how much and what people eat.<br><br><strong>11. See what you eat.</strong><br>Eating directly from a container gives you no sense of how much you're eating. Seeing food on a plate or in a bowl keeps you aware of how much you're eating.<br><br><strong>12. Vary your activities.</strong><br>Regularly change your activity routine to avoid exercise burnout. Walk a couple of days, swim another and go for a bike ride on the weekend. Seek out new activities — karate, ballroom dancing, cross-country skiing, tennis or Pilates.<br><br><strong>13. De-stress your day.</strong><br>Stress can cause you to eat more. Develop strategies that can help you relax when you find yourself becoming stressed. Exercise, deep breathing, muscle relaxation techniques and even a good laugh can ease stress.<br><br><strong>14. Eat at home.</strong><br>People eat more food in restaurants than at home. Limit how often you eat at restaurants. If you do eat out, decide what and how much you're going to eat before you start and have the rest boxed to go.<br><br><strong>15. Plan healthy snacks.</strong><br>The best snacks include fruits, vegetables, whole grains and low-fat dairy products. Fruit smoothies, sliced fresh fruit and yogurt, whole-grain crackers, and carrot and celery sticks with peanut butter are all good choices.<br><br><strong>16. Start your day with a high-fiber breakfast cereal</strong>,<br>such as bran flakes, shredded wheat or oatmeal. Opt for cereals with "bran" or "fiber" in the name. Or add a few tablespoons of unprocessed wheat bran to your favorite cereal.<br><br><strong>17. Walk for 10 minutes over your lunch hour</strong><br>or get up a few minutes earlier in the morning and go for a short walk.<br><br><strong>18. Plan a week's worth of meals at a time.</strong><br>Make a detailed grocery list to eliminate last-minute trips to the grocery store and impulse buys.<br><br><strong>19. Look for a distraction when you're fighting a craving.</strong><br>Call a friend, put on music and dance or exercise, clean the house, pull weeds in your garden, or run an errand. When your mind is occupied with something else, the cravings quickly go away.<br><br><strong>20. Reward yourself.</strong><br>Losing weight and keeping the pounds off is a major accomplishment. Celebrate your success with nonfood rewards, such as new clothes or an outing with friends.</p>

              <p>look at scary/gross pic is no use wan</p>
              <p>i can still eat. lol</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well, some tips</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- It is not advisable to skip meal, esp breakfast.  ALot of pple think that skipping breakfast can help, but in fact, breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and u should not skip.  If u skip, u will overeat more during lunch to replenish for ur breakfast loss. SO end up is the same or even more.  Eat just enough for your breakfast. Dun eat too full. FOr me, breakfast normally is coffee/tea, bread n egg, or fried bee-hoon/noodle, roti prata. It jus some light yet enough to full my stomach.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- Dun eat extra serving. The most common food which pple ask for extra rice is chicken rice. Reason chicken rice is tasty, and normally very tempting to eat more. Restrict urself to just 1 normal serving, and dun ask for extra rice.  If can, avoid chicken rice. Eat lesser.  Eat more Vege in ur diet, it can help.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- Exercise regularly. If u r still schooling, u will have plenty of time to do sports. DUn give yourself crap excuse like no time to do sports. I am working yet i can afford to take out time, few days per week(each time 2-3 hour) for workout/exercise.  Find something u like to do, so u can substain the interest n continue doing it.</p>
              <p>For me during my schooling time, it every night basketball. For now i am working, i go for swimming, made it at least once every week, if got more time, twice, or thrice. Then i got other interest, chinese martial art n lion dance. These activities also help me exercise and sweat.  As long as u exercise and u sweat (as in sweat till ur shirt wet, not just a few drop rolling down ur face!) u should be able to cut down weight in long run, maybe 2-3 month.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- Don't eat supper.  Supper is the killer and u can grow fat very very easily with supper.  Avoid sweet food, and tibits also, as these are also killer. Control urself to 3 meal per day, and u should do fine.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- I dun recommend gym for slimming down, cos u will not slim down, as u will turn ur fats into muscle mass.  If that happen, u have to maintain it and keep on doing. If u dun do, ur muscle gonna turn back into fats. Unless u r determine to be muscular all the way, dun go for gym. And also, gym is the slowest way to slim down. It never a good way a slim down.  The best way n fastest way is to run and sweat, or do any exercise that sweat alot (basketball, soccer, etc.)  If u wan to look muscular, gym is not the only choice.  if u learn martial art, in the traditional way, u can become muscular also. Jus look at all the kungfu star and u will know.  And in my view, martial art is tougher than gym. No offence to body builder, but martial art people have more stamina than body builder, and also their punch/force impact is higher, and are more flexible. For young pple who keen to build up muscular body, it recommended to go for chinese martial art.  (THink not very nice for me to name the old troupe here, if u need info please PM me) <br>Reason, young people if u learn martial art, few years down, u can train up muscular body, and yet not so big n muscular, and it will look natural. Another reason is u go into army later, u will not suffer so much, as i mention, learning martial art u will have stamina also.  So u can endure thru easily compare with other pple.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>-another way, is to wait till u go army.  BMT, confirm is the world best slimming centre. Within 3-4 month, confirm u will slim until u cannot reconginse urself. haha. (i remember i slim like 20 plus KG during my BMT. )</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Enjoy slimming down.</p>
              <p>(if anyone interested in trying Martial art to slim down, u can PM me :P)</p>

              <p>Dude, lifting weights burns up fat. It's not easy at all to become muscular, you need to follow a really strict diet.</p>
              <p>I did alot of cardio + gym to lose 15kg and now I'm at 70kg 179cm. Hell, I even grew 2cm</p>

              <p>Dude, if you look at those endurance runners, they have great stamina but they have hell lot of fats, although if they don't run, they look like they have a well-toned body but wait til you see them run.</p>
              <p>Most importantly is, working compound excercises, try to avoid machines if possible because although you can do more weights with them rather than when you're using barbells and dumbbells, you're only working a small group of muscles.</p>

              <p>Yes it is faster. And you can also sweat a lot even when doing gym.</p>
              <p>Stamina wise, you could even do circuits in the gym. Flexibility wise, should be no problem if you do warm-up and cool-down stretches a lot, in addition to SMFR.</p>
              <p>Martial arts training is also good, I won't deny. But it is not necessary tougher than lifting weights. It's just a different form of training.</p>
              <p>Quite probable you done it wrong. Care to share what you did? Don't tell me you did only bicep curls?</p>

              <p>I scared of doing those deadlifts and bent-over rows sia because my lower back not strong.</p>
              <p>I usually just do chest fly to warm up, bench press, arm curls, military press, t-bar row, squats and usually thats it.</p>
              <p>now I'm just slowly increasing the intensity hopefully I can gain more strength</p>
