Only cardiovascular exercise can lose weight effectively. The reason why soccer and basketball are less effective is because they are not continuous. <span> </span>For weight lost, exercise must go beyond 10mins of continuous running or jogging. After that 10mins rapid weight loss will occur. But you are still losing weight when u does sports but jogging, swimming etc are more effective because its continuous. <span> </span><span> </span></span></span></p></div>

              <p>TS, are you male or female?</p>
              <p>Usually, it's not because thighs muscles that are very big, especially if they didn't go through weight training; it is usually fats that are stored there, just that you can't see them.</p>
              <p>There's no such things as spot reducing. To lose weight the fastest, the best is to do compound exercises such as deadlifts/squats. These exercises utilises the most muscles in your body.</p>
              <p>In layman terms (cuz I also dunno those technical stuff...), when you do resistance training, your muscles fibres are 'damaged' and need to recover. You don't lose fat while in the gym; you burn fats while you 'recover'</p>

It’s all genetics. I’m thin but I do have big thighs when im younger. Well be assured there are some people have slightly bigger legs than people of the same size. That’s very natural. When u start to jog or swim after 10mins ur body goes into a state where it starts to break down muscle fibers and also burn fats. But do keep in mind that the rate of fat lost compare to muscle growth is very much higher. So after a few months into training you can observe that ur losing weight. One example, you compare a marathon runner and a sprinter. The body shape and size are very much diff due to the type of training. Wan to lose weight do cardio =)</span></span></p></div>

              <p>Hmm, my dad is a marathon runner, until now 50+ still can participate in AHM and stuff, so i dunno if i got that genes from him.</p>
              <p>But a sprinter will have slimer thighs then a marathon runner right?</p>
              <p>So let me get this straight, to lose tigh/leg weight, is to do cardio?</p>

A sprinter will naturally have more muscular thighs than a marathon runner. This is due to the nature of the duration. Normally sprints only last no more than 1min. While marathon races will go as long as an hour long enuff to burn fats. As a result a marathon runner will have a slimmer built. Ok.. Exercise that mainly focuses on burning fat on the thighs is to do exercise like cycling. May be outdoors or indoors. Exercise like jogging and swimming are cardio.. they are good for alternative for overall body weight lost.</span></p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Swimming its cardio too=) Its a great way to lose weight... Just ensure each an every cardio session last ard 15 to 20mins.. 3 times a week spread out such tat ur body is able to recover.. I recommend you try tis but its more advance.. I could see ur passion for soccer.. U can try jogging 1st after that continue with ur soccer games.. Start of by treating it like a warm up before ur soccer than gradually input more intensity in ur runs.. Slowly but surely listen to ur budy dun over strain it.</p></div>

              <p>It's different</p>
              <p>Long distance cardio has its advantages and disadvantages, but it is not necessary successful.</p>
              <p>Like what he said, just look at the builds of the different sportsmen. Marathon runners are stick thin, whereas soccer players from the EPL are of a much bigger build. Which one is more ideal to you?</p>
              <p>HIIT not only helps you lose fat fast, but also helps in your soccer game. Afterall, you don't really run continuously in soccer; you sprint in short bursts and spurts; that's what HIIT is about.</p>
              <p>Do google about HIIT.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And since your main activity is soccer, I would suggest some upper body exercises for you. Perhaps parallel bar dips and chin ups as a start. Do a lot a lot of it.</p>

Try alternating cycling and jogging for at least 3mths you will see the results. I must say that Micheal Phelps indeed a successful athlete in swimming. He does lots of swimming and jogging just like any professional swimmers out there. </span></p>

              <p>nothing beats the squat. it can help you to shed the fat and slab on pounds of muscle onto your thighs and make it shapely.</p>
              <p>forget swimming, sprinting or jogging, these are "slow" exercises in the sense that you take a lot of time to see results. squats are so effective because they put your body under the most intense pressure. every part of your body is in tension as you lift that weight. if you can will your mind to go beyond the capacity of your body, you will release more anabolic hormones in your body that fuels muscle growth and fat loss. this is the truly efficient way to shape your thighs.</p>
