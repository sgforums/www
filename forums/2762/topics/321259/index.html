              <p> I was born into a Catholic family 32 years ago, thus I was a Catholic by default.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was never into spirituality till a major accident I had last year, causing me to go through an operation. I started to look for alternative healing with the help of a schoolmate.</p>
              <p>I began reading and attended workshops in US.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> Back home, I attended a Reiki session for my injury by this healer called Tan Hwee San. To be honest I was very sceptical as you can imagine. But being an intuitive person myself, I could feel that she is a very kind soul and has a very compassionate heart, this she deserves credit for the work that she is doing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I would like to share with everyone here, for those who need alternative healing about this particular healer Sharon Tay.</p>
              <p>Weeks back, her workshops in KL were cancelled due to some people writing in and complaining about her Reiki and readings.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>These are found on forums:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lightworks, I am prepared to go all the way. I will be including write ups on Sharon and Lightworks in our latest magazines issues. We will also be sending the data to all our clients who advertise with us. Plus, we will be going to print newletters and brochures to notify our fellow Malaysians. Also, we will mass our clients on our e-mailing lists. <br> <br>I also have close networking ties with someone in Singapore Press Holdings. I will also notify the person in charge. <br> <br>Having seeing the state of my friend in the hospital and having watching the two ladies sharing their plight in tears during the gathering, with the pain in me, I have to do this. The two ladies were very positive after seeing Sharon for readings at Lightworks, hell started only weeks later after taking into advice of Sharon's words. These must be stopped.</p>
              <p>This is another living example! Someone below has her business went downhill after listening to the advice of Sharon Tay! I wonder how many of them are out there sufferring silently. This has to be stopped!</p>

              </p>
              <p>I must admit that all she told me was positive and that I should keep continuing on my track (in regards to my business) but it went down, down, down in the last 6 months. Luckily I jumped off the track she advised  and things seem to fall into place. Have you informed Lightworks?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Regards and thanks for your alert,</p>

              <p>{From Damian Toh:</p>
              <p>I am writing to inform everyone about the healer Sharon Tay, to prevent more harm to people. <br> <br>Sharon Tay is a hoax! I think more likely she is using the dark forces than the angels to help her in her work and healing sessions. Is she a certified Reiki Master? For all the services that she provides, ask her to prove her ability with her certificates. My friend was recommended by a new age shop in KL call Lightworks. He was given a brochure and he came all the way here to Singapore to see her for Reiki. After he left, for two weeks in a row, he fell very sick and was bed-ridden. He went to see a Tibetan master and was told that his two weeks of mishap was due to the healing session conducted by Sharon. <br> <br>We were very upset and we went online to search about her. We found new age forums writing about her. We went to their weekly gathering to hear for ourselves and found out that two ladies who had seen her for readings, suffered as a result of the things that Sharon had said to them. One of them ended up jobless and nearing bankruptcy, the other facing a divorce. Both attributed to the words of Sharon. <br> <br>I think she has to be alerted to all the new age shops not to hire her services. More harm will be done! I will definitely write to the organizer of the yearly Holistic Fair in Singapore.}</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thus, everyone, choose the right and trustworthy person if you need to seek any readings or alternative healing and do not be turn off by a black sheep in this field of healing. I checked out her website which was printed on her brochures, seems like she has changed the site, it is blank now. <a href="http://www.soulmatrixx.com">www.soulmatrixx.com</a></p>
