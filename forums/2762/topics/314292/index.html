              <p>i think running and swimming (of course not 10 or 20 mins) are the best solution to burn fats.</p>
              <p>seems like you have quite a training workload. what do you do during the gym session? does it involve a lot of movement on the knee such as leg press? if there are, you might wanna take a rest  from running and exercise routines that involves the knee substantially.</p>
              <p>also what type surface are you running on? hard pavement? if so, why not try running on track and if that still hurts look for softer ground such as grassfield.</p>
              <p>worst come to worst, if you die die wanna run, get a waist float and do aqua jogging.</p>

              <p>Your training regimen is very similar to mine... except that I run once a week</p>
              <p>there are a few things I can recommend</p>
              <p>1) You could do HIIT instead of running. Do google on it. (Although I'm guilty for not doing it, or very little of it...)</p>
              <p>2) Regarding your knee pain, do check if you have tight glutes or hamstrings. You could also try Self-Myofascial Release (google on it too <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/wink.png" alt="wink.png">) with foams or tennis balls or golf balls, on trigger points on your glutes, hamstrings or IT Band (around the side of your thighs). <br><br>Do more static stretches on all parts of your legs if necessary.</p>
              <p>3) What routines do you do in the gym? Do you do squats or deadlifts? If you squat, do you squat all the way or just half squats?</p>

              <p>if you do excessive running or you are heavy, more likely you are going to suffer cartilage wear on your knees.</p>
              <p>you can try taking Glucosamine supplements from Nature's Farm or GNC, it helps.</p>
              <p>i used to cycle and run alot. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>in the mean time, give your knees a rest, try to climb less stairs.</p>

              <p class="subheading"><em>Cartilage Injuries</em></p>
              <p><em>Most cartilage injuries are due to impact or twisting movements, and are more common in contact sports. Anyone can fall, though, including runners and cyclists. Blows and falls can cause cartilage tears. These can hurt, cause clicking noises, and may make your knee lock on occasions. Cartilage can also become damaged by accumulated repeated wear and tear, says American Running Editorial Board Member Marvin Bloom, M.D.</em></p>
              <p><em>Small tears in a meniscus may heal with rest. Menisci have a variable blood supply, and in some cases healing can take months. Larger tears and complete tears are more difficult. </em></p>
              <p><em>Cartilage injuries need expert care. In many cases, a conservative approach with rest and a change of activity works well. The change may have to be permanent, though. Putting stress on a damaged cartilage can only lead to more problems. </em></p>
              <p><em>If surgery is needed, procedures vary. Some tears can be stitched together and will then heal. Others may need fragments removed. A very badly damaged cartilage may have to be removed completely. Arthroscopic surgery involves small instruments and an optical system inserted in your knee. You’ll usually recover relatively quickly, and begin rehabilitation.</em></p>
              <p><em>The worst part of cartilage injuries is the ogre of arthritis. A damaged meniscus can grind on articular cartilage, and damage it. The surfaces roughen, pieces may break off, and wear and tear accelerates. The whole area becomes inflamed and swollen, and the problem grows. The risk of arthritis seems to be higher after surgery, but perhaps that really reflects the severity of the damage in the first place.</em></p>

              <p>cycling will solve it all. get a good road bike, start small and gradually build up your miliage and voila, your knee pain will be a distant memory.</p>
              <p>i am speaking from experience.</p>
              <p>if you have a rather serious knee problem, see a doc. the forum probably the last place you want to seek advise for a serious knee injury.</p>
