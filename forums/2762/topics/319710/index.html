              <p>Good day to all.</p>
              <p>I'm a 20 yr old male who have some troubles with weight loss. I have been jogging regularly for the past 4 mths and there is no effect on my weight, my guess is that I'm doing things wrong. I would like to know of any effective ways of losing weight in the gym, like high intensive trainings but I do not know how and what it is.</p>
              <p>Diet is also important, given in SG, it's quite hard to find healthy food so I would like to know a fool proof diet which is both healthy and filling so that I will not have the hunger cravings to chew on a burger<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>It would really help me alot as I plan to lose 30kgs in 12 mths.</p>
              <p>Currently I'm at 105kgs and 175cm.</p>
              <p>All help is really appreciated, hope to hear from you peeps soon.</p>
              <p>Thanks~</p>

              <p>gym + hiit = fat loss</p>
              <p>you will see some slight changes in like 4 weeks probably, oh yea, if you're not too strong, build some strength with the machines but quickly advance to do compound weights.</p>
              <p>at least, that's what I did.</p>
              <p>don't be following any kind of dieting, eating right is important. studies have shown that counting calories is STILL the best way to cut weight yea? 3, 500 calories is equivalent of 1lbs.</p>
              <p>drink more water, cut down on soft drinks, fastfood or anything unhealthy. pretty tough but you have to be disciplined.</p>

              <p>hiit is also high intensity interval training. considering 30secs full sprint and 30 secs jog as 1 set, complete about 8 sets. that's enough, trust me</p>

              <p>thanks for the replies.</p>
              <p>i found a work out online, is is feasible?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Warm Up for 5-10 mins.</p>
              <p>Minute 1- jog  for 5  mins at 50% of effort</p>
              <p>Minute 5-sprint for 30 secs, rest for 30 secs</p>
              <p>Minute 6-sprint for 30 secs, rest for 30 secs</p>
              <p>Minute 7-sprint for 30 secs, rest for 30 secs</p>
              <p>Minute 8-sprint for 30 secs, rest for 30 secs</p>
              <p>Minute 9-sprint for 30 secs, rest for 30 secs</p>
              <p>Minute 10-sprint for 30 secs, rest for 30 secs</p>
              <p>Minute 11-sprint for 30 secs, rest for 30 secs</p>
              <p>Minute 12-sprint for 30 secs, rest for 30 secs</p>
              <p>This is so called 1 interval, should do 4-5 intervals per session.</p>
              <p>Another work out is to run up a flight of stairs and walk down 10 times(1 interval) and do to 3 intervals.</p>
              <p>Is it good to do the running ones on 1/3/5 and the stairs ones on 2/4/6 and to rest on sunday?</p>
              <p>What about diet? I understand counting calories is the way to go so i should avoid stuff like fastfood, rice and bread?</p>
              <p>Is eating canned tuna ok? Cos I realise it has quite low fat levels. But everyday eat also will sian one right? How about chicken, besides frying is there good means to cook it? I can't grill btw.</p>
              <p>Thanks for your time, and sorry if I'm asking too many qns</p>

              <p>Usually I don't do warm-up. Just casual stretching but whatever floats your boat. And considering your single 12 minute set as 1 interval, trust me, you won't have the energy to start on the 2nd interval.</p>
              <p>As for running steps, I don't really think it's useful, I tried before and even though I did alot, I didn't feel tired at all. I was skipping steps at a running speed.</p>
              <p>Just do the HIIT, it's simply only 10mins per session and up to 3 sessions per week. As many websites have said, even the forum did, HIIT should take you no more than 10 minutes if you're intense enough.</p>
              <p>As for diet, I avoid fatty food, I think tuna is alright. I don't really watch what I eat, but I skip junk food as much as possible but I have a sweet tooth. I take quite alot of protein like egg, chicken breast, milk. I just eat what I have, be it grilled, bbq, fried or what.</p>
              <p>It's kinda costly to be eating too well as in having a full fish twice a day.</p>
