            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Experts and Enthusiasts,<br><br>I am very overweight now although I have lost almost 18 KG over the last 5 months.<br><br>I am currently going to the GYM 4 times a week. Each time, I spend at least 40 minutes on the bicycle machine. I choose that because I have hardly exercise in the 30 years of my life and when I went to the GYM, the bicycle machine is the only thing I can do consistently without giving up. I dun know why but I can tahan it better than other routines.<br><br>My main objective is of cos to help me lose weight because i have some health conditions like Diabetes and Hypertension, they are under control of cos but I need to lose weight to further reduce my risks of other complications.<br><br>However I read in your FAQS that exercises like cycling machines is not the best way to lose weight? What then can I do at a GYM to lose weight more efficiently assuming that I spend around an hour per session at a GYM.<br><br>Thanks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm not a doctor, and I don't know much about hypertension, and thus I cannot recommend much...<br><br>What I can say is, you could start on some weights training too. Start light, but do the compound exercises (deadlifts, bench press, squats). It would be good to begin on an empty barbell. If you are at a ClubFitt gym, you could always ask any instructor to teach you (for free  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> ). This could be in addition to your cycling (do continue with it). Afterall, more muscles = more calories burned during resting periods <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Regarding diabetes, perhaps it would be beneficial for you to watch your diet, to focus more on low glycemic index food such that there isn't any insulin spike, but rather, a slower and gradual release of carbs into your blood stream. Food with low GI includes oats (instant one I not sure), brown rice, multi-grain bread from Gardenia (they claim low GI), wholemeal bread, etc.<br></div>

Yeah I happen to be at a Clufitt Gym....hmm ya i do see instructors around...maybe i will just ask them when I visit them.....thanks!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Granted that exercise is the best way to lose weight but methinks TS might have to control his diet as well for greater effectiveness.<br><br>Avoid consuming too much carbohydrates &amp; fats.<br><br>Keep to 3 main meals daily only.<br><br>Avoid snacking in between meals.<br><br>TS may want to consider putting all the above into practice simultaneously..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
