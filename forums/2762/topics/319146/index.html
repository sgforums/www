              <p>Okay, I've been taking Protein Whey since January this year, about now, I don't really see anymore difference. I started with 1 scoop after every excercise including HIIT, after that I kinda stopped doing HIIT then now I'm taking 1.5 scoops. To replace HIIT, I'm doing Long distance running and swimming as part of the school triathlon team.</p>
              <p>Now, I don't see much changes in my body but I do see drastic change in my arm and slight changes in my thighs.</p>
              <p>So now I'm going to start a cutting phase, I heard its better to do lesser weights but more reps? so how am I going to apply that concept into my core excercises, especially planks? and would it help with cutting if I reduce my whey intake down to 0.5 scoops?</p>
              <p>Thanks alot!</p>

              <p>You seems to have the idea that whey protein is the miracle one and for all thing for fitness.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let me tell you, it is not.Whey is not steriod man.....it is just a normal supplement for which you just replaced the protein in natural food with.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your main diet is much much more important.So tell us what do you eat everyday on the average.More than likely that is the problem instead of whey</p>

              <p>I'm standing at 1.77 now, weighing at 76kg.. yes i gained.</p>
              <p>my meals aren't fixed, i eat what i get, breakfast are usually junk food like cakes, cream puffs and nestle cereals.</p>
              <p>for lunch, usually i go for the protein food, like tofu, meat, egg, fish.</p>
              <p>dinner is usually some cuisine, eg. korean bbq chicken.</p>
              <p>now i've been counting calories for the past days. i drink HL milk at home in the morning, about 200ml. that's as good as 0.5 scoop of whey. then i go to school and have a proper brunch. after that around 1 or 3, i'll cheat abit on sweets, bread or curry puff etc. dinner is usually chicken rice, breast meat only. skipped the skin.</p>
              <p>think that's about slightly over 2000kcal? before i sleep, i would have about 100ml HL milk.</p>

              <p>too many sets of chess presses. Your workout is too push-dominant; need to balance between pushes and pulls</p>
              <p>cut the flys, increase the barbell squats.</p>
              <p>Also include deadlifts into your routine. Replace lat's pull down with full body chin ups if possible. Add some barbell rows into your workout too.</p>

              <p>You are eating so much junk and you expect to cut.......</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cut away your cakes,cream puffs pasteries or anything that is overly processed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To think that from your other replies,you know of stuff like tabata method HIT and stuff but youer diet/nutrition is way off....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Start by having around 6 smaller meals per day (given the total same amount of food eaten in a day, the body is more efficient in digesting smaller meals and using the energy released, thus effectively upping your metabolism and less fats being stored.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You seems to think that fats are bad and you try to cut away visible fats, but do you even know carbo is worst for you in storing fats?especially the kinda processed carbo you are eating (mainly sugary stuff,white rice,white bread,noodles).Highly processed carbo are digested way faster with the energy released too fast and the body see no immediate use for it,  the causes a rise in insulin which will transport the unused carbo now turned into fats and store them up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And where the hell are your vege?</p>

              <p>You are 76kg and you are doing 10kg bench press, you joking?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But nevermind, maybe you are just very weak for now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But if you want to cut, try to up the intensity of your workout.as in higher weight lower reps, you are not training for endurance,why the hell is the need to go 15 reps, keep it to 9 max. Keep your rest time between sets low too like 30 seconds so your body will really feel the intensity and is able to burn more fats due to body glycogen level (main body fuel) used up fast and have to resort to burning more fats.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cut away the chest fly, they are useless to you at your stage of training.If you can replace your lats pull down with Chin ups</p>

              <p>u might wanna try using a fat burner such as hydroxycut advanced. i have used it twice to cut my fats and the second time i combine it wif MAN vaporize. The first time i used it, I lost about 3kg plus in a month, with my pants size dropping by 1 inch. The second time I used it wif MAN Vaporize, I lost about 8kg and 2.5 inches off my waist in almost 2 months. I had better definition also and my exercise routine and protein intake is more or less like yours.</p>
