              <p><strong>A Beginner's Guide To Losing Fats</strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT"> Where's the Fat?<br> Fat, or adipose tissue, is found in several places in your body.
              Generally, fat is found underneath your skin (subcutaneous fat).
              There's also some on top of each of your kidneys. Other locations
              depend upon whether you are a man or woman: <br> <br> *An adult man tends to carry body fat in his chest, abdomen and buttocks, producing an "apple" shape. <br> <br> *An adult woman tends to carry fat in her breasts, hips, waist and buttocks, creating a "pear" shape. <br> <br> *The difference in fat location comes from the sex hormones estrogen and testosterone. <br> <br> <br> Your body contains two types of fat tissue: <br> <br> White fat - important in energy metabolism, heat insulation and mechanical cushioning. <br> Brown fat - found mostly in newborn babies, between the shoulders; important for thermogenesis (making heat). <br> <br> Fat tissue is made up of fat cells. Fat cells are a unique type of
              cell. You can think of a fat cell as a tiny plastic bag that holds a
              drop of fat: <br> <br> White fat cells are large cells that have very little cytoplasm, only
              15 percent cell volume, a small nucleus and one large fat droplet that
              makes up 85 percent of cell volume. <br> <br> Brown fat cells are somewhat smaller, are loaded with mitochondria and
              are composed of several smaller fat droplets. The mitochondria are able
              to generate heat. Fat cells are formed in the developing fetus during
              the third trimester of pregnancy, and later at the onset of puberty,
              when the sex hormones "kick in." It is during puberty that the
              differences in fat distribution between men and women begin to take
              form. One amazing fact is that fat cells do not multiply after puberty
              -- as your body stores more fat, the number of fat cells remains the
              same. Each fat cell simply gets bigger! In addition to fat tissue, some
              fat is stored in the liver, and an even smaller amount in muscle.</span></p>

              <p><strong>How Fat Enters Your Body</strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT"> When you eat food that
                      contains fat, mostly triglycerides, it goes through your stomach and
                      intestines. In the intestines, the following happens: <br> <br> 1. Large fat droplets get mixed with bile salts from the gall bladder
                      in a process called emulsification. The mixture breaks up the large
                      droplets into several smaller droplets called micelles, increasing the
                      fat's surface area.<br> <br> 2. The pancreas secretes enzymes called lipases that attack the surface
                      of each micelle and break the fats down into their parts, glycerol and
                      fatty acids. <br> <br> 3.These parts get absorbed into the cells lining the intestine. <br> <br> 4. In the intestinal cell, the parts are reassembled into packages of
                      fat molecules (triglycerides) with a protein coating called
                      chylomicrons. The protein coating makes the fat dissolve more easily in
                      water. <br> <br> 5. The chylomicrons are released into the lymphatic system -- they do
                      not go directly into the bloodstream because they are too big to pass
                      through the wall of the capillary. <br> <br> 6. The lymphatic system eventually merges with the veins, at which point the chylomicrons pass into the bloodstream. <br> <br> <br> You might be wondering why fat molecules get broken down into glycerol
                      and fatty acids if they're just going to be rebuilt. This is because
                      fat molecules are too big to easily cross cell membranes. So when
                      passing from the intestine through the intestinal cells into the lymph,
                      or when crossing any cell barrier, the fats must be broken down. But,
                      when fats are being transported in the lymph or blood, it is better to
                      have a few, large fat molecules than many smaller fatty acids, because
                      the larger fats do not "attract" as many excess water molecules by
                      osmosis as many smaller molecules would.</span></p>

              <p><strong>How Fat is Stored in Your Body</strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT"> Chylomicrons do not last long
              in the bloodstream -- only about eight minutes -- because enzymes
              called lipoprotein lipases break the fats into fatty acids. Lipoprotein
              lipases are found in the walls of blood vessels in fat tissue, muscle
              tissue and heart muscle. The activity of lipoprotein lipases depends
              upon the levels of insulin in the body. If insulin is high, then the
              lipases are highly active; if insulin is low, the lipases are inactive.
              <br> <br> The fatty acids are then absorbed from the blood into fat cells, muscle
              cells and liver cells. In these cells, under stimulation by insulin,
              fatty acids are made into fat molecules and stored as fat droplets. <br> <br> It is also possible for fat cells to take up glucose and amino acids,
              which have been absorbed into the bloodstream after a meal, and convert
              those into fat molecules. The conversion of carbohydrates or protein
              into fat is 10 times less efficient than simply storing fat in a fat
              cell, but the body can do it. If you have 100 extra calories in fat
              (about 11 grams) floating in your bloodstream, fat cells can store it
              using only 2.5 calories of energy. On the other hand, if you have 100
              extra calories in glucose (about 25 grams) floating in your
              bloodstream, it takes 23 calories of energy to convert the glucose into
              fat and then store it. Given a choice, a fat cell will grab the fat and
              store it rather than the carbohydrates because fat is so much easier to
              store. <br> <br> It is important to note that as your body stores more fat, the number
              of fat cells remains the same; each fat cell simply gets bigger. <br> <br> Hormones That Act Opposite to Insulin<br> When you are not eating, your body is not absorbing food. If your body
              is not absorbing food, there is little insulin in the blood. However,
              your body is always using energy; and if you're not absorbing food,
              this energy must come from internal stores of complex carbohydrates,
              fats and proteins. Under these conditions, various organs in your body
              secrete hormones: <br> <br> pancreas - glucagon <br> pituitary gland - growth hormone <br> pituitary gland - ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) <br> adrenal gland - epinephrine (adrenaline) <br> thyroid gland - thyroid hormone <br> <br> These hormones act on cells of the liver, muscle and fat tissue, and have the opposite effects of insulin.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>How Your Body Breaks Down Fat</strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT"> When you are not eating, or
              you are exercising, your body must draw on its internal energy stores
              of complex carbohydrates, fats and proteins. Your body's prime source
              of energy is glucose. In fact, some cells in your body, such as brain
              cells, can get energy only from glucose. <br> <br> The first line of defense in maintaining energy is to break down
              carbohydrates, or glycogen, into simple glucose molecules -- this
              process is called glycogenolysis. Next, your body breaks down fats into
              glycerol and fatty acids in the process of lipolysis. The fatty acids
              can then be broken down directly to get energy, or can be used to make
              glucose through a multi-step process called gluconeogenesis. In
              gluconeogenesis, amino acids can also be used to make glucose. <br> <br> In the fat cell, other types of lipases work to break down fats into
              fatty acids and glycerol. These lipases are activated by various
              hormones, such as glucagon, epinephrine and growth hormone. The
              resulting glycerol and fatty acids are released into the blood, and
              travel to the liver through the bloodstream. Once in the liver, the
              glycerol and fatty acids can be either further broken down or used to
              make glucose.</span></p>

              <p><strong>Common FAQs</strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT"><strong>Q. I have been eating
              1500-1800 calories a day, I now understand this is wrong. How much
              should I eat and what results should I expect?</strong><br> <br> A. One of the simpler algorithms to find your cutting calories is to
              multiply your bodyweight by 15 to get an approximation of your
              maintenance calories, then subtract 500 to get your cutting calories.
              So a 200 lb man would have a maintenance calorie level of 3,000
              calories, and can lose weight on 2400-2600 calories a day. If you've
              been under eating (starving) for a prolonged amount of time, you may
              gain weight when you begin to eat more. Don't get discouraged and keep
              eating. Treat your body good, give it fuel to run off of. The only time
              this formula does not work is when you are extremely overweight, in
              which case I would not recommend ever trying to cut on more than 3,000
              calories (and never less than 1800).<br> <br> <strong>Q. Should I just do cardio and cardio only until I lose the weight?</strong><br> <br> A. No. You might lose a lot of weight by doing just cardio, but you
              will be losing muscle in the process. Lifting weights is the only true
              way to transform your bodie's shape. By lifting weight you will retain
              and possibley put on muscle, thereby increasing your metabolism, making
              it easier to burn fat, and improving your physical appearance. Lifting
              weights should be your priority, cardio can come second.<br> <br> <strong>Q. I am 250+ pounds, and am about to spend a zillion dollars on supplements, is this a good plan?</strong><br> <br> A. Absolutely not. You do not need to spend money on
              supplements/thermogenics at this point in time. The only supplements
              recommended to newbies are the following:<br> - Whey Protein for after intense workouts<br> - Multivitamins<br> - Fish Oil (Essential Fatty ascids, this is a general health issue that can help spur fat loss)<br> <br> <br> <strong>Q. So what am I supposed to be eating?</strong><br> <br> A. Wholesome unprocessed foods. Now that you're ready to start losing
              fat the "right way", you are going to make a new dedication to learning
              about nutrition. YOU (not me, nor this post, nor anyone on this message
              board) are going to spend time searching the forums and the internet
              for information on how to eat properly. In general you will be eating
              things like chicken, tuna, brown rice, yams, walnuts, and other tasty
              treats, but the topic of nutrition and food choices is much too large
              to answer in this FAQ.<br> <br> <strong>Q. Cardio fasted in the morning is better?</strong><br> <br> A. I don't know, I don't care, it's been argued to death and no one can
              agree on one answer. The fact that you DO the cardio is much more
              important than WHEN. <br> <br> <strong>Q. I don't have a gym membership, what do I do?</strong><br> <br> A. Get one, it is the most important and rewarding investments you will
              ever make in your life. Scrounge up change, bring back cans to the
              store, or beg on the streets if you have to. Get over your social
              axieties. Go to the gym and lift weights there. They have all of the
              equipment you need. While you're there, see about getting a personal
              trainer for a few sessions. A personal trainer will help you get
              started in the world of weight lifting, they will watch your form and
              give you a basic plan you can start with.<br> <br> <strong>Q. Is it true that I only want to lose 2 pounds a week?</strong><br> <br> A. Absolutely, anything more than that is unhealthy. The only time this
              rule does not apply is when you are very over weight (280+lbs), in
              which case, losing 1% of your total bodyweight per week is completely
              acceptable.<br> <br> <strong>Q. What's a refeed? How do they compare to a cheat?</strong><br> <br> A. A refeed day is one day a week where you eat a surplus of calories.
              This does not mean you get to binge out on pizza, and it does not mean
              you can stuff your face all day long either. What this means is that
              you eat the same foods you normally eat only in a greater quantity.
              This will help keep your muscle full of glycogen, and help keep hormone
              and metabolism levels normal. Cheats are "dirty" refeeds, and include
              things like pizza and icecream. Avoid meals like these at all costs.<br> <br> <strong>Q. My schedule makes it hard to eat 6 meals a day, are protein bars or protein shakes okay?</strong><br> <br> A. No. Protein bars are nothing more than glorified candy, and protein
              shakes by themselves do not constitute as a "meal". I don't care how
              crazy or hard your schedule is, there is a way for you to scarf down a
              3.5oz piece of chicken on organic whole wheat bread in a dark corner
              when no one is looking. You must eat real food. If it tastes like
              chocolate, it's probably not the best thing to be eating. Also please
              mind not to eat too much protein (see the answer about nutrition).<br> <br> <strong>Q. How can I stay motivated?</strong><br> <br> A. There are NUMEROUS ways to help stay motivated. Something that I
              found helpful was keeping a log of my weekly weight in my signature
              here on the forums, between that and posting with other people in
              similar situations, my motivation has stayed on track. Other things you
              may want to try is starting a "weight loss journal" on the board here
              so people can help motivate you and discuss your regimin with you, or
              you can try making a goal sheet. Lifequest did a wonderful job of
              explaining them here.<br> <br> <strong>Q. Now what? Where do I go from here?</strong><br> <br> A. Now you lose the fat. You do it the smart way. Most of all, and I
              can not stress this enough, you will dedicate a few minutes of your
              time each night to studying nutrition, fitness, and fat loss. You will
              become great friends with search engines like <a href="http://www.google.com/">http://www.google.com</a> and you will become acquainted with the searching mechanisms here on the board as well as on the bodybuilding.com supersite.</span></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT"><strong>Q. What should I eat before a workout? What should I eat after a workout?</strong><br> <br> A. Pre and Post workout nutrition are a large topic, have been heavily
              debated, and already have a wealth of resources available. In the very
              least, you want to have some whey protein after your workout, but this
              topic does a much better job explaining <br> <br> <strong>Q: I just got invited to a wedding -- what's the easiest way that I can lose 50 pounds in six weeks?</strong><br> <br> A. You can't. You should have thought of this 6 months in advance, not 6 weeks.<br> <br> <strong>Q: Can I lose fat without lifting weights? I'm afraid that I'll get too big if I do.</strong><br> <br> A. It takes many years of hard work and dedication to get "big". I
              assure you that you would not be able to get "too big" if you TRIED.<br> <br> <strong>Q: I'm 5'11" and 140 pounds, and I can't get rid of this gut. Help!</strong><br> <br> A. Eating healthy, eating more, and lifting weights will correct your
              problem. You do not want to lose weight, you want to gain it. If you
              continue eating a reduced calorie diet your belly will never go away.<br> <br> <strong>Q: I’m impatient and won’t listen I only want to gain muscle and lose fat, what is the best way to do this??</strong><br> <br> A. By dieting and exercising. As a "newbie" weight lifter, you will
              lose fat and gain muscle at the same time for approximately 6 months.
              Consider it your weight lifting honeymoon. After which time, it's
              either one or the other and there is no in between.<br> <br> <strong>Q: My friend eats pizza and deep fried ice-cream all day and doesn’t
              lift and he is 6% bf and huge, why can’t I just do what he does? It
              works for him!!</strong><br> <br> A. Because he has different genetics than you. Some people are just
              "born beautiful". It's okay to hate them, I know I do. It's just
              important that you understand what works for them won't work for you,
              and you are going to have to work a lot harder at it than they do.<br> <br> <strong>Q: Wait?? Eating more=fat loss? I don’t believe you</strong><br> <br> A. If you don't believe it, go look at 90% of anorexic people. They
              have puffy cheeks, terrible skin quality, and a puffy pot belly. I
              don't think that's how you'd like to look, I know I wouldn't.<br> <br> <strong>Q: OMG I cheated this weekend and I’m 5 lbs up on the scale I’m ruined!!!</strong><br> <br> A. Yes, you are ruined. Well, maybe not That five pounds is mostly
              "water weight" which boils down to water retention and more blood from
              the increased food ingestion. But don't kid yourself, part of that
              cheat was converted to fat, just not all five pounds.<br> <br> <strong>Q: I don’t want to drink water because it makes me look bloated</strong><br> <br> A. The more water you drink, the less water your body will retain. The
              best cure for water retention and bloating is to drink more water.<br> <br> <strong>Q: Why should I supplement EFA’s, I don’t want to get fat and fat makes you fat</strong><br> <br> A. Dietary fat does not make you fat. ONLY a surplus of calories can
              make you fat. Fat is actually very healthy and needs to be part of your
              diet.<br> <br> <strong>Q: Why would you want to do 40/40/20 if carbs and fat make you fat, shouldn’t you just eat protein like on atkins?!?!</strong><br> <br> A. Atkins diet involves eating a lot of fat. You should read the book
              he wrote before making wild assumptions. Fat and or carbs do not make
              you fat, only a surplus of calories will make you fat.<br> <br> <strong>Q: All this stuff seems like it’s directed at men, I’m a woman, I
              don’t want to look like olga the war beast, I just want to be slim and
              fit, does all of this apply to me?</strong><br> <br> A. Women do not have the hormones necessary to get big and bulky and
              would not be able to get that way even if they tried. The only
              exception being women who use steroids. All of this advice given on
              this website applies to both men and women.<br> <br> <strong>Q: I was 250lbs 35% bf now I’m 165 20% bf, what happened?? How do I get to 8% body fat?</strong><br> <br> A. Spend time researching nutrition and fitness, and restructure your
              fitness program. If you are in this situation either your diet was
              horrible or your did not lift weights, or both. Fix these things to fix
              the situation.<br> <br> <strong>Q. What about fat-loss supplements? What is this ephedrine/EC stuff and is it safe for me to take? How much should I take?</strong><br> <br> A. You're talking about the very popular EC stack (Ephedrine and
              Caffiene). While for the most part this thermogenic is safe, it can be
              dangerous especially if you have high blood pressure or other heart
              related problems. If you insist on using it, start your dosing very low
              to see how your body reacts. Typical dosing for an EC stack is 25mg
              Ephedrine and 200mg Caffiene with an optional 320mg Aspirin, 3 times a
              day. Some people will take as much as 50mg of Ephedrine in each dose.
              When starting ephedrine, start slowly with just one dose of 12mg per
              day and work your way up. It's important to note that even though you
              will build a tolerance to the jitters/energy it gives, it's fat burning
              effects will still be present.</span></p>
