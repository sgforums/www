              <p><strong>Obesity becoming US civil rights issue for some</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">By Edith Honan</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">NEW YORK (Reuters) - Kate Harding has spent most of her life on one diet or another, losing weight but always gaining it back. Determined to improve her quality of life, she joined a fast-growing group of anti-dieting activists promoting overweight people's civil rights.</span></p>
              <span style="color: #333333;"><img src="http://www.fashionmag.fr/newsletters/images/20090428/20090428_030428.jpg" border="0" alt=""></span>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><br><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Launching an anti-dieting blog called Shapely Prose, Harding and other fat-acceptance advocates online -- calling themselves the fat-o-sphere -- are also educating one another about how to improve overweight people's health.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">She and other bloggers with names like FatChicksRule and Big Liberty say society's "war on obesity" makes overweight people hate their bodies and suffer from low self-esteem.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"Being fat doesn't make me lazy or stupid or morally suspect," said Harding, 34, of Chicago, who also has written a book, "Lessons from the Fat-o-Sphere."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"The message we're promoting is health at every size."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Her blog entries criticise dieting obsessions and ponder coverage of weight issues in the mainstream media.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Since launching her blog, Harding, who says she is 5 foot 2 inches (1.6 metres) tall and about 195 pounds (88 kg), says her body image has improved. But she admits wearing a bathing suit in public "can still throw me for a bit of a loop."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Fat-acceptance advocates are starting to organise to promote anti-bias laws, encourage tolerance in health care and the workplace and help retailers recognise the profit potential of catering to plus-size customers.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"People are just beginning to think about being empowered," said Lynn McAfee, director of medical advocacy at the nonprofit Council on Size and Weight Discrimination.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"The emphasis has just been 'lose weight and everything will be fine,' and it's becoming really clear that people aren't losing weight," she said. "So we want to shift the emphasis to making us as healthy as we can be at whatever weight we are."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Activists say the movement is beginning to amass some victories, from larger seat belts in cars to a decision by the Supreme Court in Canada that obese and disabled people travelling on airplanes can't be forced to buy a second seat.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">The Fox television network is developing a reality show featuring "average looking" people called "More to Love," billed as a "dating show for the rest of us."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">The National Association for the Advancement of Fat Acceptance, a civil rights group formed in 1969, has found new life as fat-acceptance advocates gain force online.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">There are now more than 50 fat-acceptance blogs and more than a dozen books promoting the idea, from Linda Bacon's "Health at Every Size" to Wendy Shanker's "The Fat Girl's Guide to Life." There are even romance novels featuring plus-sized characters with names like "Dangerous Curves Ahead."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">But the dominant view remains that overweight people should be focussed on losing weight.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Some two-thirds of Americans are considered overweight or obese. Cities across the country have declared wars on obesity, calling it a costly public health crisis that increases the risk of heart disease, type two diabetes and certain cancers.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Obesity-related health care cost upward of $100 billion a year, research shows.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #333333;">PERVASIVE DISCRIMINATION</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">There are no U.S. laws prohibiting weight discrimination, and only one state, Michigan, has an anti-weight bias law. Legislatures in Massachusetts and Nevada have taken up size-bias bills, but similar efforts have failed in recent years.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Weight discrimination is pervasive, said Rebecca Puhl, director of research at Yale University's Rudd Centre for Food Policy and Obesity.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">An "obesity wage penalty" -- larger employees getting paid less regardless of job performance -- is widespread, and research shows overweight people are less likely to land a job or be promoted than a non-obese worker, she said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"We do need to fight obesity, but not obese people," said Puhl. "Individuals ... who are discriminated against because of their weight are more likely to engage in unhealthy eating behaviours and avoidance of physical activity."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Anecdotal evidence also suggests overweight people avoid trips to the doctor out of fear of being mocked.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">According to NAAFA, about 70 percent of overweight and obese women have experienced bias from doctors. Others complain of being turned down by health-insurance companies.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Bloggers in the fat-o-sphere track cases of discrimination they say go uncovered in the mainstream media.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Just recently, United Airlines, a unit of UAL Corp, said it will require obese passengers bumped from full flights to purchase two seats on a subsequent flight. That would match the policies of other carriers, including Continental, Delta, JetBlue and Southwest Airlines.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #333333;">SEXY AT ANY SIZE</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Deb Malkin, 39, considers herself a fat-acceptance advocate but leaves the political battles to others.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Instead, in what she describes as a labour of love, Malkin has opened ReDress, a plus-sized vintage clothing boutique in New York's Brooklyn borough.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Housed in an airy 3,000 square-foot (280 square metre) space, ReDress sells frilly dresses, formal gowns and jeans, all in size 14 and up.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">One recent afternoon, shoppers carried armloads of clothing to spacious dressing rooms, while sales assistants compared the comfort of ReDress to the more typical shopping humiliations of plus-sized consumers.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"There's a whole indy fashion world that we don't have access to," said Malkin. "I think women just come in here and are so excited."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Bevin Branlandingham, who considers herself a fat activist, has worked in Malkin's store since it opened in November.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Sorting through lingerie, a frock from the 1960s and a colourful size 22 dress by Calvin Klein, Branlandingham said she likes to help women overcome hatred of their bodies.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Branlandingham, who is partial to dresses with plunging neck lines, says she discourages women from buying so-called goal outfits that are too small and instead pick out things that flatter their figures.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"I feel like my life's mission is to make the world safer for people to love themselves no matter what their differences," she said.</span></p>
