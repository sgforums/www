              <p>An ache after 100m is very normal. All it means is that your muscles are just starting to get warmed up. After all, like you yourself said, you haven't been running in a long, long time.</p>
              <p>Think of a car that has just gotten its ignition switched on - it will splutter loudly at first before it can function properly, right? And if you haven't used it in a long time, it will splutter more, right? The same analogy applies. </p>
              <p>Push yourself slowly and steadily and do not do too much all at one go. The rule of thumb is that you should escalate by no more than 10% of your previous maximum distance per week. In short, if your previous max running distance was 2 km last week, you should run 2.2 km this week.</p>

              <p>urmm... how heavy are u?<br> <br> i am trying to slim down.. and is in the progress to slim down..
                  and i realised that if u are heavy there is a big difference... my
                  first guess was that ur calf too weak or u too heavy..<br> <br> if u are not those obesed type, then did u warm up? warm up is such
                  a impt thing that almost everyone do not do in public... they might
                  think it is uncool, troublesome, or dun feel like it.. but warm up
                  is extremely impt, trust me...<br> <br> if u did warm up.. did ur warm up include stretching?<br> <br> if not.. u are really too weak, no offense but pls build up on
                  urself...<br> <br> during my progress to slim down, of like about 95kg, i can run 4km
                  in half an hour... and it is quite easy... now tho still slimming
                  down, like about 87kg i can run 4km in 18mins.. and i think it is
                  just ur fitness, if not u are too heavy.. u see, 7kg difference can
                  make such a big timing difference in long run... and dun try HIIT
                  training for goodness sake, ppl do that kind of training because
                  jogging is nothing to them anymore... and 4km is very little btw...
                  try to target ur self with 4km in 30 mins first.. later aim for 5
                  km in 35 mins, then next try to run 10 km with no time limit, then
                  finally try 14km... after all that then try harder type of
                  training..<br> <br> anyway... for any jogging or timing or what.. i dun care if u run
                  faster if u stop halfway and run again.. the golden rule for
                  jogging is to NOT STOP no matter ur pace.. even if u are jogging at
                  a pace that is just slightly faster than walking, but u dun stop
                  thats good..</p>

              <p>Im 60kg and have gained 8kg since my last weighting. Was around 48kg when im in sec sch. Overweight only when i was baby. Underweight all the way after that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just finished jogging. Tried 1.2km and took a timing of 7mins. I stopped in the middle because a car suddenly drove out of the carpark. I walked abit but im trying my best to walk lesser and lesser. I wanna try not to walk on fri. My calves dont ache that much until when im ard 1km. But there is a itch feeling between my heel and my toes.</p>
              <p>The past few jogging session i did not stretch much. I stretch more today and did a briskwalk from my house to the place i jog which is approx 3mins walk. I got tired only when im halfway through my running route.</p>
              <p>And yes, i think my calves are not strong enough. Have been doing calves rises since yesterday.</p>

              <p>Uhh..... yes? Because pigging out on fast food without exercising seriously will lead to fat gain? Because all you did was to increase your body fat level from 'low' to 'not so low'? </p>
              <p>I tell you what: go and load your backpack with 8 kg of weights, then go and walk around the whole day with it without taking it off. Heck, go running with it.</p>
              <p>THAT is what you have been doing to your body.</p>

              <p>It's relative. A concrete amount would be more accurate.</p>
              <p>E.g. 10kg might be heavy to someone, but it's light to me. So basically, saying something is heavy or light doesn't give any indication of it's weight at all.</p>
              <p>I have a friend who tells me he eats a lot, but he has no idea why he is still skinny. When I see the amount he eats, it isn't a lot at all.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On top of that, the type of food you eat is important. It's not just about bread or noodles or rice. Being too generic doesn't help at all.</p>

              <p>Example, something less generic than just saying bread for breakfast, rice and noodles for lunch...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My usual weekday meals:</p>
              <p>Breakfast: 1 full plate of economic bee hoon (sometimes fried rice) with 1 serving of cabbage and 1 egg</p>
              <p>Pre lunch (not done today though): 1 protein shake down after a noon workout.</p>
              <p>Lunch: Rice (1 full bowl) with 2 servings of meat and 1 serving of vege.</p>
              <p>Mid day snack: depends. Sometimes 1 serving of papaya, sometimes 1 meat bun, sometimes nothing</p>
              <p>Dinner: Rice (1 full bowl) with lots of vege, and perhaps 2~3 chicken drumsticks/thighs</p>
              <p>Supper: depends on whether workout a lot that day. Might boil 3 eggs to eat.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If I want to summarize, I could say just bee hoon for breakfast, noodles or rice for lunch and dinner, with some supper. I eat normally. ==&gt; how does that sound?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Trying to exercise without eating sufficiently is akin to driving a car without enough petrol in it. Unless you want your body to breakdown, I don't see why you would do that.</p>
