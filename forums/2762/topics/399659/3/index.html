              <p>Dear TS: When you do that, all that is happening is that you are loading useless blubber onto your body. To continue the analogy of the car, instead of pumping the tank with petrol, all you are doing is to fill the boot with useless cargo that weighs you down and makes it inefficient and prone to breakdowns. </p>

              <p>Example, something less generic than just saying bread for
              breakfast, rice and noodles for lunch...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My usual weekday meals:</p>
              <p>Breakfast: 1 full plate of economic bee hoon (sometimes fried
              rice) with 1 serving of cabbage and 1 egg</p>
              <p>Pre lunch (not done today though): 1 protein shake down after a
              noon workout.</p>
              <p>Lunch: Rice (1 full bowl) with 2 servings of meat and 1 serving
              of vege.</p>
              <p>Mid day snack: depends. Sometimes 1 serving of papaya, sometimes
              1 meat bun, sometimes nothing</p>
              <p>Dinner: Rice (1 full bowl) with lots of vege, and perhaps 2~3
              chicken drumsticks/thighs</p>
              <p>Supper: depends on whether workout a lot that day. Might boil 3
              eggs to eat.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If I want to summarize, I could say just bee hoon for breakfast,
              noodles or rice for lunch and dinner, with some supper. I eat
              normally. ==&gt; how does that sound?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Trying to exercise without eating sufficiently is akin to
              driving a car without enough petrol in it. Unless you want your
              body to breakdown, I don't see why you would do that.</p>

              <p>hmmm.</p>
              <p>Most of the time for breakfast is 2 slices of bread. Sometimes 3 plain roti prata. I dont eat before i run though. Only drink water before i head out.</p>
              <p>Lunch is those economical rice..rice + 2 meat + 1 veg. Sometimes when i dun have time will be 2 packets of maggie mee.</p>
              <p>Dont usually eat anything for tea time. But for now im eating 2 curry puffs.</p>
              <p>Dinner is usually 1plate of rice + 2meat + 1fish + 1veg. Or 1 meat +1fish +1veg.</p>
              <p>Seldom eat supper since i rarely sleep late.</p>
              <p>Most of the meat i ate are chicken. Pork depends. Maybe once every 2 days or 3 days.</p>
