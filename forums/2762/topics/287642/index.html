            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Burn Fat: Lift Weights</span></strong> - Muscle determines the speed of your metabolism - the speed of your metabolism depends on how much muscle you have. That's why men burn fat faster than women... They have more muscle.  Women could burn fat faster if they had more muscle.<br><br>Women are scared to lift weights because they will get bigger muscles!! If only this was were the case. Women do not have the hormone levels to build big muscles, however they can replace the muscle tissue lost through years of crazy dieting, irregular eating habits and age.<br><br>Yes everybody is losing muscle, every year; every decade because we are getting older, but only people who let their muscles waste away have slower metabolisms as they get older. Keep your muscles and keep your fat burning machine! The only way to do this is get strong and stay strong.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Toss The Scales</span></strong> - The scales tell you none of the things you need to know about your body and everything you don't. They don't tell you how much fat you have under your skin, they don't tell you how much skin for that matter. The scales can't tell you how much fluid is in your body.<br><br>What your bones weigh and most importantly, how much muscle you have? However, weighing yourself can turn a perfectly good day into a miserable day? Don't let an inanimate, household item determine what kind of day you will have! They are not accurate so throw them away.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Muscle Vs Fat</span></strong> - Muscle weighs two times as much as fat yet takes up half the space.<br><br>Muscle is responsible for burning fat. Muscle is small when compared with fat. Muscle never hangs off your body in unsightly lumps.<br><br>Muscle looks toned, tight, strong and lean. Muscle is tight and hard to the touch and muscle is heavy.  Fat is lumpy and soft and flabby, fat takes up a lot of space, fat hangs off your body.  Fat is also soft to the touch and does not weigh as much as muscle.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Always Eat Breakfast</span></strong> - Research has concluded that having breakfast is important to kick-start the metabolism for the day, the body slows down whilst sleeping and food first thing in the morning actually awakens the body ready for the rest of the day. Also try eating more fibre at this time as it helps the digestive system work more effectively and will help keep the blood sugar levels spread evenly throughout the day.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Don't Cut Back On Calories</span></strong> - Food has a heating effect on the body increasing your metabolic rate; don't eat less than 1200 calories, as this will throw the body into a starvation mode. Your metabolism will then slow down to conserve the calories that you do have. Try to avoid fad diets if possible as they restrict or reduce the nutrients flowing to the body, which in turn slows down the metabolic rate.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Eat Small Regular Meals</span></strong> - Eat five or six small meals a day as this will trick the body into thinking that there is an abundance of food and will stop your metabolism from slowing down, keeping your sugar levels at a normal level and this will stop you overeating. Try eating the majority of your food earlier in the day, as the majority of the calories will be burned up while you are awake and active.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Count Calories</span></strong> - The way to keep track of weight loss is to buy a calorie counter and record your daily calorie intake for a week. Average out your calories for the day and then decrease the calories by 300 - 500 (No More) then gauge what happens.<br><br>By decreasing the amount of calories per day to this amount you should start losing weight. Don't go any lower; check the mirror as well as the scales to judge your progress.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Don't Repeat Diet</span></strong> - Research shows repeated dieting actually makes it harder to lose weight and easier to put it on because when you dump the diet and return to normal eating habits the drop in metabolic rate caused by the diet means that your old habits actually represent an excess in calories.<br><br>Not only do you regain the fat stores just lost, but also you may even gain an extra bit.  If you find your weight loss starting to slow or stop over a period of time, increase your walking pace a little or throw in a couple of hills along your route.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Keep Track Of Fats</span></strong> - This may appear difficult to maintain and calculate but it isn't. On nearly all packaged food these days there is a nutritional label with a fat indicator per 100gms of that particular food. What your looking for here is a figure below 10 gms and nearing 5 gms would be the ideal. So purchasing and consuming foods around this range you'll be on your weight loss target.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">The Low down On Fats</span></strong> - It is stored in the fat cells of the body. The number of fat cells is estimated to be around 50 billion for the average person. It can be up to 100 billion for the obese person. Fat cells are like storage tanks of energy to be used for later use. It has been shown that obese people who binge eat may stimulate baby fat cells to sprout to increase the number of fat cells.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Additional Tips:</span></strong><br><br><strong>1) Cut back (Cut your intake of food to Â¾ of your normal serving size)</strong><br>Slowly reduce your intake of food. The more food you consume, the harder it is to lose those fats. For starters, just reduce your normal serving by one quarter.<br><br><strong>2) Stay Away From Fast Food</strong><br>The amount of flour and oil used to make these foods is enough to turn anyone off from taking them. These are high calorie foods that should be avoided at all costs.<br><br><strong>3) Increase Your Activity Level (Burn off unnecessary fats!)</strong><br>Exercising is the best way to lose weight. The more you exercise, the more calories you burn.<br><br><strong>4) Only eat when you are hungry. (Mouth itch is not allowed)</strong><br>The lower the intake of food is, the better it is. Remember everything you put into yourself is additional calories.<br><br><strong>5) Set a goal (As the saying goes "If you fail to plan, you plan to fail")</strong><br>Setting a realistic goal is very important, it gives you the motivation to go the extra mile. Use a food and training journal to keep track of your progress. It allows you to set targets and keep track of your weight and food intake as well as exercise routines.<br><br><strong>6) No Soda (Loaded with calories, don't be fooled by diet soda either)</strong><br>Soda or even Diet soda is loaded with calories. A lot of sugar is added to give you the sweet taste.<br><br><strong>7) Drink Water (When? Once an hour. Why? Good for your body and complexion)</strong><br>Water removes the impurities in your digestive system hence unwanted residues can be cleared easily. Drinking water before meals also makes you feel "full" and prevents you from gorging.<br><br><strong><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Limit Alcohol (Ever heard of beer belly? The reason lies with the calories)</strong><br><br>Drink fresh fruit juice instead!<br><br>Does it seem like an uphill task to complete? I won't disagree with you if you think it is. Weight loss is a process and not an instant solution. What you have just read is not a life changing plan, but a step-by-step adjustment to your current lifestyle. There is nothing wrong with drinking some liquor on a happy occasion. Occasional enjoyment is always necessary for our mental well-being. Do not force all these methods on yourself immediately or you will most likely give up within a week. Instead, set a realistic target and carry out everything gradually. Monitor yourself to ensure that you are making good progress.<br><br>Compiled from:<br><a href="http://www.nutritionpark.com/healthfitness/retrieve-Article.np?model.id=15&amp;s=Lose-Weight-Quickly/10-Things-You-Must-Know-About-Fat-Loss" rel="nofollow">http://www.nutritionpark.com/healthfitness/retrieve-Article.np?model.id=15&amp;s=Lose-Weight-Quickly/10-Things-You-Must-Know-About-Fat-Loss</a><br><br><a href="http://www.nutritionpark.com/healthfitness/retrieve-Article.np?model.id=20&amp;s=Lose-Weight-Quickly/Weight-Loss-for-Men" rel="nofollow">http://www.nutritionpark.com/healthfitness/retrieve-Article.np?model.id=20&amp;s=Lose-Weight-Quickly/Weight-Loss-for-Men</a></div>

About 2~3 times a week should be sufficient. You need to rest too!<br><br>Diet wise, make sure no junk food or oily food can le. Normal cai peng is good enough. However, make sure that there's a balance of protein, carbo and fibre.<br><br>Next, the healthiest form of weight loss is around a kg a week. Any more and you will be losing precious muscle, which is not desirable because muscles help you to burn fat. This is the reason why lifting weights is recommended. Your body also burns calories to repair damaged muscle fibres after your training, making you have more calorie burning muscles. This repairing/growing of muscles (during your rest period) is what makes weight training continue to burn fat after you have finished your workout.</div>
