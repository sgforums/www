              <p>I've been taking my IPPT(Reservist) for the 8th times already and the worst killer part is 2.4km run, the rest of the statics station is not a problem to me. Anybody here break my record?</p>
              <p>Felt so demoralized and disappointed that my timing is always 13min and slightly more, I'm on Cat X and my venue is at khatib camp, the track is 6 laps and most of the time after my 2 laps, my throat become very dry and thus this cause me difficulty in breathing, I didn't stop running just do a slow jog. I try to keep up the pace of the man in front of me but I just can't.</p>
              <p>Any tips here of how to pass the 2.4km run? My deadline is on November and I want to pass it quickly so I can enjoy for the rest of the year. I need assistance! Thnx in advance.</p>

              Yes, it's all in the head. 
              One tip, it works for me, not sure if it will for you, try inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth, when you're out of breath just take a deep breath using that method.
              
              And when your mouth get those sticky saliva, spit it out, don't swallow. It will disrupt your breathing!
              
              Try those methods out if you wish to, MIGHT NOT work, but its worth a shot.
              All the best!

              <p>IMMIGRATE!if you have problems with running ippt,singapore is not the place for you as you need to report to camp every week why you didnt take your ippt physiucal fitness test and remedial training as a civilian till age 40 or 45 years old.and your job will also be affected.</p>
              <p>the time spent on training for ippt could be well spent on your own busioness and setting up of your own factory elsewhere and many other things every year .so instead of using time usefully its spent on training u to be an athelete not good for the olympics.that precious time every week,every month every year till age 40 to 45 yrs old could be spent on building your career,factory,own business,own deisgns etc etc.but all u got was tired out every week till age 40-45.</p>

              <p>You cannot expect overnight success unless you train smart. Think..where is your weakness? Is your leg muscles strong enough to take the whole 2.4km? Do you feel muscle strain after running? So you must build up your muscles. Go to the gym and do some leg weights.</p>
              <p>Out of breath? Go train yourself on an exercise bicycle or do aerobics. Kickboxing also helps. Make sure you do breathing exercises.</p>

              <p>run carpark?? even a flat piece of land he also cannot pass, you want him to run carpark, of course down is no problem, guess going up will be a death penalty to him.</p>
              <p>When I went for competition at MacRatchite for gals, I agree that mindset is very important, it all up in the head, but too bad guy got 2 heads, sometime they use the wrong head, I came in third, passed by those Mindef safra gals, cos everyday, I run with my dogs, and when no with my dogs, I just imagine some terrible guys like uncle hitman or that stupood troublemaker or that Siao gu gu with a chopper chasing behind me, and the only solution is to pass that line that I will be safe from their crutches.</p>
              <p>TS should practice spring and stop run, go to the tracks at least 3 times a week, here is the plan which my former trainer, a indian singapore long distance runner taught me.</p>
              <p>1. Do your warm up stretching exercise, is a must (15minutes)</p>
              <p>2.. Do a 2 rounds warm up jog, rest for 5 minutes</p>
              <p>3. Do the sprint run one round as fast as you can, then walk one round</p>
              <p>4. Continue doing it for 10 round</p>
              <p>5. Pack, bath and go home sleep</p>

              <p><br>it has nothing to do with being gay or not. I am feminine gay but i run 3km road everyday. its all up to training. and i agree that u try not to breath through your mouth because i also get dry throat if i do that. close your mouth and breath through your nose in deep gulps of air. and pace your steps with your breathing.</p>
              <p>personally i take large wide steps with deep gulps of air and i dont run too fast so as not to tire my muscles and stamina easily.</p>
              <p>oh yeah looking at handsome barebody hunks do help! try running around the museum and SMU around 3-4pm. woah ho ho!!!</p>

Sorry ah, for being too harsh becoz you provoke me first. Anyway, you challenge me right? I better in breakdancing, perhaps if you think you're better, I'll give you whatever you ask for. :)</p>
