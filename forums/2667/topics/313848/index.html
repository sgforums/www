              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Steps</strong></span></p>
              <ol>
              <li>Take a deep breath. This
                      is your first, most immediate defense against stress. If you can
                      get in the habit of pausing and taking a nice, deep breath every
                      time you feel stress beginning to take hold, you'll have won half
                      the battle just by preventing it from taking over. The other half
                      is won by addressing the causes of your stress.</li>
              <li>Communicate. Whether you talk to a friend or talk to your cat,
                      getting it off your chest will help a lot. If you don't feel like
                      talking about it, write it down. Keep a journal and write down
                      whatever it is that's bothering you. Writing is a therapy of its
                      own.</li>
              <li>Laugh. Rediscover your sense of humor by making fun of your
                      situation. View it from your future self's perspective, telling
                      this story to a bunch of your friends over pizza and soda. Crack
                      some jokes. Do your goofiest impression. Tickle a child that you
                      love. Laughter, whether it's yours or someone else's, is the best
                      medicine--and it's contagious!</li>
              <li>Get fit. Perhaps your
                      health and appearance are stressing you out, but even if they're
                      not an issue, being physically fit can <em>directly</em> help relieve
                      stress, which exists on both a mental and a physical level.
                      Sometimes there's nothing like a long run, an intense yoga session,
                      or a fresh swim after a stressful day to help you feel relaxed and stress-free again.</li>
              <li>Be organized.
                      For the most part, stress arises from feeling overwhelmed. There's
                      just too much to do, and not enough time to do it. Being organized
                      and getting your priorities straight can help you break
                      responsibilities down into manageable pieces and focus on the
                      things that really matter to you, rather than getting caught up in
                      details and creating extra work for yourself--all of which leads to
                      more stress.</li>
              <li>Soothe the senses. Light a scented candle that has a calming
                      fragrance like lavender. Listen to your favorite, most relaxing
                      music or, better yet, go somewhere that you can listen to wind
                      rustle through trees or waves crash on the beach. Enjoy the
                      scenery, whether you're outdoors or viewing an art exhibit. Drink some
                      warm tea or taste--<strong>really</strong> taste--some dark
                      chocolate. Treat yourself by getting a massage or, if you want to
                      be alone, take a
                      bath (bubbles are recommended).</li>
              <li>Do nothing. That's
                      right, folks, do nothing <em>at all</em>. Close the door, open the
                      window, have a seat, and take a little break from life. If your
                      mind is racing, learn to meditate and just let that stress <em>go</em>.</li>
              <li>Do something that you like. Rock out to music, have some fun
                      and dont forget to be yourself.</li>
              <li>Cry.<br></li>
              </ol>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Tips</strong></span></p>
              <ul>
              <li>Be aware of your choices; you <em>always</em> have a choice.</li>
              <li>Learn to say no; you cannot do everything you are asked.</li>
              <li>Learn how to delegate.</li>
              <li>Be thankful. It
                      does wonders for your state of mind.</li>
              <li>If you need to apologize to someone, and it will not make the
                      situation worse, find a way to do so. More importantly, learn to
                      forgive, particularly to forgive yourself. Guilt adds pain to
                      stress.</li>
              <li>Relieving stress in the short term is a good idea, but
                      resolving the underlying <em>causes</em> of stress is even better. If
                      the same issues keep driving you up the wall time and time again,
                      give some serious thought as to how they can be dealt with
                      <strong>permanently</strong>.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Warnings</strong></span></p>
              <ul>
              <li>Be wary of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escapism"><strong>escapism</strong></a>. Do not alleviate stress by doing
                      something that'll only make it worse in the long run (e.g. buying a
                      new pair of expensive shoes when what's stressing you is
                      debt).</li>
              <li>If stress gets really bad and you feel that you cannot cope
                      with it, seek professional help.</li>
