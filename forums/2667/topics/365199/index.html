              <p><em><span style="color: #008000;">Wednesday, June 17, 2009</span></em><span style="color: #008000;"><br><br>People make value judgements about 
              others based on their facial expressions. A new study, carried out be Spanish 
              and Brazilian researchers, shows that – after looking at a face for only 100 
              milliseconds – we can detect expressions of happiness and surprise faster than 
              those of sadness or fear. <br><br>Our brains get a first impression of people's 
              overriding social signals after seeing their faces for only 100 milliseconds 
              (0.1 seconds). Whether this impression is correct, however, is another question. 
              Now an international group of experts has carried out an in-depth study into how 
              we process emotional expressions, looking at the pattern of cerebral asymmetry 
              in the perception of positive and negative facial signals. <br><br>The 
              researchers worked with 80 psychology students (65 women and 15 men) to analyze 
              the differences between their cerebral hemispheres using the "divided visual 
              field" technique, which is based on the anatomical properties of the visual 
              system. <br><br>"What is new about this study is that working in this way 
              ensures that the information is focused on one cerebral hemisphere or the 
              other", J. Antonio Aznar-Casanova, one of the authors of the study and a 
              researcher at the University of Barcelona (UB), tells SINC. <br><br>The results, 
              published in the latest issue of the journal Laterality, show that the right 
              hemisphere performs better in processing emotions. "However, this advantage 
              appears to be more evident when it comes to processing happy and surprised faces 
              than sad or frightened ones", the researcher points out. <br><br>"Positive 
              expressions, or expressions of approach, are perceived more quickly and more 
              precisely than negative, or withdrawal, ones. So happiness and surprise are 
              processed faster than sadness and fear", explains Aznar-Casanova. <br><br></span><strong><span style="color: #008000;">The 
              two faces of the brain</span></strong><span style="color: #008000;"> <br><br>This research study adds to previous ones, 
              which had revealed asymmetries in the way the brain processes emotions, and 
              enriches the international debate in cognitive-emotional neuroscience in terms 
              of how to define the exact way in which human beings process these facial 
              expressions. <br><br>People make deductions from the expressions on people's 
              faces. "These inferences can strongly influence election results or the 
              sentences given in trials, and have been studied before in fields such as 
              criminology and the pseudoscience of physiognomy", the neuroscientist tells 
              SINC. <br><br>Two theories are currently "competing" to explain the pattern of 
              cerebral asymmetry in processing emotions. The older one postulates the 
              dominance of the right hemisphere in the processing of emotions, while the 
              second is based on the approach-withdrawal hypothesis, which holds that the 
              pattern of cerebral asymmetry depends upon the emotion in question, in other 
              words that each hemisphere is better at processing particular emotions (the 
              right, withdrawal, and the left, approach). <br><br>"Today there is scientific 
              evidence in favour of both these theories, but there is a certain consensus in 
              favour of the lateralisation of emotional processing predicted by the 
              approach-withdrawal hypothesis", concludes Aznar-Casanova. <br><br>###
