            <div class='col-md body'>There are two facts that if you accept them you can achieve happiness.<br><br>In fact anyone can be happy Â– Happiness is a choice - you are not born happy, just as you are not born sad.<br><br>You have to decide which you want to be and accepting thee two facts below will help you.<br><br>1. Accept What You Have.<br><br>You may look at someone and want to be as good looking as them, or as rich as them but fact is you may not be and will never be.<br><br>Life is not fair as we all know and in our lives we all encounter situations where we feel we are hard done by.<br><br>The fact is you canÂ’t do anything about it.<br><br>You need to accept what you have and make the best of it.<br><br>It maybe a clichÃ© but there is always someone worse off than you.<br><br>When you think youÂ’re hard done by, think of the millions of people around the world who have a far worse life than you, if you read a paper on any day you will find them.<br><br>From children born with aids into extreme poverty, to people who have illnesses that make us wonder how they cope at all.<br><br>A good example of a person accepting their lot was the actor Christopher Reeve.<br><br>He had it all -wealth, fame, looks and a loving family but suffered horrific injuries in a horse riding accident that, left him paralyzed from the waist down.<br><br>Dip he get depressed?<br><br>Did he simply sit back and say lifeÂ’s not fair?<br><br>No he didnÂ’t - he got on with life, set himself targets and set out to prove that he could walk again and inspire others with his efforts.<br><br>He never achieved his aim, but found a new purpose in life by helping others and trying to achieve his aim and felt gratitude for the love of his family and others around him.<br><br>So when you feel a bit depressed and think lifeÂ’s not fair think of Christopher Reeve and the countless millions of people around the world that remain happy and are in a far worse position than you.<br><br>2. Do things to make you happy<br><br>There are certain things we can all do, with a bit of motivation to make us happy.<br><br>While you have to accept certain things in life others are within your reach and can make you happier.<br><br>Get motivated and think what can I achieve?<br><br>This is different to what you may want to achieve, so be realistic.<br><br>The fact is everyone can do things to make themselves happy if their motivated.<br><br>They may be simple things like, changing your job, taking up a sport, or just simply being good to people around you.<br><br>You may find that a simple change such as seeing good in other people and being nice to others makes a dramatic difference to your life.<br><br>By being nice to others, you will find they are nice to you and this can open up all sorts of opportunities to make your life better.<br><br>In fact loving and being loved, is perhaps one of the simplest ways to achieve happiness.<br><br>Being happy is simple:<br><br>Accept what you have and make the best of it Â– achieving happiness really is that simple.</div>
