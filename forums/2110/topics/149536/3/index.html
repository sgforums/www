A free-kick on the left side of the area was touched to Lampard who powered in a drive that Zitka should have saved comfortably but lost in flight and, rather embarrassingly, leapt past the ball before it rippled the net.<br><br>Anything but fluent, Chelsea kept to the job in hand - with the majestic looking partnership of Essien and Claude Makelele dictating play despite the hardworking but misfiring display of Lampard alongside them.<br><br>The England international was, at least, causing problems from set pieces and he nearly grabbed his second goal with a driven free-kick on the hour mark, only for Zitka to throw himself to his right to tip wide, somewhat theatrically.<br><br>It was another shot from range that very nearly caught Chelsea out for an equaliser soon after, handing the Premiership side a timely reminder that they could not expect an easy ride.<br><br>Vanden Borre's low drive looked comfortable for Cech, but a nasty deflection off Terry took the ball past the goalkeeper and off the face of the post, bouncing to a grateful Chelsea defence.<br><br>The scare signalled the arrival of Shaun Wright-Phillips from the substitutes' bench and he immediately had an impact down the right.<br><br>Didier Drogba's tenacity nearly handed Lampard a second goal two minutes from time, only for the midfielder to be denied by a fine piece of defending from Yves Vanderhaeghe - getting across at the critical juncture.<br><br>Essien could have then capped his fine display with a goal, but fired narrowly wide as the game ticked into injury time.<br><br>So, another good day's work for Chelsea, and you can't help but feel that, when the football starts flowing, this is a side that will be feared by pretty much anybody.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">- credit: Patrick Goss, Sky Sports</span></span></div>
