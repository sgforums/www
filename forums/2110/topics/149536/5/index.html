Even if they were 2 goals up. I doubt very much they could cope with Chelsea's re-structured play in the second half.<br><br>Nobody paid attention to Gudjohnsen. They paid the price.<br><br>They knew that we took out a defender for an attacker but could not find a way to counter it.<br><br>Unlike Chelsea, they were rattled after we equalised.<br><br>Don't get me wrong.

One draw is correct. I was referring to the premiership games. And honestly, there was no way Blackburn was going to be able to beat Chelsea unless they were going to mow the Blues down one by one, like in a match in the not too distant past <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Will give them some credit for the penalty but the second goal was really a gift from Cech  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">   If Friedel hadn't produced some good saves, the scoreline wouldn't have been a mere 4-2  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
