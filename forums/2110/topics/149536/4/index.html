There is always a lot of debate but the reality is in six matches Liverpool have only beaten us once and we know in which circumstances they beat us.<br><br>"But at the same time we know also that in the last three games we couldn't score because they defended really well.<br><br>"We have to give credit to a team that defended well and defended with a lot of aggression.<br><br>''There was not a lot of space to create situations. Then there was the direct play of (Peter) Crouch. Some people like the direct style, some people don't.<br><br>''It is not a question of (what we) like, we have to cope."<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">- credit: Alex Dunn, Sky Sports</span></span></div>

And a bad injury to Wayne Bridge just weeks later meant William Gallas had to play out of position on the left for the remainder of the Championship-winning season.<br><br>Del Horno joined Athletic in 1992 as part of their youth team and went on to make his professional debut on September 9, 2000, in a 2-0 defeat to Deportivo La Coruna.<br><br>He would have to wait until February 16, 2002, to net his first ever goal, scoring the winner in a 2-1 victory over Real Madrid.<br><br>The player came on leaps and bounds throughout 2003/04, and at the start of the 2004/05 season he was called into the senior Spain squad for the first time. He was handed his debut in a 1-1 draw with Scotland in Valencia.<br><br>English fans got their first real glimpse of the defender a couple of months later when Spain played host to Sven Goran Eriksson's men at the Bernabeu - and Del Horno was on target with the only goal of the game in the 10th minute.<br><br>He signed a three-year deal with Chelsea.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">- credit: ESPNsoccernet</span></span></div>

Â“I donÂ’t want to think about Chelsea.Â”<br><br>Pressed for his impressions of the Blues, who had ruthlessly produced their best performance at LiverpoolÂ’s home since Christmas Day 1907, he professed it was impossible to believe the scoreline on his sideÂ’s first 25 minutes today.<br><br>Â“We know that they play with the mistakes of the other teams,Â” he said. Â“They play deep, counter attack, we make mistakes and they score.Â”<br><br>JosÃ© Mourinho, who didnÂ’t attend the post-match conference, was very happy with his teamÂ’s performance and the dominant position in the league, but warned on TV against complacency: Â“We are in front and they have to chase us but they have the quality for that,Â” he said. Â“What is the difference between us and United, Arsenal? Six points, seven points, eight, what is it? ItÂ’s something that gives us permission to make a mistake, but not to sleep on that.Â”<br><br>He will be hoping that his internationals all come home in one piece from the international break, ready for Bolton at home in 13 daysÂ’ time.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">- credit: Rick Glanvill, Official Chelsea FC website</span></span></div>

They deserve total respect for what they have achieved - and if anyone continues to bang on about "boring Chelsea", then they are crazy.<br><br>The old saying when I was at Liverpool was the title was never over until you had the medal in your hand, but it will take a fantastic team embarking on a fantastic run to take the title away from Stamford Bridge and I just don't see that fantastic team out there.<br><br>The warning signs are being posted in very large letters for the rest of the title challengers and if Chelsea still feel they are not getting the credit they deserve, it will only drive them on.<br><br>When I was at Liverpool we never felt we got the respect we deserved. Indeed when three points for a win were introduced, many cynics said it would be the end of us because they regarded us a team that ground out results rather than won games.<br><br>It was a theory that didn't do us any harm when it came to motivation, and I suspect Chelsea feel the same now.<br><br>They were brilliant against Liverpool and showed the resolve of true champions in those crucial moments after Steven Gerrard equalised.<br><br>Most teams, especially with The Kop in full cry, would have had a wobble.<br><br>Chelsea simply kept playing in exactly the same way, almost saying to Liverpool: "OK. You've scored a great goal, but we're still here and we'll score one of our own." </span><br><br><span style="color: red;">Those who prefer to carp go on about Chelsea's money. There is a tinge of jealousy in this.<br><br>Money does not equate to success unless it is used wisely and there is a hunger and desire in the camp.</span><br><br><span style="color: midnightblue;">Huge sums of money do not necessarily mean hard work - in some cases it can mean the opposite.<br><br>But you watch those Chelsea players when the chips are down like places at Anfield and they are burning with desire, hunger and determination.<br><br>They are playing for themselves and their manager - their success is a huge reflection on how good Mourinho is.<br><br>As for being boring, nonsense. They can hit you from all angles.<br><br>They have got pace, width, can go through the middle and can score goals from 25 yards: they have got variety.<br><br>They have got outstanding players all over the pitch and a giant of a leader in John Terry.<br><br>How football fans the length and breadth of the country would love to be bored by that sort of winning football.<br><br>It is this commitment, determination and hunger I admire about them as well as their ability.<br><br>Everyone is entitled to an opinion about Chelsea's style of play. I can only give my own, and my belief is that they have every single attribute you want in a football team.<br><br>For my old club, it was certainly a sobering experience to be on the receiving end of their worst league defeat at Anfield in 36 years.<br><br>And yet I feel they acquitted themselves pretty well over the two games they played against Chelsea.<br><br>The first rule of playing against Chelsea is to make them do something special to score. Liverpool did not do that. The first goal was a giveaway, with Djimi Traore doing what I've seen him do 100 times - letting the ball go past him because he has no right foot in football terms.<br><br>Traore's clearance then strikes Didier Drogba, and I'm afraid Djimi's tackle after that can be best described as a non-event.<br><br>Liverpool have a foundation and have answered questions about their commitment, but the big problem is that they have no pace through the middle of the team.<br><br>Jamie Carragher is a brilliant defender, but he is not lightning quick, while Sami Hyypia has also done great but isn't quick. Peter Crouch has not get the speed to get away from you in attack, so options are limited.<br><br>Chelsea exploited this because they have so much variety and came at Liverpool from all angles.<br><br>You are not sure where the threat is going to come from, so this leads to fear which in turn leads to mistakes.<br><br>Didier Drogba would never make a list of my favourite players, but among all their other qualities, Chelsea know they can knock the ball over the top and he is the big, strong type who will go for it.<br><br>Liverpool were also lacking in width, and even though they have a 6ft 7in striker in Crouch, I don't think he has any decent balls into the box to go for.<br><br>He had a chance against Birmingham, but he was stretching at the far post and that's not the service he needs.<br><br>So while I think Liverpool are improving, aspects of the game certainly need tweaking and they were on the wrong end of a very bad result on Sunday.<br><br>As for Chelsea, they deserve respect and they will certainly get it from me.</span></div>
