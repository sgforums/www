The long-term plan is to be very successful as a club and business, and within a 10-year-period be recognised as one of the top clubs in Europe.<br><br>"If Mr Abramovich left tomorrow, we're secured."<br><br>Kenyon added that he hoped to see a significant reduction in the amount of money spent on big-money transfers by the London club.<br><br>The Blues spent Â£175m on transfer dealings in the 2003-04 season, Abramovich's first campaign at the helm, but that dropped to Â£57m for 2004-05.<br><br>"One of the key aspects of our future business is to spend less on transfers and grow more of our home-grown talent," revealed Kenyon.<br><br>"That's why we recruited Frank Arnesen to what was already a great academy structure."<br><br>Former Tottenham sporting director Arnesen left Spurs in June 2005 to move to Chelsea.<br><br>Meanwhile, Kenyon said the club had an open mind about the possibility of building a new stadium for the club.<br><br>When asked whether Chelsea would still be at Stamford Bridge in a decade, Kenyon said: "I don't think you can say that.<br><br>"The extension to the ground to get the capacity to 42,700 was a major achievement.<br><br>"To get to over 50,000 - which is where we'd like to be - we're working and evaluating on that and, if we can't, then we'll evaluate all the other possibilities.<br><br>"I don't think we're putting a timeframe on it, what we're saying is we've not yet finished evaluating the opportunities at Stamford Bridge."<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">- credit: BBC Sport</span></span></div>
