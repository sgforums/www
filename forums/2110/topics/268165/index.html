            <div class='col-md body'>BBC SPORT<br>Mourinho and Abramovich clear air<br><br>Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has revealed that he and club owner Roman Abramovich held clear-the-air talks at Stamford Bridge last week.<br><br>A rift between the pair overshadowed Chelsea's efforts last season.<br><br>But speaking in Los Angeles, Mourinho said: "It was a long and enjoyable meeting. I was more than delighted. The air is clear and there's no problem."<br><br>Chelsea's tour got off to a good start as new signing Florent Malouda scored in a 2-1 win over Club America.<br><br>Malouda struck a 75th-minute equaliser before setting up skipper John Terry to head in the winner.<br><br>New signings Tal Ben Haim and Steve Sidwell also tasted their first action in a Chelsea shirt but Blues fans will be more pleased to hear news of Mourinho and Abramovich's reconciliation.<br><br>BBC Five Live correspondent Nigel Adderley is in Los Angeles and reported: "A breakdown of communications last season and seemed to suggest Mourinho was on his way out of Chelsea.<br><br>"But their first formal meeting for six months has cleared the air and now the manager is hopeful of staying for another four years at least."<br><br>Mourinho's contract ends in 2010 and he said he would be happy to see it out - and could even stay longer.<br><br>"I am in my fourth season here and if I can carry on five, six, seven, eight years, then I will go on without any problem," he said.<br><br>I want to go back to wingers and play attacking football<br>Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho<br><br>"I have no desire to change and try something different in Italy or Spain. I don't have that desire.<br><br>"I want to stay - and if Chelsea had wanted to make a change, they would have done it by now."<br><br>Looking ahead to the new season, Mourinho sent a warning to midfielder Michael Ballack, saying he is looking to ditch the diamond formation which best suits the German star.<br><br>"I want to go back to wingers and play attacking football," Mourinho explained. "The objective of having players like Robben, Cole, Malouda and Kalou is because we want to give width to our game, to give speed, to give creativity.<br><br>"I don't want to play football with a diamond any more.<br><br>"So I don't think it will be easy for Ballack. But he's a top player, a top personality and I think he's the kind of guy ready to fight for a place."<br><br>Story from BBC SPORT:<br>http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/6899379.stm<br><br>Published: 2007/07/15 06:09:01 GMT<br><br>Â© BBC MMVII<br><br>I just love this report so much!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
