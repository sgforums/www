It might have been, it might not have been. If it was intentional, it was nicely and convincingly done.<br><br>Phil Neville is a naturally right footed player. With his own team fighting for UEFA Cup qualification, he has reason to want his team to do well. You can see he tried to scoop the ball out by swinging the right foot outward. He was trying to use the outside of his right foot. I agree that a left foot might have been better,  but given the quick instance of how things happened, Phil Neville intinctively used his right foot which is natural to him.<br><br>My point is there is very little to prove or confirm that the two goals were intentional blunders were intentional. With Man U creating wave after wave of attack, forcing an error or two was definitely possible.<br><br>I'm sure you have your belief in your conspiracy theories, but I'd like to keep things rationale.</div>
