Left back is a problem for Man City. Even misfiring Shevchenko got into the scoresheet!

The players want to be better and have shown full commitment to positive football and winning - there are no big secrets behind this. "We will enjoy this but we are in the middle of the process and want to continue it. I don''t think we will win many games 6-0. Manchester City are not an easy team to beat but we made it easier.

If you give a team like Chelsea space and time that will happen. It was very bad defending from our side - we have to be much better than that.

Thats was said after the match had ended already... I guess Sven was just trying to find an excuse for the thrashing they got... anyway, were you aware that City had a better goal against compare to chelsea before the match? And they had only let in 1 goal against the 2 best attacking team on the land? Whichever way you want to look at it, both team started on a level score, and i would like to think that chelsea went out to play attacking football rather than they just got lucky or City forgot to defend...<br><br>It really doesn't matter who brought the team together... Cos when a manager takes over, he takes over the whole team... Good or bad players, its up to him to mould them. If you still think Mourinho should be credited for the win then are we also to believe that Ranieri was responsible for Jose first 2 seasons as well?<br><br>Permanent or not, the one difference that i think Grant has brought to chelsea football is... I think they are a little more attacking minded now than when jose was in-charge... They didn't "close shop" after taking the lead. Anyway, i still remember some senior guy from Real Madrid once said put a shi t on a stick and place it at the centre of the pitch thats was how boring jose's football was...<br><br>And i really can't remember their 4-1 win over Liverpool... But now i will remember Grant's 6 - 0 for a long time to come cos it came against Man City... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

It just that they didn't expect Chelsea to attack like that &amp; was caught extremely off-guard.<br><br>Think that of getting caught by yr wife walking into the room where you are screwing another woman to the highest point.  I believe it's the same situation.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>
