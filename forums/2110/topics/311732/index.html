              <p>Seem to me that grant cannot live up to big and crucial matches, points conceded always. 
              When is the last time he won a big match?
              Blame it on the luck or his tactics?
              <br> <br> 3-1 up and still don't know how to contain it, IMO he had been given enough luck but just to throw it away to many times.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>Tottenham 4 Chelsea 4: Chelsea hopes fade as Grant's tactics are exposed in thriller </strong><br><br> By Sam Wallace
              <br> Thursday, 20 March 2008
              <br><br> While Avram Grant fiddled, Chelsea's title ambitions burned. It was,
              quite simply, the most extraordinary game of the season so far - a
              conflagration of eight goals, three Tottenham comebacks and another set
              of bizarre tactical decisions from a Chelsea manager who just cannot
              get it right in the big games.
              <br><br>When the dust had settled after Robbie Keane's brilliant
              88th-minute equaliser, Grant was left to wonder whether this was the
              moment that his club's title ambitions died. Manchester United are five
              points ahead, Chelsea's opportunity to draw level with Arsenal in
              second place has gone. Roman Abramovich cannot grumble about the
              entertainment value but he must take issue at the way Grant’s team are
              blowing their chances of a trophy.
              <br><br>This was the game that had everything. There was a sublime
              performance from Joe Cole, whose two goals made him the outstanding
              performer before Grant's decision to substitute him with Chelsea 4-3
              up. And on the dark side there was an horrendous studs-up challenge
              from Ashley Cole before half-time that could have broke Alan Hutton's
              leg and was met with a terrible decision from Mike Riley who booked
              Cole instead of sending him off.
              <br><br>Against Manchester United, Arsenal, Liverpool and, in the last two
              games against Spurs, Grant has failed to beat the big beasts of English
              football. Juande Ramos picked the same XI that beat Chelsea in last
              month's Carling Cup final and, by the skin of his teeth, has again
              frustrated Grant. At 1-0, 3-1 and 4-3 up his Chelsea team should have
              won this game, yet by the end even Grant's own players seemed baffled
              by his substitutions.
              <br><br>With his team 3-2 in the lead, having led 3-1, the Chelsea manager
              tried to close out the game in Jose Mourinho-fashion by bolstering his
              defence. He sent on the Brazilian defender Alex da Costa as sweeper in
              what seemed like a counter-move to Ramos's decision to bring on Darren
              Bent, a third striker. But on the pitch, Chelsea lost their shape,
              Didier Drogba looked to the bench in despair and Tom Huddlestone
              equalised. The game was in the balance again.
              <br><br>Then, after Joe Cole had seemingly got Grant off the hook with a
              brilliant second goal to put his team 4-3 in the lead, the Chelsea
              manager struck again. Off came Cole this time for Michael Ballack and
              Chelsea were caught cold once again. After a clearance struck Ricardo
              Carvalho's back, Keane hit a 20-yard equaliser past Carlo Cudicini and
              Grant must have felt the cold sweat break out on his forehead. Ramos
              had out-thought him.
              <br><br>Tiny margins for error; huge consequences. The basis of the five
              trophies won by Mourinho was a sure-footedness in pressurised
              situations. It is the hallmark of all great managers and, once again,
              Ramos showed he has that judgement in abundance. Grant seems to lack
              it. The Spurs manager made two substitutions – his key call was Bent
              coming on for Ledley King on 68 minutes – and he got it right.
              <br><br>It was telling that, at 4-4 in the very last moments of the match,
              Grant was lucky that Spurs did not take all three points. The excellent
              Dimitar Berbatov twisted into space and had a clear shot at goal that
              only Cudicini's desperate save stopped. Sunday at Stamford Bridge
              provides Grant with his shot at redemption against Arsenal, but on this
              evidence there is no doubt which team will win if it comes down to the
              manager's decisions.
              <br><br>Take a deep breath and go back to the start. Four minutes into the
              game and Drogba met John Terry's peach of a cross with a downward
              header past Paul Robinson. It was the Ivorian's first Premier League
              goal since 11 September, his first goal in any competition since the
              Carling Cup final.
              <br><br>1-1: on 12 minutes Jonathan Woodgate, who had lost Drogba for the
              first goal, headed home Jermaine Jenas' free-kick for the equaliser.
              2-1 to Chelsea: on 19 minutes Joe Cole's throughball took a touch off
              Drogba before Michael Essien lifted a brilliant chip over Robinson.
              Then it started to get nasty.
              <br><br>Terry's knee caught Berbatov's head as the two tumbled in the
              Chelsea area. Lampard went straight through Jenas and at half-time the
              Spurs man was substituted for Huddlestone. Riley did not even book
              Lampard but his worst decision was to come. Just before half-time,
              Hutton moved in to control a ball by the touchline and from out of the
              frame came Ashley Cole, lunging, stretching and with studs raised. Had
              Hutton's foot been grounded when Cole connected with his leg then the
              injury would have been disastrous. The card was yellow but should have
              been red.
              <br><br>3-1 to Chelsea: on 52 minutes, Joe Cole took the long route around
              Pascal Chimbonda in the right channel before striking a low shot that
              cannoned off Robinson's legs and in. 3-2: six minutes later the
              Tottenham comeback began. Huddlestone's corner found Berbatov who
              flighted a header into the corner. 3-3: on 75 minutes a loose corner
              fell to Huddlestone who drilled in the equaliser.
              <br><br>The finale. 4-3: another goal from Joe Cole who burst through and
              struck the ball into the roof of Robinson's goal on 80 minutes and was
              then substituted. 4-4: Keane's riposte, White Hart Lane in raptures. In
              the 90th minute, Grant sent on Andrei Shevchenko but it was a bit late
              then to be changing a team that had already been pulled apart by its
              own manager.
              <br><br>Goals: Drogba (3) 0-1; Woodgate (12) 1-1; Essien (20) 1-2; J Cole

And please, the matches that Grant won during the acon and injury period, it was all 1-0 and 2-0 which was basically the Jose's team. He didn't change anything.
