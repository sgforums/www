At least that Chelsea fan knows what real soccer is, unlike you. Heck, you probably aren't a real Chelsea fan. Probably just pretending to be one to make Chelsea fans look bad. Well, you're doing a great job of it. Yes, he did feel it was a pity that it was an offside, but he did not feel the referee made a wrong decision. There's a difference.<br><br>For the record, do you know what offside is?<br>(Hint; it's not based on the position of players when Cole is about to shoot)<br><br>Besides, if it really wasn't offside, don't you think Mourinho would have complained about it and berated the referee? Rather odd don't you think? (whatever it is you use to think)<br><br>If you don't know soccer, you shouldn't be shooting your mouth off and proving it. Unless of course you just want to make Chelsea fans look bad.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
