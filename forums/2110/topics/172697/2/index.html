The way he sits in front of a defence controlling the game and protecting his back four is incredible.<br><br>'And I choose Lampard because of his incredible footballing vision. His passing and his shooting from midfield are outstanding.'<br><br>Ronaldinho even elected to have Gudjohnsen and Drogba as partners for Milan's Andrei Shevchenko attack.<br><br>The Brazilian said: 'Shevchenko is very special. His individual class and quality - as well as speed - set him apart and make him the world's most dangerous attacker.<br><br>'After Sheva, it's not so easy to choose, but I would pick Chelsea's pair. Drogba is very powerful and one of the biggest aerial threats around, while Gudjohnsen is a clever striker who makes as many goals as he scores.'<br><br>Ronaldinho chose 12 players, three in each position.<br><br>His European elite squad was:<br><br>Gianluigi Buffon (Juventus), Petr Cech (Chelsea), Dida (AC Milan); Cafu (AC Milan), Paolo Maldini (AC Milan), John Terry (Chelsea); Kaka (AC Milan), Frank Lampard (Chelsea), Claude Makelele (Chelsea); Didier Drogba (Chelsea), Eidur Gudjohnsen (Chelsea), Andriy Shevchenko (AC Milan).<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">- credit: ESPNsoccernet</span></span></div>

I'm very keen about that," he told BBC Radio Five Live.<br><br>"We've got some strong candidates in this country at this moment who are doing a great job in a very difficult league.<br><br>"The Premiership is one of the most difficult and hardest leagues there is in Europe - you could say, arguably, the best.<br><br>"And we've got some good English lads who are doing a great job with their respective clubs in that league."<br><br>Meanwhile, Middlesbrough chairman Steve Gibson has said Boro boss Steve McClaren is too inexperienced to be England manager.<br><br>"Steve has been a football manager for four years and we've had two years in the Uefa Cup. He is not a realistic candidate," he told the Independent on Sunday.<br><br>West Brom boss Bryan Robson, however, says he would be interested.<br><br>"I'd seriously consider it. I feel I have the necessary experience after nine years of management," he told the Daily Star.<br><br>Reading boss Steve Coppell is among those to rule himself out of contention, saying people who had bet on him were wasting their money.<br><br>Bobby Robson urged the FA to appoint someone with plenty of experience, pointing out his 14 years at Ipswich before becoming England boss.<br><br>"Every day I worked with the players. I found youngsters and I had time to develop the players," he said.<br><br>"That's the sort of manager we need. At the same time we need a good name, we need a strong personality and you'll find that combination if you look long enough."<br><br>Meanwhile, Eriksson has said it would be a huge handicap if his successor was not able to speak English.<br><br>Portugal boss Scolari - out of contract after the World Cup - is the only one of the main contenders who does not speak English.<br><br>Eriksson said: "When I went to Portugal in 1982 I couldn't speak any Latin languages and that was a huge handicap.<br><br>"You have to work with an interpreter and the one I had was very good in Swedish and Portuguese but he didn't know anything about football. He didn't know if the ball was square.<br><br>"I used Swedish football terms that he had never heard and I could see the players when he translated looked confused.<br><br>"It's a huge handicap if you don't speak the language in the job and in daily life. You may be out at dinner and you are sitting like a new-born child, you don't understand anything.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">- credit: BBC Sport</span></span></div>
