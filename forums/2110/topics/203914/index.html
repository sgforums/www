            <div class='col-md body'>New signing ... Dutch international defender Khalid Boulahrouz who plays centreback or either fullback positions.<br><br>Check out this quote from The Official Chelsea FC Website:<br><br><span style="color: midnightblue;"><span style="font-style: italic;">JosÃ© Mourinho said after the Man City game: Â“In a short squad and in a country where you can have only 16 players for a match, itÂ’s important to have cover for many positions. So, for example, now I can have Boulahrouz, Ricardo [Carvalho] and John [Terry] - three options for the centre; I can have Paulo [Ferreira] and Boulahrouz - two options for the right side; I can have Boulahrouz and Wayne Bridge - two options for the left side.Â”</span></span><br><br>A signal perhaps that finally Mourinho &amp; Chelsea have had enough of Gallas' whining on about leaving us and plan either to let him go or bench him till his contract ends?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho has paid a glowing tribute to new signing Khalid Boulahrouz and revealed that he would travel with the squad for Wednesday's game at Middlesbrough.<br><br>The Dutch defender joined The Blues from Hamburg on Monday and is now just waiting for international clearance.<br><br>After being handed the number nine shirt at his official unveiling, Mourinho declared that Boulahrouz had all the qualities to succeed at Stamford Bridge.<br><br>"I am really happy for Khalid to be with us because he is the type of person and player I admire," Mourinho said on Sky Sports News.<br><br>"Life was not easy with him, and to be here at 24 years old he had to go through a process where, from a small club in Holland, to another club in Germany, to the national team, and to one of the best clubs in the world at the moment.<br><br>"He did that because of work, because of confidence and because of ambition and because of quality."<br><br>Mourinho also saluted Boulahrouz's work ethic and versatility, claiming that he could be used in several different positions.<br><br>"As you know he is a defender, and we need a defender, but I think he works as more than a defender because he can play in more than one position and in a short squad like Chelsea's that is crucial," he explained.<br><br>"I can say that he is a new central defender, but at the same time he is a new right back and in an emergency he is a new left back.<br><br>"Even in another emergency he can be a new defensive midfield player, so I have a lot of trust.<br><br>"We have been working together for two days, which is nothing, but it is enough to see the character of a player and the way he works, and I am really pleased with that."<br><br>Boulahrouz could be set to make his Premiership debut against Middlesbrough on Wednesday, and Mourinho insisted that he would have no qualms about throwing him in to the action so soon.<br><br>"Today we are waiting for international clearance and that should arrive because everything is solved between the clubs," said the Portuguese tactician.<br><br>"He is travelling with us now to Middlesbrough and I hope he can help us tomorrow to get the result we need.<br><br>"I wish him a very good time with Chelsea and also, in terms of family, a very good time in London.<br><br>"He is coming to a team of champions and I hope by the end of next season you can also say he is a champion."<br><br>Peter Kenyon was also thrilled to tie up the deal for Boulahrouz, and stressed that his arrival was further evidence that Chelsea were building for the future.<br><br>"Our overall philosophy has not changed," he commented. "We were able to take two unbelievable opportunities this summer in terms of (Andrei) Shevchenko and (Michael) Ballack.<br><br>"They will add great experience to what's becoming a fantastic squad. That's been balanced by (Salomon) Kalou, (John Obi) Mikel and (Khalid) Boulahrouz.<br><br>"He (Boulahrouz) has got a great reputation and will fit well in to the Chelsea team and Premiership football.<br><br>"His qualities speak for themselves. He will be a very good addition and I'm looking forward to seeing him soon."<br><br>WTF a defender handed no. 9.. why not 2? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
