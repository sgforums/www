This is not about Avram Grant, this is a matter of principle.<br><br>'We do not have any issue about the rules being tweaked, we are not against that if the move in general is to have better-qualified coaches working in this country.<br><br>'But one thing that disappoints us greatly is when clubs don't check beforehand.<br><br>'If BA employ a pilot they are not going to say afterwards, 'By the way, do you have a pilot's licence?' It's not a bad idea to make sure he has got a licence before you give him the job.<br><br>'It would help if these big corporations spent a bit of time and energy determining these sorts of factors first.'<br><br>Wilkinson said he was still waiting for the Premier League to clarify the position on Grant.<br><br>Former Liverpool manager Gerard Houllier, now technical director of the French football federation, said every coach in France had to have the Pro Licence and that Grant should also have the qualification.<br><br>Houllier said: 'If you do not have a driving licence you cannot drive. If you do not have the certificate to be a doctor you cannot practise.'<br><br>FA director of football development Sir Trevor Brooking supported the idea of all top-flight managers having the Pro Licence and called for all league managers to have a coaching qualification.<br><br>Brooking said: 'The Football League have no mandatory requirements and we would like to see them at some level.'<br><br>- credit: ESPNsoccernet</span></div>
