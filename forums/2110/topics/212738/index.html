"Call me vain, but I produce because there are titles and, in conjunction with them, merchandising in an incomparably superior proportion to what existed before I came here. The seats in the stadium are the most expensive in English football."<br><br>In a wide-ranging interview with Maxima, Mourinho revealed he gives 40 per cent of his image rights to the club.<br><br>"The club receives 40% of everything I do," Mourinho, whose total annual earnings are estimated at ?7.5m. "For clubs to pay me and the players well, they have to generate an income. That's why I and the players who, like me, have publicity contracts, make an enormous contribution so that the club can pay us [what] it does."<br><br>He knows he increased that pressure by saying he was special when he succeeded Claudio Ranieri at Chelsea. "[I think] these 'arrogant' initiatives of mine are risky but, at the same time, they are motivating because they create a state of mind which forces me to want more," he said. </span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">Portsmouth Reserves 0 Chelsea Reserves 5<br>Wednesday, Oct 04, 2006<br><br>Portsmouth fielded an ex-England striker but the story of the game was all about the Chelsea attack following a succession of eye-catching goals, including a hat-trick for Salomon Kalou.<br><br>The 21 year-old summer signing from Feyenoord completed his first 90 minutes since his move but even more importantly, gave a good sight of the quality and pace that marked him out as such a prospect in the Dutch League.<br><br>A supporting act was ably provided by Scott Sinclair who found the net twice himself and was part of a swift front three that  kept Portsmouth on the back foot for most of the game.<br><br>Kalou played in the centre of the attack in a side reshaped by international call-ups, injuries and a loan for captain Jimmy Smith. Phil Younghusband dropped into midfield from his usual attacking slot but still found the first chance of the game falling his way.<br><br>It was a difficult volleying chance on the edge of the area that was skied. That was on 13  minutes. A minute later Hilario in the Chelsea goal was in position to stop a free-kick from Franck SongoÂ’o.<br><br>Only two minutes later, Chelsea went ahead after a Younghusband pass played Kalou in but still with much to do. From an angle on the right, he thundered a low shot into the bottom corner. It was a flash of pure class.<br><br>There was good shout for a Chelsea penalty when Fabio Ferreira outpaced Portsmouth left-back Matthew Hartmann who had a tug at him in the box, ignored by the ref.<br><br>On 25 minutes, there was a harsh lesson for 16 year-old Nana Ofori-Twumasi on his reserve debut but fortunately one without consequences.<br><br>The right-back dived into a tackle on Richard Hughes as the Portsmouth player side-stepped to take a shot. It was a clear penalty but one that Andrew Cole missed. Hilario went left; the former Man United striker hooked the ball the wrong-side of the opposite post.<br><br>Ten minutes before the break it took a smart block from Dean Kiely to prevent Chelsea going two goals ahead. YounghusbandÂ’s strong shot followed a sharp move down the middle taking in a Michael Woods dribble, a Kalou pass and a Ferreira back-flick.<br><br>Two minutes later, Cole went closer for Pompey than he had with his penalty but was left cursing the crossbar after dropping deep, turning and whacking a 20-yard shot against the woodwork. The home side were improving as the break approached.<br><br>The first incident of the second-half was a booking for Joel Ward, the Portsmouth right-back who fouled after being caught for pace for a second time, this time by Sinclair.<br><br>KalouÂ’s second goal on 51 minutes owed a touch of good fortune to a ricochet off the referee but once the Ivorian was in possession, there was no stopping him. After flying past centre-back Greg Lake, he had pace to spare to keep ahead of the rest of defence and slotted the ball past Kiely with an ice-cool head.<br><br>The hat-trick could have been completed just six minutes later when the Pompey defence were tuned into totally different wavelengths. Kalou nipped in, appeared have tricked his way past Kiely but then knocked the ball back into the keeperÂ’s range. A hand went out and the chance was gone.<br><br>Chelsea by now were well on-top with 16 year-old Michael Woods and 17 year-old stand-in captain Jack Cork influential in midfield.<br><br>A feature of the second-half was some wild tacking by the home side as they tried to keep a lid on ChelseaÂ’s nippy play; Hughes, Wilson and SongoÂ’o joining Ward in the book.<br><br>The third goal, scored by Sinclair, didnÂ’t look out of place next to the quality of KalouÂ’s brace. Taking CorkÂ’s ball on the left, he found the gap between two defenders and rifled the ball low past Kiely.<br><br>Slovakian winger Miroslav Stoch came on to make it three 16 year-olds on the pitch and including Kalou and Hilario, five debutants at this level. Harry Worley and Ofori-Twumasi were the others.<br><br>Substitute Liam Bridcutt found Sinclair on the left for another shooting opportunity with 11 minutes to go but on his weaker left-foot, this time he ballooned his shot.<br><br>He made no such mistake on his right-foot five minutes later. Exchanging passes with substitute Simmonds, from almost the same spot as his first goal he finished with power off the inside of the far-post.<br><br>The fifth goal will have kept the Chelsea team debating in the dressing room long after the final whistle. It was Kalou who completed his hat-trick but it could so easily have been Sinclair.<br><br>In a move started by Kalou, Simmonds again played in Sinclair who beat Kiely. With defenders chasing the shot, Kalou did the professional thing and slid the goalbound ball over the line from a couple of inches out.<br><br>The game was played in front of a crowd of 1,304 at Fratton Park. The result bettered the 4-0 home win over Fulham in the opening game of the season and is the best by the second string since a 6-0 home drubbing of Coventry last March.<br><br>Chelsea:<br><br>Hilario; Ofori-Twumasi (Liam Bridcutt 76), Harry Worley, Adrian Pettigrew, Nuno Morais; Phil Younghusband (James Simmonds 79), Jack Cork (capt), Michael Woods; Fabio Ferreira (Miroslav Stoch 79), Salomon Kalou, Scott Sinclair.<br><br>Portsmouth:<br><br>Dean Kiely, Joel Ward, Matthew Hartmann, Noe Pamarot, Greg Lake, Marc Wilson, Franck SongoÂ’o, Richard Hughes, Andrew Cole, Berlin, Ndebe Nlome (Jack Plummer 7<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">, Daryl Fordyce.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;">The Ukraine forward has scored just once for the Blues since the Community Shield, in the 2-1 defeat to Middlesbrough back in August, and so far has looked a shadow of the player who prompted big-spending Chelsea to smash their transfer record when completing a Â£30million-plus deal in the summer.<br><br>De Michelis, described as the 'scientific co-ordinator' of the Milan Lab, insists he is happy to help the striker find his feet in his new environment and told The Sun: "I saw him less than two weeks ago.

He needs time and support, otherwise a player becomes introverted, even scared.<br><br>"If they start to work with fear inside, it becomes a disaster."</span></div>

Sometimes they make bigger purchases, and that stands out - but other teams buy big as well," he pointed out.<br><br>"Real Madrid, Italian teams, German teams - they all buy players. But if you are not successful then you are just a buyer of players.<br><br>"Not Chelsea. You don't just pick any players; you have to pick the right players to fit together and get a good mood in the team.<br><br>"Chelsea is one of those teams that doesn't have big words about success; they are more laid-back and just let the success speak for itself.<br><br>"That's why we are not going to say big things about the Champions League right now." </span></div>
