            <div class='col-md body'>from soccernet<br><br><strong>Mourinho gets hostile reception in Spain</strong><br><br>Jose Mourinho was spat at and subjected to verbal abuse as Chelsea received a hostile welcome in Barcelona as they arrived to prepare for Tuesday's Champions League showdown.<br><br>Former Barca coach Mourinho angered Catalan supporters by accusing Lionel Messi of 'play-acting' in the first leg at Stamford Bridge in order to get Asier del Horno sent off, with Chelsea ultimately losing 2-1.<br><br>The Barcelona fans at the airport jeered and jostled the Blues boss when he arrived from London and spat at him and the team bus.<br><br>Mourinho responded by smiling and applauding sarcastically.<br><br>Chelsea TV cameraman Kieren Startup, filming the scene, told the club's official website: 'There were very few police to marshal it, and they didn't seem interested once the players got on the coach to stop any abuse.<br><br>'It was intimidating, there was a lot of aggressive chanting at Mourinho to begin with, but he ignored it and then they moved on to angry gestures and spitting.<br><br>'Everyone else on the coach seemed to be unbothered.'<br><br>Mourinho's hostile reception in the Catalan city extended to the newspapers.<br><br>One of them used a picture of the Chelsea manager with a headline which read 'Here comes the monster' and another printed his hotel and room number, encouraging fans to give him a call.<br><br>Mourinho, a former Barca coach, said: 'This is more important than the game? To me it means nothing.<br><br>'I come here to play football and what happens outside the pitch is not important. It does not affect me. The only thing that worries me is the game tomorrow.'<br><br>The first leg was won 2-1 by Barcelona but best remembered for a pre-match row about the pitch, Asier del Horno's red card and Mourinho's angry after-match reaction.<br><br>The Chelsea boss branded Barca forward Lionel Messi an actor and claimed referee Terje Hauge had got the red-card decision wrong.<br><br>The match referee is Markus Merk from Germany and Mourinho said: 'Before the game I am always positive . I always believe in fairness and truth. You will never hear me say this referee has come to help the opponents. I never say that.<br><br>'I never worry about who is the referee and linesman and their nationality.<br><br>'I believe the referee can perform well, do his best and create a clean situation for both teams.<br><br>'That's what we want in every game.'<br><br>Messi, Barcelona's star of the first leg, was rested for Saturday's league game against Deportivo La Coruna but will be unleashed on the Blues as the Spanish champions seek revenge on last season, when they were beaten by Chelsea at the same stage of the competition.<br><br>Mourinho said: 'The only way to stop Messi is with 11 players on the field. We must have double marking. With 10 players it is not possible to mark Messi because he will have a lot of space.<br><br>'He dribbles very well and if he has a one-on-one and wins it you always need a second man to avert the danger.'<br><br>Mourinho is without suspended duo Del Horno and Michael Essien but promised his team will give their all to become the first English team to win in Barcelona in the European Cup.<br><br>He said: 'Barcelona have the advantage, not only in terms of the result but emotionally. But how many times in football have things changed?<br><br>'I don't see it as my biggest challenge.<br><br>'I have two suspended and I have to play without them but, with the players I have available, I will do my best.'<br></div>
