Chelsea can't use that as an excuse anymore. Man utd had more serious injury towards the second half of the season... And it is this period that chelsea are dropping points when Terry and Cech were well back in the team and not the earlier part... You have to say, pressure got to them, nerve were showing in their last few matches... Drogba suddenly don't score as many as the earlier part of the season... Lampard also not his usual self lately. They seem to be rushing... and making mistakes along the way... The way i see it was chelsea players lack that little extra experience in the final lap... Their past 2 seasons were won too easy, so this time around, they didn't seem to know how to handle this new pressure. Same goes for jose.<br><br>If man u don't win the title, they can always be remembered for losing their entire defence including their Gk from a few matches to afew months in somr players case...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually its quite strange - last season, they steamrollered everybody whereas this season, they fall short during times when we expect them to win.<br><br>On paper, they seem to have a easier fixture list running in, they have done the tough away games (except to Arsenal) whereas Man U have to visit Liverpool away, Chelsea away.<br><br>Think the crucial factor is the lack of able players to double up when their keyplayers are injured or not performing.  I don't think Chelsea can use injuries to Terry &amp; Cech as excuse for poor performance.  If you want to be a big time team, these are things that you  must counter and live with.  But looking at Chelsea's lineup, the Dutch defender - Balh...something has not been good.  Same goes for Ferrira (or something like that) - hence essentially, you rely solely on Terry &amp; Cavarlho - either one gets injured / suspended, you are in trouble.  Playing Essien in centre of defense is not exactly a bright idea.<br><br>Man U is facing a defensive crisis at the moment - all their defenders are out.  But the saving grace is that their goalie is around although in the recent games, his form is questionable as well.  But their strike force is still potent - a fine example is the turnaround wins against Everton &amp; AC Milan.  And for Man U, they have so many players that can score.<br><br>Comparatively, Chelsea relys on (or solely) Drogba to deliver the goods.  Shevchenko is still blowing hot &amp; cold, Kalou is still young, the rest - Essien, Mikel, Joe Cole, Robben are not in top form.  And its have been a long time since Lampard last scored.</div>
