            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">tribalfooball.com - March 18, 2007<br><br>Frank Lampard won't consider leaving Chelsea.<br><br>"I've kept quiet about my contract situation because we are in such an important part of the season for Chelsea," he told The Sun. "But there has been so much written and said about me that I feel I have to make clear what's going on as much for Chelsea fans as myself.<br><br>"I want to stay at Chelsea. I have never wanted to leave the club and I don't intend to. I have everything I want in life where I am right now. For the past six years my life has been my family and Chelsea football club. Some players can say that and it sounds cliched or fake. I can say it because it is absolutely true. I am very proud I play for Chelsea and of what I have achieved as part of the team.<br><br>"I am very close to my family who play a big part in my life and my fiancee Elen and I are expecting our second child this summer.<br><br>"We love living in the Chelsea area and bringing our young family up here. People seem to think I want to leave but why would I?<br><br>"I value my relationship with the supporters very highly and they have become part of my football family.<br><br>"I know when I am older and have finished my career I will sit among the fans and support Chelsea with them."<br><br>Lamps admitted he was actually surprised when the club came to him and his agent Steve Kutner last summer and said they wanted to open talks about a new deal.<br><br>He added: "When the club came to me before the World Cup finals and said they wanted to talk about a new deal, I was pleased. As far as I was concerned, though, the most important thing then was preparing with Chelsea for the new season."<br><br>Having made the offer to talk last summer, however, Lamps was surprised when the first meeting didn't take place until just before Christmas.<br><br>He added: "I wondered what was going on and since then there have been a couple of meetings with Steve.<br><br>"So far, though, Chelsea have actually yet to make a proper offer on a new deal. As I said, I am not worried about the situation but it's frustrating when everyone else is talking about my future." </span></div>

I played here before Roman arrived when we were a bit short of the heights we have hit in the last three seasons.<br><br>"I came through that time with the fans and I know what it's like to be nearly men rather than the top team.<br><br>"No one wants to go back to those days and the only way for Chelsea to go is up.<br><br>"Of course, that means retaining the league title but it also means winning the Champions League and the FA Cup. We're still in with a shout in all those competitions this season but if we don't manage to win them we will try again next season.<br><br>"We will never stop working and trying to win.<br><br>"That has been the culture at Chelsea and that's why I want to help the club win even more in the future</span></div>
