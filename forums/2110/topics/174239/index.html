            <div class='col-md body'>Taking over the Ch.55 Love Story In Harvard slot is the refreshing My Lovely Sam-Soon. The first two episodes aired 8 January. Catch the subsequent episodes on Saturday 10.30pm &amp; 3.15am and Sunday 2.45pm!<br><br><img src="http://i9.photobucket.com/albums/a72/soojung_ssi/ATK%20Drama/70e15383.jpg"><br><br><span style="color: midnightblue;"><strong>My Lovely Sam-Soon</strong><br><br>She's 29 years old, single, and overweight. She doesn't have a college degree, a boyfriend, or a job. She's outspoken, obstinate, and fed up with society's expectations of her. Her name is Kim Sam-Soon, and she's Korea's unlikely sweetheart!<br><br>Thanks to its everywoman protagonist, My Lovely Sam-Soon (a.k.a. My Name is Kim Sam-Soon) has been billed as Korea's answer to Bridget Jones. Kim Sam-Soon (Kim Sun Ah, who gained 15 pounds for the role) is a Cordon Bleu-trained pastry chef who doesn't conform to the stereotype of the typical K-Drama Cinderella. Sam-Soon won't let men push her around, will eat and sleep her way out of a depression, and could care less how other people see her.<br><br>When Sam-Soon loses her job on Christmas Eve, her problems are just beginning. She spots her boyfriend going into a hotel with another woman. At first she wants to charge right in there and confront him, but instead decides to wait for him to come out. She plans on dumping him in front of everybody, but when he finally does materialize, Sam-Soon breaks down and begs him not to leave her for the other woman.<br><br>Realizing she has made a fool of herself in public she runs to the bathroom, but accidentally goes into the men's room. Hyun Jin-Hun (Hyun Bin), on a blind date he has no desire to go through with, walks in on Sam-Soon, embarrassing her even more! But Jin-Hun turns out to be Sam-Soon's future employer - in more ways than one. He's a rich restaurant owner who hires Sam-Soon, not only to be a chef, but also to be his pretend girlfriend! So begins a series of surprising and touching events that would try the emotions of any normal woman. But this is no normal woman - this is Kim Sam-Soon!<br><br>When My Lovely Sam-Soon first aired, audiences immediately identified with Kim Sam-Soon's stereotype-breaking character. With her foul mouth and "unladylike" behavior, Sam-Soon challenges traditional ideas of what Korean women are like, by providing a glimpse of what a Korean woman is really like! Audiences responded by making My Lovely Sam-Soon the most watched K-Drama of the year, with a viewership rate of over 40 percent. Alternately hilarious, heartwarming, and heartbreaking, My Lovely Sam-Soon - and Kim Sam-Soon herself - will win you over!</span><br><br></div>

In fact, many people consider Sam Soon to be a rather strange woman. She talks to herself, drinks too much, and stuffs her face with junk food when she's feeling down. But as the daughter of a pastry maker she's also a talented cook. Sam Soon had a boyfriend who cheated on her and, although she is still heart-broken, she knows Prince Charming isn't going to whisk her off her feet, so she does her best not to let life get her down. Pretty soon, a new man is in her life - her new employer, Ji Heon, who has a bizarre proposition. He asks Sam Soon to be his contract girlfriend. She doesn't think he's really her type, and she definitely needs the money, so she unwittingly agrees, totally unprepared for what is on the horizon.</span><br><br><img src="http://i9.photobucket.com/albums/a72/soojung_ssi/ATK%20Drama/001c6998.jpg"><br><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Hyeon Jin-heon / 27 years old / Job: owner of the restaurant "Bon Appetit" / Played by Hyeon Bin</strong><br><br>Everybody has something to hide, but few people have as many skeletons in their closet as Jin Heon. Three years ago, his brother and sister-in-law both died in a car crash. He injured his leg in the same accident and blames himself for what happened. Before this, he was an enviable young man - good looking, intelligent and heir to the family's successful hotel business. But after the accident, he slumped into a major depression, and to top it all off, his gorgeous girlfriend Hee Jin left him without giving him a reason. She simply told Jin Heon she would return in three years' time and asked him to wait for her. It would be fair to say that life has not been kind to Jin Heon lately, but he is about to cross paths with another lonely outsider, Kim Sam Soon.</span><br><br><img src="http://i9.photobucket.com/albums/a72/soojung_ssi/ATK%20Drama/19ed76bf.jpg"><br><span style="color: seagreen;"><strong>Yoo Hee-jin / 27 years old / Jin-heon's ex-girlfriend / Played by Jeong Ryeo-won</strong><br><br>Hee Jin is beautiful, intelligent, warm-hearted and kind. She is the only child of doctor parents and has been in love with Jin Heon since they first met in high school. They were together for six years, until the day Hee Jin suddenly announced she was leaving and would not return for three years. She desperately loved Jin Heon but could not bring herself to tell him the truth, that she had cancer. All she could do was promise to return and fight the disease with everything she had. Hee Jin endured horrible surgery and two years of grueling chemotherapy, with only her love for Jin Heon to keep her fighting. But she made it and returned to him as she had promised, looking more beautiful than ever before. However, when she saw Jin Heon he told her that he now loves another woman, Kim Sam Soon, a girl who seemingly has nothing going for her. It seems that Hee Jin's fight for happiness is not over after all.</span><br><br><img src="http://i9.photobucket.com/albums/a72/soojung_ssi/ATK%20Drama/b4d97cd7.jpg"><br><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Henry Kim / In his mid-30s /<br>Job: Korean-American doctor, who was adopted by Americans as a child / Played by Daniel Henney</strong><br><br>Henry was adopted by an American family when he was two years old and was raised in the US. He has an Asian appearance but speaks very little Korean and is a man of few words. He met Hee Jin when she came to the US for her cancer treatment. He fell instantly in love with her and made every effort for her, as both a doctor and a man. He knows that Hee Jin doesn't love him, that she is fighting for her life so that she can return to Jin Heon, but that she does trust and respect him. When Hee Jin returns to Seoul, Henry goes with her to oversee her recovery. His only concern is that her cancer does not reappear. If Hee Jin really wants to be with Jin Heon then Henry will respect her decision, but when Jin Heon rejects Hee Jin, how will Henry react?</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">- credit: YesAsia</span><br></div>
