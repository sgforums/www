            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">tribalfooball.com - December 12, 2006<br><br>Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho is seriously considering axing Andriy Shevchenko for tonight's crucial clash with Newcastle United.<br><br>The Independent says Mourinho faces the decision whether or not to stick with his struggling ï¿½31m striker Shevchenko tonight. He has waited until this morning to tell his players the team to face Newcastle United and, for the first time, it would seem that the Ukrainian's place is under serious threat.<br><br>Another lacklustre performance against Arsenal on Sunday, compared with the impact that Arjen Robben's introduction had on the game, has pushed Mourinho close to dropping the man brought in at Roman Abramovich's behest. Shevchenko, who has admitted that he has been struggling to fit in, was also told yesterday that returning to Milan in January was not an option.</span></div>

I think either Lampard or Ballack should play the attacking mid-field. Right-mid to Essien, Left-mid to Robben. Defensive-mid to Makelele. That's why either Lampard or Ballack must be dropped.
