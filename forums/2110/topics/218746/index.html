            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">tribalfooball.com - November 04, 2006<br><br>Chelsea midfielder Michael Ballack has revealed how the personal effort from Jose Mourinho convinced the German to choose Stamford Bridge over the summer.<br><br>Ballack told the Sunday Times: "He sent me text messages, wishing me luck, and another message of congratulations each time we won.<br><br>"After our defeat by Italy he told me we could be proud of the way we'd played. It definitely came across that he was the manager who wanted me most.<br><br>"He is not at all as I imagined after reading about him in the papers. Yes, he stands up for his team at all times, but he is not arrogant, he can be relaxed and very amusing. Most of all, I've noticed that he says exactly what he is thinking, he is very truthful like that and you always know where you stand with him. That's good, but unfortunately it's not normal in football." </span></div>

"After Barcelona, the criticism of the players and the team was hard. The referee didn't help. At times you thought you might just as well give them the three points.<br><br>"He was killing us. It was frustrating and you wonder if it's worth going there if the ref is going to make stupid decisions.<br><br>"I don't know about us against the world, but you know that when you're at the top everyone wants to shoot you down. We had it at Arsenal when we were winning the League and everyone was saying: 'What about all the bookings?' You had the feeling people were saying it to affect us.<br><br>"The manager gets criticised too much, in my opinion. I don't think it's fair. He's a great manager and has done well for us. I suppose it keeps us out of the papers if they hammer him. It's an unselfish thing for him to do because no one wants to be hammered in the paper.<br><br>"He takes it on the chin. He's happy as long as we don't get hammered. He's such a nice guy. I don't know how he does it but it keeps the pressure off us going into games." </span><br><br><span style="color: red;">alot of players and managers had said that before and i think it is really no conincidence to see such news over and over again</span></div>
