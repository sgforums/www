Chelsea's club doctor Bryan English, who accompanied Terry to France, said: "The instructions from the surgeon were to run the day after surgery.<br><br>"That is great for us and great for John. We are not going to do anything with John that is going to cause him problems. I am not in the game of pushing him out there because it is for the benefit of Chelsea - but I also don't want to hold him back unnecessarily<br><br>English also hit back at initial expert opinion outside the club which estimated Terry's injury would sideline him for up to six weeks.<br><br>Surgeons removed a sequestrated lumbar intervertebral disc, using a revolutionary new technique, and English added: "I won't say exactly how long he is going to take to recover</span><br><br>8 days to 6 weeks is the answer to this so hopefully he will only miss the next 2 premiership game and the FA cup game and be back for the game against wigan<br><br>as for cech asap !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>its good news that Terry will be back but i suppose he will not be able to feature for full action until much later?  He still need to get back his match fitness.<br><br>as for Cech, kudos for his speedy recovery, i think its about two three months in the reserve team too to get some match fitness as well.  I think Cech won't have much impact on the premiership title liaoz.<br><br>cole at Chelsea is a fringe player bcos he rarely starts and is plagued with injuries.  I think between him and Robben, Robben doles out more damage.</div>
