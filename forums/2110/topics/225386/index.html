They've had very few injuries so far.<br><br>"Whereas we know as a team we've got another level to go to. We need to take the game to teams and then no-one can live with us."<br><br>Terry's team overcame a dogged Newcastle side thanks to a second-half match-winner from substitute Didier Drogba.<br><br>And he added: "We must go on a run of games and keep winning.<br><br>"We must keep the pressure up. Christmas is a difficult period. United have got tough games. We must just keep winning and keep on like we know we're capable of." </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe that Chelsea has not peaked yet.<br><br>Reasons :<br><br>1.   Cech and Carlo, our first 2 choice keepers are out injured.<br><br>2.   Joe Cole is still out.<br><br>3.   Ballack, Shev and SWP have not settled in properly.<br><br>4.   Kalou and Mikel are still raw diamonds.<br><br>5.   Our right back position is still not settled. Is it Geremi, Ferreira or Essien?<br><br>I rather have this situation now than later. Hopefully we will reach the peak towards the 2nd part of the season.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Looking at the fixtures, looks like Man U have got tougher games to navigate - away to Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea and not forgetting Fulham, Man City and Tottenham.  Another noteworthy point - they had not manage to beat Arsenal and Chelsea at home.<br><br>Comparatively, Chelsea has yet to visit Liverpool and Arsenal.  But they have defeated Liverpool at home, held Arsenal to a draw and drew Man U away.  So in terms of head to heads with the big teams, Chelsea is still better than Man U.<br><br>Looking ahead, Man U may similarily slip at Tottenham (like Chelsea) and Man City &amp; Fulham are hoodoo teams.  So add up, Chelsea may still outlast Man U.<br><br>I think its a known fact that Man U lacked depth, and it has been seen in previous times, without likes of Giggs, Ronaldo &amp; Rooney, Man U will be jaded.  Chelsea can still bring on Robben &amp; Cole to change the game in midfield and they both can score.  Also SWP.  Man U wise, only Scholes can score and he's like 30+ liaoz.  I have no confidence in Fletcher or worse - Richardson.  As for Carrick, he is not going to score anytime soon.<br><br>So that leaves Man U having a tougher stretch ahead, and even if they sign players come Jan, they still have to gel them together....but being a Man U fan, I hope they could last the stretch and come April against Chelsea, hopefully there is still a gap of 3 - 6 points so much so that even losing to Chelsea will not dent the title hopes.  But if they are good enough, they should at least draw.</div>
