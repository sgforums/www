Sadly for the Betis chief, it made no difference.<br><br>They briefly threatened to shock Chelsea and Joaquin's fourth minute free-kick would have caused Carlo Cudicini problems had Frank Lampard not protected his goalkeeper with a timely intervention.<br><br>Sixty seconds later it was Claude Makelele's turn to rescue the Londoners when he cleared a header from Gutierrez Juanito off the goal-line.<br><br>At this juncture, the Spaniards looked lively, full of invention and goalscoring intent - a refreshing change from the lifeless performance Anderlecht produced against the Blues in the first game of this season's competition.<br><br>It wasn't long though before the Chelsea machine inevitably began to crank itself into a momentum which, as most teams have discovered this season, is difficult to halt once it reaches a certain gear.<br><br>The hands of Betis goalkeeper Antonio Doblas had already been stung by a vicious 20-yard drive from Joe Cole and when Shaun Wright-Phillips evaded his marker and delivered a measured cross into the six-yard box, Didier Drogba was inches away from applying the finishing touch.<br><br>The Ivory coast hitman, enjoying a rich vein of form after bagging a brace in their 5-1 Barclays Premiership demolition of Bolton on Saturday, soon made amends - making Betis pay dearly for giving the ball away cheaply in midfield.<br><br>The guilty party, Fernando Varela, presented the ball to Michael Essien in the centre circle and the Ghanaian international burst forward unchallenged as the Betis defence opted for a policy of containment rather than confrontation.<br><br>However, Essien proved far to clever for the Spaniards and, after fooling the retreating defenders by feigning to shoot, he supplied the perfect pass into the penalty area for the lurking Drogba to thread the ball under the body of the advancing Doblas in the 24th minute.<br><br>A minute before the interval and Real's hopes evaporated completely thanks to another present - this time courtesy of 'keeper Doblas.<br><br>He kindly dropped Frank Lampard's free-kick at the feet of Ricardo Carvalho on his own goal line and the Portuguese defender gleefully smashed the ball home.<br><br>Not even the loss of Drogba at half-time could upset Chelsea's evening although it may have imminent repercussions in terms of the Premiership this weekend.<br><br>He felt the full force of a David Rivas tackle just before the break and was replaced at half-time by Hernan Crespo.<br><br>In the 59th minute, Chelsea put the game beyond the reach of their opponents with a splendid move that had Mourinho out of his seat and celebrating along the touchline in a rare display of Portuguese pleasure.<br><br>The prime mover was the impressive Essien who delivered the perfect ball into the path of England midfielder Cole.<br><br>The youngster, showing yet more evidence of his growing maturity and stature, waited for the right moment to despatch a right-foot shot into the bottom corner of the net from the edge of penalty area.<br><br>But the best was yet to come. It arrived five minutes later courtesy of a stunning three man move. Lampard's superb 30-yard pass over the top of Melli's head was met by Wright-Phillips who volleyed the ball, first-time, back into the six-yard box for Crespo to head home from point blank range.<br><br>It was a move of sheer quality and class and put the gloss on another scintillating performance from Chelsea.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">- credit: Sporting Life </span></span></div>

He was too powerful for them.<br><br>"I think it was his best game - a more complete one than he has played. Overall I think his performance was amazing."<br><br>Mourinho's side are now just one win away from qualification for the next phase of the competition and have yet to concede a goal in Europe this season.<br><br>To a man, Chelsea were significantly better than Betis, but Mourinho was still unhappy with the way his side failed to cope with Spaniards in the air during the early stages.<br><br>"If they had scored first we would have seen a totally different game," he conceded.<br><br>"We played against Liverpool and against Bolton with players 1.85, 1.90, 1.95 and Peter Crouch 2.0 metres, and we had no problems with set-pieces.<br><br>"Against Betis with only one player over 1.85 metres, it is unacceptable the problems we had from set-pieces in the first 15 minutes.<br><br>"The result was a consequence of 2-0 in front at half-time.<br><br>"In the second half they tried but they gave us a lot of space and we scored two more goals. We could have scored four or five more.<br><br>"They started well and maybe better than us but in football the first goal is always important because it gives more confidence. They played good football and were always dangerous until we scored the third goal - it killed the game. I know in 15 days' time we will have a difficult game in Betis."<br><br>But the Portuguese coach refused to get carried away with a result that will undoubtedly send a warning to the rest of Europe whether Mourinho likes it or not.<br><br>Chelsea are nine points clear at the top of the Premiership with nine straight wins and have hit 13 goals in the last three games.<br><br>"We don't want to send messages," he said. "We just want to achieve our targets and they are to win the Premier League and, for a start, be in the next stage of the Champions League.<br><br>"At this moment we have seven points and it is a good situation for us."<br><br>Betis coach Lorenzo Serra Ferrer insists they had much to learn from the lesson Chelsea handed out to them and conceded the Blues' second goal just seconds before the interval was the killer blow.<br><br>"We were playing against a great side," admitted Ferrer.<br><br>"We had a good lesson out there. Chelsea competed better, fought harder for the 50-50 balls all over the field.<br><br>"The second goal on the stroke of half-time really affected us. We went into the dressing room a little bit down.<br><br>"I think we can take stuff from this defeat. It is all about learning - both for me and the players.<br><br>"We will take a look at things calmly in order to learn and improve for the next game."<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">- credit: Sporting Life</span></span></div>
