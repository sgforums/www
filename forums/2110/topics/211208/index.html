            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">tribalfooball.com - September 20, 2006<br><br>John Terry has hailed the impact made by new Chelsea teammate Khalid Boulahrouz.<br><br>The Dutchman, signed from Hamburg for ?7million, has been impressive at right-back even though he is a centre-back.<br><br>Chelsea have conceded only one goal in the four games he has played and he has been error-free.<br><br>Skipper Terry said: "He's a great player and a great lad to have around.<br><br>"We call him The Assassin. On the pitch he has been different class, playing out of position.<br><br>"If he can do that for us and give us that option to play centre-back and right-back it's going to be great for us defensively."<br><br>Manager Jose Mourinho reckons The Assassin is also doing a good job of protecting his team-mates.<br><br>He said: "He's giving me what I was waiting for.<br><br>"I feel safe having him in the squad because he gives me protection because he can play at centre-back or right-back. But at the same time he's safe defensively.<br><br>"He is the player of the no mistakes. He plays safe in the game and gives us a lot of security. I'm pleased with him." </span><br><br><span style="color: green;">he is not that good offensively though</span></div>

Offensively he has more qualities and scored his goal.<br><br>"From a disciplinary point of view, he is completely clean. He has not one single yellow card.<br><br>"This is because everything is about the strength of his body not about bad fouling or actions in the game."<br><br>Essien has responded to the intense competition in the centre of Chelsea's midfield although Michael Ballack will miss Saturday's trip to neighbours Fulham through suspension.<br><br>Essien said: "If you play at a club like Chelsea, there will always be competition. For me it's not a problem. I'm very happy here.<br><br>"You have to expect this kind of thing. And it makes you a better player.<br><br>"Last season was my first in the Premiership and I think I've developed a lot since then and gained lots of valuable experience.<br><br>"The more you play, the more you keep developing and improving."<br><br>Skipper John Terry has also been impressed with Essien since he returned from the World Cup.<br><br>Terry said: "Michael Essien has started the season really well. He's been one of our best players so far this season."<br><br>Yes I agreed that Essien is one of the best chelsea plyaer currently and Carvalho and Drogba look sharp too</span></div>

That simply must make an impact.<br><br>"Absolutely no [Chelsea are not at 100 percent], but our performances are better from match to match, we did well on Sunday," Cech added.<br><br>"We won even though we played almost 45 minutes with one man down.<br><br>"The biggest weakness of Chelsea is probably time, if there are new signings we all need a month to get used to each other, we are doing that on the fly.<br><br>"On the other hand we have such quality players that we can manage it and so we have won some points, that is a good sign.<br><br>"Then [when we get used to each other] we will be even stronger.<br><br>"I believe it will happen as soon as possible, we are improving step-by-step.<br><br>"I believe yes, [Chelsea will be stronger], some new top-class players have come in here; Ballack, Shevchenko or Cole.<br><br>"And there are some more ones; Mikel and Boulahrouz.<br><br>"All of them are playing for their countries, they took part in the World Cup finals.<br><br>"Moreover they fit well in the team." </span></div>
