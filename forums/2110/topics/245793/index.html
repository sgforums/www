It was an interesting season. I was watching the Blackburn - Liverpool match. When the Blackburn fans knew their side wasn't going to win, the fans all looked so downcast and there were solemn faces all around. But when the match between Man U and West Ham ended, the news came in and then you saw the losing team's manager shouting and celebrating on the touchline.<br><br>Classic, really classic, that scene in the stadium.</div>

Also, somewhere in the game, Chelsea switch to 3-4-3. With more players upfront, it did make sense in a way to pump up the field where more players were. Maybe they were more eager/desperate to get a goal quick knowing the pressure was on to win the match. Since Man U had won earlier and it was Warford afterall? Dunno, just maybe.<br><br>And what was Kalou doing? Chelsea could have scored earlier if he had let a cross to Drogba instead of taking it himself. And it's not the first time he's done something like that either. I remember in the match against Sheffield he scored, but after he did so, Ashley cole seemed angry Kalou didn't leave the ball to him. Other than that, I realise when Kalou has the option to shoot or pass, he would always shoot. Unlike Drogba who would hold up play and very often play the ball to his team-mates. Hard working Kalou may be at times, but Drogba he is not. Even Sheva who is constantly lamblasted for not scoring does his best to play the ball to team mates as well.<br><br>I say, who needs Kalou?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One thing about Chelsea last night, they seemed pretty devoid of ideas and imagination, which kind of surprised me. I'm not expecting them to play as if Joe Cole and Robben were back, but last night was simply..... weird.</div>

Unlike the past where Man U tends to leave it late, both in individual matches and the table itself.<br><br>It may be late in the season but for all we know, Man U might implode on itself since they're doing something they haven't always done.</div>
