In terms of injuries we started off without the full squad - Gaby Heinze wasn't fit, we've had problems with Gary Neville, then Ji-sung Park and Ole got injuries.<br><br>"But we've coped really well because the squad has got stronger and more experienced so when players are out we're handling it much better." </span><br><br>i did not knew that united don't score early goals nor late goals<br><br>SAF playing his mind games again</div>

There are many points to play for and we've got a lot of confidence in this team. That's the reason we've been champions two years on the trot.<br><br>"It is important we carry on doing the right things. Slight things haven't gone our way. You can't dwell on that. You just have to wait for it to turn a little bit and I am sure it will.<br><br>"People only get carried away because of the standards we have set for the past two seasons. It is quite normal to have periods in a season where it doesn't quite go for you.<br><br>"At one stage last season I think at one stage we were 15 points clear of the Manchester Uniteds and Liverpools and then all of a sudden we had a little blip and it was down to six or seven points at one point.<br><br>"You have to look at the big picture rather than just a few games.<br><br>"I think Sir Alex Ferguson as well as Jose Mourinho is wise enough to know there is a long way to go.<br><br>"The pair of them talk after games which gives out some headlines - but at the end of the day the football will do the talking."<br><br>Lampard added: "There is nothing major wrong.<br><br>"Sometimes you have to remind yourselves as a team that it is nothing major because the fact people are asking questions after two or three draws is a statement about what a team we are and what a squad we are.<br><br>"It is certainly not a crisis. It is something we need to address because we are not used to drawing games and not getting three points for three games on the trot.<br><br>"We are used to winning games and we want to win games again." </span></div>
