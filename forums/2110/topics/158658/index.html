That is like a dream come true.<br><br>"It was 50 years since our previous title and everybody's working hard to ensure we will not have to wait that long again.<br><br>"In future we hope to bring even more joy than you (Chelsea fans) have experienced over the last 100 years.<br><br>"In order to do this many challanges lie ahead.

"Jose and I talk about players and positions but the hot-shot negotiations are up to Peter Kenyon.<br><br>"Our target is to find an academy player and bring him through to the first team in two years' time."<br><br>Arnesen sees his role as working in tandem with that of Mourinho and chief executive Kenyon in finding the players necessary for the Premiership champion's squad.<br><br>Chelsea, with Roman Abramovich's fortune behind them, have been accused of buying in talent rather than nurturing it.<br><br>But Arnesen says his position as sporting director is vital to the long-term ambitions and development of the club.<br><br>"When Roman came here he wanted to quickly get the club up to a certain level," said Arnesen.<br><br>"That was step one but the next step is to go into the structure and that's why I'm here.<br><br>"Chelsea is taking this very seriously. We will not go out and spend money all the time. It has to be a combination of that and the players that I will go out and look for.<br><br>"And when I'm looking for players, I will ask the same questions as I did at PSV and Tottenham - 'are they good enough and is the price right?'"<br><br>Arnesen began his new role at Chelsea on 1 September after his controversial switch from Tottenham.<br><br>Chelsea were accused of making an illegal approach for Arnesen and had to pay an estimated Â£8m in compensation while Arnesen himself was suspended.<br><br>And, though he has only been at Stamford Bridge less than two months, the former Denmark international says he is already making progress.<br><br>"I've been more involved in football in the last one-and-a-half months here than I have been in the entire year," said Arnesen.<br><br>"I have been given an opportunity by a club who are investing not only in players but also in the structure of the club in terms of scouting and development.<br><br>"It is different to my role at Tottenham and that is one of the reasons I took it.<br><br>"My job is 20-25% administration and the rest of the time I'm out looking for players.<br><br>"That is what I like - getting players to the club, seeing their development, watching them break into the first team and then into the national team.<br><br>"I didn't know what I would find here but it's great and for me Chelsea are one of the most exciting clubs in the world."<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">- credit: BBC Sport</span></span><br><br></div>

A diminutive, brisk-looking blonde, Mrs A has developed into a high-octane chatelaine.<br><br>Her responsibilities include running an excess of properties and bringing up the coupleÂ’s five children, together with the onerous task of conjuring up retail opportunities befitting her husbandÂ’s Croesan fortune.<br><br>Today, the Abramovich family will wake to find themselves still more prosperous than they began the week, after Roman sold his controlling stake in the oil com- pany Sibneft for Â£7.4 billion. It is a figure that most of us have problems even contemplating; for Irina it is merely business as usual. Another day, another Â£5.5 billion.<br><br>Husband and wife are both in their late thirties and share similarly humble backgrounds. IrinaÂ’s origins lack the potboiler awfulness of her spouseÂ’s childhood (orphaned at four, his mother perishing after a botched abortion, his father having being crushed by a crane).<br><br>But she too lost a father to an industrial accident, and memories of her waitress motherÂ’s struggle to raise her on 120 roubles a month (then about Â£60) are doubtless still not scotched by having the run of Harvey Nics.<br><br>The young Irina became an air hostess. As an Aeroflot trolley dolly at the Sheremetyevo airport in Moscow, she progressed straight on to the coveted international routes, where hostesses could establish contact with the great and the not-so-good. She caught the eye of a young chancer by the name of Abramovich and the couple were married in 1991.<br><br>Today, Roman is said to enjoy playing the patriarch and likes to have his wife at home. But no Stepford wife, she Â— having secured a degree in fine arts from Moscow University.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">- credit: Hannah Betts, Times Online</span></span></div>
