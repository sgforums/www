"I've got a contract until 2010 and I want to carry on.<br><br>"If I have to leave for some reason or because someone wants me to... that's life in soccer.<br><br>"And if I leave I want to keep coaching next season at another European club. I like English soccer and I'd like to coach another club in the Premiership but not now.<br><br>"I don't imagine leaving Chelsea and going straight to another English club. It would be a very strange situation and I don't want it to happen."<br><br>Mourinho described his time at Chelsea as "historic" after leading the club to two Premiership titles after joining the club in 2004 from Porto, with whom he won the Champions League.<br><br>"I have done work in these three years which could be termed historic, because some of the things we have done can only be described this way," he added.<br><br>"This season has been the best of all because we have had to overcome some incredible problems.<br><br>"It's been unbelievable what we've suffered because of injury problems this season, and look what we're still managing to do."<br><br>Mourinho was not willing to discuss his relationship with club owner Roman Abramovich which has been the subject of much speculation in recent months.<br><br>"My work is with the players, we are the ones that win and lose the games. I don't want to talk about my relationship with Abramovich," said Mourinho.</span></div>
