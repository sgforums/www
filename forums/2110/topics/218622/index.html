            <div class='col-md body'>Chelsea striker Didier Drogba has signed a new four-year deal running until 2010.<br>The 28-year-old joined the club for Â£24m in July 2004 and has been in fine form this season with 10 goals in 15 games to his credit.<br><br>The Ivory Coast international told Chelsea's television station: "I am not playing well just because I wanted to sign a new contract.<br><br>"I'm playing well as I feel good and I am happy to train with my friends."<br><br>There were doubts cast over Drogba's first-team chances at Chelsea when manager Jose Mourinho landed striker Andriy Shevchenko in the summer.<br><br>But Drogba has risen to the challenge while Shevchenko has struggled for form.<br>Drogba scored a last-gasp equaliser against Barcelona in a Champions League match on Tuesday as well as netting the winner when the two clubs met in the reverse group game.<br><br>His collection of goals so far during the campaign also saw him grab an exquisite winner when Liverpool visited Stamford Bridge.<br><br>Drogba added: "I want to say thank you to Jose for believing in me since the beginning and now we will be together for a long time. The best period of my career I think.<br><br>"I am happy because when I came here it wasn't easy for me to say I would be signing a new contract with Chelsea, because everybody knows the first year was difficult.<br><br>"The second one was okay but I knew I could do better."<br>Drogba has been linked with possible moves to either Italian side AC Milan and Lyon of France but Mourinho believes the signing of a new deal will put any speculation to bed.<br><br>"It is good for Chelsea, Didier deserves a big contract.<br><br>"Now he can go to Milan for shopping and no-one can say he goes to sign a contract.<br><br>"His friend from Lyon can call and people don't say he is calling to sign him. It's fantastic."<br></div>
