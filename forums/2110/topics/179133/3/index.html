            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.soccernet.com/design05/DJ/20060213/delhorno_mh.jpg"><br><br><span style="color: midnightblue;"><strong>JOSE'S ERROR HANDS ADVANTAGE TO BARCA</strong><br><br>Just for once, Jose Mourinho got it wrong and how he was made to pay as the biggest game of the European season to date resulted in his first defeat at Stamford Bridge.<br><br>While Chelsea's eternally bullish coach would never admit as much in public, his move to throw Shaun Wright-Phillips into the action 14 minutes from the end of this pulsating Champions League encounter may just have proved to be his biggest mistake since moving to London back in the summer of 2004.<br><br>Down to ten men after Asier del Horno's harsh first half dismissal and with Barcelona baying for their blue blood, Mourinho opted not to employ the steadying influence of Maniche and settle for the stalemate that would have kept his side in the picture for the second leg in two weeks' time.<br><br>Instead, boldly, he threw Wright-Phillips on to replace the dangerous Arjen Robben and within three minutes, Samuel Eto'o had headed what may prove be a crucial second goal for Barca.<br><br>As he faced up to the media in a packed Stamford Bridge press room, his deadpan expression remained intact, but you suspect he may lie in bed for the next couple of nights pondering whether he had gambled once too often.<br><br>You can get away with such bold tactics against the lesser lights of the Premiership, but when you are up against Barcelona, such naivety is tantamount to professional suicide and the obvious question was duly thrown his way by a brave reporter.<br><br>However, Mourinho proceeded to immediately change the direction of the conversation by claiming his pre-match suggestion that Barcelona are a team who dive had been justified after Leo Messi's 'simulation' had reduced his side to ten men.<br><br>'The game was nothing to do with tactics or the quality of the players,' he barked. 'This was all about the red card. I can't say much because I will be suspended again, but you write about this incident because you were all at this game like me. I don't want to get into a difficult situation so you say it for me.<br><br>'What I do ask is if we can we suspend Messi for play acting? The kid is not just very good at football because he showed he can do much more than that now. We played a team who come from a great city that knows all about culture and theatre and tonight we saw one of their players confirm he has the spirit of Barcelona with him.<br><br>'Messi jumps, provokes contact with Del Horno and of course it's not a red card. Once again, we have 10 men and the game is completely different.<br><br>'When this was eleven against eleven, it was an even match. When you are playing against a side that is okay, you may be able to deal with one man less, but against Barcelona this is not possible.'<br><br>They are strong words and UEFA will have to decide whether Mourinho toppled off the tightrope he was walking in that press conference, but it was an inevitable reaction after what was a crushing setback for the 'special one'.<br><br>Had Maniche clogged up the midfield, he may be heading to Spain with the tie level at 1-1, but now he is in a hole that is as deep as he has found in his coaching career. If he can go to the Nou Camp in two weeks time and manufacture a victory, his self-proclaimed tag will be justified, but you suspect it may be a mountain too far, even for the coach who doesn't know how to lose.<br><br>You could tell that this game was very different to those that had gone before them at Stamford Bridge this season. The press room was brimming full like never before, yet it was all worth it for a second half that lived up to all the extraordinary hype.<br><br>The least said about a dour first half the better. It was little more than two heavyweights feeling each other out until the shadow boxing ended in stunning fashion.<br><br>While Del Horno's attempt to tackle Messi by the corner flag could be described as reckless, it was hardly a blow worthy of the reaction that followed. With players from both sides rushing to confront each other, the wounds of the battles of last season were opened wide once again.<br><br>Messi's cavorting on the floor would not have looked out of place in the Olympic ice dancing contest currently taking place in Turin and Del Horno added to the farce by rolling around himself claiming some kind of foul.<br><br>Bizarrely, Norwegian referee Terje Hauge was clearly impressed and with Barca players baying for blood from Del Horno he duly produced the red card that changed the complexion of this game entirely.<br><br>Sitting just a few yards in front of us less vital members of the media - who were given seats in the stand just behind the Chelsea dug-out - Mourinho sat motionless, merely looking behind and chuckling to his staff.<br><br>'See I told you they were a bunch of divers,' may have been the gist of his argument, yet some would argue it was justice after Arjen Robben's disgraceful diving got Liverpool's Pepe Reina sent off earlier this month.<br><br>With that, the game seemed appeared to have its decisive twist. Surely not even Mourinho and his depleted side could overcome this kind of adversity, but their stunning ability to defy the odds raised it's head again as Thiago Motta managed to divert Frank Lampard's free-kick towards goal and the game that so needed a goal had just that.<br><br>It was John Terry's presence alongside Motta that inspired his mistake and the Chelsea skipper then came to the fore like never before. He has long been described as inspirational, but this was a performance that confirmed he can now be placed among the world's best centrebacks.<br><br>When you realise it was Terry who diverted Ronaldinho's 71st minute cross to give Barcelona the away goal they craved, it seems curious to read that he was the leading figure in this game, but seeing his performance here tonight left you in little doubt that he was the best performer on show.<br><br>Clearing balls off the line, defending for his life and doing it all with passion that could only be admired, Terry did not deserve to be a loser in this game, but after Mourinho's overly ambitious substitution, Samuel Eto'o made him pay as he headed home the winner 10 minutes from time.<br><br>'I felt the Chelsea goal fired us into action,' stated Barcelona boss Frank Rijkaard. 'When I sent Henrik Larsson on in the final stages, I told him to go and win us the game and he played a part in doing just that. It is a great result for us, but this tie is not over. Chelsea are a good team and we have to have the desire to compete in the second leg.<br><br>'I don't want to say too much about the red card. However, I will say that Messi is not a player to overreact. He gets fouled a lot and these incidents are bound to happen. If I say too much about the incident because it may lead to trouble.'<br><br>Mourinho added this flourish to his press conference. 'I am so proud of my players, so proud of our supporters and we will go to Barcelona with real belief. We will not go there to look at a beautiful city and say what a nice time we are going to have. We will go there confident, as always.'<br><br>You get the feeling that the pulsating opening to this Champions League tie is merely the appetiser for what may be the ultimate 90 minutes of sport in Catalonia a fortnight from now. The world of football can hardly wait.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">(con't)</span></span></div>

TV replays suggest it may have been harsh.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">FOOD WATCH</span></strong>: Soccernet's Insider reached Stamford Bridge with a matter of minutes to spare, so the food was winding down long before my arrival.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">RED WATCH</span></strong>: Mr Hauge had something of a shocker as his decision to send of Del Horno should have been followed a red card for Carlos Puyol as he escaped punishment despite hacking down Arjen Robben while already on a yellow card in the second half.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">MOURINHO v RIJKAARD</span></strong>: You have to give the upper hand to the Barca coach, but that may be harsh in a game so dominated by the dismissal of Del Horno. Was that late Chelsea substitution as crucial as Soccernet's Insider suggests?<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">VERDICT</span></strong>: Mourinho will use every trick in the book to convince his players that they have been cheated by referee Terje Hauge and that psychological ploy may yet breathe life into this tie. The second leg should be equally as epic as this first.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">- credit: ESPNsoccernet</span></div>
