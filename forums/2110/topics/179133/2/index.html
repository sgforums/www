            <div class='col-md body'>Damn disappointed by the sending off man..Not that i support chelsea but that it could have been a cracking game esp the half half..<br>Chelsea have always managed to turn up the heat in the second half..The tactics was screwed...<br>Mourinho could have left cole in as i felt he seemed like the creative spark that can unlock the barca def. And duff could have come on in the 2nd half to add some width. But with a man down they could only apply mass defending to keep the scoreline down.<br>What a sham man...But IMO, i just could not see the intent from del horno to injure cause grievous injury to messi. And certainly the ref looked shaky before pulliong out the red after strong protests by the barca team.<br>But this is soccer and the better team on the night won...i looked forward to the 2nd game with and chelsea will win it to go thru.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

And duff could have come on in the 2nd half to add some width. But with a man down they could only apply mass defending to keep the scoreline down.<br>What a sham man...But IMO, i just could not see the intent from del horno to injure cause grievous injury to messi. And certainly the ref looked shaky before pulliong out the red after strong protests by the barca team.<br>But this is soccer and the better team on the night won...i looked forward to the 2nd game with and chelsea will win it to go thru.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> There's really no malicious intent on Del Horno's part.
