When we <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">won</span></strong> the opening match against Wigan, he was first to admit Chelsea didn't deserve the win. There were other instances I remember his voicing his unhappiness at the way the team played despite the winning ... mind you, that's winning.

Mourinho's "bench breaks" seems to provide motivation coz everyone wants to be playing as many games as possible. If someone isn't getting the job done, there's a fellow team mate who's always ready to prove himself and bring into the game strengths of his own. JMHO.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here's an amusing reaction to yesterday's horror ... straight off The Official Chelsea FC Website <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br><span style="color: midnightblue;"><strong>REACTION: JOSE: "THEY FOUGHT A LOT, THEY HAD A BETTER ATTITUDE THAN US; THEY DESERVE THE POINTS."</strong><br><br>After a dismal 0-3 defeat at the Riverside, JosÃ© Mourinho spent the first few minutes in the post-match press conference texting on his mobile phone.<br><br>Perhaps like every Chelsea fan he was receiving crowing messages from Arsenal or Man Utd fans revelling in his worst result as a Chelsea manager. Perhaps he was voting someone off his own personal reality show. There were several likely candidates for eviction today.<br><br>He was clearly unhappy with what he had seen.<br><br>Â“This is my third defeat in the Premiership and you could say it is my worst,Â” he said. Â“We lose 1-0 Man City Â— we donÂ’t deserve. We lose 1-0 Man Utd Â— we donÂ’t deserve. We lose 3-0 here Â— we deserve.<br><br>Â“They fought a lot, they had a better attitude than us; they deserve the points.Â”<br><br>He hinted that he hadnÂ’t spoken much about the game to his players afterwards.<br><br>Â“I prefer to give congratulations to the opposition,Â” he claimed, revealing that he would Â“go home and think about itÂ” and examine videos before discussing what had gone wrong.<br><br>Â“The players are saying at 1-0 it was a penalty but even if it isÂ…  on this performance I cannot talk about the referee,Â” he said.<br><br>The manager said he was unhappy with the defending and the attacking, but in both cases he saw it as a team failure, not about individuals.<br><br>It was the type of performance that has frustrated him when his side plays struggling opposition. Citing the examples of Real Betis and Everton, he groaned: Â“Chelsea this season is experts in giving life to people in difficult circumstances.Â”<br><br>Even worse news was the injury to player of the season candidate William Gallas, who hobbled off after appearing to be caught on the instep.<br><br>JosÃ© didnÂ’t know how bad the damage was to the FrenchmanÂ’s foot or how long he might be out. With Barcelona coming up shortly, it is a major worry.<br><br>Gallas would in any case have missed ChelseaÂ’s next match against Colchester next weekend through suspension, having reached five yellow cards. He is joined on that tally by John Terry, who is also now ruled out of the FA Cup match.<br><br>His team may have been charitable, but JosÃ© was giving little away. Perhaps he saved it all for those private texts.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">- credit: Rick Glanvill, 11 Feb 2006</span></span></div>
