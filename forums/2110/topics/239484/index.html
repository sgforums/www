But it is not my responsibility and it is not Arsene Wenger's.<br><br>"We managers have to try to educate them, not to kill them.<br><br>"I went on to the pitch because I was afraid more players could get involved.<br><br>"I could stop some Chelsea players and Wenger could help to control the emotions of his men. It's what you have to do."<br><br>The Chelsea chief added: "Now is not the time to say who is guilty. Mikel got a red card, Toure and Adebayor too and my players say that Emmanuel Eboue was more responsible. But that is not the point.<br><br>"It's a pity what happened because it was a good game and the players had behaved well until then.<br><br>"It was not a violent game but it was a consequence of the frustration of the last few minutes and some boys maybe lost control of their emotions.<br><br>"But the referee was cool, some other players tried to help and I hope we can all forget this incident and focus on the good things of the game."<br><br>Trouble flared in stoppage time with Chelsea leading 2-1 after Didier Drogba's double had cancelled out Theo Walcott's opener for Arsenal.<br><br>Mikel appeared to start it all by pulling down Toure.<br><br>Adebayor was so incensed by his card that he had to be pulled away from ref Howard Webb by Gunners physio Gary Lewin.<br><br>Obi said: "I didn't deserve the card. I think Toure attacked me but the ref showed me the red card.<br><br>"The referee had already given them a free-kick so why did he attack me? I don't know - I don't have a clue about it.<br><br>"I didn't touch him, I kept my hands down. But he didn't punch me. We didn't fight." </span></div>

"They beat Liverpool, Everton and Tottenham with this team.<br><br>"In the second half it was completely different, we dominated the game and at the end of the day we deserved the victory."<br><br>Three red cards marred the end of the match, and he added: "The pity was what happened in the final (minutes). I don't know what happened but it was not nice.<br><br>"A special word for them - they played very good.<br><br>"They are a great coach, great players - but football is about winning and the cup goes to us."<br><br>Chelsea vice-captain Frank Lampard, who lifted the trophy in the absence of Terry, said: "As soon as JT went down I could see it in his face (that it was serious).<br><br>"That (winning the cup) was for John going off like that."<br><br>Asked if the players would get the trophy to Terry in hospital as soon as possible, Lampard replied: "If it's possible, of course we will because we are a team."<br><br>Lampard admitted that it had been a disappointing end to the final when both sets of players became embroiled in an unseemly brawl sparked by a challenge from Mikel on Toure.<br><br>"I wasn't involved in the first incident but then some of their players got upset. I came in trying to sort it out and then got involved in it.<br><br>"It's disappointing for a final but it just shows how much people want to win this cup."<br><br>Lampard admitted Arsenal had started very strongly and deserved their early lead but Chelsea weathered the storm.<br><br>"We didn't have too much of the game," said Lampard, "but we just needed to win the game and we have.<br><br>"Didier is the best in the world at the moment. He is doing it week-in, week-out for us." </span><br><br>yes win it for John Terry and we did it =D</div>
