            <div class='col-md body'>Jose Mourinho has ended his three-year reign as Chelsea manager following his latest bust up with owner Roman Abramovich, according to reports.<br><br>Abramovich called crisis talks following Tuesday night's disappointing 1-1 draw with Norwegian minnows Rosenborg in the Champions League where the fractious duo had furious falling out.<br><br>Mourinho is believed to have informed senior players of his departure following training on Wednesday. One of those players insists that the manager has not resigned but has been sacked by the Blues.<br><br>During the launch of a new Chelsea documentary - Blue Revolution - at the Vue cinema in Fulham on Thursday night an emotional Mourinho refused to talk to the press unaware the story had been leaked. He is understood to have confirmed his departure to the players in attendance, which did not include Frank Lampard and John Terry.<br><br>Mourinho's rocky relationship with Abramovich is public knowledge and despite an apparent thaw in relations last season the duo were again at odds over the role of Â£30million striker Andrei Shevchenko and the Blues' dour style of football even before Tuesday's result brought events to a head.<br><br>The Portuguese manager, who has won the Champions League with Porto and two Premier League titles as Chelsea manager, was the subject of continual scrutiny last season and hinted at an exit last summer when he admitted he 'was a bit fed up with certain things' at the club.<br><br>Many betting companies have stopped taking odds on Mourinho quitting Chelsea, but the club have yet to confirm the reports.<br><br>After three-years at the London club the self-styled 'Special One' is expected to take training for the final time on Thursday, when he will say good bye to his players.<br><br>Chelsea's next match is against Premier League champions Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: midnightblue;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>GRANT STEPS UP FOLLOWING MOURINHO'S DEPARTURE</strong><br><br>Chelsea moved swiftly following the shock departure of Jose Mourinho as they announced that director of football Avram Grant and assistant manager Steve Clarke will take charge of the first team.<br><br>Mourinho, who won every domestic trophy during his time at Stamford Bridge, left by 'mutual consent', according to a club statement issued in the early hours of this morning.<br><br>Grant, who moved to Chelsea in the summer as director of football, will be assisted by Mourinho's number two and former club captain Steve Clarke.<br><br>A club statement read: 'Chelsea can confirm that Avram Grant and Steve Clarke will be in charge of the first team from today (Thursday).<br><br>'The club is delighted that in Avram we have an experienced man who can come in immediately at this difficult time to help deliver our objectives.<br><br>'In Steve we have a Chelsea man and he will be a crucial part of the management team going forward. Avram and Steve have our full confidence and support.'<br><br>Grant's appointment is understood to be permanent and will come as no surprise to many of the club's fans.<br><br>The former Israel coach has a close relationship with the club's billionaire owner Roman Abramovich and moved to Chelsea despite stiff opposition from Mourinho.<br><br>Abramovich saw Grant as the man to get the best out of misfiring striker Andriy Shevchenko and Mourinho finally agreed to his arrival on the understanding that he had no influence on team affairs.<br><br>But in the light of Mourinho's sudden exit, Chelsea have turned to Grant to prepare the side for Sunday's crucial Premier League clash with Manchester United at Old Trafford.<br><br>Mourinho is understood to have said his goodbyes to the players at the club's Cobham training ground on Thursday morning.<br><br>Grant spent his first year in England living in Harry Redknapp's shadow at Portsmouth but his move to Chelsea saw him become the go-between and co-ordinator of long-term strategy, reporting to chief executive Peter Kenyon at Stamford Bridge.<br><br>The role - which reportedly earned him Â£800,000 a year - also included a seat on the club's board.<br><br>Grant, who is married to actress Tzofit, certainly knows how to network and also undoubtedly has the ability to charm the most dogmatic of managers.<br><br>Upon Grant's arrival at Chelsea a defensive Mourinho warned: 'He must not interfere with the power I have in relation to my job.'<br><br>Grant took up the position of technical director at Portsmouth in June 2006 and soon won the glowing praise of boss Redknapp.<br><br>'I've found [him] to be very knowledgeable, an absolute gentleman and a nice person to have at the club - he has got a good knowledge of the game and of foreign players,' said Redknapp.<br><br>That knowledge stems from a lifetime of studying football tactics and systems.<br><br>Grant began coaching at the age of 19 having never played the game professionally.<br><br>He won the youth championship with Hapoel Petach Tikva and was then appointed to coach the senior team, becoming the youngest ever manager in the Israeli top division.<br><br>Grant then moved to Maccabi Tel Aviv, guiding the club to a first league title in 13 years, before taking over at the helm of Israel's glamour club, Maccabi Haifa, where he won two championships.<br><br>The national team subsequently beckoned and Grant entered the history books as Israel's youngest manager.<br><br>His record split opinion, however, as Israel failed to qualify for the 2006 World Cup despite remaining unbeaten in a group with the Republic of Ireland, France and Switzerland.<br><br>He resigned in November 2005 because of the Israeli FA's reluctance to open contract talks.<br></span></span><br><br>To me this hardly seems like someone qualified enough to step into JM's shoes and to take on a team like Chelsea. But when Chelsea announced Grant's arrival I was expecting something like this the moment JM slipped up.<br><br>I would be interested to see how we fair against Man U but for once I don't harbour hopes of even the narrowest of wins  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>I will miss JM.

            <div class='col-md body'>From a Man U fan, its really disappointing to see Jose Mourinho being treated like this.. Though arrogant, he is truly a special one and being a rival fan, its frustrating to see how he transform a group of players to a team of players.. Not many managers can do that.. He got style and Chelsea has lost their biggest asset. Even Roman's cash is not as big an asset to Chelsea as Jose. Good. Jose deserve a better club who knows how to treat him better.. All de best Jose..</div>
