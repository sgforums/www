So I am happy with all of these things.<br><br>Â“Why should I comment on RafaÂ’s words. Sometimes we say things without thinking Â— especially when we lose,Â” Mourinho concluded.<br><br>Benitez, somewhat sarcastically, had criticised Arjen RobbenÂ’s tumble at the hands of Reina, suggesting: Â“I thought maybe he will be three weeks in hospital with a neck broken. Reina has made a mistake. Robben was talking to him and he turned and touched his face.Â”<br><br>ChelseaÂ’s other winger, Damien Duff made a brief substitute appearance lasting just five minutes before going off to an injury which looks likely to rule him out of the FA Cup game against Everton on Wednesday.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s muscular but nothing big,Â” explained the Blues manager. Â“Maybe one week, ten days, two weeks maximum.Â”<br><br>Mourinho maintained that scoring the first goal was vital to todayÂ’s victory, a win which puts us 21 points ahead of Liverpool and 15 ahead of second-placed Manchester United.<br><br>Â“If you score against them first, you have great conditions to do what we did in Anfield and what we did today. Today the game was tight until we scored the first goal. After that it was our game. Before that they are very solid and defend very well.<br><br>Â“This is the kind of performance that makes everybody understand why we are champions and are close to be champions again,Â” Mourinho stated.<br><br>With 13 Premiership games remaining, JosÃ© explained the maths required to win the title again.<br><br>Â“We need eight victories, itÂ’s as simple as that. We need to win these matches as soon as we can. The important thing is to be champions again.Â”<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">- credit: Gill Lester, Official Chelsea FC Website, 5 Feb 2006</span></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Although JM said 8 wins will do, the chasing pack will have to win every single game in order to catch up. Also, they must improve their goal difference.<br><br>Looking at the fixtures, it is very unlikely.<br><br>Furthermore, after the loss to Chelsea, Liverpool has to bounce back. From the looks of things on the game against Chelsea, I can see only people like Carragher, Hyypia and Riise looking steady enough. Even Gerrard seemed out of sorts towards the end of the game. Alonso and Garcia did not contribute much.<br><br>It was a very different Liverpool from the last time we met them at the Champions League.<br><br>By the way, Liverpool let in 15 goals this season, Chelsea accounted for 6 of the goals. If they could have stopped Chelsea, they would have been the best defensive team. Problem is, they can't score. Now who says Chelsea is boring.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>from soccernet.<br><br>Updated: Feb. 7, 2006<br>Robben deserves an Oscar says Reina<br><br>Liverpool goalkeeper Jose Reina has branded Chelsea winger Arjen Robben an actor who deserves an Oscar for his performance at Stamford Bridge on Sunday.<br><br>But Robben has hit back, claiming: 'I wasn't the one who lost control.'<br><br>Spaniard Reina was shown the red card for pushing Dutchman Robben in the face nine minutes from time in Chelsea's 2-0 league win.<br><br>Liverpool decided not to appeal against referee Alan Wiley's decision, which caused a storm of controversy because of Robben's theatrical reaction to the goalkeeper's tame push.<br><br>It means Reina will serve an automatic three-match suspension, starting with tomorrow's Barclays Premiership encounter with Charlton at The Valley. The ban will also include Saturday's early afternoon kick-off against Wigan at the JJB Stadium, and the Anfield showdown with Arsenal on February 14.<br><br>'I am furious with Robben for what happened. My red card was unjust, which makes it so sad for me,' Reina told the Daily Star.<br><br>'Robben is a big actor and he did well enough to win an Oscar. I would never hit out at another player and hurt them in the way Robben suggested by collapsing.<br><br>'Robben is an excellent player but he was deceitful with the way he behaved.<br><br>'He exaggerated what happened and therefore forced the referee to send me off. If we had been at Anfield, I would never have got a red card.<br><br>'There was also a lot of pressure from the crowd. My team-mates feel the same and are very angry.<br><br>'This has now harmed the team in the championship because at the moment we need all our players available and I will now be banned for three games.'<br><br>But Robben is stunned he is being blamed and, according to the Daily Mail, told Dutch television: 'Reina was the one who got carried away, not me. He made a crazy challenge on Eidur (Gudjohnsen) over by the touchline and I told him so when he ran past on his way back to the goal.<br><br>'I can't remember the exact words I used, but it was something along the lines of `That was a stupid thing to do, wasn't it?'<br><br>'The next thing I know, he swings round and reacts with his hands.<br><br>'I don't see how I can be blamed for that. I wasn't the one who lost control.<br><br>'I don't think people from Liverpool should be talking about me, either. They should be having a look at themselves.'<br></div>

"I didn't make really crazy tackles and I didn't do stupid things. I tried to play in control all the time. If you lose control on the pitch you are asking for red cards.<br><br>"You can't say the game hasn't changed from 20 years ago when I was still running around. I remember touching some players on the face 20 years ago and they would go down just the same.<br><br>"The stick Arjen got was unjustified and we can't understand the criticism we get. We deserve a lot more credit. On Sunday we beat one of our big rivals for the title and we got no real credit for it because of comments made at the end of the game. It is not fair.<br><br>"Everything else was spoken about except how well we played to win the game."<br><br>Everton boss David Moyes accepted his side had been well beaten but said their cause had not been helped by the loss of goalkeeper Richard Wright with an ankle injury in the pre-match warm-up.<br><br>It forced Moyes to play 21-year-old rookie Iain Turner in his place.<br><br>Moyes said: "We did much better in the second half but losing the goalkeeper in the warm up was a setback. You don't want to lose anybody, especially a goalkeeper, when you have named your side.<br><br>"We have taken x-rays of Richard's ankle and there is no damage there but it was like a balloon in the dressing room.<br><br>"The second half performance was more like us but it is disappointing to lose goals to set-pieces."<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"> -credit: Sporting Life</span></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No doubt Reina was at fault, Robben himself may have overreacted. THis reminds me of what happened at World Cup 98 between England and Argentina.<br><br>BTW, how about having Ghimpheng for mod? I believe he can make much contribution.</div>
