            <div class='col-md body'>from soccernet.<br><br>Updated: Feb. 9, 2006<br><br><strong>Benitez vows Reds will learn from mistakes</strong><br><br>Rafael Benitez admits Liverpool have to learn from their recent slump in form if they are to challenge for honours this season.<br><br>The Reds slipped to a third straight away Barclays Premiership defeat when they were beaten 2-0 at Charlton last night, despite dominating much of the match, especially in the first half.<br><br>It is now just one point from a possible 12 for Benitez's team, who soon face a showdown with Arsenal, next Tuesday, before then taking on Manchester United in the fifth round of the FA Cup ahead of their Champions League clash with Benfica.<br><br>And the Liverpool manager expects a more professional showing from his side when they take on Wigan this weekend.<br><br>'We need to change things and to improve, but you cannot talk about the work-rate because the team worked very hard,' said Benitez, his side still in third, but again missing the chance to close the gap on United following Sunday's loss at champions-elect Chelsea.<br><br>'The problem for me was the mistakes, that means we need to improve and to learn with experience.'<br><br>The Liverpool manager declared: 'If you want to win trophies, you need to control these situations.'<br><br>Even without the drive of captain Steven Gerrard, absent through injury, Liverpool created the better chances during the opening exchanges, and the Addicks rarely threatened.<br><br>However the match turned in the final five minutes of the first half, with Darren Bent netting a controversial penalty and then skipper Luke Young doubling his side's lead in stoppage time when reacting first to drill a loose ball past stand-in goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek.<br><br>Benitez said: 'I cannot explain after 40 minutes of one-way traffic that we can lose a game like that in five minutes - it is unbelievable.'<br><br>On the spot-kick decision after 42 minutes, when Bent went down under the challenge of Dudek, the Liverpool manager declared: 'It was not a penalty, that was clear.<br><br>'You can see the video, and will have your own opinion.'<br><br>Benitez added: 'We cannot change the mistakes of other people, we need to learn from ours.'<br><br>Charlton again weathered plenty of pressure after the restart, but were much better value during the second half.<br><br>They twice hit the woodwork, first when Darren Bent rattled the crossbar and then when strike partner Marcus Bent drove his shot against the base of a post.<br><br>It was only Charlton's fifth home Premiership win of a campaign which has, by the admission of manager Alan Curbishley, been 'topsy-turvy', a blistering start followed by a wretched run of league form.<br><br>'They went out and defended for their lives, and because of way Liverpool controlled it we had to,' the Addicks boss said, admitting his team had been a bit 'lucky' to have been awarded a spot-kick by referee Andre Marriner.<br><br>'Then we got the bonus of the goals, which gave us something to hold on to and in the second half we were not under that much pressure.'<br><br></div>
