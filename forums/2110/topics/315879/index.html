              Been so queit lately around here.
              
              Anyway, just my own thoughts on the match that passed.
              
              It was a deserved win for Chelsea who were the more spirited side of the two and could easily have gone 2 up at least within the first half and I think both should have been scored by Joe Cole.
              
              Man U seemed contented to try and play for a draw which is probably why they lost. Man U seemed content to just be holding the ball for most of the time and although they tried to catch Chelsea on the offside on a number of occassions, their holding on to the ball didn't match with this.
              
              A turning point in the game was when Vidic left the pitch injured because you could see how Wes Brown couldn't cope in central defence and Vidic was so much stronger in the air. The first goal came after some good play by Drogba who held off a Man U player to cross the ball in for Ballack.
              
              And it required a mistake by Chelsea for Man U to score and despite scoring, I still feel Rooney is not cut out to be a lone striker.
              
              Didn't see the supposed handball by Carrick so can't comment, but referee did make the decision based on linesman's call.
              
              To just comment on one other flashpoint in the game, The New Paper mentioned about how Ferguson felt the challenge by Ballack on Ronaldo should have been penalty, but seriously how could that be a penalty? This kind of pushing and shoving happens very often at set pieces and the ref would at most stop the set piece from being taken and have a word with the players involved. But if Ronaldo had fallen over? Well.... Let's just be glad he didn't, otherwise a lot of pointless arguing would have gone on.
              
              Nice to have Chelsea win as a tribute to Frank Lampard's mum, it makes the title race that much more interesting.
              
              Man U is in the slighlty better position as Chelsea is behind on goal difference and has to face a Bolton side that is most likely fighting for premiership survival and would throw everything at Chelsea with nothing to lose.
              
              It's going to be an interesting last two matches.

              <p>Tomorrow I will support West Ham. But West Ham manager Alan Curbishley foolishly said if ManU loses the EPL title this year, it would be a great injustice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What the hell is he trying to imply? Especially when they are playing ManU this weekend.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By the way, I expect ManU will be a bit rattled and may drop points in the last 2 games. Chelsea on the other hand is feeling the rush and belief that they can beat anyone. ManU may be favourites but Chelsea is not going to let them do things their way</p>

              <p>Hi eemtij,</p>
              <p>I'm just sick and tired of how the people here in sgforums are so focused on their conflict with each other to the point that football itself takes a backseat. Doesn't help that your discussion involves 798 who has proven to me that his agenda against people takes precedence over everything and it's not just in the soccer related forums.</p>
              <p>Proper discussion of football in sgforums is a farce and simply doesn't happen. I feel it's perfectly fine for people to like different clubs and different types of football. But here it simply goes beyond that. People like 798 and the clonemaster simply let their blind hate and agenda get the better of them.</p>
              <p>But since you ask, I will start another lampard thread. Just not today. Give me a while. Cheers</p>

              <p>Your problem is you let your agenda guide the things you do.</p>
              <p>No, not going to kill you. Ability or not, I have no intention to kill you.</p>
              <p>Funny you are telling me not to take the forum so seriously yet you have been the one trying to draw sides. You try to get people to 'your side', and when people don't agree to you, you treat them as enemies.</p>
              <p>You really need to listen to your own advice sometimes and not be such a hypocrite.</p>
