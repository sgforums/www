            <div class='col-md body'>Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho insists there is no problem between himself and Roman Abramovich.<br><br>Mourinho's future at Chelsea has been the subject of debate in recent months because of an alleged rift with Abramovich.<br><br>However, the Portuguese tactician says there is no rift between the duo after Abramovich returned to Stamford Bridge for the first time in six games to watch Saturday's FA Cup win over Norwich City.<br><br>"He (Abramovich) does not have explain himself to me," said Mourinho. "This is his house. This is his club.<br><br>"He does not need to give an explanation why he is not here. We work for him; he does not work for us.<br><br>"When he's back to his house, not our house, he can do what he likes.<br><br>"When he's back in our dressing room, it is good for us. If he is with the players afterwards it is very, very good.<br><br>"There are no problems here."<br><br>Meanwhile, Didier Drogba admits his goalscoring exploits will count for nothing, if Chelsea do not win anything this season.<br><br>The Blues are still competing on four fronts after safely negotiating their passage into the quarter-finals of the FA Cup on Saturday with a 4-0 win over The Canaries.<br><br>Drogba scored his 26th goal of the season in the 4-0 rout, but he has put club success before any personal achievements.<br><br>"The goals will count for nothing, if we don't win anything this season," Drogba said.<br><br>"I prefer collective gratification to individual glory. It's far more important that the team are successful.<br><br>"I'm in the best form of my career and it's fair to say at the moment every time I go on the pitch, I genuinely believe I'm going to score. You can't beat confidence and at the moment, I have it in abundance.<br><br>"But the main priority is the team and it doesn't matter how many goals I score, if they don't contribute to the success of Chelsea."</div>
