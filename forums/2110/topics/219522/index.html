            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">Chelsea's Mourinho: Drogba best in world<br>tribalfooball.com - November 11, 2006<br><br>Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho hailed Didier Drogba as the "best striker in the world" after their 4-0 thumping of Watford.<br>Drogba took his tally for the season to 14 with goals in the 27th, 36th and 69th minutes and then turned provider to help strike partner Andriy Shevchenko score Chelsea's third in the 53rd minute.<br><br>The win, Chelsea's second four-goal haul in as many days, restored points parity with Manchester United at the top of the Barclays Premiership but Mourinho was full of praise for destroyer Drogba.<br><br>He said: "There is an improvement in his game in every aspect. He is very strong and he looks very sharp.<br><br>"He is great in the air and very strong in defensive actions. He is at the top of his game. Now it is just a question of him staying there for a long time.<br><br>"At the moment I don't think there is anybody better in the world scoring or playing like him.<br><br>"He is scoring in every competition - the Premiership, the Champions League, the Carling Cup. He is playing amazing stuff.<br><br>"His improvement has been at every level. I don't like to use the word unstoppable but he is great in every aspect of his game. He attacks the ball, he dominates in the air, he holds the ball well, he is at the top of his game. I never saw a better Drogba than now."<br><br>While Drogba took the individual honours, Chelsea swept Watford aside thanks to a midfield trio that gets more accomplished with every game.<br><br>Claude Makelele, Frank Lampard and Michael Ballack were always in control as Watford struggled to cope with a Chelsea side that never reached top gear all afternoon.<br><br>Mourinho added: "At the moment with the way our midfield is playing, it is easy to be a striker.<br><br>"Our midfield is playing fantastic. Watford play direct football but they know what they are doing on the pitch.<br><br>"If you don't defend well then you are in trouble but we did very well in that aspect.<br><br>"We scored four goals and it was quite a good game. We played very consistent and collectively it was a good performance. It was also a positive performance individually. I am happy with the points and the performance."<br><br>Watford boss Adrian Boothroyd was the second manager in four days to visit Stamford Bridge and accept his side were well beaten.<br><br>Watford never had any firepower to trouble the champions and Boothroyd offered no excuses.<br><br>He said: "We were not unlucky. They were far better than us on the day and we got what we deserved.<br><br>"I thought we gave them some problems for the first half-hour. They were panicking a bit but they are machine and ground out a result.<br><br>"They had a purple patch in the second half and are an exceptional team and were terrific."<br><br>Boothroyd also singled out Drogba as the "epitome of a modern-day professional" after the Blues striker had ruined his day.<br><br>He added: "He epitomises what a professional should be. He's quick and got everything a top player should have.<br><br>"But what makes him a true professional in my opinion is that he was chasing down the back four in the 93rd minute. That's all you can ask, that they give their all and he does that."</span></div>

He's the best striker in the world at the moment."</span><br><br><span style="color: green;">Chelsea's Geremi: Drogba has learned Premiership ways<br>tribalfooball.com - November 12, 2006<br><br>Geremi is convinced Chelsea teammate Didier Drogba's superb form this season is down to learning the ways of the Premiership - and ending his diving.<br>Geremi said: "Everybody has to learn. People say Didi was diving and he has improved a lot since then. Now he is not diving and he tries to be strong because that is the way to be in the Premiership. Now he is in his best form.<br><br>"He has learned a lot in the time he has been here. He now knows the Premiership better than ever but now he is doing what he knows best which is to score goals. That is what is best about him.<br><br>"You have to understand that he has come from France.<br><br>"That is a very different league and with some players it takes time to adapt. That is what has happened for Didi. Now he is familiar with the league and that's why he is different.<br><br>"He is unstoppable. He is scoring all the time and it's difficult to say if there is a team he won't score against."<br><br>There is one side looming in the minds of everyone at Stamford Bridge - leaders Manchester United.<br><br>Geremi, who appears to have solved Jose Mourinho's dilemma at right-back, is adamant what they must do before the match at Old Trafford in two weeks.<br><br>He said: "We need to keep pressure on United. We don't want the gap to get any bigger because we have to play them at Old Trafford and we don't want to be further behind before we get there. Before the game there it could be an advantage to just be on their shoulder. And we have to win every game until that day." </span></div>
