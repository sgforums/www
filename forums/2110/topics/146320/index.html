But palace intrigue and politics impede Jang-geum, as her fellow ladies compete to earn the KingÂ’s favour and secure the top female positions in the Royal Kitchen. But Jang-geum is far from ordinary. With her remarkable determination and wisdom, she takes on even greater odds, challenging numerous foes and even society to achieve a position never before held by a woman in ancient Korean history.<br><br><strong>Cast:</strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Suh Jang-geum</span> Â… Lee Young-ae<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Lt General Min Jung-ho</span> Â… Jin Jin-hee<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Choi Geum-young</span> Â… Hong Ri-na<br><span style="font-style: italic;">King Jung-jong</span> Â… Im Ho<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Lady Han</span> Â… Yang Mi-gyeong<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Lady Choi</span> Â… Gyeon Mi-ri<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Yeon-saeng</span> Â… Park Eun-hye<br><br><strong>Main locations DJG shot in:</strong><br>DGJ was shot in Seoul and Jeju Island amongst other parts of Korea.

            <div class='col-md body'>I know it was a big hit in HongKong and overflowed to Toronto.  It was first shown on our Mandarin cable but I didn't watch it.  Time slot not good for me.<br><br>Currently, it is shown on the Cantonese cable, although on Saturdays only, I still didn't watch it.<br><br>Somehow, not so motivated to watch Korean dramas.  But enjoyed Hkg, Sg, Twn or China/Twn/Sg/Hkg collaborations type.<br><br>Okay, I may try to catch it some time.  But that general guy is really good looking.  Even my husband said so.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">   I like the "small chang jin".  She is cute and seems smart.

I like the way she says <span style="font-style: italic;">"ne"</span> to her seniors, with the slight furrowing of her brows! If I had a child like that, I can imagine how difficult it's going to be for me to not spoil her <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I've heard nothing but praises about this drama for some time now but 70 episodes ...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  Then it came to Ch.55, I watched the first few episodes and was completely hooked. I was estatic to have received the DVD set as a gift, am now into my 60th ep and I have to say DJG is really very good.<br><br>I watch Sg/HK serials too (well, haven't followed an Sg serial for some time now), just not Taiwanese ones!</div>
