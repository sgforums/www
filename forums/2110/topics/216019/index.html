            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">1. Will Cuducini play or will JM let Hilario carry on his duties. - Hilario even though his experience is much lesser than Cuducini but i personally think that Hilario is a better keeper for now<br><br>2. Will Shev play? - sheva will play (RA pet) but will be drop 1 day if JM is losing<br><br>3. Will Drogba play? He was injured in the first half against Barca but carried on. - Yes Drogba is a warrior and on hot form and he seems to shaken off the injury anyway<br><br>4. Will JM use the same formation as against Barca - No I don't think he will he will improvise it</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">Mourinho sets more goals goal<br>Saturday, Oct 21, 2006<br>JosÃ© Mourinho has given his players the target of upping the teamÂ’s goals-per-chance ratio against Portsmouth this afternoon.<br><br>The Chelsea boss is conscious of the tough challenge the fourth-placed side, just three points behind in the Premiership table, will provide at the Bridge.<br><br>Ruthlessness plus maintaining the mental intensity of the Barcelona game is the key to not dropping points, as happened in the last Premiership home game, versus Aston Villa.<br><br>Against Reading because we didnÂ’t have a lot of chances to score, especially because we were playing with ten men for so long,Â’ Mourinho begins. He was talking to Chelsea TV at FridayÂ’s final training session, held at Stamford Bridge.<br><br>But against Aston Villa and Barcelona, the two last games at home, we had so many chances to score but at the end of these 120 minutes, we had scored twice.<br><br>We have to try to put our level of scoring goals better. We have to score more goals with less chances.Â’<br><br>With at least one out of Manchester United and Liverpool guaranteed to drop points when the two teams meet on Sunday, Mourinho will order his players to set a strong early pace for the weekend and not bathe in the Barcelona win.<br><br>I have to tell them that after a big game with a very good result, it happens a lot a negative game and a very bad result.<br><br>When it happens, it is not because players are tired. It is because mentally you just relax. That is what I have to try to fight by speaking with the players to keep them alert.<br><br>One day we will have to stop our incredible record at home, but we have to delay that to  the maximum we can.Â’<br><br>Chelsea are 48 league games unbeaten at the Bridge. Mourinho confirmed that Carlo Cudicini is not yet ready to resume playing. Hilario will make his second Chelsea start on his 31st birthday.<br><br>Apart from the goalkeepers, the manager reports a few minor fitness niggles in the squad but no further players ruled out.<br><br>Portsmouth have good, experienced players and manager. The game is difficult,Â’ he warned.</span></div>
