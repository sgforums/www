            <div class='col-md body'>In that case. Tevez is a good choice now that Crespo is with Inter for another season and Shevchenko's future still remains uncertain. Maybe Torres or Villa. Since Alex is procured, the back line is more or less stable. Maybe a good right back?<br><br>The midfield is packed, so no change. I suspect off loading may occur in there......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My guess <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"><br><br>When the Chelsea management board finally decides on who controls what, the drama that so much hampered Chelsea last season will NOT occur again. Let Abramovich enjoy the matches and work out the overall picture with the board. Let Mourinho worry about the team and purchases and team staff himself.<br><br>Chelsea's current squad is already powerful enough to take on ANY team. BUT barring any new transfers, Mourinho may have to sacrifice a few players and replay his most feared formation that so dominated the league 2 seasons ago for 2 consecutive seasons.<br><br>Meaning 4-1-2-2-1<br><br>With the backline more or less the same, Essien now has to take over Makelele's role in the Holding midfield as Makelele is nearing retirement. In central midfield, the mainstay definately has to be Lampard. Supporting him will be Essien, Ballack and Obi Mikel.<br><br>Why not put Ballack with Lampard? We see how things were still NOT sorted out in the last season when Mourinho tried to accomodate the 2 of them together. The pairing's true potential will be realised when one factor is solved: the number of front line men.<br><br>The flanks more or less are the same BUT it will be better if either Robben stays injury free OR they get 1 more winger. Since SWP is purchased, might as well make the FULL use of him.<br><br>The striker's department is really a no-brainer. Drogba is the main man for the lead. Shevchenko may have to take a back seat if he remains. Kalou will have to fight for a regular spot. Depending on the formation and how he fits, I don't see Kalou gets more chances than Drogba. I have not factor in any procurement of new strikers, so it may subject to change.<br><br>GK: Cech<br><br>RB: Fereirra<br>CD: Carvalho<br>CD: Terry<br>LB: Cole<br><br>(Alex is capable of competing with Terry and Carvalho. So problem solved in that area. Supporting them will be Geremi, Boulahrouz and Bridge.)<br><br>DM: Essien<br><br>(Makelele will play lesser depending on formation.)<br><br>CM: Lampard<br>CM: Ballack<br><br>(As I said, much will depend on Mourinho's preference for players' line up against his formation in use. Essien may take over Ballack in many occassions next season. Supporting them will be Obi Mikel and other players I have not mentioned.)<br><br>RW: Robben<br>LW: Cole<br><br>(Why is Robben is on the right flanks? I've seen him do as much damage on the right as on the left, but Cole is better on the left, so that's why. Supporting them is only SWP. Please SWP... make up your mind and be a good player in which many saw your potential.)<br><br>ST: Drogba<br><br>(If Mourinho plays this formation, Drogba will be the headliner of the team. If Mourinho plays 2 strikers, then we will more or less see the same side of last season. Supporting him will be Shevchenko and Kalou.)<br><br></div>
