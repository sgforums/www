"I don't know what the people who organise these world awards do at the weekends because only English people recognise what this player is.<br><br>"He was the best player in the Premiership last season and you have some great players in the world but they play one game a month. This player is top in every game.<br><br>"I would not change him for another player because he does everything. His defence is incredible, he can pass over a long distance, he can pass over short distances, he's professional, he can score goals over long distance, how can he improve? I just hope he carries on because he deserves to break the record for consecutive appearances in the Premier League.<br><br>"David James has the record and he is a keeper. That is completely different because a keeper has more chances to play."<br><br>Chelsea stormed into a two-goal lead inside the first 13 minutes through a Didier Drogba header and Lampard penalty after Andy Todd had fouled John Terry.<br><br>But Blackburn were back in it when Craig Bellamy converted a spot-kick of their own five minutes later and Petr Cech gifted Bellamy a second when he made a hash of clearing a backpass from Asier del Horno.<br><br>Lampard put Chelsea back in front with a curling free-kick and Joe Cole made the points safe with a fourth in the 74th minute.<br><br>Mourinho made no changes at half-time because he felt his side had gifted Rovers their goals and told his players to concentrate on scoring more at the other end.<br><br>"We played very well and the pace of the game was very high," said Mourinho. "We were better than them and they had one shot at goal.<br><br>"I told the players we had scored four goals in the first half and so we have to score more more goals but in the right end. I would have have been stupid to make changes at half-time so I didn't."<br><br>Mourinho is so delighted with 10 wins and one draw from their first 11 games that he joked about experiencing the downside of the game with Chelsea one day when asked if his side were now back on track after their difficult week.<br><br>"Back on track? Ten wins and one draw - back on track? I hope to be here enough years to have the experience of my team being in a very difficult position. It will be bad for me but I will enjoy. Back on track? Mamma mia!"<br><br>Blackburn boss Mark Hughes was sent from the dug-out by referee Mike Riley in the second half - moments before Lampard put Chelsea 3-2 in front.<br><br>But while he did not think his relocation to the stand had anything to do with the result, he accused Chelsea of stirring up the row over last season's ill-tempered game at Ewood Park with a number of comments in their matchday programme.<br><br>Hughes was unhappy with Chelsea goalkeeper Cech who criticised Paul Dickov for a challenge in that game. The Chelsea stopper said: "Dickov almost ripped my stomach. I can't remember a more painful kick in a long time."<br><br>Hughes responded by saying: "We've had five players booked which reflects badly on us but it was never that kind of game. Maybe he was possibly shaped by the comments in the programme which I was a little bit upset about.<br><br>"I thought the things said in the programme were a little bit wrong. There were bits and pieces in the programme and their goalkeeper mentioned a challenge from Paul which I didn't feel needed to be highlighted in those terms. Referees are only human and maybe they read the programme.<br><br>"It's annoying because every time we play Arsenal or Chelsea, this stuff gets dragged up and we have to try to defend ourselves. But I thought our play in the first half was excellent. We started badly and went two down very early but fair play to our lads we came straight back and caused them problems.<br><br>"We felt we could get something from the game but getting sent to the stand doesn't make my job any easier.<br><br>"I'm a little bit confused as to why the referee felt it was necessary to send me to the stand. I wasn't happy with a couple of decisions. I jumped up to get the referee's attention but he ignored me so I kicked a bag.<br><br>"The fourth official, who I felt was a little bit pedantic all afternoon, decided it was time for me to sit in the stand. Apparently I ignored him three times."<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">- credit: Sporting Life</span></span><br><br>Woah, Mark Hughes, at least admit it when your boys play rough - it wasn't just Dickov, Savage was equally horrid <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> The number of Chelsea players that were hacked away at back then was plain shameful <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.soccernet.com/design05/images/domr/swp275_pc_g.jpg"><br><br><span style="color: midnightblue;"><strong>JOSE'S PARTY-POOPERS<br><br>Chelsea 4-2 Blackburn Rovers</strong><br><br>I came to Stamford Bridge with my party hat at the ready, yet Jose Mourinho's unstoppable champions are refusing to start the national celebrations that are apparently imminent.<br><br>According to the increasingly grumpy Chelsea manager, the English nation is holding its breath in anticipation of his side's lengthy unbeaten run coming to an end, yet you wonder whether the man who seems to relish the spotlight more than anyone in football is merely trying to convince himself of a fact that doesn't carry too much weight.<br><br>Jealousy may be an issue when Chelsea's rivals assess their dominant position atop the Premiership table, but Mourinho may have made a rare misjudgement when he makes such protestation. The hatred inspired by Sir Alex Ferguson and his Manchester United side over the years is not yet afflicting the runaway Premiership leaders.<br><br>The 'boring football' tag has been thrown at them relentlessly by some sections of the media in the last 18 months, but their rare off-days are more than compensated by the afternoon's when they are at their thrilling, flowing best. This was very much a helping of the latter in the first 12 minutes of this encounter summed by just why Mourinho's team are set to dominate this league for years to come.<br><br>After back to back draws, Mourinho looked like a man hanging onto his job as he stormed out of Friday's media briefing in a threatening manner, yet it all served to key up his side for a blistering opening that threatened to blow Mark Hughes' Blackburn away.<br><br>Starting with Shaun Wright-Phillips and Joe Cole in the wide positions and Didier Drogba leading the line, this was very much a front three and with Frank Lampard spraying the ball around as only he can behind them, the Blues clicked into top gear from the moment Mike Riley blew his whistle.<br><br>It was a Lampard cross that gave the revitalised Drogba the chance to open the scoring with a deft glancing header after nine minutes and when referee Mike Riley awarded a dubious penalty after John Terry was challenged in the box by Andy Todd, it seemed that Chelsea's 40th unbeaten game was already secured. Lampard just doesn't miss from the spot and he buried this effort in typically clinical fashion.<br><br>Love them or hate them, this was a football team at the peak of their powers, passing the ball like masters and playing with their opponents in a manner that provided evidence of the gulf they have created between themselves and the rest of the Premiership.<br><br>It took another dubious decision from referee Riley to halt them in their tracks as he penalised Ricardo Carvalho for touching Zurab Khizanishvili, yet even after Craig Bellamy brought Blackburn back into the game from the spot, you suspected it would merely be a lull in the proceedings.<br><br>However, Petr Cech ensured this blip had the potential to develop into something much more interesting and that party hat moved an inch closer to my head when the Chelsea keeper made a right mess of his clearance seconds before the break and little Bellamy nipped in to head a stunning second for Rovers.<br><br>Never mind the US military blitz on Baghdad, this was 'shock and awe' of the Premiership variety as Chelsea were pegged back from a seemingly unassailable position and as the second half bludgeoned into action, you could sense the frustration building around Stamford Bridge.<br><br>Tugay was fortunate to get away with a stamp in Michael Essien and with tempers fraying, this game was developing perfectly into the Rovers game plan, so it was ironic that he was the first to see the red midst as his persistent protestations on the touchline saw him sent to the stands eights minutes after the break.<br><br>It was as if he had sent his players out for the second half with the sole intention of winding up the champions and as one Rovers players after the next pulled a Chelsea shirt and fell over bizarrely, the frustration grew for the home side. Any team featuring characters such as Robbie Savage, Bellamy and no-nonsense tough guys such as Tugay and Lucas Neill are bound to inflame any match and they were doing their worst to knock Chelsea out of their stride.<br><br>Step forward Frank Lampard. From all of 35 yards, the England midfielder may not have been shooting at goal, but such was the quality on his cross that it bypassed everyone in the box and bounced past Freidel to allow Chelsea to restore their advantage. In that moment, the visitor's resistance was broken and once Joe Cole's deflected 74th minute shot gave Mourinho's men a fourth goal, the outcome of this match was decided once and for all.<br><br>Lampard and substitute Robben went close to extending the Chelsea lead late on and it led Mourinho to provide another cameo performance before the media. 'Look, we are nine points clear at the top of the table, 40 games unbeaten and you are trying to tell me we needed to get back on track,' he shouted.<br><br>'Back on track? Mama Mia! I look forward to the day when my team is really in need to getting back on track, but it cannot be now. We played so well today and I knew the goals would come in the second half.'<br><br>Mourinho also launched this lavish barrage of praise in the direction of his match winner, Frank Lampard. 'Frank is the best player in the world, no doubt,' he barked. 'How he is not winning all the top prizes in the game is impossible for me to understand. What are these people who give out these awards watching every weekend?<br><br>'The 2005 European Footballer of the Year award should only have one contender and it has to be Frank Lampard. I just hope this boy starts getting the credit he deserves from people outside of England.<br><br>'There are some great players in the game today, but Frank is man of the match every week and there is no area of his game he could improve. I would not swap him for anyone and he was sensational again in this game.'<br><br>Rovers boss Mark Hughes was frustrated after his side battled back from their early setbacks. 'We played the better football in the first half and deserved to be back in the game at half-time,' he said.<br><br>'Whether my sending off had any effect on the game is hard to say, but I felt the fourth official was on my case all afternoon. I don't know why he sent me to the stands, but I felt there were some soft decisions out there for us.'<br><br>This title race is already over after just 11 games and Mourinho has every right to crow on a day when his side proved they can stand up to the toughest of challenges.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">MAN OF THE MATCH</span></strong></span>: Frank Lampard - Brilliant throughout, Mourinho is right to hail Lampard as the most complete player in the world right now.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">FOOD WATCH</span></strong>: Normally so impressive at Stamford Bridge, the hot food was replaced with a helping on sandwiches and chicken legs, much to The Insider's chagrin. However, the slice of apple pie was most welcome. However, it seems Mourinho's growing angst with the media has stretched to the way they are treated on visits to Stamford Bridge as this represented a dip in catering standards.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">BLACKBURN VERDICT</span></strong>: What an annoying bunch of gits? I suppose roughing up your opponents is a tactic of sorts, but the way they go about it is unsavoury. Savage, Dickov, Neill and the rest are as violent as they are talented. 'Any time we play the big teams, we find ourselves trying to defend our reputation and the same is true after this game,' moaned Hughes on a day when SIX of his players were booked. Say no more.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">CHELSEA VERDICT</span></strong>: This was a real test of their metal and the champions came through with flying colours. The theory goes that getting stuck in to Chelsea is the key to beating them, yet Blackburn did that in abundance after the break and they still came up well short. They are well set to go through this season unbeaten.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">- credit: The Insider, ESPNsoccernet</span></div>

But Portsmouth's resistance was then broken after 27 minutes with the poacher's goal from Crespo, who went off injured shortly afterwards.<br><br>A 12th league win of the season seemed inevitable for the Blues who had not conceded a Premiership goal in the second half this season.<br><br>That statistic rarely looked like being ended, although Portsmouth were more ambitious after the break with the vociferous crowd doing their best to raise their side.<br><br>But Pompey were left breathing a sigh of relief after an unmarked Ricardo Carvalho mistimed a header, although it was only a temporary reprieve.<br><br>Dejan Stefanovic brought down Joe Cole and Lampard sent Ashdown the wrong way as he slotted in to extend the visitors' lead.<br><br>Lampard's outing passed the previous record of 159 consecutive league appearances set by keeper David James while at Liverpool. </span><br><br><span style="color: darkseagreen;"><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho:</span></strong><br><br>"Portsmouth had a very difficult time with Joe Cole because he played fantastic. He deserves to come out of the game as a hero and the people did not recognie the work he did.<br><br>"It was a clear penalty and he didn't deserve the reaction he got because he is a very fair player.<br><br>"I think we fought very well. The team were very intelligent in the second half the way we controlled the game and we waited for the right time to kill the game off." </span><br><br><span style="color: midnightblue;"><span style="font-style: italic;">- credit: BBC Sport</span></span></div>
