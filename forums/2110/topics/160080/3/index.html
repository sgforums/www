            <div class='col-md body'>Since 1973...... many of you not born yet.<br><br>I have supported them in the old Div 1, suffered the relegation with them TWICE not once. And also one season almost down to 3rd division.<br><br>Only when Glen Hoddle took over when things started to change for the better. The rest is HISTORY.........(we do have a history after all).<br><br>ZOLA came a bit later......... but he was fantastically good, on and off the pitch. Hope he comes back to Chelsea in the near future as part of the coaching staff.<br><br></div>

"<br><br>Mourinho added: "I do not like to speak about it because it is a difficult job but there were too many mistakes from the linesman. There were 11 offsides and I think the decision was always against us.<br><br>"But I still think it is fantastic when you arrive at the end of January and you have just lost your first two points at home. "<br><br>Charlton manager Alan Curbishley felt his side's draw was a deserved reward for a battling display.<br><br>He said: "We were a little bit tentative in the first half but we worked as hard as we could.<br><br>"At half-time we were 1-0 down to a soft set-play but all I asked of them was to carry on working like that.<br><br>"I also wanted a little bit more composure on the break when we got into good positions - and I think we did that for our goal."<br><br>Curbishley was also full of praise for substitute Marcus Bent, who capped a fine debut with the equaliser.<br><br>"We knew that if he came on he could play in that position - and we also knew that if he played in that position he would want to get in the box and try to get on the end of things," he stated.<br><br>"He demonstrated that he is a Charlton player. He got the goal and then he was chasing back and filling in and perhaps that is a little bit of what we have missed in recent weeks."<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">- credit: BBC Sport</span></span></div>
