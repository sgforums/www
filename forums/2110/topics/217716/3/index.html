            <div class='col-md body'>Chelsea were the better team. They got more REAL chances. Robben as usual, keep missing 1 on 1 with keeper this season. Robben headed one nicely on the bottom left but was saved. (So close)<br>Ballack 1st strike was so close towards the left top corner. 2nd real strike was blast high over the bar with no one defending him in the box. (Really wasted)<br>Lampard got foul in the box where is very obvious but not given.<br>Barca keeper did well in this match.<br>There were chances for Barca too but their chances were all played in the middle of the defend where JT defended well which apply pressure to the player.<br>1st half Barca played better but in the 2nd half Chelsea was clearly the better team which created more chances.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>Me to, its a Chelsea win.</div>

They were under pressure from their own fans going into the game after losing at Stamford Bridge two weeks ago.<br><br>"They are a great side but we are not too sure why they are so cynical. It is a shame when you see world class players trying to get others booked. They tried all game.<br><br>"They were waving cards in the referees' face and it is disappointing when he falls for it. He gave everything their way, but the lads stuck together right to the end. The result says an awful lot about us. We showed them what we are really like as a team.<br><br>"We have played well here in the last couple of years but last night, with the referee against us and everyone against us, we were the better side.<br><br>"I thought we deserved the win, but they are a lot more disappointed than us because they are struggling to qualify.<br><br>"There were quite a few things off the ball, especially in the first half, and sometimes the referee is going to miss it. That is what his assistants are for but he was not even speaking to them or going over to have a conversation to see if they saw anything."<br><br>Frank Lampard added: "I think you need a referee in these sort of games who can stand up and knows when a bit of contact is a foul and isn't. That is when the frustration comes in. A strong referee can cut that out straight away." </span></div>
