            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;">Chelsea's Mourinho sees Lampard meet Diarra axing<br>tribalfooball.com - January 06, 2007<br><br>Chelsea thumped Macclesfield 6-1 to move into the fourth round of the FA Cup.<br>Frank Lampard struck a hat-trick, but was only played after Blues boss Jose Mourinho dropped Lassana Diarra for arriving late.<br><br>Mourinho declared: "Frank Lampard should not have been playing, he should have been on the bench because I like to always have some ammunition on there in case things are not going very well.<br><br>"But Lassana Diarra was 40 minutes late for the team meeting. The meeting was set for 11.30am and he arrived at 12.10pm.<br><br>"The meeting is for the people who are playing and I decided to play Lampard and not youngster Michael Woods because it would have been too much for him to start a game with that responsibility. So I started with Lamps and in the first half he was absolutely crucial for us."<br><br>Lampard put Chelsea in front in the 16th minute from close range but Coca-Cola League Two side Macclesfield stunned the champions when a mistake by Ricardo Carvalho allowed John Murphy to fire an equaliser five minutes before the break.<br><br>But Lampard put Chelsea in front within a minute and when Macclesfield keeper Tommy Lee was red-carded for controversially bringing down Andriy Shevchenko. Lampard converted the spot-kick for his 12th goal of the season.<br><br>The dismissal was a turning point in the game as Town did not possess a reserve goalkeeper on the bench so captain and defender David Morley went in goal.<br><br>But Chelsea completed a rout with further strikes from Shaun Wright-Phillips, Mikel Jon Obi and Carvalho.<br><br>Mourinho said: "It was a game we had to win because we have ambition in the competition.<br><br>"We had to win because we are a team of professionals at a high level and normally Macclesfield are not good enough to beat us.<br><br>"With the score 2-1 in the first half, the game is open and we knew if we scored the third goal, the game would be over.<br><br>"When we scored the third goal and they lost the keeper at the same time and the game was over."<br><br>Shevchenko looked to have slipped before colliding with Lee for the spot-kick and Mourinho defended the Ukrainian from suggestions that he may have dived.<br><br>Mourinho added: "I don't think he dived. It looked a penalty. I feel sorry that it was a red card but it is the law for the game.<br><br>"The referee cannot say 'this is a rich team, this is a poor team, this is a top player, this is a boy'. The rule in the game is 22 players and all of them are the same.<br><br>"If my keeper does that it is a red card, so if their keeper does it, it is a red card. It was not good because the game was over but it is the law. He had to go but I felt sorry for him." </span></div>
