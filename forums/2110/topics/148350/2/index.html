            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: midnightblue;"><strong>BONFREREÂ’S OUT: With World Cup in sight, fan power ousts the coach</strong><br><br>SEOUL Â– Embattled Dutchman Jo Bonfrere has quit as coach of South KoreaÂ’s national team less than a year before the World Cup finals amid a campaign against him by angry fans, the Korea Football Association (KFA) said yesterday. The campaign by South KoreaÂ’s Red Devils went into overdrive last week after the side lost 1-0 to Saudi Arabia in a World Cup qualifying tie.<br><br>Â“Coach Bonfrere tendered his resignation last night, and the KFA technical committee respected his decision to step down,Â” said Lee Hoi-taek, the head of the committee.<br><br>Experts said that it was unlikely that Bonfrere, whose contract ran until the end of the 2006 World Cup Finals in Germany, had gone willingly and South KoreaÂ’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Yonhap</span> news agency said that KFA had sacked him.<br><br>Â“We have not fired him,Â” insisted Lee. Â“It was his decision. He has achieved his goal. However, there is a consensus he is not good enough.Â”<br><br>The 59-year-old Dutchman guided South Korea to a berth in next yearÂ’s tournament, but fans backed by the media, have been clamouring for his removal following a string of poor results.<br><br>Â“We have decided on the switch, judging that it will be difficult for coach Bonfrere to carry out his job normally in the current situation,Â” said Lee.<br><br>Bonfrere took over from Humberto Coelho last June, after the Portuguese coach failed to match the high expectations created by South KoreaÂ’s run to the 2002 World Cup semi-finals under Dutchman Guus Hiddink. Although they have come through the World Cup qualifying round, South Korea have failed to regain their 2002 form, finishing bottom in last monthÂ’s East Asian championships that also involved Japan, China and North Korea. The departure of Bonfrere leaves South Korea without a coach just 10 months before the World Cup finals open next June.<br><br>Â“We should have a new coach in September at the latest,Â” Lee said.<br><br>However, world-class coaches are in short supply and judging by experience, the KFA will have a hard job ahead and little time to work with. Some commentators are urging the association to replace Bonfrere with a Korean coach, naming former international Cha Beum-keun, currently coach of league side Suwon Bluewings, or national under-20 manager Park Sung-hwa. One contender has already turned the job down as a poisoned chalice.<br><br>Former national coach Kim Ho said he would never take the job again because of the pressure and politics involved. Â“There are places I donÂ’t want to go, even if the fans want me to,Â” he told the <span style="font-style: italic;">Korea Times</span>.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">- credit: Today newspapers, 24 August 2005</span></span></div>
