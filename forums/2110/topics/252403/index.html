            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">Chelsea midfielder Michael Essien has expressed his relief after a blood test revealed he was not over the legal drink-drive limit when arrested last week.<br><br>Essien had been arrested prior to Chelsea's Champions League semi-final first leg game against Liverpool at Stamford Bridge.<br><br>The Ghana international was suspended for the tie but returned for the second leg at Anfield on Tuesday night.<br><br>Chelsea crashed out of the competition for the second time in three years at the semi-final stage when Liverpool won a dramatic penalty shoot-out 4-1.<br><br>But Essien has now been given the all-clear by police following a blood test which revealed he was not in breach of the law.<br><br>Essien declared: 'I would never drink and drive and I am glad the blood test results came back and confirmed that I was not over the limit.<br><br>'The people close to me know that I don't really drink anyway but I certainly would never be so irresponsible to put my own and other peoples' lives at risk.<br><br>'I am very aware also that footballers are role models to a lot of young kids and I take that seriously so would not want any kids to think that I would behave in an irresponsible way. That is why I wanted to clear my name and make sure people know I am a responsible person and was not over the limit.<br><br>'This story has caused a lot of upset also to my mum and family in Ghana. There has been a lot of things written about me that are just not true. It's important to me that people write the truth - that I was not over the limit. There are no charges being brought against me.<br><br>'As far as I was concerned the police were doing their job, I happily co-operated with them, even signed autographs for some of the officers' kids. I presumed when I was allowed to drive home after two-and-a-half hours at the station that they were happy I was not over the limit.'  </span></div>
