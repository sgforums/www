"He wants to play and we never guarantee players they'll play."<br><br>Bridge has only made two appearances since October after returning from an ankle injury he picked up last February in a game against Newcastle.<br><br>Although Mourinho is content with keeping Bridge happy by loaning him out, it is believed he is unlikely to sell the player, who was a Â£7m capture from Southampton in July 2003.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">- credit: BBC Sport</span></span></div>

Carlo Cudicini has agreed to stay until 2009.<br><br>Cech said of his signing: Â“I am very pleased. When I joined Chelsea I just wanted to get in the team and win some trophies. I managed that last season and have been rewarded with a new contract already. Now I want to win some more trophies.Â”<br><br>Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon added: Â“We are obviously delighted that Petr has committed to Chelsea for another two years until 2010. He had a fantastic season in his first year and established himself as one of the top goalkeepers in the world. It was always our intention to keep him for longer than his initial contract as he has a key role to play in the long-term development and success of the team.Â”<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">- credit: Paul Mason, Official Chelsea FC Website, 1 Feb 2006</span></span></div>
