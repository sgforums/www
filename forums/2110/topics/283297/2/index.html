Difficulties in coming to terms range from...<br><br>Losing interest in Chelsea's games<br>Having difficulties in sleeping...<br>Lack enthusiasm in chelsea's next game<br>Blaming Avram Grant for Jose's sacking.<br>Can't stand the sight of Avram Grant.<br>Blaming Roman for Chelsea's fall...<br>Blaming Roman for not supporting Jose in the transfer market... <span class="small">(When he has already spent so much in the last 3 yrs)</span><br>Blaming Roman for Jose's sacking...<br>Blaming Roman for appointing Grant...<br>Blame Kenyon for back stabbing Jose...<br>Blame Shevchenko...<br>Blame Ballack...<br>Blame anything except Jose's recent bad results<br><br>But people fail to see that Mourinho had a serious problem... In some ways, he was taking the club down rather than up... Blaming Roman for Chelsea's fall is totally silly and asking for Roman to go rather than Jose is even more ridiculous...<br><br>It leads me to wonder these so called "New chelsea fans" (Less than 4 yrs) are really chelsea fans or Mourinho's fans? Were they attracted to chelsea cos of Mourinho's arrogant behaviour or the football club itself?<br><br>These people should stop living in the past and look towards the future... Mourinho is gone, dead, kaput, si liao! Mourinho is now in chelsea football club history books. There is no point in mentioning about him or "what if he was there still" anymore... Now its Avram Grant time, and maybe next season someone else... Managers come and go but the club remains. Young boys should not let these changes effect their daily life cos its silly to let something so meaningless to get them so work up...<br><br>Anyway, Mourinho was just another averagely good manager only... But if without Roman's money, he still wouldn't be able to do much... Anyway, i guess many are feeling for him cos of the way he was made to leave Chelsea. In a way, i also feel for the man for the way he was made to leave too... But we have to be realistic and look at what he has done over these last 3 yrs. The titles he won in his first 2 seasons together with the problems he brought upon them wasn't worth it. His arrogance was so great and to such extent that he didn't respect others. Even to his employers... In the end, the "Special One" thought that he could go up against "The Mighty One" but fail miserably... Sacking him in a way made him look better than he really was... and to some chelsea fans, they now look at him as though he was a martyr...<br><br>But if we were to look closer, he seem to have lose his way a bit this season not to mention last... Got lucky at home to Portsmouth, followed by lost to Villa, drew with Blackburn at home and even worse Rosenborg... 2, 3 bad results and even the Chelsea fans didn't want to turn up to watch their team play boring football anymore... Something was seriously wrong already... and with his added problems with Terry, Ballack and Shevchenko... He had to go.<br><br>Mourinho himself probably learned a lesson from all these as well i believe... At the start of this season, he said that he wanted to have better relationship with other clubs managers and not insult them for no reason... Probably he learned to tone down his arrogance but i guess it was a little too late for what he have done over the last 2 Roman didn't forget. Hopefully the next job he gets he will not be so arrogant again or he could end up much worse.<br><br>Seriously, I think there is something gp can learn from all these too... cos i always felt that some part of gp's style is probably fed by mourinho's arrogance... He has a little bit similarity to mourinho probably because he idolize the "The Special One" a little too much for his own good...<br><br><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/KingRom.jpg"><br><span class="small">"The Mighty One"</span><br><br><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/Zombie.jpg"><br><span class="small">Some Chelsea fans can't stand the sight of Zombie looked Avram Grant.</span><br><br></div>

Chelsea was similarly taken over by RA but the fans did not revolt at all.<br><br>Meanwhile, you really should be comparing fan's reaction to JM's leaving with the scenario that SAF got kicked out by his American bosses. That would be a fair comparison.<br><br>Meanwhile, I sadly have to agree that many "new" Chelsea fans are here because of RA's $$$$ and JM's antics. The REAL fans will just have to carry on.
