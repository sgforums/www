            <div class='col-md body'>objectively, despite Chelsea's inability to score goals or defense, Chelsea, together with Arsenal are still the only teams in Premiership yet to taste defeat at home.  Man U, unfortunately cannot claim this credit.  That is something.<br><br>Then again, like all of us here feels, I included, we are talking about this season, not last season or season before last.  Chelsea may be that great that great but this season, they are not that productive in front of goals.  Shev i think puts himself too much pressure &amp; the public gave him too much expectations (I mean who wouldn't if you are transferred on 30mil pounds and paid obscene salary).  As a result, he is now under tremendous scrutiny when he is not producing goals.<br><br>As a striker, Drogba is only right to be selfish, and its sometimes this trait that reaps goals.  Passing of ball is only when you cannot score but its always a 50-50 right?  Given Drogba's skill, he has scored a few spectacular goals that would seem impossible for you and me.<br><br>This year's problem for Chelsea i feel, is the lack of depth of squad.  They do not have the correct replacement for each player.  Terry and Cavalho, both central defenders, when one's out, there's no ready replacement.  Ditto for the left backs and right backs.  Actually strikers as well, if Drogba is injured, who can replace him?  Koulou (spelling) ?  think he is still too inexperienced.  Robben &amp; Cole (when fit) are midfielders, they are not out and out strikers.<br><br>I think Chelsea gonna splash out cash this summer.  But even if you buy a mega-star, one must recognise that they need time to gel and settle down with the team.</div>
