            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">tribalfooball.com - February 23, 2007<br><br>Claude Makelele has lifted the lid on the internal pressure being placed on Chelsea's players and manager Jose Mourinho.<br><br>Makelele, Chelsea's elder statesman at 34, told The Sun: "Now Chelsea have become one of Europe's great clubs there is such pressure on the manager and players from the public and media.<br><br>"And from the owner, who puts pressure on behind the scenes. In truth, we don't really know too much about what is happening. Roman Abramovich does not say a lot but we can see there is so much pressure the club is putting on the manager.<br><br>"It's unbearable, especially for the players. We want to be in the right conditions to win matches and above all trophies. That is difficult with this internal pressure."<br><br>It appears to be a clear call from midfielder Makelele for greater harmony between the boardroom and dressing room at Stamford Bridge.<br><br>And he appreciates Mourinho's attempts to shield his Premiership champions from any dangerous fall-out.<br><br>Makelele added: "The manager has taken all the pressure on himself and has always been behind us. It's impressive.<br><br>"I do feel the internal pressure around the manager. He is managing to handle it and come through it well. The manager hides a huge amount from us. He preserves us from everything internal, the pressure within the club.<br><br>"He doesn't want us to feel that. The objective is not to think of those things.<br><br>"It's to go out and win matches and all the trophies ahead of us. That's the most important thing.<br><br>"We won't do that if we are involved in what's happening between the manager and the club." </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>He is a good manager in a different way....<br><br>He shakes hands with players even from the lower leagues.<br>He throws his EPL medal to the fans.<br>He hugs his players without embarrassment.<br>He is not afraid to make changes. Most of the times correctly.<br>He exudes a certain type of confidence most managers can't.<br>He laughs with his coaching staff and takes care of them. eg Steve Clark.<br><br>His interviews are very very interesting.</div>
