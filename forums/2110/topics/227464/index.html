            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">Jose lays down gauntlet to Fergie<br>Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho has warned Sir Alex Ferguson his champions will be "much stronger" in the second half of the season.<br><br>After leading the way at Christmas the past two seasons, Chelsea find themselves trailing Ferguson's Manchester United.<br><br>Exactly a year ago the Blues were runaway leaders, but ahead of the Boxing Day visit of Reading to Stamford Bridge, they are two points behind United .<br><br>It should perhaps have been four, but for a 93rd-minute winner from Arjen Robben at the JJB Stadium on Saturday.<br><br>Chelsea strolled into a two-goal lead by the half-hour mark, with Frank Lampard and Salomon Kalou on target, only to be pegged back by the 75th minute as Emile Heskey struck twice.<br><br>Mourinho conceded his side were lucky against the Latics, and did not deserve the victory, but Chelsea remain on United's heels.<br><br>They might not be dominating the Premiership, but Mourinho insisted: "We're in a great position.<br><br>"The first half of the season is over. We've played 10 matches away, nine at home, we've played at Old Trafford and the difference is two points.<br><br>"For the second half of the season we will have some important people back to the team.<br><br>"When John Terry, Joe Cole and Petr Cech are back in the team, this is more important than spending money on new players.<br><br>"So for the second part of the season, I feel we can be much stronger."<br><br>While United and Chelsea fight it out for the title, Ferguson and Mourinho seem intent on continuing their war of words all the way to the bitter end.<br><br>Following his side's 3-0 win at Aston Villa on Saturday, Ferguson took a swipe at the Portuguese's claim that Chelsea would be top at Christmas.<br><br>Mourinho replied in kind by claiming United had had it easy so far this season, and yet their lead is minimal, adding: "The only thing is the reality and the distance now is two points.<br><br>"They have no problems. Everybody is playing, and they play every game with the same team.<br><br>"They've no injuries, no suspensions and no referees like we had against Tottenham. Everything is going for them.<br><br>"We have problems. We don't have the best goalkeeper in the world, and we don't have John Terry or Joe Cole.<br><br>"We have suspensions, red cards, sometimes bad decisions go against us, but the distance is only two points.<br><br>"So for the second part of the season let's see what happens.<br><br>"Last season it was the opposite. Everything was fantastic for us and they had problems.<br><br>"Scholes had a problem with his eye, Giggs was injured, Rooney was coming back from injury and this and that.<br><br>"The distance at Christmas was how much? 15, 14, 16, 17 points. I don't know.<br><br>"In the second half of the season when Chelsea was not in a good moment, United reduced the gap, but it was too big.<br><br>"At this moment the gap is two points."<br><br>Mourinho has "no idea" if Terry will be fit to face the Royals due to the complicated nature of his back injury.<br><br>"Maybe he will be able to play against Reading, maybe he will be out for another two to three weeks," stated Mourinho, who may be forced to spend again when the transfer window opens next week.<br><br>"The problem is we only have three central defenders. When John Terry is injured we only have two," he said.<br><br>"We will have (Khalid) Boulahrouz suspended for the Fulham game, so I will only have (Ricardo) Carvalho. Sometimes people think Chelsea has a perfect squad, but we don't.<br><br>"We only have three central defenders, and we are in big trouble in that situation.</span></div>
