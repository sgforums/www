            <div class='col-md body'>Barcelona's injured hitman Samuel Eto'o has insisted former AC Milan striker Andriy Shevchenko blundered by moving to Chelsea.<br><br>Shevchenko, who joined Chelsea in the summer for Â£30million, has struggled to find his form in the Barclays Premiership.<br><br>The Ukrainian international scored his first goal at Stamford Bridge in the victory over Portsmouth but that was only his second of the season in the league.<br><br>Eto'o believes that Shevchenko has made a mistake by moving to England.<br><br>Eto'o said: "I have many friends at Chelsea and we often speak. He is perceived as Roman Abramovich's pet and he doesn't get clean assists to score.<br><br>"I believe Shevchenko has made a mistake. At Milan everyone plays football and for a forward this is crucial because you have more scoring possibilities.<br><br>"Chelsea play more defensive football and the two strikers struggle," said Eto'o on www.worldfootballers.com.<br><br>Eto'o also laid criticised former Chelsea striker Eidur Gudjohnsen for his poor finishing.<br><br>Barcelona have not been at their best in recent weeks and the slump has coincided with the Cameroon striker's absence.<br><br>Eto'o was injured in his side's Champions League match against Werder Bremen in late September and will be sidelined until the new year with knee ligament problems.<br><br>His pace and power have been sadly missed by the Spanish giants and his replacement, Gudjohnsen, has spurned a number of chances - including one against Real Madrid.<br><br>Gudjohnsen scored against Chelsea in their 2-2 draw in the Champions League on Tuesday night but Eto'o has criticised his team-mate for his wastefulness.<br><br>"Gudjohnsen needs to readapt to the role of centre forward," Eto'o told Gazzetta dello Sport.<br><br>"Did you see the chance he missed at the Bernabeu? If he had scored that goal Barca would have won 4-2.<br><br>"Gudjohnsen was looking at Lionel Messi instead of looking at the goal as every centre forward always should."<br><br>Chelsea's in-form hitman Didier Drogba is dreaming of facing French giants Lyon in the Champions League final.<br><br>Drogba stunned Barcelona with a late equaliser in their heated 2-2 draw on Tuesday night while Lyon guaranteed their progress to the knockout stages with victory over Dynamo Kiev.<br><br>"I would love a Champions League final between Lyon and Chelsea," Drogba told Le Parisien. "I love this club. They produce beautiful football.<br><br>"They are another applicant for the European title."<br><br>Meanwhile, Chelsea remain tight-lipped over suggestions that Carlo Cudicini confronted coach Jose Mourinho after learning he was on the substitute's bench for the tie with Barca.<br><br>The Italian is alleged to have clashed with Mourinho when he realised Hilario had kept his place match even though Cudicini had declared himself fit for last Saturday's Premiership match with Sheffield United.<br><br>Cudicini has not played for Chelsea since being concussed at Reading last month.<br></div>
