            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;">Top brain surgeon urges Terry to take it easy<br><br>One of Britain's top brain surgeons has urged England captain John Terry not to rush back to action after suffering an horrific head injury last weekend.<br><br>Colin Shieff, consultant neuro-surgeon at the Royal Free Hospital in London, said he would normally advise similar injury victims to take it easy for at least two weeks.<br><br>Terry lost consciousness, swallowed his tongue and stopped breathing after a kick in the head from Arsenal's Abou Diaby during their 2-1 League Cup final win on Sunday.<br><br>But he checked out of hospital after treatment and returned to the Millennium Stadium to celebrate with his victorious teammates. And the defender could now return to action against Portsmouth on Saturday.<br><br>"Someone who came in to us with a similar story and which was witnessed by so many, I would suggest to them that they take it easy for a couple of weeks," said Shieff.<br><br>"Boxers who were rendered unconscious would not be allowed to go back into the ring until they had satisfied the requirements of the regulatory authority. The boxing board of control would not let them fight for two or three months afterwards.<br><br>"It is one thing feeling well enough to get back to the team and another to being considered fit to play. He is more than likely to have had a brain scan on Sunday and it would probably have showed up normal and that there was no bleeding.<br><br>"During the period a person is knocked out, the brain is not working. It is like having a computer which suddenly doesn't work and won't accept anything you type or which refuses to save anything. When you get it working again, you might find it has saved your document but it may not have.<br><br>"During the period he was out, his brain wasn't getting a lot of oxygen but Chelsea are concerned about the guy as well as his performance and I am positive they will have obtained some neurological opinion and given him an MRI scan to determine whether there is any other damage.<br><br>"You can't always predict these things and it may take a while to get right. But generally, if someone is feeling fine in 24 hours, then there is likely to be no long-term problems."</span><br><br>Agree but without terry our defence look abit fragile</div>

Chelsea's midfield always gets beaten on the wings when they play a diamond midfield of Lampard, Makelele, Ballack and someone else (I think usually Essien).<br><br>Arsenal kept attacking on Chelsea's right wing in the carling cup final. No doubt RB wasn't a regular RB.<br><br>In Chelsea's premiership game against Liverpool at Anfield, Jermaine Pennant caused all sorts of probs for Chelsea on Chelsea's left wing.<br><br>I say, play Robben more often.</div>

"He is strong, powerful and is perfect for the Premiership.

He has the potential to be the best central defender in the world.<br><br>"Nemanja struggled a little bit when he first signed for United and people were very critical of him but he has proved them all wrong this season.<br><br>"He has been one of the best players in the Premiership and is a hero in Serbia.<br><br>"Nemanja is a defender first and foremost but always scored goals for Red Star because he is a big threat at set-pieces.<br><br>"We speak a couple of times a month and he is very happy in Manchester.<br><br>"I told him he has to stay focused because when you play for a club like United it only takes a couple of bad games and you are out.<br><br>"United have still to come to Fratton Park and I'm looking forward to seeing him - but not to playing against him in this form."<br><br>Former Red Star coach Zoran Filipovic also told The Sun: "It was a very good step for him to go to United and maybe he could go on to be the best defender in the world.<br><br>"Fabio Cannavaro is a defender and is the World Player of the Year.
