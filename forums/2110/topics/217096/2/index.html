Lampard was playing his club position and he can't score even after 30 plus tries at the World Cup. Ronaldinho did not perform at the world cup but we all know how great a footballer he is. So I'm still very impressed with him even though his world cup flopped. Same goes for Rooney. He will be an all time England great. No one can dispute that.<br><br>I have nothing against Lampard, if he can play like that for England, I'll be happy too. but fact is, he is an ordinary player who has worked very hard and if he does not reproduce this kind of form soon for England, I prefer Gerrard anytime. Gerrard has that all round natural talent and can change a game at will.</div>
