I feel Ballack Lampard combi for 4-5-1 would be better, since both can take long shots pretty well. Essien has a decent shot as well, but not as fearsome as Ballack. At least, the Ballack that was at Bayern and Kaiserlautern.<br><br>Somehow he just doesn't seem as effective at Chelsea, can't say he's not motivated given how he does seem to put in effort when he does play, and the raw emotion on his face when he scores.<br><br>He still gets the occassional goal, but he's just not lighting up like he is expected to. Which is like him at his two previous clubs.</div>

Duff, SWP, Cole, Robben. 2 playing, 2 on the bench. Geremi has been playing on the wing for them too and although he is versatile, he just isn't as good as any of them on the wings.<br><br>4-4-2 would be ok too... provided they play the wings instead of a compact diamond midfield. With Ballack or Lampard playing out of position.</div>
