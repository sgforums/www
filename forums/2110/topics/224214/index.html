If that means there is opinion and criticism, I respect that."<br><br>Shevchenko admitted in the ProSport interview he was unhappy with the start he made with the Premiership champions but denied struggling to adapt to the rigours of English football.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;">Shevchenko determined to make a go at Chelsea<br>tribalfooball.com - December 14, 2006<br><br>Andriy Shevchenko has accepted that Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho can drop him.<br><br>Shevchenko said "A great team cannot guarantee a starting place to anybody. If you are not in a position of producing what the manager asks of you, it is only right someone else plays in your place.<br><br>"I am giving 100 per cent. We will see in the end if this is the right place for me or not.<br><br>"The way Chelsea play is totally different from AC Milan. AC Milan emphasises possession. At Chelsea the style is much faster.<br><br>"A person needs time to settle. Here all is new - the club, the language, the way of playing. It is all different.<br><br>"Somebody who has made a precise choice, and left a great club where he was happy for seven years to join another great club, cannot give up like that. Even in spite of this difficult moment<br><br>"I've no idea where all the rumours about me leaving Chelsea stem from. There are difficult moments and easy moments but, when you make a choice, you have to get to the end of it.<br><br>"Now I am at Chelsea and I have to adapt to their game and all that the manager asks from me.<br><br>"When one decides to take a certain route, you must follow it to the very end. Only at the end will I be able to see if things have gone well or not."<br><br>Shevchenko accepts he has lost the scoring touch, having hit the net only five times in 22 games.<br><br>But he added: "It is not that I do not score any longer. I do not score as much or as regularly as before. I still score a few.<br><br>"We players are not machines. There are times when the wheel turns in a different way. You have to have belief.<br><br>"I've said it before and I repeat it once and for all.<br><br>"I have great respect for AC Milan and its supporters. I send them all a fond embrace and greetings, because they have remained in my heart.<br><br>"But I have made a choice and it is not right that I should think of going back on my tracks after three months.<br><br>"Over the past few months I've said very little - on purpose. I do not want to go on about why and how I left AC Milan." </span></div>
