We are still waiting for the report from that but as far as I am concerned, we are looking very positive and very well.<br><br>"Especially the brain is working very well and I haven't lost anything I had so for the moment it is looking very well.<br><br>"There is still time to go with the skull fracture because it has not healed and I have to be patient with that, but hopefully that will go quickly as well.<br><br>"It is looking like that, about the middle of January, I will be able to start training in the goal. So I will just try to enjoy the time with my family, enjoy the time with the lads at the training ground and now I have plenty of time to work."<br><br>Cech added: "I feel better, improving every day. I can start training a little bit in the gym and the swimming pool so it makes me feel a lot better.<br><br>"It has been a great week the last week because I could start working, I could even start to play tennis. I can be at the training ground and see the people I like to see, and that is better for my confidence and better for my feelings. I hope this way I can make it back earlier than expected.<br><br>"Of course I am tired when I do the training session because my body is still a little bit tired.<br><br>"But this has improved massively because I can work twice a day and at the end of the day, I am tired but I am tired because of the work, not just because of the walking. So it has been great to discover this." </span><br>be back soon !</div>
