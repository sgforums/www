            <div class='col-md body'>Jose Mourinho remains convinced Chelsea will see off Manchester United to claim a third consecutive Premiership title.<br><br>The reigning champions reduced the gap at the top to two points on Sunday after beating Everton 3-2 before United lost at West Ham.<br><br>Those results restored Chelsea to the position of favourites for the Premiership and Mourinho is confident his players can retain their crown.<br><br>"I am as convinced as I was three or four months ago we are going to win the title," Mourinho told The Sun.<br><br>"I have won four consecutive titles. It's not normal for one club to do that and even less so for one coach.<br><br>"The work done by the club, more than the players, is always questioned. They don't give us the credit we believe we deserve.<br><br>"We were champions in the first year and champions again. If we are not champions again then our work will be analysed in a negative way."<br><br>Mourinho also insisted he does not encourage his players to bend the rules in the pursuit of victory.<br><br>Didier Drogba's antics have often been criticised, but the Chelsea boss is adamant he does not instruct his players to dive.<br><br>He added: "The end doesn't justify the means. I'm a just person.<br><br>"I don't like to lose because of an injustice and I don't like to win because of an injustice."</div>
