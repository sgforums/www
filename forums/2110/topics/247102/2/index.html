But if you're in the wrong about anything, it's in your attitude towards everyone else in general. I've said enough about that before and so have others. People dislike you not because you are a Chelsea fan, but because of your attitude and how everytime you try and provoke people. Slinging mud at everyone else even fellow Chelsea fans.<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong></strong><div class="quote_from"><strong>this is not the 1st time<br><br>eversince that bartender issue came up </strong></div></blockquote>No, it wasn't the first time. You started retaliating with the lame 'pervert' claims after I started commenting on you. Doesn't make sense if you called me pervert suddenly right? Even though calling me that is untrue and incorrect. The fact is instead of discussing on the same level about soccer-related posts, you resorted to dragging in unrelated stuff and even did a search on my nick. Things you would not have done if I weren't already making posts to you.<br><br>You see why I say you're confused? I'm trying to not use that word so much on you myself but you just give me no other choice by muddling up facts like that.<br><div class="quote_body"><blockquote>every now and then or shall i say almost everytime you try to prove that my comments / posts are wrong or that i am confused which more often or not that i am not as clearly i know what i am posting</blockquote></div>You know what you're posting? Based on the above I still doubt so. Also, you do things like that too often. Plus, your posts aimed at provoking and making snide remarks towards other fans are definitely wrong.<br><br>You get hate replies not because you are a Chelsea fan, I say you're confused because you think the reason why others dislike you is because they are biased against your preference of football club. The real reason which you always overlook, is your attitude and the kind of posts you make. You always get it wrong that people dislike you just because you like Chelsea.<br><br><strong>[quote]so please don't being a idiot and try to play your stupid little mind games </strong>Haiz.... If you didn't keep getting things wrong, there's no need for me or others to say much also.<br><br>The reason why I say you're confused is precisely because you always get things wrong and muddled up. You think it's one thing when actually it's another. I won't go into specifics because I've already done that previously. Besides, if you didn't get it then, you won't get it now either. Not to forget that you are stubborn and full of yourself as well. Even without the letter of the week, you were c0cky already, after that you became worse.<br><br>I'm not trying to prove anything with regards to the bartender pervert issue. It's just that you keep bringing it up unnecessarily. The point is firstly, not related to soccer and is in itself a totally wrong point in itself.<br><br></div>

What you say in this post is all good and true, and it's basically what I can tell you as well so nothing new.<br><br>But referee issues aside, Chelsea playing badly against Newcastle was unexpected. Whereas my comment that you expect Everton to play well once and totally flop the next. But let's not harp on that since now you are saying you expect Everton to play well in both games.<br><br>I much appreciate this post better because it's based on actual soccer instead of you calling me names based on unrelated matters.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ghimpheng, my comments on you started even before you started blindly labelling me a pervert. And apparently you had no replies to the things I said hence you resorted to using things unrelated to soccer. Even then, the things you say about me outside of soccer are lame and weak to begin with.<br><br>If you want to continue with the pervert claims it's up to you, because each time you will continue to get it wrong and each time it just gives me more reason to laugh at you. So far you're the only one calling me a pervert and it's.... comical.<br><br>If you truly want example of pervert post, then you should see what the clones put up. Although I don't expect you'll never say anything negative about the clonemaster. Years from now when you're more mature, you'll probably look back on this and laugh at yourself on how you considered these things pervert in the past.<br><br>I'm no saint nor am I perfect, I'd be wrong of many things being human. However, being pervert is not one of them. I really don't see any need to justify to you why, my posts are there for you to see, but I can't help if once again you persist in your wrong impressions. You're probably doing that because you can't find any better response to me.<br><br>Seriously, I think it'd be better and more constructive if you built on your soccer knowledge. Also, stop provoking people and stop being so arrogant.</div>
