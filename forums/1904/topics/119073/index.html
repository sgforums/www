            <div class='col-md body'>Tue Feb 22, 4:15 PM ET<br><br>Paris Hilton may be having a tough time getting her friends on the phone these days.<br><br>Hundreds of the hotel heiress' contacts, including the likes of Avril Lavigne, Eminem and Anna Kournikova, were exposed to the wrath of prank phone callers after hackers posted the contents of Hilton's T-Mobile Sidekick on the Internet over the weekend.<br><br>Hilton's famous friends apparently moved quickly to salvage their privacy, changing their formerly unlisted numbers to new unlisted numbers.<br><br>A call to Ashlee Simpson's number yielded nothing but a standard out-of-service message, while a call to Lindsay Lohan's number produced a recording of a male voice spouting expletives and burping.<br><br>Other famous names who had their info outed include Nicole Richie, Vin Diesel, Shannon Elizabeth, Ashley Olsen, Christina Aguilera, Fred Durst, Jay-Z and Frankie Muniz.<br><br>Victoria Gotti raged to the New York Daily News that she had received over 100 calls in two hours.<br><br>"I didn't want to take the phones off the hook because my oldest son was out on a date," Gotti said. "This went on all night. Finally, at 5:30 a.m., I took them off the hook. This morning, I put them back on and they started ringing immediately. It's driving me insane."<br><br>In addition to the Simple Life star's contact list, personal notes to herself such as "call maroon 5" and "call gary shandlin get tape of everything" were also posted online to be decoded by the masses.<br><br>A representative for Hilton had no comment on the hacking.<br><br>Meanwhile, a spokesman for T-Mobile said the company's computer forensics and security team were "actively investigating to determine how Ms. Hilton's information was obtained."<br><br>Though the company said it is unclear how Hilton's data made its way onto the Internet, the leak occurred only days after a 22-year-old man pleaded guilty to gaining access to the T-Mobile database which contains records for millions of users, including access to Secret Service accounts.<br><br>Several sites that initially posted Hilton's info removed it after being contacted by the Secret Service following the case.<br><br>Hilton, meanwhile, did not seem outwardly concerned by the publicizing of her equivalent of a little black book.<br><br>The celebutante spent the weekend at Walt Disney World with her family, celebrating her 24th birthday, which was on Feb. 17.</div>
