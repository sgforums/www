              <p>Whoa, kopi, better read Ken Rockwell's review on the D3X before rushing out to the store: http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/d3x.htm.  Rockwell's a no-bullshit guy, but the review is pretty harsh for even him.</p>

              <p>Good as it G10 is, it's still no match for even my 400D, much
              less any of the newer DSLR models.  The G10 starts to show
              noise at ISO200 while I can still take decent shots with the 400D
              at ISO800.  For fast shootng, I already find the 400D's three
              frames per second limiting (I'd love the 50D's 6.3 fps), and the
              G10's 0.7 really wouldn't be usable to me at all for that
              purpose.</p>
              <p>The G10's a nice little "carry everywhere" pocket camera that
              will happily do the job as a backup camera, andone of its
              oft-quoted virtues is that it's unobtrusive.  Since I already
              have the 400D and I'm not bothered about being unobtrusive, getting
              lenses was the more sensible choice.</p>

              <p>someone said before that the best zoom is to take a step forward.</p>
              <p>it really isn't the equipment sometimes.</p>
              <p>the same wide angle lens at different heights will give you different a "feel" each time.</p>
              <p>take one standing up, chest level, hip level and from the floor with the same lens, it all looks different.</p>
              <p>if the flash is too bright, step back, zoom in to crop the photo.</p>
              <p>its that simple</p>

              <p>the money spent for the same amount of megapixels is like... not
              worth it.</p>
              <p>its not like as if nikon has a camera that matches the 1Ds Mark
              3.</p>
              <p>i'll stick with the d300 untill nikon comes up with a better
              body.</p>
              <p>for now i'm happy with the results of the d300... except that it
              doesn't have a damn battery grip.</p>

              <p>Fair nuff - definitely get the grip.  Once I put the grip on my 400D, it never came off - damn handy and improves the balance of the camera when you've got a large lens.</p>
