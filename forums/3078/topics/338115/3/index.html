              <p>Well, kopi, you would know that the sensors on compacts are pretty much useless when it comes to low light.  As it is, crop sensors have enough of a challenge in those conditions - all you'd get is noise with a 1.7" CCD.</p>

              <p>that's why u gotta learn to know when is too near.</p>
              <p>if you are really afraid of flash over exposure, get a camera where it has TTL (Through The Lens) capabilities</p>
              <p>what it does is that it will calculate and dispense how much light you need, then again it is not entirely idiot proof.</p>
              <p>the simplest way to solve this kind of problem is to take a step back.</p>
              <p>or if you have a function in the camera to adjust flash power output, just reduce it.</p>

              <p>Nah, that's perfectly fine.  The discussion's gone off on a couple of tangents here, so maybe a quick summary might clarify the picture I'm trying to paint.</p>
              <p>First, like I said, the small sensors on compact cameras are not very good at handling low light conditions.  There's not a whole lot you can do about that except avoid such conditions.  I agree with kopi that being a good photographer will help, but being a good photographer also means knowing the limitations of whatever equipment you have, and what tricks you can use to make up for those.  Now there are some compacts like Sigma's DP1 and DP2 that actually have big sensors, but those come with their own compromises.</p>
              <p>Speaking as someone who quite happily shot with a Canon S1IS for a few years before going on to DSLRs, I was quite happy with the results that I got at the time, but years later I do find myself looking at those old shots and thinking, "Gee, I wish I could tweak them to improve the image". An example of such a photo is this one I took in 2005:</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v229/Gedanken/meerkat_smile.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>This is still one of my favourite "grab at the moment" shots (or as you put it, "as life flashes by"), but it's a bit of a pity that the image quality was not better.  If it had been taken in RAW and not JPEG, there's more I could have done today to clean the image up.</p>
              <p>I understand where you're coming from right now, but from my exeprience I'm just presenting the need to consider future-proofing your shots to some extent.</p>
              <p>You don't necessarily have to shoot in RAW.  You can set the G10 to shoot in RAW+JPEG (which will take up more space but afford you more flexibility), or you can set it to shoot exclusively in JPEG.  The point is that the options are there should you choose to use either format, and if you take RAW shots, down the track you can go back to tweaking them once you've learned a thing or two about post-processing - until then you can just save it as a JPEG without the tweaks.</p>
              <p>As for the lambency diffuser, it can work outdoors, but the range isn't great .</p>

              <p>if you are really afraid of flash over exposure, get a camera where it has TTL (Through The Lens) capabilities</p>

              <p>the simplest way to solve this kind of problem is to take a step back.</p>
              <p>or if you have a function in the camera to adjust flash power output, just reduce it.</p>

              <p>Nah, that's perfectly fine.  The discussion's gone off on a couple of tangents here, so maybe a quick summary might clarify the picture I'm trying to paint.</p>
              <p>First, like I said, the small sensors on compact cameras are not very good at handling low light conditions.  There's not a whole lot you can do about that except avoid such conditions.  I agree with kopi that being a good photographer will help, but being a good photographer also means knowing the limitations of whatever equipment you have, and what tricks you can use to make up for those.  Now there are some compacts like Sigma's DP1 and DP2 that actually have big sensors, but those come with their own compromises.</p>
              <p>Speaking as someone who quite happily shot with a Canon S1IS for a few years before going on to DSLRs, I was quite happy with the results that I got at the time, but years later I do find myself looking at those old shots and thinking, "Gee, I wish I could tweak them to improve the image". An example of such a photo is this one I took in 2005:</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v229/Gedanken/meerkat_smile.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>This is still one of my favourite "grab at the moment" shots (or as you put it, "as life flashes by"), but it's a bit of a pity that the image quality was not better.  If it had been taken in RAW and not JPEG, there's more I could have done today to clean the image up.</p>
              <p>I understand where you're coming from right now, but from my exeprience I'm just presenting the need to consider future-proofing your shots to some extent.</p>
              <p>You don't necessarily have to shoot in RAW.  You can set the G10 to shoot in RAW+JPEG (which will take up more space but afford you more flexibility), or you can set it to shoot exclusively in JPEG.  The point is that the options are there should you choose to use either format, and if you take RAW shots, down the track you can go back to tweaking them once you've learned a thing or two about post-processing - until then you can just save it as a JPEG without the tweaks.</p>
              <p>As for the lambency diffuser, it can work outdoors, but the range isn't great .</p>

              <p>for me, i'll be ok with a G10</p>
              <p>though i'm aiming the Ricoh GX200 because it gives good colour, can focus fast enough for a compact, its well designed, can shoot RAW.  but its a daytime camera, any shots at night or requires flash will fail miserably. firstly because it get noisy at midrange ISO and the flash sucks. but depending on how you use it, you might achieve something nice with the noise at night, like those japanese photographers who use this camera.</p>
              <p>i'm still considering purchasing this camera because of its results during the day. because i don't take my camera out at night!</p>
              <p>but be reminded that the cameras that i've mentioned are around the $700-800 range</p>

              <p>someone said before that the best zoom is to take a step forward.</p>
              <p>it really isn't the equipment sometimes.</p>
              <p>the same wide angle lens at different heights will give you different a "feel" each time.</p>
              <p>take one standing up, chest level, hip level and from the floor with the same lens, it all looks different.</p>
              <p>if the flash is too bright, step back, zoom in to crop the photo.</p>
              <p>its that simple</p>
