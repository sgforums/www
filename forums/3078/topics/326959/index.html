              <p> <span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">Okay, I'll try to compile
                      some. Don't be afraid to edit for me or add more terms that I missed out.
                      Though I think I will miss out on quite a lot. <span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 16px; line-height: 19px;"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;  font-family: Georgia;  color: blue;">Aperture:</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;  font-family: Georgia; "> An aperture is an opening in which light is
                      admitted. But the f-number (e.g. f/2.8) is the opposite of how big the aperture
                      is opened. A small f-number like for example f/1.4 means the aperture is opened
                      wide, while a big f-number like for example f/11 means the aperture is very
                      small.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family: Georgia; ">Aperture is mostly used for Depth of Field (DOF) shots. A small f-number
                      (meaning big aperture) will make the subject you are focusing on to be in clear
                      focus, while the background is blurred. A big f-number (meaning small aperture)
                      will still make the subject you are focusing on to be in clear focus, but
                      background is not so blurred.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;  font-family: Georgia;  color: blue;">Autofocus:</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;  font-family: Georgia; "> Also known as “AF”. It means the lens will
                      automatically focus for you the object that falls into the AF-point.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText"><strong><span style="font-family: Georgia;  color: blue;">Bokeh:</span></strong><span style="font-family: Georgia; "> It refers to the blurred background of a photo
                      caused by a shallow Depth of Field (DOF). Bokeh is a Japanese term and it means
                      "blur". So bokeh can also be used to refer to DOF.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;  font-family: Georgia;  color: blue;">CCD sensor versus
                      CMOS sensor:</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;  font-family: Georgia; "> CCD means
                      "Charge-Coupled Device" and it is the first light sensor used in
                      digital cameras. CMOS means "Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor"
                      and it's a newer technology.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText2"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;  font-family: Georgia; ">CMOS first appeared on camera
                      phones because it is easier to implement and uses less battery power and it’s
                      cheap but picture quality is poor, hence CMOS is suitable for camera phones.
                      But CMOS soon progressed to a stage where it can compare with the more matured
                      CCD technology in terms of picture quality. That was when CMOS became more
                      widely used in digital cameras and DSLRs. The advantages is less power
                      consumption, faster processing speed and cheaper to produce. It is also rumoured
                      that CMOS has better noise suppression than CCD, whether is it true or not, I'm
                      not sure.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText2"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;  font-family: Georgia;  color: blue;">Depth of Field:</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;  font-family: Georgia; "> As mentioned when I talked about aperture and
                      bokeh, DOF affects how blurred the background is. The smaller the f-number
                      (meaning the wider the aperture), the shallower the DOF. And a shallow DOF
                      means a blurred background.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText"><strong><span style="font-family: Georgia;  color: blue;">Exposure:</span></strong><span> </span><span><span style=" font-family: Georgia; color: black;">It is the total amount of</span></span><span><span style=" font-family: Georgia; color: black;"> </span></span><span><span style=" font-family: Georgia; color: black;">light</span></span><span><span style=" font-family: Georgia; color: black;"> </span></span><span><span style=" font-family: Georgia; color: black;">allowed to
                      fall on the photographic medium during the process of taking a</span></span><span><span style=" font-family: Georgia; color: black;"> </span></span><span><span style=" font-family: Georgia; color: black;">photograph.
                      Shutter speed and aperture opening determine how much exposure there is. Longer
                      shutter time and wider aperture will result in greater exposure, and vice
                      versa.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText"><span><span style=" font-family: Georgia; color: black;">There is also something called the
                      Exposure Value (EV). It can be seen on most digital cameras where you can
                      adjust the EV in 1/3-steps or ½-steps, ranging from positive to negative value.
                      Positive values means greater exposure while negative values means lesser
                      exposure.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText"><span><strong><span style=" font-family: Georgia; color: blue;">Focusing: </span></strong></span><span><span style=" font-family: Georgia;">For
                      most Point-and-Shoot (PnS) digital cameras, focusing is determined by the
                      camera itself. But for some prosumer bridge cameras and DSLRs, you can
                      determine how your camera focuses on subjects.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText"><span><span style=" font-family: Georgia;">For a DSLR camera, there’s the single-servo AF,
                      used in most conditions and mostly for stationary objects. Then there’s the
                      continuous-servo AF, used for moving objects. The camera constantly Autofocus
                      on the object even if it’s moving, used for Sports Mode on DSLRs and also for
                      panning shots. And finally there’s Manual focus, where you focus manually.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText"><span><strong><span style=" font-family: Georgia; color: blue;">ISO speed:</span></strong></span><span><span style=" font-family: Georgia;"> ISO stands for “International Organization for Standardization”, and yes, this
                      is the ISO you see printed on products like “ISO9500”, “ISO9660”, etc. ISO
                      speed can also be referred to as film speed. Films with high sensitivity only
                      need a short exposure time, while low sensitivity films need a longer exposure
                      time. Thus high sensitivity films are said to have a fast film speed, while low
                      sensitivity films have slow film speed. After ISO standardized the measurement
                      of film speed, everyone started calling it the ISO speed.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">Digital cameras also
                      have ISO speed. It determines how “sensitive” you want the image sensor to be.
                      With low ISO speed like ISO-100 or ISO-200, you need longer exposure time,
                      meaning lower shutter speed. With higher ISO speed like ISO-800 or ISO-1600 or
                      even ISO-3200 in some DSLRs, you can increase the shutter speed while still
                      achieving the same amount of exposure. But higher ISO speed usually translates
                      to more noise.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText"><strong><span style="font-family: Georgia; color: blue;">Metering:</span></strong><span style="font-family: Georgia;"> There are 3 kinds of metering for exposure.
                      There’s (1) Center-Weighted Metering, (2) Matrix/Evaluative/Pattern Metering,
                      and there’s (3) Spot Metering.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">(1) Center-Weighted
                      Metering the whole picture frame is evaluated, but priority is given to the center
                      of the picture. Used mainly for Portrait Mode for taking pictures of a person.
                      Some cheap PnS digital cameras without metering options have Center-Weighted
                      Metering as standard.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">(2)
                      Matrix/Evaluative/Pattern Metering. Different camera manufacturers call it differently,
                      but this is usually the most common metering mode used in digital cameras. It
                      measures the whole picture to determine the right amount of exposure so that
                      the whole picture is nicely exposed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">(3) Spot Metering means
                      only the area around the selected AF-point is metered and exposed accordingly;
                      the rest of the area is ignored. Ideal for situations when your subject is
                      backlit and using Matrix or Center-Weighted Metering will make your subject
                      totally black.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff; font-family: Georgia; font-weight: bold;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Georgia;   color: blue;   ">Noise:</span></strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Georgia;     "> <span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="color: #000000;">Noise is the irritating red and blue dots in see in pictures taken low lighting
                  conditions. It appears mostly in the shadow area. Factors that contribute to
                  noise is low lighting and high ISO speed.</span></span></span><br></span></p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Georgia; color: blue;">Pixels:</span></strong><span style="font-family: Georgia;"> The image sensor in a digital camera or DSLR
                          consists of a lot of pixels that collect light energy (photons) and convert
                          them to electrical signals. The “Mega” in front of the word “Megapixels” simply
                          means one million. So “6.0-Megapixels” means six million pixels on the image
                          sensor.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">There’s also difference
                          between TOTAL number of pixels and EFFECTIVE number of pixels. Let’s say an
                          image sensor in a digital camera has a total of 10.6-Megapixels; it means it
                          has a total of 10,600,000 pixels on the image sensor. But they may promote their
                          digital camera as having 10.2 EFFECTIVE Megapixels. That means even though the
                          image sensor has 10,600,000 pixels, only 10,200,000 is used to compose a
                          picture. The remaining 400,000 pixels are around the border left unused, or
                          used for other purposes that I’m also not sure about. So beware of how camera
                          manufacturers promote their cameras. So the main thing is: TOTAL number of
                          Megapixels is not equal to EFFECTIVE number of Megapixels.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">And there’s also this
                          problem with everyone having the misconception that Megapixels equate to image
                          quality/sharpness. This is not true at all. How much pixels does your digital
                          camera/DSLR have does not affect image quality. The bigger the image sensor,
                          the bigger the picture when printed out, that’s all. What affect image quality
                          are the lenses, the image sensor’s dynamic range and quality of the pixels and
                          the image processor (e.g. Canon’s Digic III, Nikon’s Expeed, Sony’s Bionz, etc.)
                          in the camera itself. If you have a 20-Megapixels camera, it also doesn’t mean
                          you can take astonishing pictures if the lenses and image sensor sucks. That is
                          why Nikon’s D40 DSLR only needs 6.1-Megapixels. As long as the lens and image
                          sensor are of good quality, pictures of good image quality can be achieved
                          easily.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText"><strong><span style="font-family: Georgia; color: blue;">RAW:</span></strong><span style="font-family: Georgia;"> Some of you might have seen this image format. It
                          simply means the picture from the image sensor is stored unaltered/unprocessed.
                          And it is not an acronym that everyone thinks it is. It literally means the
                          picture is still raw, unprocessed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">RAW allows for greater
                          flexibility for professional photographers, because you can still edit white
                          balance, colour enhancements, sharpening, exposure, etc. It is like having a
                          second try at taking a picture of the same scene when your first attempt
                          failed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">There are of course
                          drawbacks to shooting in RAW format. RAW files are much larger than other file
                          formats like JPEG for example. This is because it is not compressed at all. And
                          when shooting in RAW format on a DSLR, number of images you can store in the
                          buffer will be reduced, resulting in slower continuous shooting speed. Another
                          thing is different camera manufacturers have different RAW formats; hence you
                          need dedicated software to process your camera’s RAW files.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText"><strong><span style="font-family: Georgia; color: blue;">Red-eye
                          effect:</span></strong><span style="font-family: Georgia;"> This happens when taking
                          pictures with flash of people in the dark. The pupils of a person’s eyes dilate
                          when in the dark to admit more light to be able to see in the dark. When you
                          take a picture of someone whose eyes are already accustomed to the dark
                          surrounding, the flash from the camera will reflect off the back of the
                          person’s eyes and hence you see the red eyes. The red colour is actually caused
                          by melanin, which is in abundance, at the back of a human’s eyes.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">This can be avoided when
                          you select the red-eye function in your digital camera. When you switch to this
                          mode, you will be able to observe that the flash from the camera actually
                          flashes for a few times before the picture is actually taken. This is done to
                          make the person’s eyes to adjust to the brightness and contract accordingly, so
                          red-eye effect is reduced or eliminated.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">But no worries there, a
                          lot of photo editing softwares nowadays offer red-eye fixing features, where
                          you can remove the red-eye effect digitally.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText"><strong><span style="font-family: Georgia; color: blue;">Shutter:</span></strong><span style="font-family: Georgia;"> One of the very important components of a camera.
                          The </span><span><span style=" font-family: Georgia; color: black;">shutter</span></span><span><span style=" font-family: Georgia; color: black;"> </span></span><span><span style=" font-family: Georgia; color: black;">is a device
                          that allows light to pass for a determined period of time, for the purpose of
                          exposing a photographic film or a light-sensitive electronic sensor. The two most
                          common types of shutters are the central shutter and the focal-plane shutter.
                          The central shutter is used mainly in PnS digital cameras while SLR/DSLRs uses
                          focal-plane shutter. Central shutter is mounted just after the lens assembly.
                          Focal-plane shutter is mounted just in front of the image sensor. It’s used in
                          DSLR cameras because DSLRs have interchangeable lenses, and with the shutter
                          built onto the camera body, changing lenses will be easier. Focal-plane
                          shutters are more expensive to produce than central shutters.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText"><span><span style=" font-family: Georgia; color: black;">In most PnS digital cameras, you cannot
                          control the shutter speed, instead the camera will decide for itself what’s the
                          best shutter speed for the current situation. In SLR/DSLR cameras, shutter
                          speed can be controlled. For most DSLRs nowadays, shutter speed is between
                          1/4000 to 30 seconds. Some are even fast enough to achieve 1/8000 seconds.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText"><span><strong><span style=" font-family: Georgia; color: blue;">Shutter lag:</span></strong></span><span><span style=" font-family: Georgia; color: black;"> Shutter lag occurs from the moment you press the shutter button
                          to the time when the shutter actually opens to expose the image sensor. In most
                          PnS digital cameras, shutter lag is inevitable. It cannot be avoided and it can
                          be a nuisance when taking pictures of fast moving objects due to the lag.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText"><span><span style=" font-family: Georgia; color: black;">DSLRs generally have very little or no
                          shutter lag because it has no live view. But shutter lag will occur when you
                          are using the live view of a DSLR camera. When using live view in a DSLR
                          camera, it becomes like a PnS. Shutter lag will occur unless you switch off
                          live view and use the viewfinder instead.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText"><span><strong><span style=" font-family: Georgia; color: blue;">Chromatic Aberration:</span></strong></span><span><span style=" font-family: Georgia; color: black;"> Also known as “purple fringing”. But strictly speaking, there are
                          also blue fringing, red fringing, etc. It will occur at wide angle on a camera
                          lens and in sunny conditions, where you will see red/blue/purple colour along
                          the edges on some of the objects in the picture. It is unavoidable, but can be
                          reduced with good lenses. Compact digital PnS cameras are more prone to
                          chromatic aberration than DSLRs. But this is due to the lenses and not the
                          image sensor. DSLR camera’s lenses sometimes employ extra-low dispersion lenses
                          to counter chromatic aberration.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff; font-family: Georgia; font-weight: bold;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Georgia;   color: blue;   ">Vignetting:</span></strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Georgia;     "> <span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="color: #000000;">The
                      black corners you see in your pictures are the effect of vignetting. More
                      common on PnS digital cameras than on DSLRs. Again, this is due to lens design.
                      It is usually undesirable and best avoided, but can be purposely induced for
                      creative purposes.</span></span></span><br></span></p>

              <p>Good thread, alleggertia!</p>
              <p>Just throwing my two cents' worth in, here's a demonstration of DOF.  The same shot taken at F1.8:</p>

              <p>Note how, as the aperture decreases (the F-number increases), more of the image comes into focus.</p>
