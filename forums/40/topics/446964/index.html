              <p>Not that I'm going to promote the shop or anything like that. But I 
                      usually do shop for my pc hardware stuff from bizgram @ sim lim. The price
                       for most items are competitive.</p>
              <p>Compare those prices firstly based on your shortlisted items vs those to-be-imported goods. See whether imported goods with shipping price are worth the efforts.</p>
              <p>What  I do most of time when assembling new system, I've always take a
                       lot of time doing "research" on value for money items - this could take more than a month. For example, I 
                      would compare all my shortlisted items to those listed by the sim lim 
                      vendors through their price list handouts. Then, I would also do 
                      comparison in terms of value and performance. Those cheaper ones which perform satisfactorily etc. Usually I ended up with 
                      those items not in my shortlists based on value for money.</p>
              <p>From the vendors' price lists, I would go all out looking for specs comparison via respective products' official website. Some items do not have their official web sites and these are the ones that I would try to avoid because of no evidence in terms of performance etc and thus saves my time.</p>
              <p>As for your questions on PSU, I usually download the motherboard's manual guide from its website in order to determine the actual recommendation for PSU for that particular motherboard in terms of wattages for full optimised loading system. Not all motherboard the same. This is crucial and these days gaming machine could start with 700w and above in terms of stability. Usually those with power efficiency of 80% above and awarded with "80Plus Bronze, Silver or Gold" is strongly recommended. In essence, try to get those PSU that might save electricity bills, eco-friendly, quiet, cooling and built-to-last....longer.</p>
              <p>Hope this helps. Good luck and all the best with the new system. <a class="tinymce_control" href="/forums/40/topics/446964"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png?1212956094" alt="Emoticons"></a></p>

              <p>You're most welcome.<a class="tinymce_control" href="/forums/40/topics/446964"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png?1212956094" alt="Emoticons"></a></p>
              <p>I agree that some distributors choose to operate independently via online and cheaper too to some extent. But do note if the price exclude shipping or delivery charges or any hidden charges like taxes etc.</p>
              <p>Usually online is cheaper because there's a low or no shopfront overhead cost (no need to hire waiting salesperson) and it can be done 24/7. And customers would do a self-collect (if applicable) rather than delivery, so it may be cheaper.</p>
              <p>Do note that some online are operated by individuals who hold stocks (god knows where they got it) and this type of source is the one you need to be careful.</p>
              <p>Seek for more info before any online purchases, especially on their credentials as seller. Ask if there are warranty, money back guarantee etc. Usually those operated by individuals mostly don't carry warranty but the item is mostly genuinely new unless otherwise stated. Of course there's risk but if calculated risk then it's worth it.</p>
              <p>It's better to purchase via manufacturers web store or any trusted online pc web store backed by proven satisfactory service.</p>
              <p>Do remember to ask more questions or read FAQ or purchasing policy before buying online.</p>
              <p>Hope this helps. <a class="tinymce_control" href="/forums/40/topics/446964"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png?1212956094" alt="Emoticons"></a></p>
