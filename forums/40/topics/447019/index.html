              <p>I've taken a brief look at your items and I believed you have well considered all your items beforehand. Good for you. <br><br>Thus, I would not try to do a major overhaul as everthing already pretty well selected based on your budget and pre-requisites.<br><br>Here's my two cents worth of opinion for selected items:<br><br><strong>Motherboad</strong> - although some opinions may differ about Z68 chipset, unless you know what you are going to put up with (faster video conversion &amp; switchable graphics) you may consider getting P67 (good for overclocking too) but without integrated graphics.</p>
              <p>As I am a sucker to ASUS mobo, the ASUS P8z68-v (Z68) is alright and ASUS P8P67 (P67) also good enough for your proposed plan. But again, your Gigabyte Z68-DS3-B3 is okay though. <br><br>Always cater for more PCI slots because you never know what you need to add in near future and do remember that when you expand, your power supply too gives out extra watt to the newly installed hardware.<br><strong><br>Casing</strong> - If it's Z68-DS3-B3 then Cooler Master Elite 430 is alright.<br><br><strong>CPU</strong> - It's fine supported by the selected motherboard.<br><br><strong>Hard drive</strong> - Since Seagate already bought over Samsung hard drives then it's okay though. Fyi - Samsung hard drives is value for money.<br><br><strong>DVD Drive</strong> - It's alright, depends on individual preferences as it is not that expensive to change these days.<br><br><strong>RAM</strong> - As long as you know that only 64bit OS would recognise more than 3GB of ram then you are safe.<br><br><strong>VGA</strong> - That's one of the powerful grahic cards. Since it requires 500w of power supply you may consider wider options for your PSU.<br><br><strong>PSU </strong>- As mentioned above, this 600w 80Plus Gold is alright though. But still need to be careful as your VGA card's minimum requirement is having a system of 500w. The more the better and choose the most power efficient to save electricity. We don't want your gaming experience to be short-lived by insufficient power supply to the whole rigged system.<br><br>There you go, hope this help.<a class="tinymce_control" href="/forums/40/topics/447019"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png?1212956094" alt="Emoticons"></a><a class="tinymce_control" href="/forums/40/topics/447019"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png?1212956094" alt="Emoticons"></a><a class="tinymce_control" href="/forums/40/topics/447019"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png?1212956094" alt="Emoticons"></a></p>

              <p>It's okay with your GIGABYTE mobo and yes ASUS is kinda pricey. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>The Z68MA-D2H-B3 is okay with Cooler Master Elite 430. Anyway, the Z68MA-D2H-B3 has two USB 3.0 ports at the back panel. Getting some ports with USB 3.0 is a good idea. I don't see why you don't want to use it. Just check to see if the mobo provides you with its back panel connectors' cover plate to fit into the casing.</p>
              <p>By the way, it's useless getting Cooler Master Elite 431+ (Plus) with 3.0 USB port at the front panel where you don't have USB 3.0 headers available at the internal I/O connectors.</p>
              <p>For the PSU, I would strongly suggest the 700w than 600w - with 80plus awarded power efficiency.</p>
              <p>Hope this helps. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p>Briefly and in layman's term the requirements would be of course having the xfire/sli ready mobo, xfire/sli ready graphic cards, bridge connector and the pc system that does not experiencing bottlenecks in processing (compatible cpu to run xfire/sli functions).<br><br>Again in layman's term - xfire/sli is mainly for a pc system that use double graphic cards to boost graphical performance but not all would need to use xfire/sli setup though. Or not necessary for you to use 2 cards if you could already have one brilliant card. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
              <p>For illustration: if you have one graphic card that perform well to all latest games then you don't have to go all the trouble having xfire/sli to play games. It's only when you think that getting one brilliant card could burn a hole in your pocket, then it is good idea to have two graphic cards (at least with similar specs for reliable performance) rigged under xfire/sli which in turn will perform similar to that one brilliant graphic card. E.g. 1 + 1 = 1 (definitely not in actual math representation) <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"><br><br>My advise is to check on the typical games' graphic requirements that you might play. For this at least you would know by how far you would need to upgrade further in near future or at least how long your card would last or be relevant to current or modern day games like Crysis or others alike in near future.<br><br>For the PCIEX16 slot - your Z68MA-D2H-B3 mobo specs would indicate that "for optimum performance, if only one PCI Express graphics card is to be installed, be sure to install it in the PCIEX16 slot."<br><br>For the PCIEX8 - your Z68MA-D2H-B3 mobo specs would indicate that "the PCIEX8 slot shares bandwidth with the PCIEX16 slot. When the PCIEX8 slot is populated, the PCIEX16 slot will operate at up to x8 mode."<br><br>The PCIEX slots like X1, X4, X8 and X16 are just new and advanced PCI slots for hardware that needs more bandwith than the usual PCI slot (works just same as PCI except for the bandwith). It can be for TV tuners, Firewire cards, USB cards, RAID controllers, SATA controllers, PATA controllers, Network cards, Serial cards and of course video cards. Be sure to check the card's requirements before slotting into one.</p>
              <p>It's good to have a mobo without integrated graphic card which give way to the usage of two PCIEX cards. But any way could do.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"><br><br>In essence, if you have graphic cards slotted in one at PCIEX16 and the other at PCIEX8 then your card in PCIEX16 will operate up to X8 only (not X16) inheriting the 2nd card that is slotted in PCIEX8 (conforms to whichever is lower). So typically, it also apply to those having the 3rd and 4th graphic card slotted at lower bandwith slots like PCIEX4 etc. Thus, choose wisely which type of graphical card setup that you would prefer as I've mentioned above.<br><br>For more information on the xfire/sli usage or to understand further how each Xfire and SLI works, please visit this site which covers most of it:<br><a href="http://www.gamefront.com/how-to-choose-between-nvidia-sli-and-ati-crossfire/#section2">http://www.gamefront.com/how-to-choose-between-nvidia-sli-and-ati-crossfire/#section2</a><br><br>Hope this help.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>Yes but not really slowing it down but that's the way it works. Eventually some would experience better performance and some more or less neutral. It all depends on the type of combination of graphic cards and its specs.</p>
              <p>About all the info, well I used to be a hardware junkie, those were the days when I was younger and I do still keep up with latest development. And internet is the best way for knowledge base.</p>
              <p>Yes for PSU if you can have money to spare then as I've mentioned before, the more the merrier. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>I would suggest that you have to buy whatever PSU that could sufficiently power up your rigged system for time being until you upgrade to higher power capacity in the near future. Thus, you got to save up slowly but surely.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"><br><br>For $130 plus/minus, I believed you can get something like the following:<br><br>1) Cooler Master GX Series GX-650W (max output 780W) Price = $139 approx. @ bizgram<br><br>2) Aerocool E85M-700 (max output 700W) Price &lt; $139 approx. (can ask bizgram or other authorised dealer on availability) - <em>value for money</em><br><br>3) OCZ ModXtreme OCZ700MXSP (max output 700W) Price = $134 @ bizgram</p>
              <p>4) XFX Pro650w Core Edition 80+ (max output 650W) Price = $129 @ bizgram<br><br>The above PSU are the ones that I've used before and reliable. Can look into other brands too.

              <p>I believed that 80+ awarded PSU usually comes with a reasonable cooling and silence factor.</p>
              <p>Well, it's your call. If you are not so eager to lay your hands on the current new games or it's not really that urgent for your to rig a system now, then why not?</p>

              <p>Yes this Corsair is value for money. But please ensure the dimension could comfortably fit into your casing - <span class="desc">150mm(W) x 86mm(H) x 160mm(L) - just take note of the height (H). In other words, just take note of the dimension as you would not want another problem of having your PSU can't fit into with your internal casing arrangement.<br></span></p>
              <p>Cheaper yes, and again you have to take note and consider the additional shipping or delivery charges too.</p>
              <p>Of course if you buy the whole lot from one source, you could probably twist their arm and request for further discount. But again, if you are on tight budget sometimes getting products all over the place is actually not bad though.</p>

              <p>Yes the power capacity can go up to the maximum of 780W whenever the system demands.</p>
              <p>Yes those are useful for multi-gpu graphic configuration. But remember the objective is still the power capacity. E.g. If you buy 600w capacity now and when you ugraded your system with the usage of multi-gpus graphic config, then you need to pay attention of the new power demands which definitely not the same as 600w.</p>
              <p>The bottom line is try to get the bigger watts that could cater for future expansion if you want to invest in it. Or else, you could always upgrade them as you go along.</p>

              <p>At least 750W but that's only minimum requirement. To have continuous and realiable stability a higher capacity preferred.</p>
              <p>My advise for you is not to cross the bridge until you come to it. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></p>
              <p>Since
               you have reasonable graphic card, you may well proceed on to use it 
              with your newly rigged system using the recommended PSU until such time 
              where you got no choice but to upgrade. When the time comes, I believed you
               may have enough savings to upgrade further. Who knows, you could have 
              two systems by then. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></p>
              <p>For computer enthusiasts, you must willing to accept that there's
               no such thing as permanent or long lasting configuration that could be 
              relevant to the ever changing development in the industry. One thing in 
              life that is constant is change. So we might be using xfire/sli now but who 
              knows there will be future configurations better and less headache than 
              that. Probably in the upcoming pc show, you'll never know.</p>
              <p>As for question on the GX Series, it is SLI-ready not much of Xfire. But it's not about connectivity, it's about the flexibility of power distribution whilst on demand. The difference in usage between SLI and Xfire is as described in the earlier article.</p>
              <p>My
               question to you is how soon you want to use 2 graphic cards? If it's 
              not that soon then you could purchase other brand of PSU that comply to your current configuration and start 
              rigging. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></p>
              <p>Leave the flexibility in power capacity for SLI/Xfire to the next time you would upgrade.</p>
              <p>You could always sell away your purchased PSU via local online classified sites when you decide to upgrade to higher capacity. Just keep the original packaging intact. There's always somebody who seek for best deal in used hardware.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></p>
              <p>Hope this helps. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></p>

              <p>OCZ ModXtreme OCZ700MXSP</p>
              <p>I feel like getting that but.. I am not sure if it has 4 PCI
                              slot &gt;&lt; Do you have any idea if it does?</p>
              <p>Isit bad if it doesnt have a crossfire ready sign on it?</p>
              <p>And should I get a Boardcom adaptor? Because my current PC is
                              kinda far away from my room aleast need few meters ethernet cable
                              to my new PC.</p>
              <p>And which kind of wireless PCI should I get or maybe you would
                              recommend something else.</p>

              <p>The OCZ700MXSP is not that bad. It has good reviews too - value for money. As I've said before, take note of the dimension compare to your current casing. Just make sure the PSU could sit comfortably based on it's height. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"><br><br>4 PCI Slot? Are you talking about PSU or Motherboard? I think we have gone through your mobo specs for PCIs. And for the PSU, they never ever have slots but they do provide 4 modular peripheral cables: Here's what they have under modular cables:<br><br>1 x 6-pin PCI-E (for cards that need direct power boost)<br>1 x 6+2-pin PCI-E (for cards that need direct power boost)<br>4 x Peripheral (as mentioned above)<br>2 x Floppy<br>6 x SATA<br><br>And again, please elaborate on the 4 PCI slots in order for me give exact insights. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></p>
              <p>Having certified for crossfire or not doesn't make any difference for PSU, but Motherboad yes, until you want to start using 2 Crossfire graphic cards then you may need to find Crossfire certified PSU for reliability and stability. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"><br><br>Boardcom adaptor is one those players in the market. But let me share with you about wireless configuration.... <br><br>Although, it's better to have cable connection in order to eliminate potential loss of bandwidth and/or "lag", wireless connection also gives better options for such scenario as yours. But before we plunged ourselves into it, let's take note of some of the following known issues:<br><br>1) Most Windows 7 64-bit having certain issues with pci wireless adaptor;<br>2) USB wireless dongle is one of the alternative but can't match with pci wireless adaptor reliability and stability.<br>3) With potential of loss in bandwidth, user might experience close to below average performance in high-speed Internet connection, transfer files, and stream media from greater distances around your entire home.<br><br>But the game is not over yet. Personally I prefer wireless than cable, so in order to overcome all the above known issues, getting the one of the most high performance, reliable and tested adaptor is the answer. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"><br><br>As such, I'll be highly recommending D-Link DWA-552 Xtreme Desktop Adapter, easy out of the box setup, no specific drivers or sophisticated installation needed, Win 7 64bit-friendly. This adaptor is what I am using right now communicating with you. If you think of getting wireless for your desktop, then this is the answer. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></p>
              <p>Hope this helps. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></p>

              <p>Glad to help.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></p>
              <p>No problem though, I understand your situation.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></p>
              <p>I believed we have not changed anything to your system's choice except for PSU. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></p>
              <p>It looks good to go for me. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></p>
              <p>As for determining the PSU sizes; your Cooler Master Elite 430 fits well with the <strong>Standard ATX PS2</strong> size. Which is <strong>150mm(W) x 86mm(H) x 140mm(L)</strong>.</p>
              <p>Here is a clear picture of what you would expect for the above standard size that fits into your Cooler Master Elite 430 like a hand into a glove:</p>
              <p><img style="float: left; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px; border: 0; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" src="http://kaynett.com/images/standardatx.jpg" alt="Standard ATX PS2" width="400" height="141"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So take note of the dimension. The dimensions that could be flexible would be the length (L) which can be longer. The height (H) and the width (W) shall be fixed due to screw holes etc.</p>
              <p>There you go. If you still not sure, do let me know. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></p>
              <p>Hope this helps. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></p>

              <p>Referring to your last paragraph, it depends on what kind of after sales service you would expect.</p>
              <p>Most of the items are having their own respective warranty by the manufacturer directly. Just make sure you don't get defective items or malfunction hardware upon opening the packaging.</p>
              <p>Unless you want them to assemble it for you, I don't think you need to keep in touch with them. As long as you get the price you wanted then your objectives are already being met - mission successful. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></p>
              <p>Always remember to register your respective product via their respective manufacturer in order to have a valid warranty.</p>
              <p>If you have any concerns, please let it out, I may have some solutions for you based on my personal experience. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></p>

              <p>Definitely not worth the 50W and doesn't make any difference with $24 except for the modular part where much depend on your preference whether you are very particular about cable management and prefer to have a clean and cool look internally than unsorted cable layout, which not a big issue, if you know how to organise. Your call. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></p>
