            <div class='col-md body'>Those of you who visit C|Net's Help.com may have seen or even replied to my posting. I need to purchase a notebook computer, it's compulsory for my Poly course. I'll be doing lots of dynamic media production and programming work, so I'll need all the power money could buy. My budget ranges from $3000-$3700. I'm thinking of getting a Digitek model which has a whopping configuration. For both those who have used a Digitek, and those who haven't, can I have your valuable opinion on the product, mainly on it's reliability? Thanks in advance.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, in case you didn't notice, I did wrote that it was deemed compulsory for my Poly course. And yes, I could have gotten a rather good configuration Desktop for that budget. The fact remains, I'm required to purchase a laptop if I wanted to study in that course. I would have wanted Digitek because of their whopping configuration for the same price that would have gotten u a low end system from other brands. I too had bad experience with Digitek desktops. My school used to use it, and once, after it malfunctioned, it was sent for repairs. 1-2 months after it came back, it broke down again. This time more severly. Needless to say, it was since condemned. What I'm hoping is that the Digitek notebooks would fare better than their desktop counterparts. After all, desktop PCs are just little more then consumer goods nowadays, while notebooks are more for the serious individual. Thanks for the reply.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>can i just say that whoever is coordinating the course is an ass (my personal opinion).  sorry, had to get that out of the way.<br><br>i can tell you that for the high-end applications multimedia students/developers need to run for 3d apps, audio, video editing, graphic creation tools, a notebook within your price range is simply going to be borderline.<br><br>i do not mean to sound rude, but have you checked with your course coordinators? they might have recommendations.  it's always good to know the platforms and standards that the course requires, so you can shop to that. no point spending so much money only to find out it's not really going to be useful. (i digress, but why do they not have bursaries for this? *sigh* the education system).<br><br>anyway, from personal experience, i would strongly recommend a toshiba or an ibm. if you're getting the ibm thinkpad series,you can opt to go with the 'made in asia' ones which are approx $2k less than the 'made in usa' models.  if you can afford it though, get a mac.  they open photoshop wayyy faster than any intel/cyrix/amd/what-have-you powered pc's. i love dell, but they're so expensive now.<br><br>but frankly, if you want your notebook to last the length of your course, you gotta look at increasing that budget of yours. hey! maybe shop with your classmates and get a deal from the same shop? just a thought.<br><br>let us know how it goes..i'd be interested as i'm sure others will too.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Digitek Laptops are quite value for money<br>but abit on the heavy side<br>and quite ok after extended use<br>You say for your poly course... which i think you are going to NP(correct me if i am wrong)<br>Np got RFC branch inside.. and sells cheaper to NP students. It is really value for money<br><br>Only 1 sentence of advice.. Dun touch Whitebox.. WHitebox/ Asus laptop are next to useless.. my whitebox spend more time in primefield than in my house<br><br>Brands i recommend for laptop are Toshiba, Fujitsu, NEC and Acer<br><br>------------------<br>To luf someone is nothing, to be luf by someone is something, to be luf by the one you luf is everything.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Shake &gt;&gt; I would have chosen a Dell too..for some reason I like it's design (though I can't understand why...) Main problem is still price -- for a good config for Dell, the price can be quite steep.<br><br>Spiff &gt;&gt; Coordinator of the course? It's a poly course..and it's not just one, it's a few...<br><br>That's right, with my budget I can't get one that I even consider good enough, unless it's a Digitek.. but so far, I'm still worried about the quality.<br><br>For one thing, we need to comply with the specification the course wants, but on the other hand, I want to buy a notebook for other uses such as dynamic media and programming, so I'll need more power than what is required.<br><br>The problem with budget is a cronking headache..I'll just have to wait and see...<br><br>DaKaR &gt;&gt; Value for money, yes... Heavy?? The model I saw looks quite think, but anyway, I wouldn't mind the weight so much. I'm one of those students who's willing to lug along a huge bag to school and back, leaving nothing in school nor carry books in hand... I should be able to handle it.<br><br>Are you really sure they are reliable for long use? I really want to believe so, but so far, all the comments I receive are negative.<br><br>As a matter of fact, I am going to NP. (I believe I posted this piece of info somewhere in other threads) An RFC branch? If I buy a Digitek I should be buying it online. Can it get cheaper than that?? Does the branch do servicign as well?<br><br>Thanks for all the replies.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>
