              <p>IT is an interesting twist about Wikipedia 
              that the most controversial, most heavily trafficked articles — on abortion, 
              politics, virgin birth — are often the most accurate and vandalism-free. Not 
              that people aren’t trying to cause mayhem. It’s just that the frequent visits 
              ensure that vandalism is quickly removed, aided by automated tools that can 
              recognize crude writing before it ever appears.</p>
              <div id="articleInline" class="inlineLeft">
              <div id="inlineBox">
              <div id="inlineMultimedia">
              <div class="story first"></div>
              </div>

              <p>Leave these high-traffic thoroughfares, however, and things can get a bit 
              sketchier. A few wrong turns and you may find yourself deep in 
              Hatfield-and-McCoy territory. Entrenched enemies engage in combat over the 
              wording of topics so obscure — Armenian historians from the first millennium, 
              for example, or breakfast cereals — that you may wonder: so much fighting over 
              this?</p>
              <p>But it is exactly the obscurity that makes these Wikipedia articles ripe for 
              feuding, fighting and vandalism. A basic tenet of the online encyclopedia is 
              that articles be written from a neutral point of view.</p>
              <p>And it can be hard to expect neutrality on some topics. For example, the 430 
              Wikipedia articles about all aspects of Scientology 
              represent a free-floating civil war, a “miasma,” in the description of Ira Brad 
              Matetsky, a corporate litigation lawyer in New York. He is a member of 
              Wikipedia’s Arbitration Committee, which last month waded into the sniping over 
              the Scientology entries.</p>
              <p>In a sweeping ruling with little precedent in the eight-year history of 
              Wikipedia, the committee blocked editing from “all I.P. addresses owned or 
              operated by the Church of Scientology and its associates, broadly interpreted.” 
              The ruling did allow users from those addresses to appeal to be reinstated on a 
              case-by-case basis.</p>
              <p>“We’ve only blocked the work sites; they can edit from their laptops, their 
              kid’s computer at home,” said Roger Davies, the committee member who wrote the 
              exhaustive report after more than five months of fact-gathering and 
              deliberation. (The material in the case file was half a megabyte of data, or 
              more than 400 pages printed out, he said.)</p>
              <p>The decision 
              has a range of sanctions for dozens of users, including outspoken critics of 
              Scientology and Wikipedia administrators, from mild chiding for poor behavior to 
              bans on editing about Scientology to total bans. Among the violations were 
              name-calling and repeated nullifying of the editing of others without any 
              discussion first.</p>
              <p>“It was obvious that this case was going to be controversial pretty much from 
              the start,” Mr. Davies said in a telephone interview from London, where he is a 
              writer. “What we have done is we’ve really tried to make sure that we have not 
              directed our fire at anyone in particular.”</p>
              <p>The Church of Scientology accepted its ban in that spirit, saying in a 
              statement: “More importantly is the fact that Wikipedia finally banned those who 
              were engaged in unobjective and biased editing for the purposes of antagonism as 
              opposed to providing accurate information. We hope the decision will result in 
              more accurate and useful articles on Wikipedia as the site evolves.”</p>
              <p>There are articles covering detailed elements of Scientology belief and 
              practice, important people in the religion, important debunkers of the religion, 
              important documents released by the important debunkers, and important cases 
              about the legality of release of the important documents. Each is a potential 
              battleground between the two camps, often while being viewed only a few dozen 
              times a day. In essence, they preach to the converted or those who used to be 
              converted.</p>
              <p>“One of the problems we keep bumping into is what I call core belief issues — 
              politics, religion, nationalism,” Mr. Davies said. “Fringe faiths, fringe 
              nationalities.”</p>
              <p>The Scientology decision, which received plenty of news coverage, brought the 
              Arbitration Committee (or ArbCom) to public view. No doubt, most users of 
              Wikipedia had no idea that there was a court of last resort for disputes on the 
              site.</p>
              <p>Tens of millions of people around the world use Wikipedia, but few users — 
              even the most frequent editors — can say how or why it works. The two members of 
              the committee I interviewed agreed that the committee was not vital to 
              Wikipedia’s continued operation — the Hatfields and McCoys, after all, were 
              largely left to their own devices by the government and people knew to stay away 
              — but they said that having a way to ban people of bad faith made the site more 
              friendly, more efficient and more welcoming to new editors.</p>
              <p>Wikipedia users elect the panel members, and Mr. Matetsky reports that he is 
              the only active lawyer among them, though there are a few law students. He said, 
              “It is considered ironic; I’m the gung-ho litigation attorney but often on the 
              side of second chances and leniency.” He says he often is opposed to outright 
              bans — he abstained on some of the sanctions in the Scientology case — because 
              “to a user who is banned, Wikipedia is ‘the encyclopedia anyone can edit,’ 
              except for you.”</p>
              <p>The discovery that Wikipedia is not the anarchic paradise some might imagine 
              can be a shock. Others see hypocrisy, evidence that there is a class of users 
              who control what appears there, people who benefit from Wikipedia’s huge public 
              clout with little public scrutiny.</p>
              <p>But taking the longer view, it is apparent that in its brief history, 
              Wikipedia is quickly replicating the creation of society, from an Eden (no 
              rules, no need for rules) to a modern entity.</p>
              <p>“Bureaucracy is inevitable,” said Joseph Reagle, whose Ph.D. thesis was about 
              the history of Wikipedia and collaborative culture, crediting the German 
              sociologist Max Weber. “Even if you have a supposed anarchy or collective, that 
              doesn’t mean the rules aren’t there, just that they are implicit.”</p>
