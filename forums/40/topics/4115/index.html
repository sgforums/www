            <div class='col-md body'>Which school are you in anyway?  Actually, the topic of which NOS (Network OS) is better is very subjective a matter.  Novell &amp; NT has their distinct advantages as well as disadvantages ...<br><br>First, Novell is more established in the NOS area and is very well supported besides UNIX.   I am not too familiar with Novell so I can't say very much about it.  Novell doesn't use Graphical User Interface to configure it's system settings like that of Windows and most services are loaded dynamically too.  Novell also requires a small DOS partition.<br><br>NT is a recent entry by Windows and is much easier to configure (not use ...) because of it's click and set interface.  However, it is quite a resource hog and can be quite troublesome to manage at times ...<br><br>Read up more about the 2 NOS first before making any major decisions.  Or just throw your hands in the air and learn UNIX instead.  That is an OS for "Gods" ... :-)<br><br>"Bluetooth" is a wireless network protocol developed by a consortium of network companies which include Microsoft.  Currently, Bluetooth doesn't seem to have much of a bite (sorry for the pun ..) and it's transfer speed is still slow compared to other types of networks.  Bluetooth also allows household appliances to be networked together w/o cables so that you can control them via a remote or single location ... Imagine if someone wrote a BackOrifice for Bluetooth, setting you oven to toast salad and fridge to broil chicken ...  There are also other wireless protocols around so watch out for them too ...<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Monn:</div><div class="quote_body">I have got problems knowing which one is better.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, your words make me confuse. Are you working in this field? If so, what network your company use often? Though I have gathered quite a lot of their info and studying on it but I hope to study and learn more of common OS that companies use. Anyway, thanks for your advice and hope that you can give me more of your valuable advice.<br><br>Thanks for your effort. Hope to hear more from you and those IT expert.<br><br>Sincerely.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi<br><br>Novell and NT<br><br>It depends on individual. Of coz most ppl will go for NT, this is becasue that have no idea how other NOS work.<br><br>For ur info, Novell in running on top of Window NT which means that u muz install NT first then Novell.<br><br>This does not proof anything good bout NT.<br><br>Novell is a better NOS implementation because of its security feature integrated.<br><br>------------------<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Both also no good lah.  In the marketplace maybe NT better than Novell these days in terms of jobs available.<br><br>The best is u go and attend some Linux or Unix networking classes.  Of course set up something at home yourself to get more hands-on.<br><br>NT keep changing and Novell is almost disappearing.  Unix/Linux will last for a long time still.<br><br>The entire China is going to have a government network run on Linux.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually Netware is only unpopular in some countries. It is still widely used in Australia. As for which OS is better, that's preference, but in Singapore, I would say it goes to Microsoft.<br><br>Let's see if Netware 6 will change that. I don't know really.<br><br>My 2 cents worth.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In terms of market share, Microsoft controls quite a significant amount over Novell. However, there are still quite a lot of Novell installations around.<br><br>Both have their strength and weakness, and one should not ignore any of them. Cause you will not know what your future company deploys. =)<br><br>Do try to pick up Linux though, besides Mandrake, Suse is quite friendly to newbies.

            <div class='col-md body'>I won't comment on which one is better though..<br><br>THru my own experience, I have tried Linux and it was a whole new experience for me.<br><br>I would recommend studying Linux if you are into NOS as it is one of the better NOS around. It's stable and reliable.<br>But if you are a beginner, try Suse or NT if you like. The other NOS demands that you have quite a bi of knowledge in Networking programming.(Which I admit, I dun really have)<br></div>
