              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Wednesday, June 17, 2009</span></em><span style="color: #0000ff;"><br><br>Some video games can make children 
              kinder and more likely to help---not hurt---other people. <br><br>That's the 
              conclusion of new research published in the current (June 2009) issue of 
              Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, a top-tier, peer-reviewed academic 
              journal. <br><br>The article presents the findings of three separate studies, 
              conducted in different countries with different age groups, and using different 
              scientific approaches. All the studies find that playing games with prosocial 
              content causes players to be more helpful to others after the game is over. 
              <br><br>The report is co-authored by a consortium of researchers from the United 
              States, Japan, Singapore and Malaysia. <br><br>"Dozens of studies have 
              documented a relationship between violent video games and aggressive behaviors," 
              said lead author Douglas Gentile, an Iowa State University psychologist. "But 
              this is one of the first that has documented the positive effects of playing 
              prosocial games." <br><br>Prosocial video games involve characters who help and 
              support each other in nonviolent ways. <br><br>"These studies show the same kind 
              of impact on three different age groups from three very different cultures," 
              said Brad Bushman, a University of Michigan co-author of the report. "In 
              addition, the studies use different analytic approaches---correlational, 
              longitudinal and experimental. The resulting triangulation of evidence provides 
              the strongest possible proof that the findings are both valid and 
              generalizable." <br><br>"These studies document that children and adolescents 
              learn from practicing behaviors in games," said Rowell Huesmann, a U-M co-author 
              of the report. <br><br>One study examined the link between video game habits and 
              prosocial behavior among 727 secondary students in Singapore, with a mean age of 
              13. Students listed their favorite games and rated how often game characters 
              helped, hurt or killed other characters. They also answered questions about how 
              likely they were to spend time and money helping people in need, to cooperate 
              with others and share their belongings, and to react aggressively in various 
              situations. <br><br>As in numerous other studies, the researchers found a strong 
              correlation between playing violent video games and hurting others. But the 
              study also found a strong correlation between playing prosocial games and 
              helping others. <br><br>The second study analyzed the long-term connection 
              between video game habits and prosocial behavior in nearly 2,000 Japanese 
              children ages 10 to 16. Participants completed a survey about their exposure to 
              prosocial video games, and rated how often they had helped other people in the 
              last month. Three to four months later, they were surveyed again, and 
              researchers found a significant connection between exposure to prosocial games 
              and helpful behavior months later. <br><br>"This suggests there is an upward 
              spiral of prosocial gaming and helpful behavior, in contrast to the downward 
              spiral that occurs with violent video gaming and aggressive behavior," said 
              Bushman, a professor of communications and psychology and a research professor 
              at the U-M Institute for Social Research (ISR). <br><br>For the third study, the 
              researchers carried out an experiment with 161 U.S. college students, with a 
              mean age of 19. After playing either a prosocial, violent, or neutral game, 
              participants were asked to assign puzzles to a randomly selected partner. They 
              could choose from puzzles that were easy, medium or hard to complete. Their 
              partner could win $10 if they solved all the puzzles. Those who played a 
              prosocial game were considerably more helpful than others, assigning more easy 
              puzzles to their partners. And those who had played violent games were 
              significantly more likely to assign the hardest puzzles. <br><br>"Taken 
              together, these findings make it clear that playing video games is not in itself 
              good or bad for children," Bushman said."The type of content in the game has a 
              bigger impact than the overall amount of time spent playing." <br><br>###
