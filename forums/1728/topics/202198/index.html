This is the stanza:--<br><br>People under delusion accumulate tainted merits but do not tread the Path.<br>They are under the impression that to accumulate merits and to tread the Path are one and the same thing.<br><br>Though their merits for alms-giving and offerings are infinite,<br><br>(They do not realize that) the ultimate source of sin lies in the three poisonous elements (i.e., greed, anger and illusion) within their own mind.<br><br>They expect to expiate their sins by accumulating merit<br><br>Without knowing that felicities obtained in future lives have nothing to do with the expiation of sins.<br><br>Why not get rid of the sin within our own mind,<br><br>For this is true repentance (within our Essence of Mind)?<br><br>(A sinner) who realizes suddenly what constitutes true repentance according to the Mahayana School,<br><br>And who ceases from doing evil and practices righteousness is free from sin.<br><br>A treader of the Path who keeps a constant watch on his Essence of Mind<br><br>May be classified in the same group as the various Buddhas.<br><br>Our Patriarchs transmitted no other system of Law but this 'Sudden' one.<br><br>May all followers of it see face to face their Essence of Mind and be at once with the Buddhas.<br><br>If you are going to look for Dharmakaya<br><br>See it above Dharmalaksana (phenomena), and then your Mind will be pure.<br><br>Exert yourself in order to see face to face the Essence of Mind and relax not,<br><br>For death may come suddenly and put an abrupt end to your earthly existence.<br><br>Those who understand the Mahayana teaching and are thus able to realize the Essence of Mind<br><br>Should reverently put their palms together (as a sign of respect) and fervently seek for the Dharmakaya.<br><br>The Patriarch then added:--<br><br><a href="http://www.sinc.sunysb.edu/Clubs/buddhism/huineng/huineng6.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sinc.sunysb.edu/Clubs/buddhism/huineng/huineng6.html</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">the formless repentance stanza belongs to the repentance of matter ,which one should view the true nature of karmic offense as void and empty<br><br>As Formless Repentance is itself  formless ,so what is the mention of repentance ?<br><br>Since the 3fold of karmic offense(body,speech and mind) can be extinguished and 3fold of karmic offenses can be purified ,so what is the mention of formless .<br><br>practitioner should sincerely cleanse ones karmic offense ,and no longer polluted by the various karmic offense  .<br><br>One should also not deluded by circumstance/encounters .Which is both devoid of its real nature.<br><br>Repentance which mainly is to "extinguish" the past, present and future which made up of the 3 periods of karmic offense ,which is the purpose to attain the purification of Body ,speech and mind<br><br>Thus is the purpose of repentance<br><br>As Virlmakirti Sutra mentions which is the true nature of karmic offense is not inner , not outer and not in-between .....<br><br>Translated from Commentary by venerable Master yanpei<br><br>(to be  continued)</span><br><br></div>
