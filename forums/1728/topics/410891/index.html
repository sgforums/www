              had been discovered before 1889 and is quite extensive. It will take 3 months to

              information about the Rinchen Terzod. We have recently spoken with Ven. 
              Yangthang Tulku Rinpoche and he has indicated that he would like to start the 
              Rinchen Terzod on the first day of the 10th Tibetan month.<br><br>Start Date 
              &amp; Suggested Donation<br>According to the Western calendar, the Rinchen

              students, new and experienced, are welcome to attend these transmissions. The 
              prerequisite is a good motivation and the aspiration to achieve 
              enlightenment!<br>Of course attending the whole program is best, but we can 
              attend on a daily basis according to our available time. We don't yet have the 
              daily schedule but when we do we will let everyone know. <br><br>To the extent 
              we can establish the sequence of empowerments prior to the start of the

              on a case by case basis. <br><br>Food will not be available at ODD, but there

              temple. We plan to have an online registration process in place soon, so watch 
              your inbox and check the website for additional information.<br>We will need a 
              lot of help during the program, so please plan to participate as much as you 
              can! We will send more details during the registration 
              process.<br><br>Sponsorship<br>As a means of accumulating merit, some people are 
              able to be sponsors and underwrite some or all of the considerable costs 
              associated with hosting Dharma events of this type; some people have already 
              expressed interest in contributing in this way. Any donation, large or small, 
              will surely establish a connection for you with Ven. Yangthang Tulku Rinpoche

              <p>It is said that at the time of the rebirth of Tertön Dorje Dechen 
              Lingpa, from all directions the sky in Sikkim resounded in thunder, "I am here!" 
              Sogtrul Rinpoche, his principal student and lineage holder, was already awaiting 
              him, as the place of his rebirth had been predicted both by His Holiness Dudjom 
              Rinpoche and by His Holiness Reting Rinpoche, the Senior Tutor to His Holiness 
              the Dalai Lama. By the time Sogtrul Rinpoche reached him he had already declared 
              himself to be the rebirth of the tertön from Dhomang. He had become known as 
              Yangthang Tulku, as he is from the Yangthang clan in Sikkim.</p>
              <p>In addition to mastering the extensive training in practices of his lineage, 
              Yangthang Rinpoche was completely trained in the Kangyur and Tangyur, and in the 
              works of Longchenpa. He was widely recognized for the quality and depth of his 
              realization, the power of his attainment, and the purity of his transmissions. 
              Rinpoche is known as a compassionate, humble, no-nonsense Dzogchen master of the 
              Nyingma, Old School Tradition.</p>
              <p>In 1959, when the communist chinese invaded Tibet, Yangthang Rinpoche fled 
              Dhomang. He was later captured by the chinese, and imprisoned for 22 years. He 
              helped many fellow prisoners who could not bear the hardship to die peacefully 
              by performing Phowa, transferring their consciousness to Pure Lands. Though he 
              witnessed and experienced much torture, he bears no resentment to his captors, 
              only compassion. In fact, he became a spiritual advisor to some of the guards. 
              When people express sympathy about his imprisonment, Rinpoche says that because 
              of Dharma, his mind was more free in prison than worldly people experience in 
              the best of circumstances. <br><br>Following the death of mao tse tung he was 
              released. He returned to Dhomang to find his monastery completely dismantled. He 
              then obtained permission to go to Sikkim. As a simple yogi he traveled back and 
              forth to Nepal and Bhutan, receiving transmissions and empowerments from His 
              Holiness Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche and His Holiness Dodrubchen Rinpoche. 
              <br><br>In recent times he has come to the United States several times and also 
              travels to Taiwan where he has many devoted students. As he is now around 80 
              years old, we don't know if he'll be able to return again. This is a rare and 
              precious opportunity to receive blessings and teachings from one of the few 
              remaining great masters of his generation.
