              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 12.75pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: #888888;">By Rodney Smith</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;"><br> Over the last half-century, Buddhist practices in the West have grown in
              popularity. Mindfulness has become associated with stress reduction, enhanced
              immunological protection, psychological well-being, and profound states of
              happiness. In many cases, mindfulness has been uncoupled from the Buddha’s
              teaching altogether and is a stand-alone cognitive therapy for the treatment of
              various mental difficulties, from depression to obsessive-compulsive disorder.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">The term anatta, which means “no
              [permanently abiding] self or soul,” is at the heart of the Buddha’s teaching,
              but with our Western emphasis on psychological health it is perhaps inevitable
              that this essential aspect of the teaching is downplayed or even avoided.
              Emptiness, after all, stands in opposition to many of our most important values
              such as self-reliance, individual initiative, and the pursuit of pleasure. We
              want the contentment and happiness promised by the Buddha, but with “me” fully
              stabilized and intact.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">This selective approach to Buddhism would
              seem to allow the best of both the Eastern and Western worlds. We can use the
              techniques and practices that serve our immediate purpose without asking the
              deeper spiritual questions concerning our very existence. Best of all, the
              methods work, and the benefits of greater mindfulness dramatically affect both
              our mental health and the ease of our life.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">The story would end happily here, except
              that there is a rub when we pare back the dharma, the Buddha’s teaching.
              Externally we see the earth’s environment eroding before our eyes, the
              population soaring, and our natural resources diminishing. We see unparalleled
              greed and anger forming greater divisions within an evershrinking planet. At a
              time when the world pleads for kindness and compassion, we see cultures
              continuing their ancient bickering while forgetting their shared heritage.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">Internally our problems continue as well. We
              hurt, and we do not understand why. Fear, desire, and grief fill our life. Our
              psychological sophistication should solve our problems, but therapies and
              self-improvement methods do not seem to diminish our isolation and separation.
              We would like to feel compassion for all beings, but our own problems are so
              demanding that we have little time to include others in our heart. We try to
              compensate for these shortcomings with more socially engaged activities, but we
              find that our motivation is often based in righteousness, which further divides
              the world.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">Through all our techniques and procedures,
              the sense-of-I remains the cornerstone of our existence. When we look at our
              experience, we appear to be the center of the universe. All experiences seem to
              confirm our central place in life, and every input is interpreted through the
              lens of self. We hear about the corrupted power of the ego but seem unable to
              shake off this ever-present sense-ofme. Its authority seems absolute; most of
              us eventually acquiesce to its rule, and we engage our dharma practice carrying
              the sense-ofme along within our spiritual development.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">Many of us incorporate a gentler and kinder
              spiritual “me” into our practice, which is in opposition to the worldly “me,”
              the troublemaking twin that needs a resolution. We then play the familiar theme
              of divide and conquer, pitting our spiritual ideals against our worldly
              reactions. Eventually we see that calling the ego different names serves to
              strengthen its overall grip and control, which inevitably leads to greater pain
              and ill will.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">Some of us pursue the path of wisdom to
              weaken the ego’s influence, and we have genuine insights into the ego’s
              insubstantiality, but we may return from those revelations with the power and
              force of “me” very much intact. The ego has a way of claiming reference to its
              own demise by saying, “Oh, I just had an experience of my own emptiness.” No
              matter what we do, no matter how many revelations we have regarding our true
              nature, we still seem to organize the world around the basic premise that “I”
              am in here looking out at everything else. At some point the sincere dharma
              practitioner realizes that as long as the “I” is the governing force behind
              thoughts and emotions, then our internal world will be filled with abstract
              arguments and the external world will be laden with conflict and struggle. We
              begin to further understand that the cause of our suffering is not what we do
              but the way we perceive, and until this obstacle is addressed, all actions of
              body, speech, and mind will predictably reinforce our old perceptions of self
              and other, problem and solution, and limitation and freedom.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: center; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">Spiritual practice is stepping out of the
              assumed reality of “me” by understanding what the “me” is and withdrawing
              energy from its perceptual fixations. The Buddha made the realization and
              integration of anatta central to his teaching—we are without separate
              existence; that is a fact. When we align all our practices and efforts with
              this fact, the spiritual path becomes quite simple and transforms everything we
              do. All the monasteries, renunciations, restraints, skillful means, full-lotus
              posture, and nose-tip awareness, all of it, has only this intended purpose. We
              must be very careful not to carry the assumption of separation to the practices
              that have the intended purpose of stepping out of self-deception. If we do, we
              will be reinforcing our egoic conditioning and move in the opposite direction
              from the freedom of the Buddha.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">Much of my early practice carried this
              contradiction. My heart genuinely sought the truth, but I conceived of freedom
              as a very long and arduous process that needed focused determination and hard
              work. My efforts were directed toward surmounting myself. “I” was the problem,
              and “I” would apply effort toward resolving the difficulty of “me.” Often my
              teachers spoke of lifetimes necessary to achieve awakening and the long
              cultivation of mental qualities that freedom depended on. I thought of freedom
              as something that I was working toward but that was not accessible now.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">After a few years of strenuous retreating, I
              ordained as a Buddhist monk and went on a pilgrimage to Bombay in January 1980, to visit the renowned
              sage Nisargadatta Maharaj. I had known of him years earlier through his book<span> </span><em><span style="font-family: Helvetica;">I
              Am That</span></em>. After a few days of bantering back and forth about my
              attachment to being a monk, he said, “You are like a man holding a flashlight,
              trying to run beyond its beam. The view you are holding…is undermining your
              intent.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">“You don’t understand Buddhism,” I retorted.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">“You do not understand the truth,” he
              replied.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">I was righteous, but he was right, and his
              message stuck. As the days unfolded, I lost my arrogance and my identification
              with the Buddhist robes, leaving me naked and exposed. By directly pointing to
              the truth, Nisargadatta destroyed my spiritual structure, purpose, and frame of
              reference. In their absence, something awoke with an upsurge of energy that
              seemed impossible to contain. It exploded with the revelation of what the
              Buddha was pointing to: The path that Nisargadatta revealed was not a search
              but a find, not a struggle but an abiding, not a cultivation but something
              intrinsic to all. I had been committed to the long-enduring mind of practice
              but not the essence, not the inherent freedom that was immediately available.
              From this vantage point, there seemed far too much methodology in the Buddhism
              I had been practicing and not enough release.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">he Buddha’s Eightfold Path can either build upon or dismantle the
              sense-of-self, depending upon how we use it. When aligned within its proper
              orientation, the path appears like a perfectly formed diamond, each facet complimenting
              the beauty of the whole. After my meeting with Nisargadatta, the Buddha’s
              teaching became breathtaking in its simplicity and elegance. The entire path
              was, and had always been, accessible. Prolonged retreats in silence or
              conversations over dinner had the same reference point. Nothing was ever at
              odds with its opposite. Every practice and action had its place and appropriate
              time, but never contradicted or enhanced what was already there. Everything was
              perfectly together, and every movement arose from that perfection.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">This was the beginning of my understanding of lay Buddhism. A lay
              Buddhist is one who fully embodies his or her entire life of work, family, and
              relationships without spiritually prioritizing any activity. From this
              perspective all moments are equally precious, and whether we are practicing
              formal meditation on retreat or showing up for ordinary moments of our lay
              life, freedom is never diminished. The unequivocal resolve not to move away
              from where we are is essential. Once we abandon the belief that there is a more
              spiritually useful moment than the one we are in, we have embraced our life and
              infused it with the energy for awakening.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">There are three impediments to lay Buddhist practice. The first is
              the belief that monasticism and long retreats are the only way to realize one’s
              true nature. In Asia monasteries have served
              as the central training ground for aspiring Buddhist practitioners, and because
              of this strong history within a monastic tradition, much of Buddhism is derived
              from that formal culture. Now, as the Buddhist tradition settles in the West,
              monasteries have played a diminishing role in the training and teaching of
              Buddhism, and in their place residential retreat centers have formed as
              substitute monasteries. The lay Western Buddhist often undertakes intensive
              training during residential retreats, which last from a few days to several
              months, much as their predecessors did within monasteries in previous
              centuries. All of this has given rise to an emphasis on a silent, secluded life
              as being central to Buddhist training.<br> <br> For a few people, a full lifetime as a monastic or living many years on retreat
              is a wise direction. Each of us has a unique spiritual design that pulls us
              toward freedom. The problem arises when we listen to others for our direction,
              or think we “should” do something because others have done it in the past.
              Spiritual growth is a fine-tuning of our ear to the needs of our heart.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">What obscures this understanding in many of us is the belief that
              the silent retreat is a priority over other expressions of life. When we
              believe we are not where we need to be for spiritual growth, we relegate our
              daily life to a secondary tier. We energetically pull out of our spiritual life
              and wait for the appropriate secluded moment in order to fully engage. Leaning
              toward or away from any experience creates an anticipation of fulfillment in
              the future, and the sacred that exists here and now is lost. Discovering the
              sacred within all moments is the hallmark of awakening.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">We often feel our everyday existence is a distraction from our
              spiritual intention. When this happens, life is divided between the sacred and
              mundane, and the mind pits one concept against the other. But belief shapes
              reality, and if the belief is maintained that the sacred lies somewhere else
              other than Now, our spiritual life will be governed by that limitation. The
              truth is that the sense-of-self is not separate from the moment in which it is
              arising, any more than the sense-of-self is outside the mind that it thinks it
              possesses. In fact, realizing the undivided mind also heals the dualistic
              notion of “me” being outside the moment.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">We cannot delay fully embracing the moment. To do so maintains the
              divisions within the mind, the division between the mind and the body, and the
              division between the organism and its environment. All divisions are attempts
              to keep us from the truth of what is right here. When this is understood by the
              sincere practitioner, there can be no more hesitation, no more postponement, and
              no more pulling back and waiting for a more opportune time. It is literally now
              or never.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">Suddenly the Buddha is found in the middle of relationships, work,
              and family, within all activities, reactions, thoughts, and emotional
              responses. Nothing is outside Now, because no boundary is drawn to separate Now
              from then. The message of the Buddha is equally relevant in all locations and
              at all times. Until this is fully realized and until there is no movement to
              escape this environment for a better spiritual setting, we will continue to
              suffer.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">The second way in which lay Buddhist practice is impeded is
              through misunderstanding the teaching of the long-enduring mind. Buddhism is
              full of metaphors of time that disarm us. “You have cried more tears than the
              waters of the great oceans,” says the Buddha, speaking of our endless lifetimes
              in terms of inconceivable numbers.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">I have heard some students express hopelessness with these
              numbers. They interpret the metaphors to mean that it takes endless
              reincarnations to achieve freedom. I believe the Buddha uses these analogies to
              point toward patience. The numbers he uses are so vast that he seems to be
              taking time away, but he certainly is not discouraging our efforts. When time
              is removed, so is the future expectation of what and when something might
              occur. Anticipation is actually counterproductive to the practice, because by
              waiting to be fulfilled in the future, we drift away from what is immediately
              present.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">Perhaps the Buddha’s use of time is also an attempt to motivate us
              out of complacency. Through these analogies he seems to be pointing out that if
              we do nothing, nothing will change, and we will spend endless lifetimes lost in
              our divided mind. These examples are a call toward urgency—but it is an urgency
              moderated with patience. Patience is essential on the spiritual path, but delay
              is not. Patience invites the timeless back in, and practicing becomes a waking
              game, not a waiting game, because patience is the state of full wakefulness.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">The most important understanding for a lay Buddhist is the
              immediate availability of awakening. Awakening need not arrive after a long,
              protracted practice history unless we believe that this is necessary. We
              deliberately delay our readiness because we are divided about what we really want.
              We practice until we are tired of preparing for what has always existed here
              and now, then we become quiet and surrender.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">The question of readiness is really a question of intentionality.
              Do we want this or not? If we do, we have to look squarely at our competing
              interests. We can use our time most skillfully by observing the value and
              limitation of our opposing desires. A fully engaged lay life allows continuous
              feedback regarding those interests. Most of us indulge our desires rather than
              learn about their limitations, but that learning opportunity is always present.
              Again, it is the sincerity of the student that will determine whether her life
              is a hindrance or a support to her spiritual growth.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">A third way a lay approach to spiritual fulfillment can be impeded
              is by investing the sacred within particular practices and conditions. When I
              was younger, I followed the example of an experiment once performed by
              Krishnamurti: I placed a rock that held no special significance on my mantel
              and bowed to it each day. I did this deliberately to see whether I could infuse
              a unique quality into something completely ordinary, simply by incorporating
              the rock within a morning ritual. At the end of a month, the rock held a
              special, holy place in my perception.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">The Buddha statue, the zafu [cushion] we sit upon, the saintly
              picture or poem, the states of mind accessed in meditation, solitude, or even
              nature itself, can all become accentuated beyond the ordinary by infusing them
              with special attention. When we invest the sacred into specific conditions, we
              feel spiritual only when we are having those experiences. The rest of life goes
              spiritually unnoticed.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">Spiritual forms and rituals can be very helpful in focusing our
              intention and providing a doorway to the sacredness of all life. They can
              awaken a sensitivity of heart and allow our mind to become quiet. Forms and
              rituals become a problem when they stop representing a gateway into oneself and
              become an exclusive presentation of the sacred, such as the belief that the only
              way to commune with God is by going to church or taking a walk in nature, or
              that the only way to meditate is to be alone in quiet surroundings. When we
              think of rituals and forms as the only way to access the sacred, the rest of
              our life is placed on spiritual hold. The lay Buddhist begins to recover the
              sacred in the most remote areas of life, in the midst of difficulty and
              dissatisfaction, loneliness and despair. The reality of problems is challenged
              and investigated, and life begins to thrive free of circumstances and
              conditions. The heart takes over and is resurrected from the conditioned habits
              of mind.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">The lay Buddhist harbors no defense, seeks no shelter, and avoids
              no conflict for the resolution of wholeness. It is here in the middle of our
              total involvement that this alchemy of spirit can best be engaged. Our life
              becomes focused around this transformation as our primary intention for living.
              We find everything we need immediately before us within the circumstances and
              conditions we long begrudged ourselves. Spiritual growth becomes abundantly
              available and is no longer associated exclusively with any particular
              presentation of form.<span> </span><br> <strong><br> <strong><span style="font-family: Helvetica;">Rodney Smith</span></strong></strong><span> </span><em><span style="font-family: Helvetica;">is
