              why are you supporting Trump?" a volunteer for an opposing politician asks
              an older gentleman standing outside his house in Las Vegas's Silverado Ranch
              neighborhood. The older gentleman has just declared his support for Trump and
              is now going to explain. "Because he says this," the man responds,
              throwing his middle finger upward, "to everybody."</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 18.7pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 115%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #444444;'>And
              so it is. With one pantomimed action, we see and feel the thrust of the
              argument that the electorate is angry ... and willing to go to extreme lengths
              in a presidential election cycle. The question, however, may not be so much
              about what is making the electorate angry as what anger says about the
              electorate.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 18.7pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 115%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #444444;'>In
              Buddhist thought, anger is one of three poisons, the others being greed and
              ignorance. Together, they create a trance state overtaking the mind, causing
              delusion and suffering. The delusion is of a particular kind, believing we are
              separate from other living things and the physical earth that is our home. From
              this stance of separation, the individual focuses on his or her own needs and
              desires. However, something feels amiss. The trance states produces cravings
              that seem to grow the more they are addressed. The poisons feed each other with
              amplifying effects: feeling separate, we want more and more; desiring more, we
              become suspicious of others; suspicion breeds fear and anger; anger fuels our
              sense of separation -- and the cycle continues. At the collective level, anger
              becomes simultaneously grandiose and specific, a middle finger thrust into the
              air for "everybody" and targeted emotional resentments aimed at
              specific groups.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 18.7pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 115%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #444444;'>What
              we know about anger is that it inflates self-importance and builds a wall
              between genuine introspection and finding right action. Anger can be a useful
              signal, alerting us that something is amiss, but if we don't explore what truly
              makes us angry, anger isolates us from our heart's intelligence and our
              connection with others. Anger may be thrilling, but it also leaves us separate
              and alone.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 18.7pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 115%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #444444;'>The
              antidote to this delusional state involves humility, introspection and personal
              responsibility. Even more, it requires a demonstrated concern for others,
              especially those less fortunate. In a world that sought to combat anger, greed
              and ignorance, we would strive to create a better world for everyone. And we
              would be mindful of how our own emotional reactions, including anger, can lead
              to greater self-understanding. The quest would be to cultivate peace of mind
              from within and harmonious relations with others in the larger world.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 18.7pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 115%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #444444;'>Now
              imagine that we live in a parallel universe, where people believe they are
              indeed separate. In this world, greed is reframed as success, evidence of being
              in God's grace. Ignorance is a form of bliss because we don't have to suffer
              other perspectives or face the consequences of our actions. Arrogance,
              self-aggrandizement, and factual embellishments (making things up) are valued
              as demonstrations of confidence, self-esteem, and rhetorical skill. In this
              world, the way to address insecurity is to accumulate more things, and the way
              to address vulnerability is to create an enemy.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 18.7pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 115%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #444444;'>How
              do we reconcile what appears to be two such separate worlds? How can we shift
              our attention back and forth between the social forces fermenting a growing
              rage within the collective and compassion for those succumbing to the trance
              state that accompanies anger?</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 18.7pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 115%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #444444;'>Comprehending
              the attractiveness of anger is an essential element for its healing. There is
              something absolutely delicious about finding fault with others and making one's
              own insecurities the justification for demonizing others. But rather than
              simply condemning anger or allowing it free rein, we can approach it with
              gentle inquiry. What values are being threatened? What beliefs are being
              jeopardized? What control is being wrested from our grasp? And conversely, how
              good does it feel judging others, punishing them, and relishing in revenge? If
              anger is delicious, we should be willing to recognize how much we take delight
              in threatening, haranguing, and demeaning those from whom we feel separate.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 18.7pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 115%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #444444;'>The
              poignancy and even distressing nature of this insight struck me recently as I
              read of Donald Trump's address to a South Carolina audience about an American
              atrocity that never actually happened. It doesn't matter. For Trump, the
              veracity of the story is inconsequential. The story is simply a vehicle to
              channel anger. He lives in the alternate universe I described earlier, one in
              which arrogance and factual embellishment are evidence not of a disordered
              internal state, but of confidence and rhetorical skill.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 18.7pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 115%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #444444;'>"You
              know, I read a story -- it's a terrible story, but I'll tell you," Trump
              said. "Should I tell you? Or should I not?" The crowd cheered him on.
              The taste of punishment and revenge, the bittersweet fruit of anger, was
              already on their tongues.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 18.7pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 115%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #444444;'>The
              story as told by Trump is this: Following an attack, U.S. General John J.
              Pershing had 50 enemy combatants lined up for execution. The bullets for the
              execution were dipped in pig's blood, and the soldiers loaded the blood-soaked
              ammunition into their rifles. They were then ordered to execute 49 of the men.
              The 50th person, Trump informed the crowd, was told to "go back to your
              people and you tell them what happened. And for 25 years there wasn't a
              problem."</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 18.7pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 115%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #444444;'>No
              problem.</span></em><span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #444444;'> </span></span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #444444;'>This
              was, for me, the most chilling aspect of the story, and it evoked anger.
              Stories of my relatives in Eastern Europe lined up and shot dead into a ditch
              by Nazi soldiers linger in my memory. These soldiers too were following orders.
              They may have even believed that killing my relatives was necessary to combat
              the Jewish problem, eliminating them the solution. No problem.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 18.7pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 115%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #444444;'>So
              my anger wells up, and I ask myself what is going on. My anger is
              self-defensive. I carry with me a fear that the atrocities visited on my own
              blood can happen again, though not just to Jews, but to my brothers and sisters
              who may be Muslim, Arab, African, Hispanic and Asian. My anger is a residue of
              my hyper-vigilance, that I took seriously a vow made that I would not be a
              bystander to demagogues or political parties that turn normal human emotions
              such as anger, fear, and vulnerability into collective poison. My own
              vulnerability begins to bleed into awareness. Tears well up. My cheek is wet
              and my body just so slightly shivers.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 18.7pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 115%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #444444;'>And
              I remember to breathe. I remind myself that emotions such as anger are
              ephemeral, and what is important is not to hold on to it, to not let a single
              emotion define me. I engage in some sober self-talk.<span> </span><em>Anger will
              not be my substitute for stepping forward with a more hopeful message about
              human possibility.</em></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 18.7pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 115%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #444444;'>With
              discipline, anger can be tamed and transformed into caring, even for those I
              may disagree with, fear, or not understand. Anger, however, does not
              automatically disappear. Only when we grasp its role as a signal function, rather
              than a thought we identify with, can we allow the feeling to shift naturally to
              a broader, more compassionate stance. As with a diabetic looking at a chocolate
              cake, the temptation for anger is lessened by understanding how terrible the
              body will feel if the thing is mindlessly ingested. We cannot and must not be
              passive, but neither shall we evolve by being emotionally self-indulgent or
              self-righteous. Recognizing how anger functions as a manipulator of emotional
              life while also understanding its vital function as signal for deeper distress
              can be a basis for real dialogue, connecting us to our shared human experiences
              of fear, vulnerability, and the values we hold dear.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 18.7pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 115%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #444444;'>The
              political fanning of flames, the surging up of anger, and the demonization of
              the <em>other</em><span><em> </em></span>are all signals, at the
              collective level, of something deeply unsettled. We have reason to be cautious
              and alert to the dangers ahead. However, our inner attitude matters a great
              deal. If we succumb to despair or simply meet anger with anger, we will fail to
              bring forward a new ethic that embraces the reality of our interconnectedness.
              Let us be a growing network of evolutionary humans who meet anger with
              curiosity and loving resolve.</span></p>
