              <p class="text"><strong>Life release</strong> is a Buddhist tradition of saving lives of animals 
              that are destined to be killed. Although every life is precious, the fact of 
              being alive inevitably causes taking lives of other beings. We cannot completely 
              prevent this situation because as long as we walk, breath, eat, and so forth, we 
              cause deaths of many creatures. However we can cultivate mindfulness, and try to 
              reduce taking lives to the best of our ability. We can also offer a gift of life 
              and protection through the practice of Life Release.</p>
              <p class="text"><strong>No matter what our life style</strong>, we can do this 
              practice. It benefits those who offer the gift of life as well as those who 
              receive it. And regardless of what religion we practice, its result will be 
              strengthened if the practice is concluded with an aspiration that all beings 
              without exception enjoy happiness and a life free from any harm.</p>
              <p class="text">If we are Buddhists, we dedicate the merit from the practice of 
              life release to the benefit of all beings, to long life of Buddhist teachers and 
              practitioners, and to the flourishing of the Dharma. As the followers of His 
              Holiness the Gyalwa Karmapa in particular, we dedicate the practice to his long 
              life, and to the flourishing of his activity in the world.</p>
              <p class="text">When asked about adjusting the practice to the situation in 
              Western countries, His Holiness the 17th Gyalwa Karmapa said that the meaning of 
              life release is broad, that the practice can be done in a variety of ways, and 
              that we should use our intelligence in deciding what way is most suitable in our 
              particular circumstance.</p>
              <p class="text"><strong>In a talk given during the Kagyu Monlam Chenmo 
              2006</strong>, His Holiness has also encouraged Karma Kagyu students to engage 
              in saving lives through obstaining (at least periodically) from eating meat.

                          Society (Singapore)</a></em></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><br> <br> <strong>Releasing Animals: Good or Bad?</strong><br> <br> In Singapore, many people release animals. Here are some facts about 
                          this practice.<br> <br> Many pet shop animals cannot survive in the wild. They no longer have 
                          the ability and instinct to find food and shelter, or to run away 
                          from predators.<br> <br> Many animals can only survive in special habitats, such as the rainforest, 
                          desert or mangrove swamp. Releasing an animal into the wrong habitata 
                          will cause it to suffer and then die.<br> <br> If we release a foreign animal, it may not survive in our country 
                          and climate. For example, a land tortoise from India can only survive 
                          well in a seasonal climate.<br> <br> If we release an anmal from a foreign country, it may compete with 
                          our local wild animals for food, shelter, nesting areas and living 
                          space. These foreign animals may also eat the babies of local animals.<br> <br> Can we tell if an animal is sick or healthy? If a sick animal is released, 
                          it may infect wild animals which have no immunity against certain 
                          diseases.<br> <br> Infect animals may transmit diseases to humans.<br> <br> When everyone releases animals, the combined quantity will upset the 
                          natural balance. The areas of release will not be able to cope with 
                          the sudden increase of animals.<br> <br> <strong>We can stop these cruel situations</strong><br> <br> Do not buy birds and other wild animals for releasing. Do not patronise 
                          these shops.<br> <br> Do not be directly responsible for the capture of wild animals to 
                          continue.<br> <br> Please do not release these animals:<br> <br> Red-eared terrapin and Chinese soft shell turtle. These turtles can 
                          grow large and are more aggressive. They will cause the decrease of 
                          Singapore's own rare turtles.<br> <br> Birds bought from bird shops. Most of the birds that are bought from 
                          bird shops get sick when they are captured and imprisoned in a crowded, 
                          unhygenic cage.<br> <br> Aquarium fish. Most of these fishes are forced to share crowded tanks 
                          in the fish shop. Diseases spread easily in such poor conditions.<br> <br> American bullfog. This aggressive, large frog eats up our smaller 
                          native frogs.<br> <br> Pet animals. It is extremely unkind to abandon your pet.<br> <br> <strong>The Law</strong><br> <br> In Singapore, it is against the law to release any animal into our 
                          public parks, reservoirs, nature reserves and many other places.<br> <br> It is also against the law to catch wild animals. When we buy a wild 
                          animal from a shop, we are therefore involved in a crime.<br> <br> <strong>Wise actions</strong><br> <br> Do your part to truly show compassion for animals<br> <br> Rescue and care for animals when needed. It can be a baby bird which 
                          has dropped out of its nest or a turtle found in the middle of a road; 
                          an injured animal or fishes trapped in a drying pond.<br> <br> Encourage others not to buy wild animals to keep as pets, for consuption 
                          or to release.<br> <br> Encourage pet owners to love and give proper care to their pet animals, 
                          and not to abandon them.<br> <br> Volunteer your help to organisations that care for animals.<br> <br> Make others aware about the importance of conserving nature and protecting 
                          our environment.<br> <br> Join an animal welfare group to help protect and improve conditions 
                          for all animals.<br> <br> Join a green group to protect our nature areas. These are homes to 
                          countless animals.<br> <br> <strong>Life is cheap: Demand=Supply</strong><br> <br> When we buy animals to release, we are encouraging the shop-owner 
                          to catch even more animals from the wild to sell.<br> <br> For example, thousands of grass birds are captured from the wild for 
                          people to buy for release. Bird and pet shops sell these 'cheap' birds 
                          at a price of $1.50 or $2.<br> <br> Many of these birds die when they are caught, and during the journey 
                          to the shops.<br> <br> Since these are 'cheap' birds, they are treated like dirt. Crowded 
                          into dirty cages and standing in their own excrement, they are not 
                          given any proper care, food and fresh water.<br> <br> <strong>How can we help to protect and conserve endangered 
                          species?</strong><br> <br> Do not buy and keep endangered species as pets or to eat.<br> <br> Do not buy any products made from endangered speices. For example, 
                          jewellery made from sea turtle shell, elephant ivory and fur of wilds 
                          animals.<br> <br> Do not buy 'medicines' made from endangered species. For example, 
                          tiger penis, dried seahorses, bear gall, rhinoceros horn, sea turtle 
                          meat, etc. Use herbal remedies instead.<br> </span></p>

              <h1 style="margin: 0pt 0pt 5px;">The folly of releasing animals as acts of compassion</h1>
              <h3 style="margin: 0pt 0pt 5px;">by Kelvin Wong, The Buddhist Channel, May 26, 2005</h3>
              <p style="margin: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Singapore</strong> -- Releasing of animals 
              has been a traditonal practice of Buddhists. This action is probably 
              inspired by the vows to save all beings from suffering, which 
              incidentally also helps the person gain some merits.</span></p>
              </div>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><img src="http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/picture/bless-life.jpg" alt="" width="230" height="286" align="left">Compassion
               as it has been said is foolish without wisdom. Wisdom comes not from 
              gut feeling of "I think I did the right thing", but arises from careful 
              study and understanding of the consequences of our actions. Is this 
              respect, when we release an animal from its captivity, are we certain 
              that our actions are based on wise contemplation, despite our 
              compassion? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Just as the Buddha had urged the kalamas (in the 
              Kalama Sutta) to investigate all teachings and traditions, Buddhists now
               are urged to investigate this tradition of animal release, to know if 
              their acts are worthy of the cause.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The action of releasing birds has by itself 
              sprouted an industry for it. For a religion that talks about compassion,
               it does seems strange that our actions can bring about an industry that
               catches birds in the wild, hold them in small and cramp cages (usually 
              with many other birds) and then allowing people to buy and releasing 
              them back to the wild again, just so that we "humans" may feel that we 
              have done a good deed.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">One of the methods of catching birds by these 
              vendors is to set up a net across the woods. As the bird flies through 
              they get entagled inside it. Many of these nets are not meant for 
              catching bird harmlessly, unlike those used for research. The entagled 
              birds often gets injured or exhaust themselves when they desperately try
               to get free. By the time the bird catcher comes and collect the bird, 
              they are either exhausted or starving. Many either die in the net or 
              while being transported to the market. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Those that live are then stuffed into a cage which
               hosts many other birds as well, often in unhygienic conditions. We 
              don't even know if the vendors feed the birds, if at all. Due to the 
              cramped conditions, some of the birds fight amongst themselves in the 
              cage. Some suffocate or bleed to death because of the fights. By the 
              time anyone comes along to buy these birds for release they would have 
              already suffered for a few days. So, for every bird released, probably 
              five more would have died.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Such acts of cruelty are not just consigned to 
              birds, but also to other species such as fishes, terrapins and 
              tortoises. To have them caught, some vendors would have their habitats 
              destroyed or poisoned, some are ripped apart from their flock or have 
              their entire flock killed. Like a lot marine fishes (which are not bred 
              in farms), many of them are caught by locals using dynamites or cyanide 
              poisoning. In the process, their habitats are ruined, which in turn 
              render those not caught to suffer and live in a poisoned environment. 
              Many of these shop owners who buys fishes and animals care very little 
              about the sources of these animals or the methods used to catch them. 
              Their main concern, obviously is the bottom line.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Some of us may feel that its okay to buy from 
              restaurants because we are directly saving the beings from being killed 
              and they don't effect the economics of the restaurant themselves. 
              Ironically however, when we purchase any "live food" whether with the 
              intention of eating or releasing it, the act itself continues the 
              economic cycle that benefits those who make a living out of selling 
              these animals. Also, some of these live food may not be endemic to our 
              native environment. Releasing animals into a different environment which
               they are not accustomed to causes great impact to the existing ecology,
               or to even the animals themselves. If the animal is farm bred, they 
              normally don't survive well in the wild. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Even if the live animal is native to our areas, 
              and releasing them would not be detrimental to the environment, we 
              should also enquire: How were they caught? What sort of destructive acts
               were committed before they were caught? How are they treated by the 
              restaurants? How long have they been kept in the tank? But the time we 
              buy any of these animals, they have already gone through all these 
              various stages of sufferings.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">For every ONE we buy, probably 5 more died or 
              suffered, and another 2 or 3 more probably replaces it. If you buy one 
              fish from me, I won't get just another one to replace it, it will get at
               least one more, so that I can sell more. Therefore, it would be naïve 
              to think that its always a one for one replacement. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The moral argument here is not about being for or 
              against the releasing of animals, but in the economics behind the 
              action, that is, the act of exchanging of money in order to get them 
              released. Whenever we pay to buy something, it becomes an encouragement 
              for vendors to continue in their trade.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">This dilemma is constantly played out with animal 
              conservationalist in places like Africa. They constantly have to 
              struggle with their personal emotion of not buying a young primates 
              (e.g. gorilla, chimpanzee or gibbon) from the market place because once 
              they do that, it will encourage the sellers to catch more to sell them 
              back to the conservationalists. And to catch these young primates, 
              usually it means that its parents have to be killed in order to pry them
               off from their arms. So effectively, they are not releasing one animal 
              by buying them off the streets, but killing 2 or more animals because of
               it.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Closer to home, true animal lovers do not buy pets
               from pet shops, they adopt them from the animal shelters. I have a 
              friend's cousin who loves dogs and have taken in a lot of stray dogs to 
              feed and shelter them. His daughter thought that since he loved dogs so 
              much, the best birthday present was to buy a cute puppy for him. Not 
              only was he unhappy, but he was very upset by this move. True animal 
              lovers knows the sufferings of these pets have gone through, and will 
              never agree to buy one from a shop, no matter how cute they are. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">What about those whose livelihood depends on such 
              sales? Well, life is certainly not easy for anyone caught in such a 
              moral dilemma. It is even harder for a wise and compassionate Buddhists.
               This is something for all concerned to ponder in depth, for there is no
               quick solution.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Being aware of the consequences of our own actions
               and choosing the right path perhaps, may be a good way to start. Like a
               famous NGO campaign says, only with the buying stops, the suffering and
               the killing will stop too.</span></p>

              <p>ONE case out of many does not necessary make it a norm. Your example might have been one of the few "success" stories. From a scientific or statistical point of view certainly does not constitute "sucess".</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I would ask you to not be defensive as I have nothing against showing compassion to animals</span> but what dragg stated is correct. Compassion without wisdom is foolish. How well do you know of ecology or even biology?</p>
              <p>There are people who release animals without thinking or understanding the consequences of their actions. Have you seen people releasing goldfish into the sea? Or rabbits into the forest? Do you honestly think they will survive?</p>
              <p>Contrary to popular belief, Singapore does have a native ecology but it's already under stress from all the development. Releasing exotic species further adds to the stress and may end up changing the whole ecology all together. People like to release big fish like arowanas into reservoirs. However these are not native inhabitants of the ecology and are voracious carnivorous fishes that can literally decimate all the small fishes within the reservoirs. Some of these "aliens" end up becoming the dominant (but unwanted) animals eventually. An example is the cane toad nuinsance in Australia.</p>
              <p>Another example is people buying cage-reared fish, bound for dinner plates, for release. I agree that there is no harm as long as the fishes are native to the area but from the biological POV, would these fishes who have been reared in cages throughout their lives know how to look for food or recognise predators? Majority end up on the lines of happy fishermen so defeats your purpose anyway.</p>
              <p>Having criticised the Nature Society for coming up with the pamphlet  without substantiating the facts shows that you do not really understand both the ecology or biology. Even if you do not have access to scientific journals, there are quite a few articles in National Geographic and similar magazines that write about threat of alien species on native ecology and I recall there are some articles about animal trade as well. Some things are also substanciated by using common sense.</p>
              <p>It is a noble cause to show compassion to animals but to a neutral like myself, I think there are better ways than to unknowingly "supporting" such animal trades that is, I think that you will agree, inhumane. </p>

              <p>and using ecology to defeat the purpose of animal release, should you not think that without these released fishes inside our reservoir, our water may be more dirty from sucide bodies that were not discovered ?  Yes, i believe there are more than 6 bodies in Bedok and many more not reported from other reservoirs.</p>

              <p>Once again, you go all defensive by asking for proof, not unlike Christians when challenged on the existence of God. However, I do agree to a certain extent that practising compassion with wisdom as stated by yourself is the preferred way. I can explain why "to a certain extent" but I doubt the parachute is open enough to accept it.</p>
              <p>Studies of ecological upsets are well documented. Famous examples that you do not need to search in scientific journals are the extinction of the dodos due to not just indiscriminate hunting by humans but also the introduction of rats that decimated their nests. Or how about the spread of the Black Death by plague rats? How about the introduction of foxes into Australia that led to a decline in the number of native species?</p>
              <p>And the message by the Nature Society is not entirely independent. It is a joint program that involves NParks and NEA. This message is not unique to Singapore as well. Ever wonder why Australia restricts the import of animals so stringently?</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/invasive/ferals/index.html">http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/invasive/ferals/index.html</a></p>
              <p>The threat is real and not some hocus-pocus conjured to scare mindless simpletons. It has been backed by many scientific studies.</p>
              <p>I have to at this point stress once again that I am NOT attacking the practice of releasing animals for religious or compassionate purposes, I would rather that you understand the potential consequences of what you percieve as "harmless" and "beneficial". It is also not wise to jump out with the parachute closed. As for the "lack of fishermen" in Singapore, you'll have to go out more frequently instead of sitting in front of the computer.</p>

              <p>hello why do you assume i am being defensive ? you are posting your theories of animal release in the wrong place here.  I am talking about animal release from my religious point of view but instead of listening, you keep on harping on your views and then assume i am being defensive.</p>
              <p>I do not need to defend my own personal experiences which i am sharing here. I witness for myself how the animals i release can survive well in the wilds.</p>
              <p>I can tell the other side of the story , my side of the story. Why must only listen to your side when you don't even know how to differentiate between religious animal release and irresponsible pets owners dumping their pets?</p>
              <p>If you can't support your theories with photos or facts, then you are being defensive yourself. Just one simple question, where you find fishermen in Singapore waiting to catch the released fishes and you can't even answer that.</p>
              <p>You people up there who has zero idea what is animal release, stop sitting in front of  your computer  and at least for once take part in one proper Buddhist animal release ceremony to find out more before you open your mouth to critize.</p>
              <p>Buddhists do not release pets ! Buddhists pay for the animals from wet markets (waiting to be killed for food ).  Nature society should aim more at the irresponsible pet owners.</p>

              <p>hello why do you assume i am being defensive ? you are posting your theories of animal release in the wrong place here.  I am talking about animal release from my religious point of view but instead of listening, you keep on harping on your views and then assume i am being defensive.</p>
              <p>I do not need to defend my own personal experiences which i am sharing here. I witness for myself how the animals i release can survive well in the wilds.</p>
              <p>I can tell the other side of the story , my side of the story. Why must only listen to your side when you don't even know how to differentiate between religious animal release and irresponsible pets owners dumping their pets?</p>
              <p>If you can't support your theories with photos or facts, then you are being defensive yourself. Just one simple question, where you find fishermen in Singapore waiting to catch the released fishes and you can't even answer that.</p>
              <p>You people up there who has zero idea what is animal release, stop sitting in front of  your computer  and at least for once take part in one proper Buddhist animal release ceremony to find out more before you open your mouth to critize.</p>
              <p>Buddhists do not release pets ! Buddhists pay for the animals from wet markets (waiting to be killed for food ).  Nature society should aim more at the irresponsible pet owners.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>If you still think all these are theories, I suggest you read up more on the topic. I stress once again, I AM NOT CRITCISING THE PRACTICE, in Caps because this point seem to elude you.</p>
              <p>As for the fishermen, pay a visit to the areas near fish farms where people pay to release fish. So I've answered that. You going to then ask me for photos to back it up now?</p>
              <p>If you like a closed parachute, I have no problems with that.</p>

              <p>As for the fishermen, yes, show me the photos.  I have been to so many kelong in Singapore releasing fishes and i never see any fishermen waiting nearby to catch them.</p>
              <p>So who is lying here ? Definitely YOU mister.  If you like a closed parachute, open your mind and go and experience what is animal release at least once . Stop sitting in front of your computer and lied through your teeths.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: large;">The frog expressed its gratitude for the freedom as mentioned  - All that lives will press palms together in prayerful adoration of those who refuse to slaughter and savor meat. <em>Tirukural 260</em> </span></strong>
              </p><p><strong><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: large;">Why Hindus Don't Eat Meat</span></strong></p>
              <p>Besides being an expression of compassion for animals, vegetarianism is followed for ecological and health rationales</p>
              <p><strong>Reasons</strong></p>
              <p>In the past fifty years, millions of meat-eaters -- Hindus and non-Hindus -- have made the personal decision to stop eating the flesh of other creatures. There are five major motivations for such a decision:</p>
              <p>1. The Dharmic Law Reason<br>Ahinsa, the law of noninjury, is the Hindu's first duty in fulfilling religious obligations to God and God's creation as defined by Vedic scripture.</p>
              <p>2. The Karmic Consequences Reason<br>All of our actions, including our choice of food, have Karmic consequences. By involving oneself in the cycle of inflicting injury, pain and death, even indirectly by eating other creatures, one must in the future experience in equal measure the suffering caused.</p>
              <p>3. The Spiritual Reason<br>Food is the source of the body's chemistry, and what we ingest affects our consciousnes, emotions and experiential patterns. If one wants to live in higher consciousness, in peace and happiness and love for all creatures, then he cannot eat meat, fish, shellfish, fowl or eggs. By ingesting the grosser chemistries of animal foods, one introduces into the body and mind anger, jealousy, anxiety, suspicion and a terrible fear of death, all of which are locked into the the flesh of the butchered creatures. For these reasons, vegetarians live in higher consciousness and meat-eaters abide in lower consciousness.</p>
              <p>4. The Health Reason<br>Medical studies prove that a vegetarian diet is easier to digest, provides a wider ranger of nutrients and imposes fewer burdens and impurities on the body. Vegetarians are less susceptible to all the major diseases that afflict contemporary humanity, and thus live longer, healthier, more productive lives. They have fewer physical complaints, less frequent visits to the doctor, fewer dental problems and smaller medical bills. Their immune system is stronger, their bodies are purer, more refined and skin more beautiful.</p>
              <p>5. The Ecological Reason<br>Planet Earth is suffereing. In large measure, the escalating loss of species, destruction of ancient rainforests to create pasture lands for live stock, loss of topsoils and the consequent increase of water impurities and air pollution have all been traced to the single fact of meat in the human diet. No decision that we can make as individuals or as a race can have such a dramatic effect on the improvement of our planetary ecology as the decision not to eat meat.</p>
              <p><strong>History</strong></p>
              <p>The book <em>Food for the Spirit, Vegetarianism and the World Religions</em>, observes, "Despite popular knowledge of meat-eating's adverse effects, the nonvegetarian diet became increasingly widespread among the Hindus after the two major invasions by foreign powers, first the Muslims and later the British. With them came the desire to be `civilized,' to eat as did the Saheeb. Those atually trained in Vedic knowledge, however, never adopted a meat-oriented diet, and the pious Hindu still observes vegetarian principles as a matter of religious duty.</p>
              <p>"That vegetarianism has always been widespread in India is clear from the earliest Vedic texts. This was observed by the ancient traveler Megasthenes and also by Fa-Hsien, a Chinese Buddhist monk who, in the fifth century, traveled to India in order to obtain authentic copies of the scriptures.</p>
              <p>"These scriptures unambiguously support the meatless way of life. In the <em>Mahabharat</em>, for instance, the great warrior Bheeshm explains to Yuddhishtira, eldest of the Paandav princes, that the meat of animals is like the flesh of one's own son. Similarly, the <em>Manusmriti</em> declares that one should `refrain from eating all kinds of meat,' for such eating involves killing and and leads to Karmic bondage (Bandh) [5.49]. Elsewhere in the Vedic literature, the last of the great Vedic kings, Maharaja Parikshit, is quoted as saying that `only the animal-killer cannot relish the message of the Absolute Truth [Shrimad Bhagvatam 10.1.4].'"</p>
              <p><strong>Scripture</strong></p>
              <p>He who desires to augment his own flesh by eating the flesh of other creatures lives in misery in whatever species he may take his birth. <em>Mahabharat 115.47</em></p>
              <p>Those high-souled persons who desire beauty, faultlessness of limbs, long life, understanding, mental and physical strength and memory should abstain from acts of injury. <em>Mahabharat 18.115.8</em></p>
              <p>The very name of cow is Aghnya ["not to be killed"], indicating that they should never be slaughtered. Who, then could slay them? Surely, one who kills a cow or a bull commits a heinous crime. <em>Mahabharat, Shantiparv 262.47</em></p>
              <p>The purchaser of flesh performs Hinsa (violence) by his wealth; he who eats flesh does so by enjoying its taste; the killer does Hinsa by actually tying and killing the animal. Thus, there are three forms of killing: he who brings flesh or sends for it, he who cuts off the limbs of an animal, and he who purchases, sells or cooks flesh and eats it -- all of these are to be considered meat-eaters. <em>Mahabharat, Anu 115.40</em></p>
              <p>He who sees that the Lord of all is ever the same in all that is -- immortal in the field of mortality -- he sees the truth. And when a man sees that the God in himself is the same God in all that is, he hurts not himself by hurting others. Then he goes, indeed, to the highest path. <em>Bhagvad Geeta 13.27-28</em></p>
              <p>Ahinsa is the highest Dharm. Ahinsa is the best Tapas. Ahinsa is the greatest gift. Ahinsa is the highest self-control. Ahinsa is the highest sacrifice. Ahinsa is the highest power. Ahinsa is the highest friend. Ahinsa is the highest truth. Ahinsa is the highest teaching. <em>Mahabharat 18.116.37-41</em></p>
              <p>What is the good way? It is the path that reflects on how it may avoid killing any creature. <em>Tirukural 324</em></p>
              <p>All that lives will press palms together in prayerful adoration of those who refuse to slaughter and savor meat. <em>Tirukural 260</em></p>
              <p>What is virtuous conduct? It is never destroting life, for killing leads to every other sin. <em>Tirukural 312, 321</em></p>
              <p>Goodness is never one with the minds of these two: one who wields a weapon and one who feasts on a creature's flesh. <em>Tirukural 253</em></p>
