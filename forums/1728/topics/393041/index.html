              <p>right now i havent got any big ,'oceanic sense of oneness',or 'interconnected experiences with everything'.</p>

              <p>do i have to induce this in order to progress?</p>
              <p>i sense there are now appropriate conditions for me to enter such 'oneness' ,but concern if it will be a detour rather than a unavoidable passage.</p>

              <p>i think the question can be more accurately put : do i have to expand this sense of beingness,by keep detaching/ignore from what's "not me"?</p>
              <p>what has this to do with the insight into no-self?</p>
              <p>this 'i am',sense of existence,is always here,no big deal,it seems.</p>
              <p>but what im interested now is the insight/wisdom into the reality that has been taught through the ages,the truth of  "no-self" or "there is no boundary of subject- object.'</p>

              <p>When you stand as the I AM or Witness, you see clearly that objects are happening impersonally and the Witness have no stake in whatever happens, it just perceives.</p>
              <p>If there is identification, and you become aware as the witnessing of the identification, that alone breaks that conceptual identification.</p>
              <p>When you witness a thought "this is occuring to me", you see that the thought is simply a thought, an interpretation, but you are not the thought or interpretation, you are the witnessing, whether it is the thought "this is occuring to me", "this is occuring to him", "this is not occuring", "this is occuring", whatever. They are conceptual thoughts, like clouds floating by, appearing and disappearing in the vast sky of witnessing. What is undeniable is unconceptual being and awareness. Not being aware of the non-conceptual truth, we become lost in contents and concepts and take them to be absolutely true. In fact they are simply conceptual perspectives, not Truth.</p>
              <p>Just keep inquiring. Who is aware of the thought? Who am I?</p>

              <p>Hope this is useful, by Leo Hartong (I liked his e-book 'Awakening to the Dream' a lot):</p>
              <p>18<br>Blinded by the light</p>
              <p>There is a story about a soldier who was sentenced to death.<br>On the day of his execution, he is transported in an open<br>cart to the gallows. As he takes in his surroundings for<br>what he believes to be the last time, a great stillness descends<br>upon him. The world appears in a clear and transparent<br>vision of unity and harmony. His fear of dying is<br>replaced with a deep sense of peace in which he and all of<br>creation are one in a mystical union with God. At the very<br>last moment, the king pardons the soldier. He regains his<br>freedom and life, but loses the vision of paradise. The rest<br>of his life is a hopeless quest to regain that vision. He takes<br>to heavy drinking and dies years later as a lonely alcoholic.</p>
              <p>For me the experience came when I was twenty-one.<br>For several reasons, I felt at the end of my rope, and as it<br>slipped through my fingers, my overwhelming sense of<br>desperation suddenly lifted. I’ve got a Feeling from the<br>Beatles’ album Let It Be was playing on the stereo, and it<br>touched something deep inside of me. A large space<br>opened up. It would be as true to say that I expanded to<br>encompass the whole of existence as it would be to say<br>that I had totally disappeared. Eternity, which I had understood<br>as time without end, appeared as the absence of<br>time. Everything was infused with life, including what, up<br>until that moment, I had considered inanimate. All exist-</p>
              <p>ence shared a common source and the first day of creation<br>and the final day of destruction were seen as equally<br>present. The Universe was neither big nor small. It revealed<br>itself as simply One beyond all relative attributes,<br>such as size, location, and time. While on the relative level,<br>everything’s purpose was shown to serve everything else<br>in an intricate mosaic of perfect harmony, the totality of<br>creation showed itself beyond purpose. I saw that it simply<br>is as it is: Its own cause and fulfillment.</p>
              <p>Things that really mattered before did not matter any<br>longer. The people I saw from my window all seemed to<br>be ‘in the know’ while pretending not to know who they<br>really were. As the experience was slowing down, I remember<br>thinking: How can I go on with my day-to-day life,<br>pretending to be this limited character? How can I go to work<br>and face the daily routine again? As it turned out, I was perfectly<br>able to continue my life as before – but I was left<br>with a certainty that, even when I do not see it, all is as it<br>should be.</p>
              <p>What the soldier’s and my personal story have in<br>common is that they show a vision of the eternal recounted<br>as an experience with a beginning and an end. It has been<br>called a mystical, transcendental or peak experience, and<br>that is exactly what it is – an experience.</p>
              <p><br>The content of such experiences seems to vary from<br>person to person, depending on one’s personality and<br>socio-cultural background; but in essence, all peak experiences<br>are similar in that they all recount a unity of<br>man and God (or whatever name you’re comfortable<br>with), and they all transcend space and time. It is the<br>sort of experience that people who want enlightenment<br>are looking for; and many have confused it with enlightenment,<br>as did I. What is generally overlooked, however,<br>is the silent background in which both the experience<br>and the ‘I’ that remembers and interprets it occur.</p>
              <p>To this mirror-like Awareness, such an experience is simply<br>another cloud drifting by.</p>
              <p><br>Over the years, that experience has been a source of<br>both comfort and confusion to me. There was a clear<br>memory of a vision of universal oneness, even though it<br>was not always felt. My initial interpretation of the experience<br>was that if all is One, then everybody and everything<br>is part of this oneness. Later, I realized that this was a<br>linguistic trap – that if all is truly One, there are no parts<br>and there can be no you and me to be part of it. I saw that<br>the ‘I’ of this body/mind is the same ‘I’ living in and as<br>everybody else. Perhaps an apt analogy would be to say<br>we are all the same Self dressed in a variety of costumes.</p>
              <p><br>At the same time, there persisted this contradictory<br>sense of being an individual entity responsible for my actions.<br>Before I came to a simple and clear ‘This is it, I am<br>it, and that is that,’ this concept of being ‘part of it’ made<br>me work on myself to be a better part. In the Hsin Hsin<br>Ming, by Sengtan, the third Zen Patriarch, this working<br>on the mind with the mind to make the ‘good’ victorious<br>over the ‘bad’ is described, as follows:</p>
              <p><em><br>If you want to get the plain truth,<br>Be not concerned with right and wrong.<br>The conflict between right and wrong<br>Is the sickness of the mind.*</em></p>
              <p><br>There was a continued interest in matters considered spiritual,<br>as well as an interest in the parallels between the<br>mystical experience and subjects like the new physics, the<br>Gaia theory, and the ideas of an imminent evolutionary<br>leap for humankind.</p>
              <p><br>More recently, a renewed attraction to the non-dual<br>teachings of Advaita, Taoism, and Zen emerged. It was</p>
              <p>like a revival of sorts, and I reread books like the Tao Te<br>Ching, the Ashtavakra Gita, and the Way of Zen, as well as<br>new books from Tony Parsons, Ramesh Balsekar, Nathan<br>Gill, and many others. The same old words seemed to speak<br>to me in a fresh and clear manner. It was like the missing<br>pieces of a puzzle fell into place, and at the same time, it<br>clearly showed that nothing could ever be out of place.</p>
              <p><br>I met Wayne Liquorman during a seminar with his<br>teacher Ramesh Balsekar. I told him that I was attending<br>to experience the presence of people like him and<br>Ramesh and that there were no questions I could ask, as<br>I had a complete intellectual understanding of the material<br>that was discussed. He answered, ‘Yes but you still<br>say I understand.’ I did not respond much to this as I<br>took it to be semantics; but somehow it stayed with me.<br>It kept coming back to my mind, percolated down into<br>my heart, and finally said, ‘Actually there is no ‘I’ that<br>understands it. There is simply understanding.’</p>
              <p><br>Presently ‘I’ remains as ‘my address in life,’ as well as a<br>grammatical convention and convenience, which I will not<br>hesitate to use. There is, however, no objective ‘me’ that<br>can be identified or taken hold of. It is clear that my earlier<br>mystical experience was not enlightenment. The idea<br>of an ‘I’ having this experience created the confusing paradox<br>of an ‘I’ having a non-dual experience. Now, it is obvious<br>that the so-called mystical experience is as much an<br>experience as having a glass of wine, making love, doing<br>the shopping, or taking a walk in the rain. It is all just<br>happening as me – not to or by me. The silent background<br>in which experience appears and disappears had escaped<br>the attention of the ‘me’ that thought he ‘got it.’</p>
              <p>Don’t get me wrong: It is not that I didn’t quite get it<br>before and now I do. It is now clear that there is no ‘I’ to<br>get it. The whole concept of someone getting enlightened<br>has lost its validity. Enlightenment appears as a goal that</p>
              <p>one can reach only as long as there is the illusion of a<br>separate entity or ego. In Zen, it has been called the gateless<br>gate. When one stands before it, the gate seems to be there.<br>When one passes through and looks back, it’s clear there<br>never was a gate, nor anyone to go through it.</p>
              <p><br>The mystical experiences described above – both the<br>condemned soldier’s and mine – however attractive they<br>may sound, were in the end a ‘blinding by the light.’ There<br>is no need to have such experiences for understanding to<br>happen. True understanding will level the artificial<br>boundaries between the mystical and the mundane, the<br>extraordinary and the ordinary, the experience and the<br>one who experiences. It will reveal the splendor and the<br>simplicity, along with the freedom – even from the need<br>to be free – that lies beyond this apparent duality.</p>
              <p><br>There is a freedom -<br>even from the need to be free<br>even from the need to try to be spiritual.<br>This is beyond the duality of awake and asleep,<br>enlightened, and unenlightened.<br>This is relaxation into the suchness of things<br>just the way things are.*</p>
              <p><br>This text points to absolute instead of relative and conditional<br>freedom. Absolute freedom’s inherent nature is such<br>that there cannot be any conditions that have to be met<br>before this freedom can be realized. There is no need for<br>a special experience to set you free. When you wait for<br>such an event, you feed the erroneous belief that there<br>really is a ‘you’ in need of liberation. Such an anticipated<br>event may be a transcendental experience; but even when<br>you do get such an experience, it can become a trap instead<br>of a liberation. The one having such an experience</p>
              <p>may be overwhelmed and conclude that this should become<br>a permanent state.</p>
              <p><br>There is a book by Suzanne Segal called Collision with<br>the Infinite. It tells the story of a woman who got shocked<br>by the sudden realization that there is no personal self.<br>She was not a seeker and had no interest in things like<br>yoga, Zen, and advaita. She thought she was losing her<br>mind and sought help from psychiatrists and psychologists;<br>but they were unable to help her. At some point, she<br>came in contact with the non-dual perspective; and from<br>that point on, her situation started to improve – so much<br>so that she started to hold meetings and began to help<br>people on their spiritual path.</p>
              <p><br>By the end of the book, she gets sick and dies. In the<br>afterword her friend Stephan Bodian writes:</p>
              <p><em><br>‘Yet toward the end of her life, we could only watch as the<br>realization slipped between her fingers like so much sand, leaving<br>her frustrated and confused.’ *</em></p>
              <p><br>Suzanne Segal was a unique case, and her situation involved<br>a brain tumor; but in general, when ‘the experience’<br>– like all experience – turns out to be impermanent,<br>one might mistakenly consider this as a personal failing.<br>Like the condemned soldier, one may end up chasing the<br>experience, which is missing the point completely, much<br>as one of the actors in the following story does:</p>
              <p><em><br>Imagine watching a movie in which two men walk toward<br>you. The setting is a desert. The sun is blazing overhead, and<br>a huge mountain range is visible in the distance.<br>One of the men stops and says to his companion, ‘Do you realize<br>that this is all an illusion and we are just variations in one</em></p>
              <p><em>single light appearing as us, the sun, the sky, and the whole<br>landscape?’ His friend looks puzzled as he continues. ‘ This<br>whole world we see is a flat screen, though it appears as if there<br>is space all around us.’<br>Now his friend gets slightly worried. He thinks perhaps his<br>buddy has been affected by the heat, so he asks, ‘Are you feeling<br>all right?’<br>‘Absolutely fine! It is just suddenly obvious that all this is really<br>nothing but a very clever illusion appearing on a single<br>background.’<br>‘Really,’ says his friend getting slightly annoyed. ‘Please show<br>me this background.’<br>‘Well look, here it is; right here touching us, carrying us.

              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 100%;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: georgia;">Suzanne wrote:</span><br><br><br><span style="font-family: georgia;">My mind is spinning with confusion over 
              one of your pointers. You have said that we are unchanging awareness. 
              This is understood, and that appearances are inseparable from this 
              awareness. Then you say appearances ARE that same awareness. If thoughts
               ARE that awareness, how is it's identity withdrawn from them; how are 
              they seen to not hold truth...</span><br><span style="font-family: georgia;">Where do thoughts arise from? A confused mind or purposeful 
              intelligence?</span><br><span style="font-family: georgia;">I've read 
              about two-thirds of the LR text, but my mind is caught on this point? 
              Also I wonder, where does personal will come from (seems like a strong 
              energy of opposition) if there is no 'personal'? Any clarity you can 
              offer that will break through this morass of mind, would be greatly 
              appreciated.</span><br><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: georgia;">Scott wrote:</span><br><br><br><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: georgia;">Let's put the questions as to where 
              thoughts come from and where personal will comes from aside for a 
              moment. </span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: georgia;">Let's focus on the pointer that is giving you trouble. It may 
              be helpful to look from a background awareness within you at first. Just
               look from the place that sees a thought appear. This "place" notices 
              the thought but it is NOT the thought. In noticing it, you have the 
              first opportunity to just rest as awareness, and watch the thought pass 
              on by. You aren't moving to add another thought to it. You aren't trying
               to understand where it came from or what "personal will" means. It is 
              just noticed. Seeing yourself as a witnessing, background awareness can 
              be helpful at first to "get some distance" from what is appearing.  
              There really is no "distance."  That is just a pointer describing the 
              sense of being able to witness thoughts come and go within awareness.  
              This is how disidentification can happen. Each thought arises, but it 
              isn't me.  I am this awareness that sees that thought.  If there is 
              something appearing, you are that which sees the appearance, not the 
              appearance.  When what you thought was you--a thought--starts to be seen
               as something appearing within what you really are--awareness, that is 
              the beginning of real freedom and clarity.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: georgia;">You see that what is 
              appearing is appearing within the awareness that sees it. Anything that 
              you see as an appearance (including thoughts or emotions) can't be the 
              witnessing awareness itself. The awareness is what sees. It can also be 
              helpful, at first, to simply rest as often as possible as non-conceptual
               awareness. This means to drop your conceptual labels about a person, 
              event, or situation, and simply be in that situation without labels 
              about it. If a label arises, notice it. See that what you are is this 
              witnessing awareness, and it remains untouched by what comes and goes. </span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: georgia;">As you become more 
              aware that you are this witnessing awareness, identification starts to 
              fall away. Things come and they go and they seem to have less pull, less
               of a charge. As you begin to feel more comfortable that you are this 
              awareness, then the "inseparability" pointers can be handy. The 
              inseparability pointers are those pointers in the text that say, "see 
              that appearances are inseparable from awareness." We don't want to move 
              too quickly into this pointer. Again, at first, it may be more helpful 
              (if there is a lot of emphasizing storylines, thoughts, and emotions) to
               see oneself as witnessing awareness and notice these stories, thoughts,
               and emotions, as they come and go. It is only when we start to get a 
              real sense that we are this awareness that the inseparability pointers 
              become helpful. </span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: georgia;">To notice inseparability, see that, when a thought arises, it 
              bleeds seamlessly out of awareness. A thought never appears outside of 
              awareness. It is a movement of awareness. It is not a movement of EGO. 
              Ego is a name for thoughts about a self. Thoughts about a self are what 
              come and go within awareness. Awareness starts to see that thought is 
              transparent. It has no solid substance. It is a lot like an empty image 
              appearing on a movie screen. In recognizing that there really is no line
               between awareness and the thought appearing in awareness, you see that 
              all thoughts are INSEPARABLE from awareness. </span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: georgia;">The text is full of 
              pointers on inseparability. I would also suggest you take a look at a 
              video I just uploaded on youtube called "Different pointers for 
              different folks." This talks about the difference between establishing 
              the witnessing awareness AND seeing that appearances are inseparable 
              from this witnessing awareness. </span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: georgia;">My main suggestion is not to look at the 
              questions "where do these things come from." Instead, stick to these 
              pointers. The source is always awareness. This is where all thoughts 
              come from. Once you see that a thought is not separate from awareness, 
              it begins to dawn on you that thought is none other than awareness. You 
              start to see it's all awareness. Nothing appears or can appear outside 
              of awareness. </span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: georgia;">The second suggestion for you, as with anyone who feels 
              inclined to do so, set up a time to talk with me. Phone or skype. I can 
              be contacted initially via email; scottkiloby@aol </span></span></p>

              <p>Hi Seeker,</p>
              <p>IMO, there is 'no should' or 'should not'. All already is.</p>
              <p>For practice, learn to be aware of the mental and bodily sensation at moments as best as possible. It should not be a grasping type of attention, just a relax light noting.</p>
              <p>Oneness has various degrees and depths. To me, it is induced by letting go.</p>
              <p>Again, there are various degrees of letting go and release. IMO, the map is describing this various degrees of release. The thing is that, we cannot let go of anything that we are not consciously aware of. For example, one cannot let go of the dualistic grasping, if he or she is not aware that reality is non-dual.</p>
              <p>Samsara has veils covering that are not made aware of until they(the veils) are discovered. This veils are firstly covering  the non-dual nature of no-subject-object division. When the first veil is 'lifted', we discover the non-dual nature. Secondly, another veil is covering the 'emptiness' nature. When the second veil is lifted, we discover the emptiness nature.</p>
              <p>Even when these veils are discovered, for practitoner, it is still an on-going process of integrating this natures into the daily life.</p>
              <p>So, please be very very patient. For example, i have been practicing for decades, I do not consider my practices complete, but as of now there are very obvious benefits resulting from following the path. :)</p>

              <p>firstly,i would like to thanks everyone who responded to my ' im confused!' post with advices and encouragements,i feel your kindness,really do :-)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>long chen : the uncovering of veils ,i think,can best be understood analogically  as the process of peeling an onion,layer by layer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and it allcomes down to our inability to have realization immediately,and at the same time observing the ppls around us having the same condition.but as im attempting to do just the opposite,i cant let myself subscribe to this point of view.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>no matter how immature and naive this may sound,i really attempt to awaken quickly, "in a single sitting".as the actor in the movie iron man says(when testing the new suit), "sometimes u just have to fly b4 learning how to walk" .(i can hear some of u thinking - just dont land flat on ur face :-) ) </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>there's dharma dan's " u can get it quickly if u just stop f****** around " attitude .and franklin merrel-wollf once(perhaps more than once) attempted an 'induction',an attempt to 'cause' awakening in his listeners(something i read sometime ago),a 'dharma transmission'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the stages of awakening can be understood as gradual attainment uinfolded over time,perhaps involving many lifetimes.but it can also be understood as the very instant occurance,right now.(just as paticasamuppada can be understood as involving 3 lifetimes,or the very conditions in this present moment)in other words, " reality is staring u right at ur face,see it! "  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>there's another model of spiritual stages im learning currently,and it describes the last stage prior to gnosis(enlightenment) as kenosis(death of subject and object,or as merrel-wolff says ;consciousness without subject and consciousness without an object - this seems to correlate to thusness's stage 5 &amp; 6) .kenosis can be experienced,according to this teacher,by many as a very painful 'dark night of the soul',but some actually go through it in contenment.(wonder what's thusness's experience).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and as i understood,one can go through the stages quickly into the 'first distinction',as he describes it,the subtlest distinction between subject-object,and if 'lucky'enough,"grace takes over" and awakening occurs.what one needs to do is to keep remaining here,then the chances of recognition(of dharma)are very high.</p>

              <p>Full awakening in one sitting is impossible. An initial awakening or glimpse of one's nature can come faster, but is also extremely unlikely within one sitting. Most importantly one must have <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>no expectations of anything whatsover</strong></span> when meditating.</p>
              <p>When we meditate we set our interest on Truth. Ideas of 'gaining enlightenment' or 'me getting/going to get enlightened' are purely conceptual, in fact you can try to find if there is a separate self entity that truly exists that can 'gain enlightenment'. It only appears as an idea, a presently arising (and subsiding) thought, it does not truly exist. It is important we do not easily believe in our thoughts to be true, but to gently let them go by seeing them as fictitious notions which are a product of our imagination. If we find ourselves lost in such thinking, just observe and gently let it dissolve in clear seeing.</p>
              <p>The Buddha-Mind that exists right now, is the same Buddha-Mind when one 'wakes up', is the same Buddha-Mind of a practitioner that has undergone eons of practice, because there is only ever This. The notion of time and future attainment does not apply to This, when there always is just This. We can 'wake up' from the dream of our illusions, and in fact there is even a gradual deepening of this 'waking up' (which doesn't mean there is an 'I' becoming more enlightened, but rather deeper layers of illusions are being seen through and dropped), but there is no 'time-bound separate me waking up' and such concepts are precisely what we wake up from. If these concepts are seen and dropped, the sense of separation (such as the notion that I am still not yet 'there' and need to get 'there', where there really is only This) and suffering is also dropped.</p>
              <p>Those who 'woke up' will not see their 'waking up' as a kind of one time event.</p>
              <p>As Thusness posted before,</p>
              <p><strong><br> ...As what Joan Tollifson once asked Toni “if

                                                  those big awakenings where life turns inside out

                                                  identification with the body-mind ceases.<br> <br> Toni replied, "I can't say I had it," she 
                          replied. "It's this
                                                  moment, right now." ...</strong></p>

              <p><em>there's dharma dan's " u can get it quickly

              <p> </p>
              <p>Dharma Dan himself practiced for many many years before full enlightenment. I think around 20 years from his first crossing of A&amp;P. 'Quickly' is subjective.</p>
              <p>The notion of enlightenment being gradual is true from one perspective, but if it is attached with the notion of a separate time bound self going to get something or somewhere, it does more harm. Once you become attached to an expectation, you are believing in the notion of a 'separate time-bound me going to become enlightened' which itself is a 'subject and object' dualistic relationship. It is important to question and drop all the beliefs so that you are left with only non conceptual naked absolute truth.</p>

              <p>Awakening is definitely possible within this lifetime, and many traditions including the most original form of Buddhism - Theravada Buddhism - do accept it's possibility.</p>
              <p>In fact I can hardly think of any Buddhist tradition that says enlightenment is impossible within one lifetime. Buddhahood is however, another issue, and even Dharma Dan himself admitted he did not attain Buddhahood.</p>

              <p>There's a passage from The Supreme Source that I like very much:</p>
              <p><strong>"The desire for happiness is the disease of attachment; one can be happy only when free of desires. Realization is not achieved by striving for it; it arises spontaneously when one abides in the natural state without seeking anything. So remain in the natural state without seeking, without concepts! Even though the name "enlightenment" is used for the real nature, this does not mean that "enlightenment" concretely exists. If someone believes the opposite, [let them go ahead and try to find] enlightenment: apart from the dimension of fundamental reality, they will find nothing at all. So, instead of aiming for enlightenment, one has to understand the nature of one's mind beyond action. On examining one's mind, one finds nothing, yet at the same time there is clarity that is ever present. It does not manifest concretely, yet its essence is all pervading: this is the way its nature presents itself."</strong></p>
