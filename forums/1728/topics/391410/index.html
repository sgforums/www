              <p><em>...I recognize I have brought this on myself. And I know above 
                  all I am the one who needs to change. I owe it to my family to become a 
                  better person. I owe it to those closest to me to become a better man. 
                  That is where my focus will be. I have a lot of work to do. And I intend
                   to dedicate myself to doing it.</em></p>
              <p><em>Part of following this path for 
                  me is Buddhism, which my mother taught me at a young age. People 
                  probably don't realize it, but I was raised a Buddhist, and I actively 
                  practiced my faith from childhood until I drifted away from it in recent
                   years. Buddhism teaches that a craving for things outside ourselves 
                  causes an unhappy and pointless search for security. It teaches me to 
                  stop following every impulse and to learn restraint. Obviously, I lost 
                  track of what I was taught</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>As I move forward, I will continue to receive help because I 
              have learned that is how people really do change. Starting tomorrow, I 
              will leave for more treatment and more therapy.</em></p>
              <p><em>I would like to 
              thank my friends at Accenture and the players in the field this week for
               understanding why I am making this -- these remarks today. In therapy, I
               have learned that looking at -- the importance of looking at my 
              spiritual life and keeping in balance with my professional life. I need 
              to regain my balance and be centered so I can save the things that are 
              most important to me: my marriage and my children.</em><em>....</em></p>

              <p><strong>(CNN)</strong> -- When Tiger Woods invoked his religious faith during 
              his public apology on Friday, he readily acknowledged that a lot of 
              people would be surprised.</p>
              <p>"People probably don't realize it," he
               said, "but I was raised a Buddhist, and I actively practiced my faith 
              from childhood until I drifted away from it in recent years."</p>
              <p>But
               Woods said his Buddhist faith would be a key part of his quest to put 
              his life back together after revelations of his marital infidelity, 
              which he admitted for the first time. Buddhist experts said Woods' 
              summation of the tradition's beliefs was accurate -- and that his 
              remarks likely will bring more attention to the faith in a week when its
               highest profile leader, the Dalai Lama,<strong> </strong>is visiting the United 
              States.</p>
              <p>"I have a lot of work to do, and I intend to dedicate 
              myself to doing it," Woods said, reading a statement from Ponte Vedra 
              Beach, Florida. "Part of following this path for me is Buddhism, which 
              my mother taught me at a young age."</p>
              <p>"Buddhism teaches that a 
              creation of things outside ourselves causes an unhappy and pointless 
              search for security," he continued. "It teaches me to stop following 
              every impulse and to learn restraint. Obviously, I lost track of what I 
              was taught."</p>
              <p>A handful of Buddhist scholars said Woods' 
              description of Buddhist teaching was spot on. "Woods was quite 
              accurate," said Janet Gyatso, a professor of Buddhist studies at Harvard
               University. "Craving causes unhappiness. That's a fundamental Buddhist 
              idea."</p>
              <p>A 1996 Sports Illustrated profile suggested that Woods -- 
              then in his early 20s -- took his faith seriously. He visited a Buddhist
               temple with his mother each year around his birthday, slept near a 
              mother-of-pearl <a class="cnnInlineTopic" href="http://topics.cnn.com/topics/buddhism">Buddha</a> from his Thai grandfather, and wore a 
              gold Buddha around his neck, according to the profile. Woods' mother, 
              Kultilda, is a Thai-born Buddhist.</p>
              <p>"I like Buddhism because it's a
               whole way of being and living," Tiger Woods told Sports Illustrated. 
              "It's based on discipline and respect and personal responsibility. I 
              like Asian culture better than ours because of that."</p>
              <p>When 
              allegations of <a class="cnnInlineTopic" href="http://topics.cnn.com/topics/tiger_woods">Woods'</a> infidelity began emerging after a 
              November 27 car accident, Fox News Channel host Brit Hume stirred 
              controversy by publicly advising the golf pro to become a Christian.</p>

              <p>"He's said to be a Buddhist -- I don't 
              think that faith offers the kind of forgiveness and redemption that is 
              offered by the Christian faith," Hume said. "So my message to Tiger 
              would be: Tiger, turn to the Christian faith and you can make a total 
              recovery and be a great example to the world."</p>
              <p>But Buddhist 
              scholars say that forgiveness and redemption are core components of the 
              faith. "You're always beginning again in the Buddhist tradition," said 
              John Kornfield, a prominent Buddhist teacher based in California. "You 
              see that you're causing harm, you repent and ask forgiveness in some 
              formal or informal way, and you start again."</p>
              <p>Some Buddhism 
              experts said that's what Woods appeared to be trying to do today. Many 
              Buddhists applauded Woods' statement. "The fact that people could see 
              this kind of behavior causes suffering is an incredibly important 
              message for all kinds of people who respect Woods," said Kornfield.</p>
              <p>Buddhism
               was in the spotlight this week before Woods' remarks, with the Tibetan
