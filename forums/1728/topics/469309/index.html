Prior to meeting you I have read some of your books and have been a TDE subscriber for years. I am a beginner actually. So what you shared is interesting and informative to me… I signed up for 48 vows without knowing anything about Amituofo except it is a ‘mantra’! I am glad I did! You are very good at conducting such lessons in an interesting and lively manner, with very good visual effects too. I really appreciate your time and effort put into your research, detailed interpretations and guidance. Attending your<em> ’48 Vows’</em> and<a style="color: #16387c;" href="http://tinyurl.com/praiseforclass">‘<em>Understanding Amituofo’</em></a> courses has further strengthened my faith. My husband and I are very encouraged to take on the practice more seriously. We are looking forward to more of your courses. As the year is drawing to a close, I thank you, not just for the recent lessons, but also for all these years, for what I have learnt from your books and publications. I also sincerely wish that you are always blessed to continue your great work in sharing the Dharma. <strong>- Jenny</strong></p>

The amount of research put into the numerous slides for the very interesting and mind-blowing knowledge-sharing sessions (and notes) is indeed commendable! We enjoyed the sessions and fellowship sessions and wish that everyone who attend them do too. We now believe that our aspiration to go to Pure Land has become stronger. We’ll definitely recommend people to attend the next run. Amituofo! <strong>Tio Siang &amp; Jacqueline</strong></p>

Always filled with many interesting and creative analogies or metaphors to let us have a better idea and understanding. The various creative media used and implementation of the element of humour brings the Dharma classes alive without boredom, very often allowing me to feel inspired and invigorated with renewed energy after the lessons. Really appreciate the amount of effort Teacher Shi’an put into preparing his classes. Hope that the work of Teacher Shi’an will continue and benefit more of us! <strong>- Ricky</strong></p>
