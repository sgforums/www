              <p>Yeah, you are right. Religion is not a commercial product. Only businessman will tell their customers how inferior their competitor's products are compare with his product inorder to promote his own product.</p>
              <p>Unlike business, the bottomline of religion is not $ and cents. It seems that many do not understand the difference of doing commercial business and religion.</p>
              <p>To those who defame Buddism and Taoism, I believe they also believe in hell. A note to take, don't be in a hurry to reserve a place in Hell for yourself.</p>

              <p>Hi, regarding this topic by TS. I use to have same thoughts like TS
              (to be truthful, sometimes i still do, on and off lah). But, don't know
              whether is it fate or what. These few days, where all these churches
              news and everything. I keep coming across certain videos. Randomly,
              they keep on appearing in my youtube recommended segment. So after
              seeing those video, I feel that maybe by sharing these, fellow
              disciples can see/take this situation in another perspective.</p>
              <p>I
              think, more or less, when people who don't understand Buddhism or
              Taosim ridicule or pass remarks that is unpleasant. Disciples or
              devotees of these schools of teachings will feel upset and offended.
              So, what do we do?</p>
              <p>This is some advice from some venerable, å‡€ç©ºæ³•å¸ˆ &amp; åœ£ä¸¥æ³•å¸ˆã€‚</p>
              <p>1)
              In this video, å‡€ç©ºæ³•å¸ˆ tell us about how he dealed with a christian
              evangelist when he was still a å±…å£« working in a Buddhist library.</p>
              <p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yazH6z4AWQo&amp;feature=related</p>
              <p>2)
              In this videos, å‡€ç©ºæ³•å¸ˆ tells us why people will pass unpleasant remarks
              and how we can deal with it. More or less, we should also reflect and
              learn about ourself.</p>
              <p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NpmUiC_mWk&amp;feature=related</p>
              <p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03jhEcy0zJ8&amp;feature=related</p>
              <p>3) This video is about putting down the Triple jewels and what would befall you and why it would happen. Also by å‡€ç©ºæ³•å¸ˆã€‚</p>
              <p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r03MUnWGqNY</p>
              <p>These videos
              above is something I find very useful in our learning, not only
              Buddhist, but also schools of other teachings. To sums things up, to
              me, all these events that had been happening, acts as a training for us
              to <strong>really put our teachings into practise</strong>.</p>
              <p>4) This video
              is on åœ£ä¸¥æ³•å¸ˆï¼Œit is a interview with him before he pass away. This is the
              last part of the interview, which impact me. After hearing this last
              part of interview, my mind suddenly lighten, I felt as if a heavy
              boulder is lifted off my mind. He frankly told the person, that alot of
              schools of Buddhist teachings, is creating a barrier with the society.
              And in this interview, if you are a Buddhist, you will find what he
              said is very true. And I recommend you all to watch the interview from
              part 1. </p>

              <p>Unless, we are really clear minded, when people come knocking on our doors trying to challenge us, we can then deal with it.</p>
              <p>We
              always make mistakes, we always repeat mistakes. But nevertheless we
              should always correct our mistakes. I myself technically is still not a
              buddhist, I have not çšˆä¾�ä¸‰å®�. But to what I've learned from åœ£ä¸¥æ³•å¸ˆ, even if
              we know that many teachings, but our heart don't put these teachings
              into action, so what if you know so many teachings? to him and many
              others, we are æ„šç—´çš„å¾’å¼Ÿã€‚ xD xD !!</p>
              <p>I emerge from hating other
              religion, to me this is improvement. I don't hate now. When i 1st join
              sgforum, you can see from my topics, i am really fed up. But now, the
              hate is not there anymore, sometimes is abit of nuisance, but shortly
              after that i just shrug it off. And i can say, it really feels much
              better. I am not stressing over it anymore.</p>
