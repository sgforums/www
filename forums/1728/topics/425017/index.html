              <h3>I. Talk on Wanderers (<em>ParibbÄ�jakakathÄ�</em>)</h3>
              <p><span class="sutta_ref"><a id="paragraph-1" name="paragraph-1">1.</a></span> Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Exalted One was travelling along
               the highway between RÄ�jagaha and NÄ�landÄ� together with a great company 
              of bhikkhus, with about five hundred bhikkhus. At the same time the 
              wanderer Suppiya was also travelling along the highway between RÄ�jagaha 
              and NÄ�landÄ� together with his pupil, the youth Brahmadatta. Along the 
              way, the wanderer Suppiya spoke in many ways in dispraise of the Buddha,
               the Dhamma, and the Sangha. But his pupil, the youth Brahmadatta, spoke
               in many ways in praise of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. Thus 
              these two, teacher and pupil, followed closely behind the Exalted One 
              and the company of bhikkhus, making assertions in direct contradiction 
              to each other.</p>
              <p><span class="sutta_ref"><a id="paragraph-2" name="paragraph-2">2.</a></span> Then the Exalted One together with the company of bhikkhus entered the 
              royal resthouse in the Ambalaá¹­á¹­hika garden in order to pass the night. 
              The wanderer Suppiya together with his pupil, the youth Brahmadatta, 
              also entered the royal resthouse in the Ambalaá¹­á¹­hika garden in order to 
              pass the night. There, too, the wanderer Suppiya spoke in many ways in 
              dispraise of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, while his pupil 
              Brahmadatta spoke in many ways in their praise. Thus these two, teacher 
              and pupil, dwelt together making assertions in direct contradiction to 
              each other.</p>
              <p><span class="sutta_ref"><a id="paragraph-3" name="paragraph-3">3.</a></span> When dawn broke a number of bhikkhus, after rising, assembled in the 
              pavilion. As they sat together, the following conversation sprang up 
              among them: "It is wonderful and marvellous, friends, how the Exalted 
              One, he who knows and sees, the Worthy One, the perfectly enlightened 
              Buddha, has so thoroughly penetrated the diversity in the dispositions 
              of beings. For this wanderer Suppiya spoke in many ways in dispraise of 
              the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, while his own pupil, the youth 
              Brahmadatta, spoke in many ways in their praise. These two, teacher and 
              pupil, followed closely behind the Exalted One and the company of 
              bhikkhus, making assertions in direct contradiction to each other."</p>
              <p><span class="sutta_ref"><a id="paragraph-4" name="paragraph-4">4.</a></span> Then the Exalted One, realizing the turn their discussion had taken, 
              entered the pavilion, sat down on the prepared seat, and addressed the 
              bhikkhus: "What kind of discussion were you holding just now, bhikkhus? 
              What was the subject of your conversation?"</p>
              <p>The bhikkhus replied: "When dawn had broken, Lord, after rising we 
              assembled in the pavilion. As we sat here, the following conversation 
              sprang up among us: 'It is wonderful and marvellous friends, how the 
              Exalted One, he who knows and sees, the Worthy One, the perfectly 
              enlightened Buddha, has so thoroughly penetrated the diversity in the 
              dispositions of beings. For this wanderer Suppiya spoke in many ways in 
              dispraise of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, while his own 
              pupil, the youth Brahmadatta, spoke in many ways in their praise. These 
              two, teacher and pupil, followed closely behind the Exalted One and the 
              company of bhikkhus, making assertions in direct contradiction to each 
              other.' This, Lord, was the conversation we were having when the Exalted
               One arrived."</p>
              <p><span class="sutta_ref"><a id="paragraph-5" name="paragraph-5">5.</a></span> "If, bhikkhus, others speak in dispraise of me, or in dispraise of the 
              Dhamma, or in dispraise of the Sangha, you should not give way to 
              resentment, displeasure, or animosity against them in your heart. For if
               you were to become angry or upset in such a situation, you would only 
              be creating an obstacle for yourselves. If you were to become angry or 
              upset when others speak in dispraise of us, would you be able to 
              recognize whether their statements are rightly or wrongly spoken?"</p>
              <p>"Certainly not, Lord."</p>
              <p>"If, bhikkhus, others speak in dispraise of me, or in dispraise of 
              the Dhamma, or in dispraise of the Sangha, you should unravel what is 
              false and point it out as false, saying: 'For such and such a reason 
              this is false, this is untrue, there is no such thing in us, this is not
               found among us.'</p>
              <p><span class="sutta_ref"><a id="paragraph-6" name="paragraph-6">6.</a></span> "And if, bhikkhus, others speak in praise of me, or in praise of the 
              Dhamma, or in praise of the Sangha, you should not give way to 
              jubilation, joy, and exultation in your heart. For if you were to become
               jubilant, joyful, and exultant in such a situation, you would only be 
              creating an obstacle for yourselves. If others speak in praise of me, or
               in praise of the Dhamma, or in praise of the Sangha, you should 
              acknowledge what is fact as fact, saying: 'For such and such a reason 
              this is a fact, this is true, there is such a thing in us, this is found
               among us.'</p>

              <h3>II. The Analysis of Virtue</h3>
              <h4>1. The Short Section on Virtue (<em>CÅ«á¸·asÄ«la</em>)</h4>
              <p><span class="sutta_ref"><a id="paragraph-7" name="paragraph-7">7.</a></span> "It is, bhikkhus, only to trifling and insignificant matters, to the 
              minor details of mere moral virtue, that a worldling would refer when 
              speaking in praise of the TathÄ�gata. And what are those trifling and 
              insignificant matters, those minor details of mere moral virtue, to 
              which he would refer?</p>
              <p><span class="sutta_ref"><a id="paragraph-8" name="paragraph-8">8.</a></span> "'Having abandoned the destruction of life, the recluse Gotama abstains
               from the destruction of life. He has laid aside the rod and the sword, 
              and dwells conscientious, full of kindness, compassionate for the 
              welfare of all living beings.' It is in this way, bhikkhus, that the 
              worldling would speak when speaking in praise of the TathÄ�gata.</p>
              <p>"Or he might say: 'Having abandoned taking what is not given, the 
              recluse Gotama abstains from taking what is not given. Accepting and 
              expecting only what is given, he dwells in honesty and rectitude of 
              heart.'</p>
              <p>"Or he might say: 'Having abandoned unchaste living, the recluse 
              Gotama lives the life of chastity. He dwells remote (from women), and 
              abstains from the vulgar practice of sexual intercourse.'</p>
              <p><span class="sutta_ref"><a id="paragraph-9" name="paragraph-9">9.</a></span> "Or he might say: 'Having abandoned false speech, the recluse Gotama 
              abstains from falsehood. He speaks only the truth, he lives devoted to 
              truth; trustworthy and reliable, he does not deceive anyone in the 
              world.'</p>
              <p>"Or he might say: 'Having abandoned slander, the recluse Gotama 
              abstains from slander. He does not repeat elsewhere what he has heard 
              here in order to divide others from the people here, nor does he repeat 
              here what he has heard elsewhere in order to divide these from the 
              people there. Thus he is a reconciler of those who are divided and a 
              promoter of friendships. Rejoicing, delighting, and exulting in concord,
               he speaks only words that are conducive to concord.'</p>
              <p>"Or he might say: 'Having abandoned harsh speech, the recluse Gotama 
              abstains from harsh speech. He speaks only such words as are gentle, 
              pleasing to the ear, endearing, going to the heart, urbane, amiable, and
               agreeable to many people.'</p>
              <p>"Or he might say: 'Having abandoned idle chatter, the recluse Gotama 
              abstains from idle chatter. He speaks at the right time, speaks what is 
              factual, speaks on the good, on the Dhamma and the Discipline. His words
               are worth treasuring: they are timely, backed by reason, definite and 
              connected with the good.'</p>
              <p><span class="sutta_ref"><a id="paragraph-10" name="paragraph-10">10.</a></span> "Or he might say: 'The recluse Gotama abstains from damaging seed and 
              plant life. He eats only in one part of the day, refraining from food at
               night and from eating at improper times. He abstains from dancing, 
              singing, instrumental music, and witnessing unsuitable shows. He 
              abstains from wearing garlands, embellishing himself with scents, and 
              beautifying himself with unguents. He abstains from accepting gold and 
              silver. He abstains from accepting uncooked grain, raw meat, women and 
              girls, male and female slaves, goats and sheep, fowl and swine, 
              elephants, cattle, horses and mares. He abstains from accepting fields 
              and lands. He abstains from running messages and errands. He abstains 
              from buying and selling, and from dealing with false weights, false 
              metals, and false measures. He abstains from the crooked ways of 
              bribery, deception, and fraud. He abstains from mutilating, executing, 
              imprisoning, robbery, plunder, and violence.'</p>
              <p>"It is in this way, bhikkhus, that the worldling would speak when speaking in praise of the TathÄ�gata.</p>
