              <p>Hi Friend,</p>
              <p>I don't post in this forum often now. Maybe I know you.. maybe not.</p>
              <p>Just wanted to say that channeling is not the same as Buddhist practice per say. Channeling may not equate to directly realising and understanding the nature of reality.</p>
              <p>Channelling need to use the mind to interprete the content. It does not necessarily lead to the direct experience of reality as it really is. That means, a channeler may not really understand the premise/medium where the channeling is occuring..aka not understanding the basis of reality being non-dual.</p>
              <p>Please do not feel offended. This is just a sharing. I just don't want the readers to be confused by the myriads of different mystical/metaphysical occurence and be lead onto more confusions.</p>

              <p>hi Longchen,</p>
              <p>Don't worry, I'm not offended at all. In fact, I'm very happy to hear a balanced and objective opinion. I'm just sharing another aspect of spiritual growth journey, which may be beneficial to complement some people's current religious practice, if it resonates well with them. Of course, people should continue with their Buddhist practice, as it's important to experience for themselves Buddha's teachings in their daily lives.</p>
              <p>Anyway, reality as we know it is just an illusion. I'm sharing this as my guide, Maitreya, has asked me to help him share the Truth. To me, Buddhism is one of the most balanced religions in the world currently, which I truly respect. Having an open mind and heart in these current times, in these couple of years, is of utmost importance. We need to help people keep out fear of the unknown or unusual, as the Truth is far stranger than most people can handle.</p>

              <p>Hi Rainbow Jigsaw,</p>
              <p>Glad that you are not offended.</p>
              <p>I too agree that reality is illusionary. IMO, it is really occuring without subject-object division. After a while, it really becomes obvious why reality is non-dual. But when we are born, conditioning make us assume that there is a 'you' and an environment out there. This assumption of a self is held in place by the 'coherent' grouping of the six sensory inputs of mental mind, sight vision, hearing, touching, etc. When the six sensory inputs are not 'attached to' and 'loosely' experienced, we experience reality closer to what it really is.. that is .. it is undivided and unseparated.</p>
              <p>This undivided nature is the basis of reality. IMO, in this sense, we can't really channel the creator because there is really no separation that is occuring. The real creator is this premise of undivided Presence. All along, there has not been a medium for any separation to occur. In order for any separation to occur, the source/creator... must be within a separation-medium. If that is the case, that will be 2 thing existing in the first place.. it can't. And that will make the separation-medium the source, instead..</p>

              <p>It is far better to understand the workings of reality ourselve than to listen to the second-hand information of channelled message that alway have to be conceptually constructed. The concepts are different from the experience.</p>

A channeller cannot channel any information or experience accurately that he or she does not understand.  If he or she looks back at what was being recieved years ago, he or she will feel that they may not be understood properly at that time.</p>

              <p>hi Dawnfirstlight,</p>
              <p>your questions are very valid. I don't preach anything, just sharing. :) I believe the origins of all religions go back to one Creator/Source/God/Buddha or whichever name man has given. I consider myself a spiritual free-thinker, as I believe there's truth in all religions, yet different in their interpretations by Man. We and Creator/Source/God/Buddha are One, as all beings are part of the Source.</p>
              <p><br>We should always keep our hearts and minds open, to be able to fully feel the Truth for ourselves, not simply believe what's been told to us. There's so much violence in this world, as many people have closed their hearts, and choose to only believe their perspective and interpretation.</p>
              <p>Spirituality is in all of us, if we choose to. Feel with our hearts what we should do, and things will become clear. Open our hearts and minds, and we'll experience the Truth for ourselves, not hear from anyone else. As I've said earlier, I'm not here to prove anything. All who are meant to understand will do so, when the time is right. There is a plan for everyone.</p>

              <p>I'm not special, just that I and others like me chose to open our hearts to reach out to Higher Beings, as we've remembered our life mission. Everyone has the inner ability to communicate with Higher Beings if they truly want to, deep within their Higher Selves. However, most people choose subconsciously not to be able to do so, for reasons that have happened in past-lives or present lives. As a result, there are energy blockages within us which prohibit the ability to be realised.</p>
              <p>It's ok if you don't believe. It does not matter. All who are meant to know will know in good time. May you have a good day ahead! :)</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>I agree completely with you that who the channeler is and his/her experiences make a difference. That is the reason Higher Beings will have many channelers to help send out their messages across the world, as all of us will only resonate with certain people, not everyone, ie. we naturally tune in to a particular person, but not another person.</p>
              <p>Everyone's life plan is different. As long as our individual paths lead us to a journey of unconditional love, not fear and negativity, we'll eventually reach our destinations meant for us, in good time. No two people should be expected to walk the same path for the sake of following without understanding the path and destination.</p>

              <p>Maitreya has sent another channeled message on 13 Jan 10.</p>
              <p>Feel free to visit <a href="http://www.rainbowjigsaw.com">Rainbow Jigsaw website</a> to read it, ONLY IF you feel comfortable about knowing more about the Universe, and are prepared to open your heart and mind.

              <p>Hi Rainbow Jigsaw,</p>
              <p>Am just offering a different experience.</p>
              <p>BTW, i too have experiences of these messages ... Earth change
              messages, ET astral encounters message, read the
              Book-of-life/akashic, and encounters of even more sinister kinds,
              etc.  Am not new to these stuffs. Still, they did not bring me
              any closer to the actual practice of cultivation... am still
              working on the cultivation.</p>
              <p>Just want to stress that the actual practice of cultivation is
              very different from reading and recieving channeled messages.</p>
              <p>It is far better to understand the workings of reality ourselve
              than to listen to the second-hand information of channelled message
              that alway have to be conceptually constructed. The concepts are
              different from the experience.</p>
              <p>Also, the limit of any channelled information IS the channeller.
              A channeller cannot channel any information or experience
              accurately that he or she does not understand.  If he or she
              looks back at what was being recieved years ago, he or she will
              feel that they may not be understood properly at that time.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>I agree. These channeled information are far far away from the actual practice and realisation of enlightenment and shows no real experience or insight of the nature of reality. If these information actually came from enlightened masters, it would be of an entirely different kind of understanding.</p>

              <p>Dear Rainbow Jigsaw,</p>
              <p>Please stop posting link to your website.</p>
              <p>It is with much hesitation that I write this to you.</p>
              <p>By spreading these channelled messages, they are of no help. Those words are just too vague.</p>
              <p>Do you understand the dynamics of the words used in those messages?</p>
              <p>What is light? What is ascension? Do you really have real experience of them? How does light relates to ascension? What is required for ascension? Also where are we ascending to?</p>
              <p>As, I have said before, I also have message transmissions relating to these stuffs before. In fact, for several years ( about 10 years ago) I followed the stuffs of an 'ascension school'. I am now so glad that i have got out of those new age stuffs.</p>
              <p>The Earth may be changing, but what is required for your so-called 'ascension' is far far more rigorous. It is not so cheap.</p>
              <p>Also, workable systems of spiritual developments are already in place. Why create more stuffs...? Why not just direct people to those proven systems such as Buddhism.</p>
              <p><strong>If any non-physical being say that you are special or you are here for a special mission, you better think twice. It is using you by feeding on the ego pride.</strong></p>
              <p>Have you ever wondered why very few newage channeller channel the historical Buddha?</p>
              <p>Real Buddhism is profound.</p>
              <p>I am not here to 'convert' you. From my experience, once someone has come to this stage, he or she will not listen anymore.</p>
              <p>I am just requesting that you stop promoting your website here.</p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>

              <p>Good afternoon Rainbow Jigsaw, </p>
              <p>Buddhist as rule do not believe in the concept''Creator/Source/God"</p>
              <p>To achieve Buddhahood, only by self cultivation, that it is attainable.</p>
              <p>"He who sees the Dharma sees me", that with the Dharma, we may follow his footsteps!</p>
              <p> Secondly, is about accountability, by being medium or channel for the messages, do you take the accountability for the messages passed through you? In the event of utterances of falsehood, are you willing to take responsibility that falsehoods has been disseminated by you?By falsehood, does not imply that you have been dishonest! Please remember, you are not being accused of anything! Falsehood, even if it is held and uttered by millions to true, is still a falsehood. </p>
              <p>Thirdly, what authentication  do you have that the messages are accurate, that channelling is reliable, the entities are who they say they are? What is the basis of your verification? </p>
