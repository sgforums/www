              <p>Good afternoon Rainbow Jigsaw, </p>
              <p>Buddhist as rule do not believe in the
              concept''Creator/Source/God"</p>
              <p>To achieve Buddhahood, only by self cultivation, that it is
              attainable.</p>
              <p>"He who sees the Dharma sees me", that with the Dharma, we may
              follow his footsteps!</p>
              <p> Secondly, is about accountability, by being medium or
              channel for the messages, do you take the accountability for the
              messages passed through you? In the event of utterances of
              falsehood, are you willing to take responsibility that falsehoods
              has been disseminated by you?By falsehood, does not imply that you
              have been dishonest! Please remember, you are not being accused of
              anything! Falsehood, even if it is held and uttered by millions to
              true, is still a falsehood. </p>
              <p>Thirdly, what authentication  do you have that the messages
              are accurate, that channelling is reliable, the entities are who
              they say they are? What is the basis of your
              verification? </p>

              <p>I agree with Weychin,</p>
              <p>There is great responsibility there in spreading spiritual message.</p>
              <p>It is not just about ourselve anymore. It is about the welbeing of many others.</p>

              <p>The forest is always safe. But, the ego-mind/self thinks it is dangerous.</p>
              <p>If you gonna put this fear-based, egomind-bounded message on your website, you are going to mislead people.</p>
              <p>Realisation is not about finding the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. It is a paradigm shift to see the illusionary nature of the game.</p>

              <p>Let's just say, without the torch, yes, they would not see clearly as it was daylight,but they see things evenly and as they  are. Now between torch and no torch, now without the torch they could not longer see,as they were blinded by torch.</p>
              <p>And without the torch they were afraid ,now they fear shadows that were'nt  there before, for they could no longer see beyond the glow of flame.  </p>
              <p>And James felled as he tripped trying to walk faster with the aid of the torch! Tom and Sally panicked as the torch doused when James fell. Tom failed to see the wolves are actually dogs from the rescue party, as he failed to see beyond the torch. Sally, contacted poison ivy was lulled due to false assurance as rabbits don't play with human in the wild.....  </p>
