              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Ghosts Are Universal, But What You See is Influenced By What
              You Already Believe</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">December 4, 2017 Derek Beres Big Think</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The mythologist Joseph Campbell once wrote that Buddhists
              don’t dream of Christ. His point is simple: if your identity is bound up in a
              certain set of beliefs, you’re likely not going to be unconsciously invaded by
              a different figure from another set, especially if you’ve never had contact
              with that system.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Campbell jotted down this idea this well before the Internet,
              when people of various religions had much less access to different religious
              systems. Buddhists were much more likely to envision a Bo tree over a crucifix
              any night. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But do Buddhists see Christian ghosts? The concept of ghosts
              is universal. In Buddhism, there are even categories of ghosts. Hungry ghosts
              are beings driven by intense emotional desires, while ghosts as we generally
              know them in America—apparitions of the deceased—also exist. Taoist hungry
              ghosts emerge from the ether if their meat casing of a human body died
              violently or unhappily. In Christianity, the holy spirit is a ghost, but
              ancestors are ghostly too. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Though ghosts are a global phenomenon—there is evidence
              humans are hardwired to “see” them—Knox College psychology professor Frank T.
              McAndrew writes that whatever god you worship influences the type of ghost you
              see. Like Campbell, he recognizes prior belief influences what your eyes
              behold. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">First McAndrew surveys basic assumptions about the spirit
              world. Protestants, Catholics, and Muslims, he writes, share a belief in
              resurrection and judgment, which eventually ends up in a heavenly realm or a
              hellish domain; Catholics throw in purgatory for good measure. Buddhist and
              Hindus, while varying slightly depending on region, put stock in reincarnation,
              which requires a certain waiting period in which the soul might just happen to
              haunt the living—their own private purgatory.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">This, McAndrew speculates, allows each believer to think
              they’re asserting control over the destiny of their individual ether in the
              context of the belief system they’ve been raised in. But it turns out that this
              anxiety-reducing mechanism of an ever-after might actually induce a different
              kind of paranoia: </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Religion’s talent for easing our anxiety about death may have
              had the perverse effect of increasing the likelihood that we’ll be on edge
              about ghosts, spirits and other supernatural beings.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Religious believers are twice as likely to believe in ghosts
              than nonbelievers—and 18 percent of Americans have claimed to have seen one
              surfing the air. If the believer is Muslim, he’ll likely think he’d spied a
              Jinn, since the concept of souls becoming ghosts isn’t prominent in Islam,
              whereas Protestants give credence to the paranormal. Catholics also champion
              these type of spirits, even as they condemn followers from contacting them
              through the Ouija board they purchased on Amazon. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">One of the most complex assertions on the waiting period
              between death and rebirth is expressed in the Bardo Thodol, a Tibetan text
              popularly known as the “book of the dead.” While the validity of this
              “transitional state” is questionable, the rites associated with it are fascinating—so
              much so Carl Jung added commentary to W.Y. Evans-Wentz’s translation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Jung is skeptical regarding the text’s more grandiose claims,
              comparing them to “the half-baked literature of European and American
              spiritualism.” As an interior map of archetypes and psychology, however, he is
              enthralled. He writes,</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">It is a primordial, universal idea that the dead simply
              continue their earthly existence and do not know that they are disembodied
              spirits—an archetypal idea which enters into immediate, visible manifestation
              whenever anyone sees a ghost. It is significant, too, that ghosts all over the
              world have certain features in common. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The features, which include a sort of hallucinogenic vision
              of a hazy figure and often relies on a “feeling” of presence rather than visual
              proof, are indeed experienced around the planet. As McAndrew points out, prior
              beliefs influence how you see ghosts and what to make of them. Their function,
              history, and friendliness (or foreboding nature) are all dependent upon what you
              previously thought about ghosts. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Which is why the concept continues to fascinate as a
              psychological construct. The human brain is capable of creating things that do
              not exist and actually seeing them in front of their own eyes. There’s a saying
              that life is what you make it. Turns out that death might just be as
              well. </span></p>
