              Two local Chinese evening tabloids (Xin Min and Lianhe Wanbao) both reported last night the President of the Singapore Buddhist Lodge , Mr. Li Mu Yuan took a swipe at Mr. Low Thia Khiang, the leader of the Workers Party, candidate for Aljunied GRC. Mr. Li openly criticised Low Thia khiang in relation to his decision and motive to contest in Aljunied GRC. He also openly praised BG George Yeo for his contribution to the religious community here. 
              
              Mr. Li has the right to express his opinion in his personal capacity, but the newspapers both reported him as 'President of the Buddhist Lodge'. This partisan political stand by a religious leader is NOT good for the Buddhist community.
              
              What will happen if the leaders of other religious groups were to do likewise expressing their partisan political views openly? This will drag religion into politics.

              <p>I believe all Buddhists are mature enough to decide for ourselves who to vote and not listen to just what someone has said.

              <p>Agree about this for Buddhists who are younger in age.</p>
              <p>However the older set of people - let's just arbitrarily say those from 50 years old onwards - tend to be trusting of anything that appears in newspapers or which comes from the mouth of "authorities".  Hence, to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">specifically name politicians and give specific opinions</span> about them would actually interfere with the democratic process.  On the eve of the elections, publishing something like that will have certain impact.  How huge the impact, I don't know.</p>

              <p>ask if u prefer "working" under a Real buddhist (selfless in nature) thinking "boss" or a "new and unfamilar" one, i think most will choose the former and tend to "protect" the current situation that is more "comfortable" to him/her. it's just human nature. actually i dun quite "like" GY, but after some search on him and buddhism, i reduce the "dislike". this is also bias nature again. guess to him a new and unfamilar boss need to show the selfless nature to win more <em>true</em> buddhist support.</p>

              <p>That said, I do think that if democratic processes are already in
               place for citizens to choose one way or the other, then Buddhists still
               have the responsibility to vote taking into account the good of the 
              larger community.  To be apathetic and not take part in the 
              decision-making process, is to also make a decision in favour of not 
              doing what is kind and compassionate. </p>
              <p>I do agree with TS and a few others that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">religion and secular life should preferably be kept separate</span>. 
               Once high profile religious leaders get openly involved in politics, 
              things can get complicated.  Paradoxically, religious sentiment can also
               become a tool to incite people to be immoral. </p>
              <p>Thankfully though, Buddhists all over the world have for the most part shown themselves to be peace-loving people.  AMTF.</p>
