                  op-ed</a> that relies on building some absurdly precise parallel between a
                  contemporary political event and an obscure precedent from the past. The Greek
                  debt crisis really isn’t <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/25/opinion/bankers-at-the-gates.html?_r=0">all
                  that similar</a> to the Fourth Crusade, post-9/11 America isn’t really
                  reminiscent of <em>fin-de-siècle</em> Vienna, etc. But given the <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/02/is-america-at-war-with-radical-islam/385200/">ongoing</a> <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2015/02/what-isis-really-wants/384980/">debate</a> over the Islamic nature of ISIS, I can’t resist throwing caution to the wind
                  and offering my own contribution to the genre: Baron Roman Fedorovich
                  von Ungern-Sternberg — The Buddhist al-Baghdadi. If nothing else, the
                  gruesome adventures of an aristocratic 1920s Buddhist convert provide one more
                  bit of evidence for why we should understand ISIS in a political or structural
                  context, rather than a specifically Islamic one.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 21.0pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #444444;'>The most dramatic account of Baron Ungern-Sternberg’s reign of
                  terror is undoubtedly the 1922 classic <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1463701861/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1463701861&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwaronthec-20&amp;linkId=JVBZACK6WVDQQCFP"><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">Beasts, Men and Gods</span></a></em>,
                  penned by Polish adventurer Ferdinand Ossendowski. Ossendowski’s tale of
                  meeting Ungern-Sternberg in Mongolia while fleeing the Red Army makes for
                  engaging reading, though that may have something to do with long-standing <a href="http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1782894?uid=3739256&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21106740536343">accusations</a> that he made up the most engaging parts of it. Yet when it comes to the outline
                  of Ungern-Sternberg’s career, as well as the depths of his savagery, the
                  essentials of Ossendowski’s book are all supported by Peter Hopkirk’s
                  better-documented and still quite engaging book, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Setting-East-Ablaze-Lenins-Empire/dp/0719564506/"><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">Setting the East Ablaze</span></a>.</em></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 21.0pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #444444;'><em></em></span><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Cambria, serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 21pt;">Baron
                  von Ungern-Sternberg was a Russian officer from a long line of Baltic barons,
                  “Huns from the time of Atilla” he supposedly told Ossendowski. The baron served
                  in World War One, then fought with particular distinction and savagery for the
                  Whites during the Russian Civil War. When the tide turned decisively in the
                  Bolsheviks’ favor, Ungern-Sternberg found himself deep in Siberia. There,
                  he organized a small army made up of defeated White Russian soldiers and set
                  out to conquer Mongolia — a place he felt a great affinity for, having visited
                  there previously and having converted to his own idiosyncratic form of
                  messianic Buddhism.  In conquering Mongolia, he would avoid death at the
                  hands of the Bolsheviks while he reorganized his forces for an eventual liberation
                  of Russia.  Named “the incarnated God of war and Khan of grateful
                  Mongolia” by Bogdo Khan, the Living Buddha, Ungern-Sternberg imagined himself
                  the reincarnation of Ghengis Khan. He explained to Ossendowski, that he wanted
                  to forge a “great State from the Pacific and Indian Oceans to the shore of the
                  Volga,” in which “the wise religion of the Buddha shall run to the north and
                  the west.” Pausing only to order beatings and executions, he also told
                  Ossendowski of his efforts to form an order of Buddhist militants in Russia.
                   If Ossendowski was skeptical of the baron’s grandiose claims, it is
                  likely many other Buddhists were as well, though for political and personal
                  reasons many found it expedient to play along. In his invasion of Mongolia the
                  baron received advice from the oracle bones of his soothsayers, a detachment of
                  bodyguards from the Dalai Lama, and the support of Mongol cavalry seeking to
                  free their country from Chinese rule.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 21.0pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #444444;'>In 1920, following almost three years of vicious fighting,
                  Central Asia was in chaos and its population was inured to violence. Von
                  Ungern-Sternberg established a modicum of order by being even more violent,
                  finding ever more dramatic ways to torture and kill his enemies that could
                  inspire fear in a desensitized population.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 21.0pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #444444;'>Peter Hopkirk <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Setting-East-Ablaze-Lenins-Empire/dp/0719564506/">describes</a> Ungern-Sternberg’s systematic atrocities in terms that sound all too
                  familiar today.  In first building his army, the baron made a point of
                  executing recruits who did not meet his expectations. As one of his officers
                  explained, “His Buddhist teachers taught him about reincarnation, and he firmly
                  believed that in killing the feeble people he only did them good, as they would
                  be stronger beings in their next life.” Entering Mongolia, Ungern-Sternberg
                  sought to terrorize anyone who resisted his advance. Officers were burned at
                  the stake, villagers in their huts. To what extent the baron’s use of exemplary
                  sadism — a bakers’ apprentice baked to death in his own oven, men thrown into
                  the boilers of trains — contributed to his success is unclear, but he quickly
                  succeeded in driving a much larger Chinese garrison out of Urga (now Ulan Batur)
                  and making it his capital.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 21.0pt;"><a href="http://warontherocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Danforth-1.png"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif; color: #0489b1;"> </span></a></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 21.0pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #444444;'>By 1921, the baron had consolidated his rule in Urga and was
                  preparing to return to liberate Russia. It is unclear if Urga would be his
                  Mosul or his Raqqa in this case. Here is where the comparison breaks down.
                  Ossendowski, who was staying in Urga as the baron’s nervous guest, recorded the
                  beginning of the end before wisely leaving town. Ungern-Sternberg went to a
                  Buddhist temple to pray for success in his new anti-Bolshevik crusade. Instead,
                  he received a prophecy that he would die in 130 days. Instead of losing hope,
                  he simply took this to mean he would have to act fast. But the Bolsheviks were
                  now better prepared. They ambushed the baron’s men shortly after he crossed the
                  border, forcing them to withdraw and regroup. A few minor victories gave the
                  baron the chance to commit a final atrocity — burying captured Bolshevik
                  Cavalry alive — but soon his troops turned against him. The Red Army found him
                  on the ground, covered in ants, where his former Mongolian allies had left him
                  to die. Supposedly, he was then executed by a Bolshevik firing squad exactly
                  130 days after his death had been foretold.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 21.0pt;"><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Cambria, serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 21pt;">As
                  Baron Ungern-Sternberg’s short and bloody career shows, the combination of
                  extreme faith and extreme violence can prove effective in times of extreme
                  chaos, but wielding them is not always conducive to long-term strategic
                  planning or winning the loyalty of those around you. Whether Al-Baghdadi
                  himself survives much longer than Ungern-Sternberg did remains to be seen. But
                  even if he doesn’t, his death would be unlikely to sweep away the region’s
                  volatility and insecurity, out of which he emerged as an Islamist leader, just
                  as the baron’s death hardly brought tranquility to Soviet Central Asia.</span></p>
