              <p>hahaha... this is cute.</p>
              <p>got something to say but it's out of this thread's topic</p>
              <p>somehow I felt is like ... not sure what term to use, mystifying...?</p>
              <p>it's like... when i first read about buddha, he was a human being, keen to find a way to end suffering. But after he got popular, maybe people out of respect or adulation, gave him several "titles", eg. World Honored One, Teacher of Devas and Humans, etc and how he could performed several amazing feats...</p>
              <p>no one could prove or deny. But somehow I still think Buddhas, Bodhisattvas or Arahats are people who wants to help people. Just like you and me. Normal people but with compassion.</p>
              <p>But somehow in the process, people added supernatural stories. Could be true but no one really knows.</p>

              <p>if any of you have read my post before, you probably know i'm a roman catholic but i have a true story about Goddess of Mercy. my true life story...</p>
              <p>some history;</p>
              <p>my mother is a born taoist who "converted" to roman catholic when she married my dad. when i was a baby, i was looked after by my mum's sister as both my parents had to work. so basically, the plan is that i will be at my aunt's place from Monday to Friday and my parents will bring me home over the weekends. but after coming back from hospital, every night i will cry non stop... guarantee at about the same time, i will cry like nobody's business. no matter what they did or how they try to pamper, pacify, i will still cry.</p>
              <p>so almost every night, auntie will call mum and "complain" about my crying... sometimes they will rush over but still no use, cry and cry... until my parents had enough. so being from a taoist family, my mum and auntie brought me to see a Goddess of Mercy medium. she claimed that i was visited by my "past life" parents and they disturb me every night like wanting to get back what i owed them. the only way is to become the "godson" or what they say "kwei Gia" to protect me from them.</p>
              <p>of course my father who is a born catholic do not believe... i won't blame him, different teaching but he say try lor... nothing to lose and that night when i was made "godson", the crying literally stopped and i could sleep well... even my father couldn't believe it yet it was true... the crying really stopped and from that day onwards, my father even pay his respect to Guan Yin when my mother goes to the temple to pray. </p>
              <p>so to dear godma, Happy Birthday!</p>

              <p>AT THAT TIME Inexhaustible Intention Bodhisattva rose from his seat, 
              uncovered his right shoulder, placed his palms together, and facing the 
              Buddha, said, "World Honored One, for what reason is the Bodhisattva 
              Guanshiyin called ï¿½Guanshiyinï¿½?"</p>
              <p>The Buddha told Inexhaustible Intention Bodhisattva, "Good man, 
              if any of the limitless hundreds of thousands of myriads of <em>kotis </em>of
               living beings who are undergoing all kinds of suffering hear of 
              Guanshiyin Bodhisattva and recite his name single-mindedly, Guanshiyin 
              Bodhisattva will immediately hear their voices and rescue them.</p>
              <p>"If a person who upholds the name of Guanshiyin Bodhisattva 
              enters a great fire, the fire will not burn him, all because of this 
              Bodliisattvaï¿½s awesome spiritual power.</p>
              <p>"If a person being tossed about in the great sea calls out the 
              Bodhisattvaï¿½s name, he will find a shallow place.</p>
              <p>"If the hundreds of thousands of myriads of <em>kotis </em>of 
              beings who seek gold, silver, lapis lazuli, mother-of-pearl, carnelian, 
              coral, amber, pearls, and so forth enter the great sea, an evil wind may
               toss their boats into the territory of the <em>rakshasa </em>ghosts. But 
              if among them there is even one person who calls out the name of 
              Guanshiyin Bodhisattva, they will all be saved from the difficulty of 
              the <em>rakshasas. </em>For this reason, he is called Guanshiyin.</p>
              <p>"Further, if a person who is about to be harmed calls out the 
              name of Guanshiyin Bodhisattva, the knives and staves of the attackers 
              will break into pieces and he will be saved.</p>
              <p>"If <em>yakshas </em>and <em>rakshasas </em>enough to fill the three 
              thousand great thousand world system come to torment a person, if they 
              hear him call out the name of Guanshiyin Bodhisattva, all those evil 
              ghosts will not even be able to stare at that person with their evil 
              eyes, how much the less harm him.</p>
              <p>"If a person, whether guilty or not, who has been put in stocks 
              or bound with chains calls out the name of Guanshiyin Bodhisattva, his 
              fetters will break apart and he will immediately be freed.</p>
              <p>"If bandits enough to fill the three thousand great thousand 
              world system infest a dangerous road on which a merchant chief in charge
               of costly jewels is leading a group of merchants, but among the 
              merchants there is even a single person who says, ï¿½Good men, do not be 
              afraid! You should all single-mindedly recite the name of Guanshiyin 
              Bodhisattva. This Bodhisattva bestows fearlessness upon living beings. 
              If you recite his name, you shall surely be saved from these robbers,ï¿½ 
              and if upon hearing that, the merchants all cry out together, <em>ï¿½Namo </em>Guanshiyin
               Bodhisattva,ï¿½ then they will immediately be saved because they recited 
              his name.</p>
              <p>"Inexhaustible Intention! The awesome spiritual power of the 
              Bodhisattva Mahasattva Guanshiyin is as lofty and sublime as that!</p>
              <p>"If living beings who have much sexual desire constantly and 
              reverently recite the name of Guanshiyin Bodhisattva, they will be 
              separated from desire.</p>
              <p>"If those who have much hatred constantly and reverently recite 
              the name of Guanshiyin Bodhisattva, they will be separated from hatred.</p>
              <p>"If those who are very stupid constantly and reverently recite 
              the name of Guanshiyin Bodhisattva, they will be separated from 
              stupidity.</p>
              <p>"Inexhaustible Intention, Guanshiyin Bodhisattva has great 
              awesome spiritual powers such as these and confers great benefits. 
              Therefore living beings should always be mindful of him.</p>
              <p>"If women who seek sons bow and make offerings to Guanshiyin 
              Bodhisattva, they will give birth to blessed, virtuous, and wise sons. 
              If they seek daughters, they will give birth to upright and handsome 
              daughters who have planted roots of virtue in previous lives and who are
               regarded and respected by all.</p>
              <p>"Inexhaustible Intention! Guanshiyin Bodhisattva has powers such 
              as these. If there are living beings who reverently bow to Guanshiyin 
              Bodhisattva, they will be blessed and their efforts will not be in vain.</p>
              <p>"Therefore living beings should all receive and uphold the name 
              of Guanshiyin Bodhisattva.</p>
              <p>"Inexhaustible Intention! If a person were to receive and uphold 
              the names of Bodhisattvas in number as the grains of sand in sixty-two <em>kotis </em>of Ganges Rivers, and in addition were to exhaustively make 
              offerings to them of food, drink, clothing, bedding, and medicine, what 
              do you thinkï¿½would that good manï¿½s or good womanï¿½s merit and virtue be 
              great or not?"</p>
              <p>Inexhaustible Intention Bodhisattva replied, "Very great, World 
              Honored One."</p>
              <p>The Buddha said, "If another person were to receive and uphold 
              the name of Guanshiyin Bodhisattva and bow and make offerings but once, 
              that personï¿½s blessings would be equal to and not different from the 
              other personï¿½s. They could not be exhausted in hundreds of thousands of 
              myriads of <em>kotis </em>of eons.</p>
              <p>"Inexhaustible Intention, one who receives and upholds the name 
              of Guanshiyin Bodhisattva obtains the benefit of blessings and virtues 
              as limitless and boundless as those."</p>
              <p>Inexhaustible Intention Bodhisattva said to the Buddha, "World 
              Honored One, how does Guanshiyin Bodhisattva roam through this Saha 
              world? How does he speak the Dharma for living beings? How does he carry
               out this work with the power of expedients?"</p>
              <p>The Buddha told Inexhaustible Intention Bodhisattva, "Good man, 
              if living beings in this land must be saved by means of someone in the 
              body of a Buddha, Guanshiyin Bodhisattva will manifest <span style="font-size: x-small;">itt </span>the body of a Buddha and speak Dharma for them.</p>

              <p>"If they must be saved by someone in the body of a Hearer, he 
              will manifest in the body of a Hearer and speak Dharma for them.</p>
              <p>"If they must be saved by someone in the body of the Brahma King,
               he will manifest in the body of the Brahma King and speak Dharma for 
              them.</p>
              <p>"If they must be saved by someone in the body of Shakra, he will 
              manifest in the body of Shakra and speak Dharma for them.</p>
              <p>"If they must be saved by someone in the body of the God of

              <p>"Inexhaustible Intention! Guanshiyin Bodhisattva has accomplished
               merit and virtue such as this and, in all manner of forms, roams 
              throughout the land, saving and liberating living beings.</p>
              <p>"Therefore you should all single-mindedly make offerings to 
              Guanshiyin Bodhisattva. Guanshiyin Bodhisattva Mahasattva can, in the 
              midst of fear, crisis, and hardship, bestow fearlessness. That is why in
               this Saha world all call him the "Bestower of Fearlessness."</p>
              <p>Inexhaustible Intention Bodhisattva said to the Buddha, "World 
              Honored One, I shall now make an offering to Guanshiyin Bodhisattva." He
               then removed his necklace of pearls, its value in the hundreds of 
              thousands of ounces of gold, and offered it to the Bodhisattva, saying, 
              "Humane One, accept this Dharma offering, this necklace of precious 
              pearls."</p>
              <p>Guanshiyin Bodhisattva refused to accept it.</p>
              <p>Inexhaustible Intention Bodhisattva again said to Guanshiyin 
              Bodhisattva, "Humane One, out of pity for us, accept this necklace."</p>
              <p>The Buddha then told Guanshiyin Bodhisattva, "You should take 
              pity on Inexhaustible Intention Bodhisattva and the fourfold assembly, 
              as well as the gods, dragons, <em>yakshas, gandharvas, asuras, garudas, 
              kinnaras, mahoragas, </em>humans, nonhumans, and so forth, and accept 
              this necklace."</p>
              <p>Then, out of pity for the fourfold assembly, the gods, dragons, 
              humans, nonhumans, and so forth, Guanshiyin Bodhisattva accepted the 
              necklace. He divided it into two parts: one part he offered to 
              Shakyamuni Buddha and the other to the <em>stupa </em>of Many Jewels 
              Buddha.</p>
              <p>"Inexhaustible Intention, such is the self-mastery and spiritual 
              power of Guanshiyin Bodhisattva, who roams throughout the Saha world."</p>
              <p>At that time, Inexhaustible Intention Bodhisattva used verses to 
              ask this question:</p>
              <em> </em>
              <p><em>World Honored One, complete with wondrous marks, <br> I now ask again, <br> Why is this disciple of the Buddha Called Guanshiyin? </em></p>
              <p><em>The Honored One of Perfect, Wondrous Marks, <br> With verses answered Inexhaustible Intention: <br> Listen to the practice of Guanyin, <br> Who skillfully responds in all places. </em></p>
              <p><em>With vast vows, as deep as the sea, <br> Throughout inconceivable eons, <br> He has served many thousands of </em>kotis 
                          <em>of Buddhas, <br> And has made great, pure vows. </em></p>
              <p><em>I shall now tell you in brief, <br> That for those who hear his name or see him, <br> And who are mindful of his name unceasingly, <br> He can extinguish the suffering of all realms of 
              existence. </em></p>
              <p><em>If someone is the victim of anotherï¿½s harmful 
              intent, <br> And is pushed into a pit of fire, <br> If he evokes the strength of Guanyin, <br> The pit of fire will turn into a pool. <br> If someone is being tossed about in the great sea, <br> And is surrounded by the dangers of dragons, fish, and 
              ghosts, <br> If he evokes the strength of Guanyin, <br> The waves will not drown him. </em></p>
              <p><em>If someone is on the peak of Mount Sumeru, <br> And another person tries to push him off, <br> If he evokes the strength of Guanyin, <br> He will stand firm as the sun in space. </em></p>
              <p><em>If someone is pursued by evil people, <br> Who want to throw him off a Vajra Mountain, <br> If he evokes the strength of Guanyin, <br> Not a single hair on his body will be harmed. </em></p>
              <p><em>If someone is surrounded by vicious bandits, <br> Who threaten him with knives, <br> If he evokes the strength of Guanyin, <br> The bandits will all give rise to compassion. </em></p>
              <p><em>If someone is in trouble with the law, <br> And on the verge of being executed, <br> If he evokes the strength of Guanyin, <br> The knives will break into pieces. </em></p>
              <p><em>If someone is imprisoned, shackled, or 
              chained, <br> Or if his hands and feet are in stocks, <br> If he evokes the strength of Guanyin, <br> His bonds will open and he will be free. </em></p>
              <p><em>If someone is about to be harmed, <br> By mantras, spells, or poison, <br> If he evokes the strength of Guanyin, <br> The harm will all return to the sender. </em></p>
              <p><em>If someone meets with evil </em>rakshasas, 
                          <em><br> Poisonous dragons, or ghosts, <br> If he evokes the strength of Guanyin, <br> They will then not dare to harm him. </em></p>
              <p><em>If someone is surrounded by vicious beasts, <br> With fearsome fangs and claws, <br> If he evokes the strength of Guanyin, <br> The beasts will quickly run far away. </em></p>
              <p><em>Poisonous snakes and scorpions, <br> Have blazing lethal vapors, <br> But if one evokes the strength of Guanyin, <br> At the sound of oneï¿½s voice, they will disperse. </em></p>
              <p><em>Clouds of roaring thunder and lightning <br> May send down hail or great floods of rain, <br> But if one evokes the strength of Guanyin, <br> The clouds will immediately scatter. </em></p>
              <p><em>Living beings are beset with hardships, <br> And oppressed by limitless sufferings. <br> The power of Guanyinï¿½s wondrous wisdom <br> Can rescue the world from suffering. </em></p>
              <p><em>Complete with the power of spiritual 
              penetrations, <br> Vastly cultivating wisdom and expedient means, <br> Going throughout countries in the ten directions, <br> He manifests everywhere in all places. </em></p>
              <p><em>The various evil destinies, <br> Those of the hells, ghosts, and animals, <br> And the pain of birth, old age, sickness, and death <br> Are all gradually wiped away. </em></p>
              <p><em>True Contemplator, Pure Contemplator, <br> Contemplator with Vast, Great Wisdom, <br> Compassionate Contemplator, Kind Contemplator, <br> May we constantly behold you with reverence! </em></p>
              <p><em>Undefiled pure light, <br> The sun of wisdom that breaks through the darkness <br> Is able to quell calamities of wind and fire <br> As it shines on all worlds. </em></p>
              <p><em>Compassionate substance: the thunder of 
              precepts. <br> Kind intent: a wondrous great cloud. <br> He rains down sweet dew and Dharma rain, <br> Which extinguish the flames of affliction. </em></p>
              <p><em>In the midst of contention, when faced with 
              lawsuits, <br> Or when someone is terrified on the battlefield, <br> If he evokes the strength of Guanyin, <br> All his many enemies will scatter and leave. <br> Wondrous your sound, Contemplator of the Worldï¿½s Sounds<br> A pure sound, a sound like the sea tide, <br> A sound beyond all worldly sounds, <br> We shall always bear it in mind. </em></p>
              <p><em>In thought after thought we have no doubt: <br> Guanshiyin is pure and sagely. <br> In times of suffering, agony, danger, and death, <br> He is our refuge and protector. </em></p>
              <p><em>Complete with all merit and virtue, <br> His kind eyes watching living beings, <br> He is endowed with massive blessings, limitless as the 
              sea. <br> Therefore we should reverently worship him. </em></p>
              <p>At that time the Bodhisattva Guardian of the Earth rose from his seat
               and said to the Buddha, "World Honored One, if there are those who hear
               this chapter of Guanshiyin Bodhisattva, who learn about the 
              self-mastery of his deeds and the power of his spiritual penetrations as
               shown in this Universal Door, you should know that the merit and virtue
               of such people will not be small."</p>
              <p>When the Buddha had spoken the "Universal Door Chapter," 
              eighty-four 
                        thousand living beings in the assembly all brought forth the 
              resolve 
                        for <em>anuttarasamyaksambodhi.</em></p>
