              <p>Regarding merits:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>I remember years ago Thusness would
                                          have me explain the dharma to people from various forums. One time
                                          many years ago I thought it would be better if Thusness explained
                                          by himself to the others, so I told Thusness why don't you post
                                          yourself or something like that. Thusness suddenly appeared serious
                                          (he seldom talk in this tone) and asked me so are you going to do
                                          this or not? Then he told me the reason (not exact words now but
                                          along this line) he had me to do this was because I was lacking in
                                          merits to gain enlightenment. And then he said something like...
                                          you think I'm joking? Suddenly at that moment I realized why he was
                                          always taking the trouble and instructing me to do all those
                                          things... when he could have done it himself.</em></p>
              <p><em>Not long later I had a meditation experience... he informed
                                          me it is due to my merits ripening due to a particular instance of explaining the dharma to
                                          someone some time ago. He informed me there is a direct causal
                                          relation. When asked how does he know that merits is important for
                                          experience and realization, he simply says this is his experience.
                                          He says it may not make a lot of sense to a dualistic mind, but
                                          this is how it (dependent origination) works.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Today he no longer makes me explain this and that to others, since I am in a much better position to explain myself based on my insight and experience. But even today he said one of the reasons that contributed to my quick progression of insight is the merits accrued by actively participating in Dharma discussions... apart from the practice and establishment of right view.</p>

              <p>There are other factors that is important... you must have right view. If you participate in dharma discussion, but your view is not really strong, then it is not very effective... in worse case it is like the blind leading the blind.</p>

              <p>thank you for your advice. Based on your model, i should be following the gradual path though i am quite enthusiatic about trying the self-inquiry too. But just wondering how i should be balancing both.</p>
              <p>my teachers are in the Tibetan Buddhist traditions. There are many of them, i can't pin down to just one main teacher. But in terms of the path of discovering the mind-essence, it can be said to be one or two particular Nyingma teachers (they are not well-known). I could send you the names in private but i dun think it will make much difference</p>
              <p>my present slant is towards non-sectarian and openness, freedom of too much religio-political or school concepts... the truth should be like that. All phenomenon can be my teacher.</p>

              <p>I see... If you wish to take up self-inquiry, then do self-inquiry as much as possible. Let it grow into a big ball of doubt.</p>
              <p>The advice here is good:</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.hsuyun.org/chan/en/essays/bychuanzhi/759-huatoupractice.html">http://www.hsuyun.org/chan/en/essays/bychuanzhi/759-huatoupractice.html</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <ol>
              <li><strong>Select a <em>hua-tou</em>.</strong>  If you like Pure Land practices, 
              choose the first one, if one of the others seems to hit a meaningful 
              target, choose that one. Once you choose your <em>hua-tou</em>, stick with
               it and don’t switch to another one.  If you are concerned that you may 
              have chosen the wrong one, that’s the ego interfering with things. Don’t
               let it manipulate you!  Once you get going with the practice you’ll 
              come to see that they are all the same and you can use any of them and 
              even come up with your own, but when starting out, it’s essential to 
              work with only one.</li>
              <li><strong>“Lock in” your <em>hua-tou</em>.</strong>  If you have a regular sitting meditation schedule (always a good idea!), use this <em>hua-tou</em> for your entire sitting period.  Focus your entire being on it.  Don’t 
              give in and give yourself some artificial answer to the question like “I
               am just sitting here trying to figure out this <em>hua-tou</em>.”  Open 
              your mind, allow great doubt to overwhelm you.  Perform this “lock in” 
              session daily for three weeks.  After that time the <em>hua-tou</em> will 
              be firmly implanted in your mind and will be with you all the time, to 
              greater or lesser degrees depending on what you are doing.</li>
              <li><strong>Let the <em>hua-tou</em> consume you</strong> day and night but push it 
              back when you have to do things that take concentration in other areas –
               caring for a child, driving a car, typing an email, etc.  Just because 
              it’s not at the center focus of attention doesn’t mean it’s not still 
              working on you.  I liken this to an experience we’ve probably all had – 
              we lose a key or something else of importance and spend a long time 
              looking for it without success.  In frustration, we finally give up and 
              do something else, but a few hours or days later we have a <em>eureka</em> <em>moment</em> and suddenly know where to find it, and there it is.  The question of 
              where it was had lingered in the back of our minds even though it wasn’t
               dominant in our attention.  The <em>hua-tou</em> does this too.  Work the <em>hua-tou</em> intensely whenever you are doing something that doesn’t take a great 
              deal of attention, like washing dishes, walking down the street or along
               a mountain path, getting dressed, etc. Apply it to whatever you are 
              doing.  If you find yourself forgetting to attend to it, just bring your
               mind back to it non-judgmentally.  The amount of effort it takes to 
              force yourself to do it will lessen as you continue the practice. In a 
              short time the practice will happen automatically.</li>
              <li><strong>Be merciless!</strong> If you feel the <em>hua-tou</em> practice is not working for you, ask yourself “Who is it who thinks the <em>hua-tou</em> practice is not working?”  Your mind can be your worst enemy with this 
              practice and can sabotage even the best of intentions.  When it fights 
              you, turn the <em>hua-tou</em> back onto it.  Be merciless!</li>
              <li><strong>Observe the results of practice. </strong>Notice as you do the 
              practice how your mind becomes stronger, your attention more keen, your 
              awareness more expansive.  You will also find that the practice itself 
              changes, first in subtle ways, and later in more dramatic ways. </li>
              <li><strong>Take the practice seriously, but lightly.</strong>  It should not be a chore or a burden but something to enjoy doing (although perhaps in a somewhat perverse way!) . </li>
              <li><strong>Avoid preconceptions.</strong> Everyone has his or her own experiences
               to tell about this practice.  Don’t develop expectations of what will 
              happen for you based on accounts from others.</li>

              <p>Thanks! i think this 'self-inquiry' is also a technique used in Dzogchen too. I read it somewhere from an author practising under Lama Surya Das's lineage, John Maransky or something like that.</p>

              <p>Yes I know Lama Surya Das equates Dzogchen's rushan (separating rigpa from sems) with self-inquiry Hindu style.</p>
              <p>I'm not too sure if traditional Dzogchen teaches rushan this way, maybe one day I'll find out when I have access to those teachings. Lama Surya Das used to learn under a Hindu master so it could have influences from there.</p>
