              <p>Happy Lunar Year to you, bohiruci! Happy and Blissful year ahead!</p>
              <p>Often conflicts ensue within family due to less inhibitions towards each others. Both sides often take each other for granted.</p>
              <p>Let me relate to you of someone I knew of during my NS days. There this guy called storeman Foo(may you be born into a higher realm),he is also smiling and eager to joke around. He was never without his smile and jovial attitude, and always get away with a lot things. Anyway, one day while in the Encik's office, I think the CSM was angry with storeman Foo and wanted to punish Foo. But  however he tried, he could never raise the temperature inside the room for him to be angry enough to mete out punishment. Storeman disarmed his anger by never allowing to caught in the tension and as such he was let off with a verbal remand, even the CSM can't help but try to hide his smile.</p>
              <p>Hopefully, one can adopt a giving and jovial attitude when dealing with parents.</p>
              <p>Hope you may meet with people whom you can develop  a constant mindfulness and a loving kindness  towards  them. Communicate with them only when both parties are not angry.</p>

              <p>He has to be firm  without resorting to being overly confrontational.</p>
              <p>Ask your friend to call the hotline as suggested by Mr Milo, do not involved the parents until a clearer idea on how to deal with the addiction can reached. Usually , to borrow from them loanshark need a guarantor. If debt is affordable, settle it and inform the loansharks  and guarantor not to offer anymore  loans otherwise the authorities will be invoked! </p>

              <p>The problem surfaced after his father retired, no longer has the means to support his gambling habits. His CPF and money from selling his house have been used up recently. I don't think he wants to call the hotline because he said he does not feel like talking about his parents anymore. He said the only way is to sever ties with them.</p>

              <p>Yeah, may be I can tell him to try talking to his elder relatives. He told me his father gambled since young but his luck was good when he was younger. His father always told him that he gambled to bring him up.</p>
              <p>I will try telling him that, see whether his father wants to seek treatment but I doubt so because old folks always do not want to admit they have problems.</p>

              <p>my mother likes to kpo. everything also kpo until I find it very irritating. she cant seem to keep secrets, so any secrets I do not intend to divuldge I do not share with her. some of her little habits cant stand her as well.</p>
