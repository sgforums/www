              Mughal Emperor Akbar, the Sangh Parivar has now raised questions about the
              legacy of Emperor Ashoka. A publication backed by the RSS has claimed that
              Ashoka’s conversion to Buddhism and his promotion of ahimsa opened India’s

              played a seditious role by assisting Greek invaders thinking they would destroy
              “Vedic religion” and pave the way for dominance of Buddhism.</span></p>

              became the reason for India’s decline…we worshiped him as great…It would have
              been better if, like Bhagwan Buddha, Emperor Ashoka too, would give up his
              kingdom, become a monk and promote Buddhism…(then) India would not have had to

              empire into a giant monastery for promoting Buddhism. It was because of the
              Buddhist leaders of Magadha that Greek invaders returned to conquer
              India…Buddhist monks propagated seditious, senseless, anti-India ideas among
              their disciples that Buddhism did not believe in caste or nation. Whenever
              foreign invaders sympathetic to Buddhism attacked India, these Buddhists
              colluded with them, instead of fighting them bravely.”</span></p>

              <p>Emperor Asoka's Mauryan empire was at it height during his reign.</p>
              <p>It did not ended until fifty years after his death. The last emperor of the Mauryan empire was assassinated by his Brahmin general who founded the Shunga dynasty.</p>
              <p>It was the after the fall of the Mauryan empire that  Indo-Greeks invaded India. It could be as easily been said that a Brahminic dynasty allowed the foreign invasion into the sub continent!</p>

              <p>As a sub continent, it is actually a amalgam of different nations. India has officially 23 languages including English. Unlike China, which was unified as a single country with one official written and official spoken language very early on.</p>
              <p>Ancient Indian sub continent was somewhat shielded by the Hindu Kush. The earliest invaders were supposedly the Aryans of the Vedic culture. Then the most famous is  Alexander the Great. </p>
              <p>The largest extant of the Chinese empire was during the Tang dynasty. Just imagine the famous Tang poet Li Bai was born in Chinese ruled Kyrgyzstan.</p>
              <p>However, China was also fragmented and reunified couple of times.</p>
