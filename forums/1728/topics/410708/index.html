              <p>Hi guilty,</p>
              <p>You should treat this as part of the learning process of life that we (or most, or many) all have to go through. There is no need to live in guilt but learn from these experiences so that we will not make the same mistakes in the future. I and friends also had bad experiences with alcohol. These kind of things actually quite common... there is no need to dwell on it, but most importantly both parties must learn the lesson (e.g. the girl should learn to avoid binge drinking, and the other parties should learn not to offer people alcoholic drinks. especially as Buddhists we should avoid alcohol) Anyway, ladies generally have less alcohol tolerance (due to body weight etc) than male.</p>
              <p>Learn to live in the Present... the amazing thing we call Life. In fact we already always are living in the present, just that we keep dwelling on our thoughts and memories and miss the aliveness of this moment, which is blissful.</p>
              <p>The thing is already over, don't make things worse by imagining and dwelling in illusions.</p>

              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>I have made another mistake which i would like to share / or maybe get some opinions on how to salvate the situation,</p>
              <p><br>I am a buddhist but i went to those sleezy KTV louges with those freelance gals who sit with you for tips, one gals seat beside me and because we ordered beer, i ask her to drink, she pick up a empty cup and had 2 glasses with my friends, after that she went off to other rooms, when she came back, she was very drunk and wanted to drink somemore, i told her to drink water but she refused and wanted some more beer, we gave her a bit, after which she wanted to vomit and i escorted her to the toilet, after coming back, ahe wanted to go other room to collect $, afterwhich we left the place.</p>
              <p>During the trip back, i started feeling guilty for asking her to drink which could have made her drunk, i call her and she say she is alright, but i still feel not good as i start imagine what could happen to her when we left like could she have been raped or get hiv, could i be indirect involed.</p>
              <p>Eversince, this has badly affected my life living in guilt and fear of bad karma, and feel i am responsible if anything happen. I called her many times to ask her how she is,</p>
              <p>Now i understand the importance of the 5 precept, and why we should not drink at all, it will make a people say some things without careful consideration and regret terribly later</p>
              <p>Before i went there i thought drinking is okay if you know your limit and can control your action, now then i know when you drink, you could unknowingly ask someone to drink with you</p>
              <p>This is the lesson i learnt, now i have to leave in guilt</p>

              <p>Amituofo,</p>
              <p>i was wondering how u recieved the precepts. to wat i know, as a layperson, u can select those precepts that u can abide accordingly to your career. if ur career need u to go out with client and need to drink, u can first opt out the drinking precept for the time being. one can just abide one of the precept and it's already very powerful. gradually then overcome.</p>

              <p>Hi guilty,</p>
              <p>Being too guilty is also not good. From your past posts I can see that you are dwelling too much on the past and causing unnecessary stress for yourself which can lead to depression.</p>
              <p>Go easy on yourself and try to focus on some of the positive things about yourself... you certainly have changed a lot from these incidents for the better. You are now able to understand the importance of precepts, etc. In fact... I still have a lot to learn from you.</p>
              <p>Don't always go into the past... Whenever you have spare time (and even in the midst of busy-ness), learn to be present, submerge yourself (let go of yourself) into the everyday mundane and ordinary experience of seeing, hearing, smelling, and you'll realize how wonderful and blissful and extraordinary that ordinary aliveness is. If you are able to realize and experience pure consciousness, you'll be freed from identification with a mental story, you will be willing to drop all that 'me-stories' and live in Actuality which is absent of a separate self.</p>
              <p>I can say I am not a perfect person, but I choose never to live in attachments and guilt, but in Actuality. I do not identify myself as my past or future or notion of present, but as Pure Presence/Consciousness, which is all there is - even a memory of past or projection of future are mere thoughts arising in and as Presence/Consciousness.</p>
              <p>I highly recommend the book (not just to you but everyone, it is a spiritual classic and NY times bestseller): "The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment" by Eckhart Tolle, available in almost all bookstores. It is a life changing book.</p>

The elder monk quickly fell asleep while the younger one twisted around, unable to calm his mind. Finally, he woke up the elder monk and reprimanded him for what happened during the day, "As monks, we are supposed to keep away from women. I am really ashamed and troubled by what you did today!"<br><br>The elder monk looked at his friend and a smile broke up on his face, "Oh, so that has been bothering you! Brother, I have left the girl behind by the river bank, why are you still carrying her around?"</blockquote>/\</div>

              <p>Just like dressing sexily may provoke sexual attention, it does not warrant the violence of rape. You may want to label them as immoral, but please do not infer that it is alright to do them violence.

              and wanted some more beer, we gave her a bit, after which she
              wanted to vomit and i escorted her to the toilet, after coming
              back, ahe wanted to go other room to collect $, afterwhich we left
              the place.</p>
              <p>During the trip back, i started feeling guilty for asking her to
              drink which could have made her drunk, i call her and she say she
              is alright, but i still feel not good as i start imagine what could
              happen to her when we left like could she have been raped or get
              hiv, could i be indirect involed.</p>
              <p>Eversince, this has badly affected my life living in guilt and
              fear of bad karma, and feel i am responsible if anything happen. I
              called her many times to ask her how she is,</p>
              <p>Now i understand the importance of the 5 precept, and why we
              should not drink at all, it will make a people say some things
              without careful consideration and regret terribly later</p>
              <p>Before i went there i thought drinking is okay if you know your
              limit and can control your action, now then i know when you drink,
              you could unknowingly ask someone to drink with you</p>
              <p>This is the lesson i learnt, now i have to leave in guilt</p>

              <p>Please distinguish between consensual sex and rape. </p>
              <p>You do not force sex to one who is unwilling by the justification of them putting themselves into the situation. There are bouncers to remind you of that !  </p>
              <p>Just like dressing sexily may provoke sexual attention, it does not warrant the violence of rape. You may want to label them as immoral, but please do not infer that it is alright to do them violence. This is the excuse that many self righteous, including the holier than thou impose on others !</p>
              <p>Don't ever justify rape ! And please respect a woman as a person, right to her own life, it is not for you to judge and impose,not in Singapore anyway.</p>

              <p>its a good question to hit at many parts of the system...</p>
              <p>if such profession affects the morals of the society....dun we think it is for the system to stop it than for us to mumble abt it? .... why it has not done so? for fear of increase in rape? </p>
              <p>such that if smoking is so bad...the system find all despicable means to make things difficult for smokers....such a smart system should already devise ways to make it difficult for such profession to exist...why has it not done so? </p>
              <p>the system can enforce everyone to do so many tings against their wish...what is prostitutes to them? what is stopping them to enforce on them like how they make things difficult for smokers or men? </p>

              <p>I did ask this question before. The answer I got was they are afraid  there will be more rape cases if prostitution is being stopped.</p>
