              <p>:( unfortunately, thats not the root of the problem. The root of the problem is media and education. They are too lax with what is showing in the media.</p>
              <p> Nowadays, turn on the tv and you get all kinds of shows planting seeds of lust in your head. Go to most of the movies they are still showing these kind of things.

Basically they need to clamp down these things. Mediacorp hasn't been doing a good job. It's no wonder we get more and more perverts.</p>
              <p>In terms of education, they teach kids on these things at a young age. This is also wrong. Why do they need to know about these things? Young kids are suppose to study and learn morals and virtues but yet they hardly teach them these. Instead they teach them rubbish they just promote more social problems. The education system is bankrupt. Morals and virtues have gone down the drain.</p>

              <p>very much agreed and sad to say, kids nowadays can't get past this problem.  I talk to some people about it, they say that they have nothing else to entertain the kid with. Only TV keep them occupied and quiet...  well, we live in a age of incredible speed. how to change this, i really don't know... when i was young, i could play by myself with make-believe things and enjoy reading story-books and life was really idyllic, there was the luxury of time, which nowadays many people don't seem to have.  Now kids rush for tuition, classes, they are so stressed and their system is so worked up and hectic that even when resting, they can't stop the speediness and have to watch TV to keep distracted etc.  Really no time to really rest the mind.  It's quite bad situation nowadays. Frankly speaking, i won't want to be a child in such times all over again.</p>

              <p>Hi terminator,</p>
              <p>It  is not so good in my opinon to go to such
                  places, it better to get into a proper relationship out of love and
                  respect, as the above post say if there is no such preverted
                  man like us, maybe they will be no demand to do this job.</p>
              <p>I guess girls do these job as they find it good and "easy"
                  money</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>If you do not feel comfortable with such places, avoid it. Also the company you keep, do you feel compelled do the "manly" thing.</p>
              <p>Why do you expect to be able to find love and respect from such places, when smiles and wiles are traded for money?!</p>
              <p>Also understand your sexuality, it is one of our  primal urges,(ren yo san ji) it what perpetuates the world, what drives you to achieve the 5Cs among others. You will become aware of it the moment you become a teenager, and does'nt really go away. It is when you start seeing a female person in sexual context.</p>
              <p>You feel uncomfortable because of conflicting emotions between desires and proper moral conduct, maybe even attraction to someone in that profession.</p>
              <p>As long it does not become a preoccupation, an obsession, it is normal. However, you are looking to enlightenment, then it may become an obstruction. </p>

              <p>This 3D world will forever be reserved as a world of duality for people to learn how to handle problems such what TS brought up. To expect this world to be completely free of vices and situations that test one's sense of right/wrong is unrealistic. It's far more important that people learn what to do and how to manage themselves in such situations.</p>

              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>I have made another mistake which i would like to share / or maybe get some opinions on how to salvate the situation,</p>
              <p><br>I am a buddhist but i went to those sleezy KTV louges with those freelance gals who sit with you for tips, one gals seat beside me and because we ordered beer, i ask her to drink, she pick up a empty cup and had 2 glasses with my friends, after that she went off to other rooms, when she came back, she was very drunk and wanted to drink somemore, i told her to drink water but she refused and wanted some more beer, we gave her a bit, after which she wanted to vomit and i escorted her to the toilet, after coming back, ahe wanted to go other room to collect $, afterwhich we left the place.</p>
              <p>During the trip back, i started feeling guilty for asking her to drink which could have made her drunk, i call her and she say she is alright, but i still feel not good as i start imagine what could happen to her when we left like could she have been raped or get hiv, could i be indirect involed.</p>
              <p>Eversince, this has badly affected my life living in guilt and fear of bad karma, and feel i am responsible if anything happen. I called her many times to ask her how she is,</p>
              <p>Now i understand the importance of the 5 precept, and why we should not drink at all, it will make a people say some things without careful consideration and regret terribly later</p>
              <p>Before i went there i thought drinking is okay if you know your limit and can control your action, now then i know when you drink, you could unknowingly ask someone to drink with you</p>
              <p>This is the lesson i learnt, now i have to leave in guilt</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I see that the freelance girl insists on drinking and it is no fault of yours. It is good that you reflect on your situation and contemplate on the logic behind the 5th precepts. However, i see your worry and feeling guilt as unnecessary burden. It is not a way of purging your sin or past mistakes. Sometime to truly learn is... to learn from mistakes.</p>
              <p>May you be Well and Happy</p>
