              <p>Nope,</p>
              <p>since all of us have the ability to let go and gain attachments, why do we still turn to religion, become monk or nuns when all it takes is the will to do so?</p>
              <p>To me, it is extremely pointless to pursue symbolic acts</p>
              <p>i prefer meaningful actions and thoughts</p>

              <p>Hi Mr Milo ,</p>
              <p>i would like to say you are mistaken abt Monk and nun</p>
              <p>In Buddhism there is no "calling upon " to be a monk or nun</p>
              <p>ascetism entails a higher level of discipline and expectation from the community of the Buddhist at large</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Although i agree people in the past run to the monastery due to relationship problem with bgr ..but nowadays people understand that the monks and nuns are to guide us when we are "part-time" in our practice</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>its never a form of escapism in Buddhism to be a monk becos monkhood or nunhood is a very tough life than in the secular world</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Waking up 4am to chant and going to bed at 930pm require alot of discipline and concentrate on the path of practice as the offering of the lay community is not given as granted ..</p>

              <p>to renounce and be a monk is not an easy decision, esp when the monk has to observe 200 plus precepts in the monastic order. the monk also have to study the teachings and meditation.</p>

              <p>Monkhood is definitely not cowardice, but rather it needs more courage than any other ordinary people to actually renounce their worldly life to pursue something much more meaningful, to seek spiritual truth and liberation for oneself and others.</p>
              <p>Rather than escaping the world, monks usually are actively involved in helping lay people on their problems and teaching them the Dharma.</p>

              <p>I do agree with u tthat monks help out -  the question is whether he (the monk/nun) is <strong>free of all the</strong> trappings of organized religion,habits, rituals, traditions and so on so forth .... and only then  can he/she free others.

              <p>The centre of one'self' is always the awareness of the <strong>unsel</strong>f (ego-disidentification) so as long as one is UNself conscious one does not need a path, cos there is no path.

              <p>So for me the courage is not to be a monk or nun but rather be able ( the ability) to fulfil one's role eg as a father, brother, sister, professsor , driver .... and yet come home to one's being, one's essential being - unaccumulating expereinces, roles  ... and one is always free, that is, one partakes of the world in many ways, roles, responsibilities, sharing and yet one is inwardly detached.</p>

              <p>I have to agree with you. Conditionings cannot ultimately liberate a person, so I am not drawn to things like rituals, etc. But I do admit that some people find them useful to certain extents. They are just skillful means. As for monkhood: if it truly helps one's spiritual development and help others, why not, I know of monks who became far more useful to society and could devote more time to their own practice and the work of spreading dharma after renunciation. But again I am not suggesting it is necessary, since many enlightened persons I personally know and met are lay-men.</p>
              <p>Scriptures actually help in one's spiritual development, only if there is misunderstanding of scripture without proper guidance that one falls into error. However the scripture is just a pointer, what is important is to practice what the scripture says and realise them for ourselves.</p>
              <p>Regarding the I AM/Beingness you talked about, very often it is understood that beingness is in the experience of "I AM", even without the words and label of "I AM", the 'pure sense of existence', the presence still IS. It is a state of resting in Beingness.<br><br>But in Buddhism, it is also possible to experience everything, every moment the unmanifested.<br><br>The key also lies in 'You' but it is to "see" that there is no 'You' instead. It is to 'see' that there is never any do-er standing in the midst of phenomenal arising. There is just mere happening due to emptiness nature, never an 'I' doing anything. When the 'I' subsides, symbols, labels and the entire layer of conceptual realm goes with it. What is left without a 'doer' is a mere happening.<br><br>And seeing, hearing, feeling, tasting and smelling and not only that, everything appears as purely spontaneous manifestation. A whole Presence of the manifold. :)</p>

              <p>Hmmm...just wondering</p>
              <p>how does one undo all attachments to oneself or to others when all it takes is the will and determination to make it happen?</p>
              <p>if so, then why need become a monk or nun?...all these attachments have always been with us, so why do we still pursue such...(forgive me) symbolic acts?</p>
              <p>especially those who are not monks or nuns...they are able to let go and gain attachments easily</p>

              <p>Actually, the purpose is to be free from suffering in this very life, and many practioners, monks included but lay-men included also, achieved this goal in this very life.</p>
              <p>Also if that person did not achieve enlightenment in this lifetime, it doesn't mean he would achieve enlightenment in the next. But the practice continues.</p>
              <p>Also the Buddhist goal is not to reborn in a realm of heaven as even that is temporary and subject to impermanence. The Buddhist goal is to end the uncontrolled cycle of rebirth and suffering. So we do not look to the next life to be free of suffering. Any future births as more bondage.</p>
