We want more of what ever we can gain.  Life is empty but not meaningless.  Feeling emptyness is good, you understand and see thing in a better prospective.  Once you take up dhama course, you will see your real intention of life.  The realistic of life.<br><br>When 'I' was young, my wish is to become a monk and devoted to public assistance.  Somehow, 'I' was obstructed by barrier.  But with a mindful attitude, current am able to continue 'my' task.<br><br>Yes, you may still gain and appreciate buddhism even you are not renounced. There are many good example. one of them is Mr. Lee Block Guan.  To renounce you need certain quality and quantity in a person.  and with such high quality, many are unable to attain.</div>
