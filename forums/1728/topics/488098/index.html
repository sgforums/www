              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>In the light of the proposed
                  changes to the Constitution of Sri Lanka now under consideration and growing
                  accusations of contrived attempts via the proposed new Article 33 to neutralise
                  the applicability of Article 9 in the Constitution that imposes a mandatory
                  duty on the State to give to Buddhism the foremost place and protect and foster
                  the Buddha Sasana, while assuring to all religions the rights granted by
                  Articles 10 and 14(1)(e), an important question has arisen What is the
                  relationship that should exist in the present day between the State and
                  Buddhism?</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>It is an incontrovertible fact
                  that Buddhism, more than other ideology or religion, has played a singular role
                  in creating an unique civilization and shaping the destinies of this country.
                  Sri Lanka is the oldest Buddhist nation in the world. If not for the
                  continuance of the Dhamma, through the study and practice of it in this
                  country, it is unlikely that there would even be a semblance of pure Sasana in
                  Thailand, Myanmar, Laos, or Cambodia. It is in Sri Lanka that the Wheel of the
                  Buddha’s law was truly set in motion with the arrival of Arahant Mahinda with
                  the blessings of that great universal monarch, Emperor Asoka. If this event did
                  not take place in Sri Lanka, the Pali Canon may not have got recorded and the
                  noble doctrine of the Buddha, recited and accepted by the Arahats, at Rajagaha,
                  Vesali and Pataliputta, i.e. three Great Councils of the Arya Sangha, would
                  have vanished into thin air long ago.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>Arahant Mahinda not only
                  introduced the Dhamma but he also taught it in such a manner that it soon
                  became the overriding element in all the activities of our people in the past,
                  enthused them to develop an altogether new culture, which has become the basis
                  of the social  outlook of the vast majority of our people even to this
                  day. Such is the hold of the Dhamma so ingrained in almost every facet of this
                  country that the Buddhist public very rightly feel that it is something they
                  cannot do without as it is now representative of their life blood, more or
                  less.  The day the Buddha Dhamma is abandoned or allowed to fade or wither
                  away with the removal of patronage of our rulers and the protection afforded by
                  the Constitution which was also explicitly set out in Article 5 of the Kandyan
                  Convention of 1815,  that is the day this country would have truly lost
                  its very soul.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>In the pre-colonial period the
                  Sinhalese Monarch protected the Buddha Sasana and maintained its purity as one
                  of his primary duties. He exercised his power and authority over the religion
                  to prevent schisms and heretical interpretations of the Dhamma.   He
                  invoked the dasa raja dhamma” as a basis of governance. He developed an Animal
                  Friendly Cultural Heritage which is unique to Sri Lanka. The tenet ‘compassion
                  to all living beings’  based on the Buddha’s words in the Karaniya Metta
                  Sutra was heavily influential in the choice of both vocation and diet.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>When foreigners came to this
                  country beginning in 1505 they found the Buddhists united and strong. To weaken
                  this unity they adopted every means to divide them. The post – independent Sri
                  Lanka has a fundamental obligation to strengthen the status of Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>It is our historical track record
                  of service to the cause of Buddhism that has shaped our national identity and
                  brought universal recognition to this country and still continues to do so.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.231;">It therefore falls on the current
                  and future generations to ensure that Buddhism continues to flourish in Sri
                  Lanka and that the State performs its historic public duty, as enshrined in the
                  National Constitution, to extend patronage, protection and foster Buddhism both
                  within and outside the country. Any attempt directly or indirectly through
                  tampering with the Constitution to stalemate the applicability of Article 9
                  which gives foremost place to Buddhism is fraught with grave danger to peaceful
                  co – existence among various communities in Sri Lanka.</span></p>
