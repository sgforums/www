            <div class='col-md body'>I bought them from Taka Kinokuniya under Buddhism section.<br><br>About the Golden Letter. It is a very important book. It contains the transmission by Garab Dorje to his principal disciple before dissapearing in the body of light. This book also attempt to connect western concept of ascension with Dzogchen teaching. Here we can see that how far modern Church-based Christianity has gone off course. No offence to anyone. But Western mysticism is still very similar to Buddhism especially Vajrayana.<br><br>About Dzogchen, to me, it is a very mysterious teaching. There are 2 versions of Dzogchen... Buddhist and Bon. Both are essentially the same. However, Bon teaching originates from a Buddha before our historical Buddha. Accordingly, this Buddha call Tonpa Shenrab lived thousands of years ago before our historical Shakyamuni Buddha. Also, Dzogchen teaching is said to be taught in 13 other star-systems as well, to both humans and non-humans.<br><br>It seems periodically, there are lineages of physical Buddhas that teaches the same thing. Regardless, all teachings are said to originate from one source Dharmakaya Samanthahadra.<br></div>
