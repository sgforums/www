              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              practice of mindfulness-awareness meditation does not take place in a vacuum.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Meditation
              Alone Is Not Enough</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">We
              all have preconceptions, we all have points of view. Not only do we have ideas,
              but we have opinions and countless judgments, especially about other people. We
              may hope to free ourselves from such a tangle, but usually what we find is that
              we just exchange one set of preconceptions for another. Is meditation enough?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              practice of mindfulness-awareness meditation does not take place in a vacuum.
              It happens within a certain context and point of view. In the Buddhist
              tradition, meditation is often presented in the context of view, meditation,
              and action. Each of these three is essential, as a system of checks and
              balances.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">VIEW</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">If
              we do not understand the view, the practice of meditation can be more of a trap
              than means of freeing ourselves from deception. Without an understanding of
              nontheism and the motivation to benefit others, meditation practice can
              degenerate into self-absorption and escapism. Rather than loosening our
              ego-clinging, it could further perpetuate our ignorance and grasping.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Meditation
              practice is a way of loosening our solidity.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Rather
              than connecting us to our world, it could draw us away from it. Meditation
              practice could even be a tool of aggression, a way of clearing the mind before
              going out to commit our next murder. Meditation in and of itself is no magical
              cure-all. Proper understanding and proper motivation are important. The view
              informs the practice.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Likewise,
              meditation balances view. Meditation practice is a way of loosening our
              solidity. Without practice, even the most inspired view can become rigid
              ideology. The practice of meditation brings out the futility and limitations of
              holding any rigid view.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">We
              see the nature of our attachment to particular viewpoints, and the simplicity
              of letting such views dissolve. The irony is that the proper motivation and
              view are essential, and at the same time, it is also essential not to grasp any
              view.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">ACTION</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Action,
              the third component, is a balance to both view and meditation. Meditation does
              not matter that much if it has no effect on the rest of our life. Likewise, we
              could be filled with empty words that do not lead to any change whatsoever in
              our life or our relationship with others. We need to act on our understanding
              and our awareness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Action,
              like view and meditation, does not stand alone. Action without clarity of view
              is blundering and apt to cause more harm than good. And action without
              meditation tends to be speedy and complex, rather than spaciousness and simple.
              But if these three factors are in balance, clarity of view and meditative
              awareness permeate all our activities.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              the Buddhist path we are bringing together our actions, our view, and our
              practice. It is a balance of awareness, insight, and action, working
              harmoniously together. In that way our energy is no longer divided or
              scattered, but we are fully present in whatever we do. That is what it means to
              be a genuine human being.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              Buddhism, the point is not simply to be accomplished meditators but to change
              our whole approach to life. Meditation is not merely a useful technique or
              mental gymnastic, but part of a balanced system designed to change the way we
              go about things at the most fundamental level. In this context, it is a way of
              exposing and uprooting the core problems of grasping and ego-clinging that
              separate us from one another and cause endless pain.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">NOT
              JUST MEDITATION</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">There
              are many varieties of meditation and many different contexts in which it
              occurs. Even within the Buddhist tradition, there are many varieties of
              meditation and many differences of opinion as to what meditation is all about.
              Yet, wherever it turns up, it is colored by one set of preconceptions or
              another. Nowadays, people pluck techniques such as meditation from their
              traditional contexts, mix and match practices from very different traditions,
              and apply them in new settings.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              technique may be there, but there is no heart.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Meditation
              practice is increasingly presented in a secular way, free of religious
              trappings. In the United States, this tends to place it in the general category
              of self-help techniques. As a result, meditation has been de-mystified for many
              people, who see it as one aspect of a healthy lifestyle, like working out or
              eating healthy food.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Meditation
              is used as therapy, to calm people down, as healing (to lower blood pressure,
              for instance, or deal with pain), and even as a way to get ahead in business,
              or win at sports. It is gradually becoming part of the mainstream. This is not
              unlike what has happened to the practice of yoga, once viewed as a
              sophisticated system of spiritual training, and now offered regularly. The
              technique may be there, but there is no heart.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">There
              is a danger that the practice of meditation could be similarly reduced. The
              very technique designed to undermine the power of ego-fixation could become
              another feather in our ego-cap.</span></p>
