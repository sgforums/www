              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span class="date"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">May 24, 2015</span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;"> by <span class="fn"><a title="Ty Phillips" href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/dharmadad/author/thphillips/">Ty Phillips</a></span> <span class="post-comments1">Patheos</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;"> Anyone familiar with Mahayana Buddhism, is
              probably also familiar with the idea of the six realms of existence. In
              traditional setting of Buddhism (think Asia) these are easily accepted as
              literal realms of existence that interplay with the process of samsara and
              reincarnation. Understanding the western mindset and its lack of acceptance of
              reincarnation, the famed Tibetan teacher Chogyam Trungpa presented these realms
              as states of psychological or emotional existence within the human experience.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">While I am no Chogyam Trungpa, I think it is
              necessary to cast the net of this teaching over those unfamiliar with it. I
              think as science continues to enlighten us on the workings of the world, it
              behooves us to present these teachings in a way that is consistent with the
              scientific world. Skirting around reality is never what the Buddha intended, so
              much like science being a passionate search for truth, I think Buddhism is a
              passionate search for understanding the mind.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The six realms consist of the following; the
              hell realms, both hot and cold, the hungry ghost realm, the animal realm, the
              human realm, the demi god realm, and the god realm. When we look at these
              through traditional eyes, we see them each as a realm that we can be reborn in,
              based on our karma and collective merit. But as presented by Trungpa, they were
              realms of the mind; emotional states that we get stuck in or obsessed with.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The key to our liberation is seeing them for
              what they are and learning how to remain emotionally unattached to them. We
              free ourselves by not only accepting the truth of them, but taking a step back from
              them and loosening our grasp on our fixations.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The Hell Realms</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The hell realms are seen as most traditional
              hells are: burning with flames and freezing with ice. They are places where bad
              people go to receive punishment and spend time in agony and torment. Unlike
              western views of hell, in Buddhism, nothing is permanent. Our negative karma is
              burned away over a period of time and we are then reborn.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Psychologically though, living in a hell realm
              is akin to emotional torment. We are afraid, in pain, tormented, abused,
              neglected, and in every way, in a living hell. We cannot see hope or freedom in
              any direction. We spend our time secluded, hiding and emotionally tortured,
              afraid to affect the change that will free us. Many of us have probably felt
              this way at some point.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">We see life as something to escape from. We just
              want the suffering to end and no amount of kindness seems to get through to us.
              We doubt it, we fear it, we mistrust it. We assume that the helping hand must
              be laced with poison or further abuse in the end. We can see these as severe
              emotional illness, abusive relationships, situations of neglect and unless we
              are truly strong and ready, we often, sadly, succumb to our darkness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The Hungry Ghost Realms</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The hungry ghosts are usually portrayed as thin
              necked men and women with bloated bellies, sitting around a table of food and
              drink but unable to consume the nourishment. They can neither feed themselves,
              nor cooperate enough to feed each other. They lust unceasingly for what is just
              out of reach. Psychologically, these are people who suffer from emotional and
              chemical addictions. No matter how much they consume, they cannot create a
              salve that heals what ails them. No hit is ever enough, no drink strong enough,
              no relationship consuming enough.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">They always want more and even when they have
              it, they are unable to see it or take care of themselves enough emotionally to
              handle it when they do see it. They want, and they want, and they want, but
              apathy prevents them from respecting it when they finally have it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">This emotional state is also connected with
              greed. It is not the same kind of greed the wealthy have, but the greed that
              makes them obsessive and bitter, yet unwilling to put in the work. They look at
              everyone with resentful eye, wanting what other have bitter that they don’t
              possess it, but again, apathy keeps them bound in a state of emotional
              starvation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The Animal Realm</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">More than any other realm, I have noticed this
              one looked at and talked about with the most confusion. How can animals be bad?
              How can we say that our loving dog or cat, the precious baby monkey or tiger is
              less than us? Is a negative state to be looked down upon? This is actually not
              at all what is being said, at least not by any teacher with a good
              understanding of the teaching and the world around them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Animals are amazing and wonderful creatures.
              They can be loving and loyal, mysterious and funny. They can be our best
              friends or like a spider, which is a nightmare to many. What the animal realm
              represents is an inability to free oneself from suffering. Even a cursory look
              at any slaughter house would make it clear that this is not a fun or rewarding
              life.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Animals are largely mistreated, hunted,
              slaughtered, poached, and live lives filled with kill or be killed, run away or
              be eaten. It is hardly the life of luxury that many of us experience when we
              walk to the fridge and make a deli meat sandwich. It is an emotional state too
              clouded by doubt and fear of the world around them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">We see this in people afraid to act, afraid to
              take control over their situation and move forward. It is both an unwillingness
              and lack of understanding on how to change. Many times, even when the change is
              presented and opened for them, they remain afraid and complacent within their
              situation, clinging to the suffering they are used to, instead of embracing the
              uncertainty of the happiness they don’t yet know.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The Human Realm</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The human realm is the realm where everything is
              possible. We are neither too repressed or too distracted by fame and glitter.
              We have found a balance between work and leisure, reason and emotion. We have
              stumbled upon the middle path. This emotional state is open to searching for
              truth and posing the hard questions to ourselves.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">We are willing both to work for what we want,
              contribute from what we have, and still remain relatively unattached to
              distracting desires that lead to nowhere. We have seen both suffering and
              distraction for what they are and we want something better for ourselves and
              those we come in contact with.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">This state of equilibrium is not content just
              sitting back and worrying about ourselves. We have immersed ourselves in
              compassion and loving kindness and our motivation is now one of liberation for
              all beings. We reach out a loving hand for all, without expectation for gain or
              return. We are simply motivated by love. This emotional state makes us prime
              candidates for pursuing the path of the dharma.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">This realm or emotional state is unique and to
              be cherished. Unlike other states of being, we are neither stuck where we are,
              or totally comfortable remaining just as is. We embrace willingly, an open
              experience of all life and work to affect positive change for all. This is the
              path of true Dharma.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The Demi God Realm</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The demi gods live in semi luxury, arguing and
              competing amongst themselves for better positions and status. They view each
              other with constant mistrust and jealousy, and they are always keeping up with
              the proverbial Joneses.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">This is a state where we have more than enough
              but always feel the need to compete and improve our lives, if only to irk those
              around us. We are often motivated by the basest of feelings and stepping on
              others to get what we want is not unheard of. We don’t need a new car, but the
              neighbor just got a Porsche; to counter this, we buy one too, but a better
              model.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">We continue this trend in everything we do;
              better schools for our kids better colleges, better houses, boats, cars, lawns,
              pretending to help out those in need, but we do it only for the picture
              opportunity. Our concern starts and ends with what we see in the mirror and in
              our wallet. We remain distracted and unhappy even though we have every material
              comfort in the world.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">This realm is very much an exaggeration of the
              hungry ghost mentality. We are jealous and want to consume, but instead of
              having a lack of drive, we have a lack of control in knowing that we have more
              than enough. We have gold digger syndrome.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The God Realm</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The god realm is a state of complete physical
              freedom. We don’t have a care in the world and we are so well off, that we also
              become devoid of emotional capabilities. Our state is one of apathy to those
              hurting and those in need. We cannot be bothered by suffering because we have
              no concept of what it is.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">We view human life as something we can possess,
              mistreat and disregard. We influence political and religious trends with little
              more than a whim and a check. This emotional position makes us feel, well,
              godlike. We remain at a complete disconnect from the every encroaching moment
              of our death and even then, we still can’t be bothered by it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">This is a state of complete apathy where only
              our entertainment—no matter how vile it may be—is our only concern. We make a
              show of our disregard for the environment and those within it. We can neither
              be bothered nor touched by emotion and concern.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">When we look at these states, whether we see
              them as realms of rebirth or realms of emotional health, it is little wonder
              that the ancient teachers put so much focus on using the human realm for
              absolute good. They knew that life was fleeting and that concern and compassion
              only show up in those that are emotionally open to these states of being.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">It is easy to get lost in our fixations; too
              slovenly to care or too wealthy to even notice. Both of these states, like the
              others, end up at the same finish line. The middle path of the Buddha cannot be
              overstated in its health in all areas of life. Just like the porridge in the
              familiar Goldilocks and the Three Bears fable, it is neither too hot, nor too
              cold. We should reflect on these lessons well and continually watch for where
              we fall in this spectrum.</span></p>

              will come first.</span></p>

              <p>There is no science that disproves rebirth.</p>
              <p>Buddhism would be completely pointless if rebirth and other realms are not literal.<br><br>As Thusness said:</p>

              <h5><em><span><span>Life is like a
              passing cloud, when it comes to an end, a hundred years is like
              yesterday, like a snap of a finger. If it is only about one life,
              it really doesnt matter whether we are enlightened. The insight
              that the Blessed One has is not just about one life; countless
              lives we suffered, life after life, unending. Such is
              suffering.<br> <br> It is not about logic or science and there is really no point
              arguing in this scientific age. Take steps in practice and
              experience the truth of Buddhas words. Of the 3 dharma seals, the
              truth of suffering to me is most difficult to experience in
              depth.<br> <br> May all take Buddhas words seriously.<br> <br> ~ Thusness, 2006</span></span></em></h5>
