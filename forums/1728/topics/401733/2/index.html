              <p><br> It's just my personal advice to anyone truly wanting to connect
                                          with Creator/Source/God, to read less, analyse less,
                                          experience more, feel more. The connection needs to be made
                                          with your heart and mind combined, not your mind alone. A mind
                                          operating without the heart is only good for analysing academic
                                          papers and spiritual articles.</p>
              <p>Many writers out there on the Internet and bookstores have no
                                          clue what they are writing or talking about, as they have yet to
                                          experience it for themselves. Even for the few writers who have
                                          experienced themselves and know what they are writing about, many
                                          readers have no clue how to interpret what they are reading. Which
                                          is why the academic debates and battles over existence of
                                          Creator/Source/God is never-ending. At the end of the day, just
                                          believe what one is comfortable with. If one is meant to understand
                                          and experience something, he will be able to, somehow.</p>
              <p>Though I'm blunt here, I mean no offence to anyone. Just my
                                          honest sharing. :)</p>

              <p>I agree with you.</p>
              <p>But I think the TS already knows that the transcendental cannot be approached through logic, as when I asked him what he is refering to as 'God', he said <em>"can't remember any names sorry cos i just 
                                          happened to read
                                                                  some. i just mean the kinda 'God' that one 
                                          reaches <strong>in
                                                                  meditation</strong>? what's that kind of 'God' in that 
                                          context?"</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sometimes, it is good to offer pointers on how to directly experience the transcendental. Such pointers should of course come from someone who have already have that direct 'touch' of the essence.</p>
              <p>In fact, one thing I should stress is that it is not difficult to have that direct 'touch', insight and realisation of the divine. Many have that misconception. Many think that only those who sit in mountains and caves for many years are going to have any enlightenment.</p>
              <p>I dare say that if you practice hard, there is no reason you cannot have that realisation after a few months to a few years. Thusness too said this himself before, based on his own experience of course.</p>
              <p>Contemplating koan like 'before birth, who am I?', 'who am I?' is going to lead to that realisation pretty quickly. It took me slightly less than 2 years from the time I started on that koan to gain direct insight. And I wasn't even practicing hard :P (however I started meditation a few years prior to that, in 2005 in fact)</p>
              <p>However... the initial realisation is far from the end of the path. There is a process of deepening insight.</p>
              <p>But anyway what you said is very true...</p>
              <p><strong>read less, analyse less,
                                          experience more, feel more.</strong></p>
              <p>This is the essence of koan practice, or vipassana, or dzogchen, mahamudra, etc.... these insights tradition have all in common is a <strong>direct and attentive bare mode of observation that allows the seeing of
                   things as they are.</strong></p>
              <p>The 'direct' mode of attending to Truth is what is most important and what makes koan, vipassana, etc so successful.</p>

              <p>I am referring to the 'God' and 'Love' that are always talked about by spiritual teachers. Because some of us may be confused(like myself) when we think in terms of the personal God and romantic love.</p>

Love serves as the catalyst by which compassion exists and thusly develops. Contextually, compassion is defined as the wish that all beings might find both happiness and the causes of happiness...</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Love, here, means total unconditional love for all beings without any distinction or partiality. Love between men and women, and love for family and friends, is often possessive, exclusive, limited, and mixed with selfish feelings. There’s an expectation of getting back at least as much as one gives. Such love might seem quite deep, but it easily vanishes if it doesn’t live up to expectations. What’s more, the sort of love we feel for those close to us is often accompanied by a feeling of distance, or even hostility, towards ‘strangers’, and or those who could pose a threat to ourselves and to those we love... </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">True love and true compassion can be extended to our adversaries, while love and compassion mixed with attachment cannot include anyone we see as adversarial. Yet, true love cannot be polarized, restricted to one or two specific beings, or contaminated with partiality, as it should be completely disinterested, expecting nothing in return...</span></span></p>
