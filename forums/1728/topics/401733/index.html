              <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Buddhism and the God-idea</span></span></strong>
              <p><span style="color: #000066;">QUESTION: Do Buddhists believe in a god?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #990000;">ANSWER:</span> No, we do not. There are several reasons for this. The Buddha, like modern sociologists and psychologists, believed that religious ideas and especially the god idea have their origins in fear. The Buddha says:</p>
              <p>Gripped by fear men go to sacred mountains, sacred groves, sacred trees and shrines.</p>
              <p>Primitive man found himself in a dangerous and hostile world, the fear of wild animals, of not being able to find enough food, of injury or disease, and of natural phenomena like thunder, lightning and volcanoes was constantly with him. Finding no security, he created the idea of gods in order to give him comfort in good times, courage in times of danger and consolation when things went wrong. To this day, you will notice that people become more religious at times of crises, you will hear them say that the belief in a god or gods gives them the strength they need to deal with life. You will hear them explain that they believe in a particular god because they prayed in time of need and their prayer was answered. All this seems to support the Buddha’s teaching that the god-idea is a response to fear and frustration. The Buddha taught us to try to understand our fears, to lessen our desires and to calmly and courageously accept the things we cannot change. He replaced fear, not with irrational belief but with rational understanding.</p>
              <p>The second reason the Buddha did not believe in a god is because there does not seem to be any evidence to support this idea. There are numerous religions, all claiming that they alone have god’s words preserved in their holy book, that they alone understand god’s nature, that their god exists and that the gods of other religions do not. Some claim that god is masculine, some that she is feminine and others that it is neuter. They are all satisfied that there is ample evidence to prove the existence of their god but they laugh in disbelief at the evidence other religions use to prove the existence of another god. It is not surprising that with so many different religions spending so many centuries trying to prove the existence of their gods that still no real, concrete, substantial or irrefutable evidence has been found. Buddhists suspend judgement until such evidence is forthcoming.</p>
              <p>The third reason the Buddha did not believe in a god is that the belief is not necessary. Some claim that the belief in a god is necessary in order to explain the origin of the universe. But this is not so. Science has very convincingly explained how the universe came into being without having to introduce the god-idea. Some claim that belief in god is necessary to have a happy, meaningful life. Again we can see that this is not so. There are millions of atheists and free-thinkers, not to mention many Buddhists, who live useful, happy and meaningful lives without belief in a god. Some claim that belief in god’s power is necessary because humans, being weak, do not have the strength to help themselves. Once again, the evidence indicates the opposite. One often hears of people who have overcome great disabilities and handicaps, enormous odds and difficulties through their own inner resources, through their own efforts and without belief in a god. Some claim that god is necessary in order to give man salvation. But this argument only holds good if you accept the theological concept of salvation and Buddhists do not accept such a concept. Based on his own experience, the Buddha saw that each human being had the capacity to purify the mind, develop infinite love and compassion and perfect understanding. He shifted attention from the heavens to the heart and encouraged us to find solutions to our problems through self-understanding.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #000066;">QUESTION: But if there are no gods how did the universe get here?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #990000;">ANSWER:</span> All religions have myths and stories which attempt to answer this question. In ancient times, when man simply did not know, such myths were adequate, but in the 20th century, in the age of physics, astronomy and geology, such myths have been superseded by scientific fact. Science has explained the origin of the universe without recourse to the god-idea.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <hr>
              <p><span style="color: #000066;">QUESTION: What does the Buddha say about the origin of the universe?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #990000;">ANSWER:</span> It is interesting that the Buddha’s explanation of the origin of the universe corresponds very closely to the scientific view. In the Aganna Sutta, The Buddha describes the universe being destroyed and then re-evolving into its present form over a period of countless millions of years. The first life formed on the surface of the water and again, over countless millions of years, evolved from simple into complex organisms. All these processes are without beginning or end, and are set in motion by natural causes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <hr>
              <p><span style="color: #000066;">QUESTION: You say there is no evidence for the existence of a god. But what about miracles?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #990000;">ANSWER:</span> There are many who believe that miracles are proof of gods existence. We hear wild claims that a healing has taken place but we never get an independent testimony from a medical office or a surgeon. We hear second-hand reports that someone was miraculously saved from disaster but we never get an eye-witness account of what is supposed to have happened. We hear rumours that prayer straightened a diseased body or strengthened a withered limb, but we never see X-rays or get comments from doctors or nurses. Wild claims, second-hand reports and rumours are no substitute for solid evidence and solid evidence of miracles is very rare. However, sometimes unexplained things do happen, unexpected events do occur. But our inability to explain such things does not prove the existence of gods. It only proves that our knowledge is as yet incomplete. Before the development of modern medicine, when people didn’t know what caused sickness people believed that god or the gods sent diseases as a punishment. Now we know what causes such things and when we get sick, we take medicine. In time when our knowledge of the world is more complete, we will be able to understand what causes unexplained phenomena, just as we can now understand what causes disease.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <hr>
              <p><span style="color: #000066;">QUESTION: But so many people believe in some form of god, it must be true.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #cc0000;">ANSWER:</span> Not so. There was a time when everyone believed that the world was flat, but they were all wrong. The number of people who believe in an idea is no measure of the truth or falsehood of that idea. The only way we can tell whether an idea is true or not is by looking at the facts and examining the evidence.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <hr>
              <p><span style="color: #000066;">QUESTION: So if Buddhists don’t believe in gods, what do you believe in?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #cc0000;">ANSWER:</span> We don’t believe in a god because we believe in man. We believe that each human being is precious and important, that all have the potential to develop into a Buddha – a perfected human being. We believe that human beings can outgrow ignorance and irrationality and see things as they really are. We believe that <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/Precepts.htm#Three"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">hatred, anger</span></span></a>, spite and jealousy can be replaced by love, patience, generosity and kindness. We believe that all this is within the grasp of each person if they make the effort, guided and supported by fellow Buddhists and inspired by the example of the Buddha. As the Buddha says:</p>
              <p>No one saves us but ourselves, <br>No one can and no one may. <br>We ourselves must walk the path, <br>But Buddhas clearly show the way.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><span style="font-size: x-small;">When Ananthapindika, a wealthy young man met the Buddha at the bamboo groove at Rajagriha, the Buddha spoke to him clearly about his views on the existence of God and the real cause behind the creation of beings in this world. These views of the Buddha are summarized in the following manner: <br><br>1. If God is the maker of all living things, then they all should have to submit to His power silently. They have to be like the vessels produced by the potter, without any individuality of their own. If that is so, how can they all practice virtue? <br><br>2. If this world is indeed created by God, then there should be no such thing as sorrow or calamity or evil, for all the pure and impure deeds must come from Him. <br><br>3. If that is not the case then there must be some other cause besides God which is behind Him, in which case He would not be self-existent. <br><br>4. It is not convincing that the Absolute has created us, because that which is absolute cannot be a cause. All things here arise from different causes. Then can we can say that the Absolute is the cause of all things alike? If the Absolute is pervading them, then certainly It is not their creator. <br><br>5. If we consider the Self as the maker, why did it not make things pleasant? Why and how should it create so much sorrow and suffering for itself? <br><br>6. It is neither God nor the self nor some causeless chance which creates us. It is our our deeds which produce both good and bad results according to the law of causation. <br><br>7. We should therefore "abandon the heresy of worshipping God and of praying to him. We should stops all speculation and vain talk about such matters and practice good so that good may result from our good deeds. <br><br>The Buddha did not encourage speculation on the existence of Iswara, (God) among his disciples. He wanted them to confine themselves to what was within their field of awareness, that is, to understand the causes of suffering and work for its mitigation. <br><br>He preached that the individual was a product of ignorance and an illusion which were responsible for all the suffering and evil. He therefore urged his disciples to become aware of the various aspects of their individual personalities and work for Nirvana which was but the total extinction of this individuality and cessation of all becoming and changing.</span></p></div>

              <p>Hi Aloozner</p>
              <p>It is an interesting query. There two aspec to it.</p>
              <p>First, we need to define, " GOD". This definition process maybe subjective in nature as most people would belive in GOD under the Rooney9-Q&amp;A summary. The main reason for the belief is due mostly to fear and blessing factor. However, recently theologian, has redefine,"GOD" as Ground of All Beings. In another word,  it indicates not that God is the fact of things existing, but that God is the basis for the existence of all things. God is more fundamental to existing things than anything else. So fundamental to the existence of all things is God, that God can be thought of as the basis upon which things exist, the <em>ground</em> their being. To say that God is <em>The ground of being</em> or <em>being itself</em>, is to say that there is something we can sense that is so special about the nature of being that it hints at this fundamental reality upon which all else is based. All beings are parts of His manifestation. <a href="http://www.doxa.ws/Being/Being2.html">http://www.doxa.ws/Being/Being2.html</a></p>
              <p>Secondly, we need to define , "LOVE". In English language, Love is love. However, the original Greek word have a few premises for consideration.</p>
              <p><em>Philo</em>-brotherly or community love</p>
              <p><em>Eros</em>-sexual and sensual appealing love between lovers</p>
              <p><em>Storge</em>-parental love for his offspring</p>
              <p><em>Agape</em>-unconditional love without discrimination</p>
              <p>Therefore, it depend on the context to define the love. Love(Agape) is an aspect of God in Christian context. Personally, I do beleive that Buddha and Bodhisattvas also possess the agape and philo quality which we repeatedly see in Buddhist scripture. However, we tend to call this quality as compassion, because love in Buddhist context tend to have a connotation related to object attachement which resulted in suffering. </p>
              <p>In conclusion, a person may believe in God/Buddha/Bodhisattvas due to the various factors. However, if he is able to recognise himself as parts of higher beings manifestation (grounds of all beings). Then he can chose to  strive on the Agape quality aspect of higher beings in his daily living to make our world a better place. Thus far, I think Mother Teresa and Master Cheng Yen (Tzu Chi)  have managed to do that in our era.</p>

              Thing?</a>):</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>This is an interesting topic and since it is 
              allowed to discuss
                                      more about God in a Buddhism forum, I would like
               to talk a little
                                      more about the experience of 'AMness" in all 
              things. <img title="Razz" src="http://movies.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz"><br> <br> Like a river flowing into the ocean, the self 
              dissolves into
                                      nothingness. When a practitioner becomes 
              thoroughly clear about the
                                      illusionary nature of the individuality, 
              subject-object division
                                      does not take place. A person experiencing 
              Â“AMnessÂ” will find
                                      Â“AMness in everythingÂ”. What is it like?<br> <br> Being free individuality -- coming and going, 
              life and death, all
                                      phenomenon merely pop in and out from the 
              background of the AMness.
                                      The AMness is not experienced as an Â‘entityÂ’ 
              residing anywhere,
                                      neither within nor without; rather it is 
              experienced as the ground
                                      reality for all phenomenon to take place. Even 
              the moment of
                                      subsiding (death), the yogi is thoroughly 
              authenticated with that
                                      reality; experiencing the Â‘RealÂ’ as clear as it 
              can be. We cannot
                                      lose that AMness; rather all things can only 
              dissolve and
                                      re-emerges from it. The AMness has not moved, 
              there is no coming
                                      and going. This "AMness" is Â“GodÂ”. <img title="Smile" src="http://movies.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"></p>

              <p>His Holiness The Dalai Lama:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <h4>Q: You have said that according to Buddhist philosophy there is no 
              Creator, no God of creation,
              and this may initially put off many people who believe in a divine 
              principle. Can you explain
              the difference between the Vajrayana Primordial Buddha and a Creator 
              God?</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>A: </strong>I understand the Primordial Buddha, also known as Buddha 
              Samantabhadra, to be the ultimate
              reality, the realm of the Dharmakaya-- the space of emptiness--where all
               phenomena, pure and
              impure, are dissolved. This is the explanation taught by the Sutras and 
              Tantras. However, in the
              context of your question, the tantric tradition is the only one which 
              explains the Dharmakaya
              in terms of Inherent clear light, the essential nature of the mind; this
               would seem imply that
              all phenomena, samsara and nirvana, arise from this clear and luminous 
              source. Even the New
              School of Translation came to the conclusion that the "state of rest" of
               a practitioner of the
              Great Yoga--Great Yoga implies here the state of the practitioner who 
              has reached a stage in
              meditation where the most subtle experience of clear light has been 
              realized--that for as long
              as the practitioner remains in this ultimate sphere he or she remains 
              totally free of any sort of
              veil obscuring the mind, and is immersed in a state of great bliss.</p>
              <p>We can say, therefore, that this ultimate source, clear light, is 
              close to the notion of a Creator,
              since all phenomena, whether they belong to samsara or nirvana, 
              originate therein. But we must
              be careful in speaking of this source, we must not be led into error. I 
              do not mean chat there
              exists somewhere, there, a sort of collective clear light, analogous to 
              the non-Buddhist concept
              of Brahma as a substratum. We must not be inclined to deify this 
              luminous space. We must
              understand that when we speak of ultimate or inherent clear light, we 
              are speaking on an
              individual level.</p>
              <p>Likewise, when we speak of karma as the cause of the universe we 
              eliminate the notion of a
              unique entity called karma existing totally independently. Rather, 
              collective karmic
              impressions, accumulated individually, are at the origin of the creation
               of a world. When, in the
              tantric context, we say that all worlds appear out of clear light, we do
               not visualize this source
              as a unique entity, but as the ultimate clear light of each being. We 
              can also, on the basis of its
              pure essence, understand this clear light to be the Primordial Buddha. 
              All the stages which make
              up the life of each living being--death, the intermediate state, and 
              rebirth--represent nothing
              more than the various manifestations of the potential of clear light. It
               is both the most subtle
              consciousness and energy. The more clear light loses its subtlety, the 
              more your experiences
              take shape.</p>
              <p>In this way, death and the intermediate state are moments where the 
              gross manifestations
              emanating from clear light are reabsorbed. At death we return to that 
              original source, and from
              there a slightly more gross state emerges to form the intermediate state
               preceding rebirth. At the
              stage of rebirth, clear light is apparent in a physical incarnation. At 
              death we return to this
              source. And so on. The ability to recognize subtle clear light, also 
              called the Primordial Buddha,
              is equivalent to realizing nirvana, whereas ignorance of the nature of 
              clear light leaves us to
              wander in the different realms of samsaric existence.</p>
              <p>This is how I understand the concept of the Primordial Buddha. It 
              would be a grave error to
              conceive of it as an independent and autonomous existence from 
              beginningless time. If we had
              to accept the idea of an independent creator, the explanations given in 
              the <em>Pramanavartika, </em>the
              "Compendium of Valid Knowledge" written by Dharmakirti, and in the ninth
               chapter of the text
              by Shantideva, which completely refutes the existence per se of all 
              phenomena, would be
              negated. This, in turn, would refute the notion of the Primordial 
              Buddha. The Buddhist point
              of view does not accept the validity of affirmations which do not stand 
              up to logical
              examination. If a sutra describes the Primordial Buddha as an autonomous
               entity, we must be
              able to interpret this assertion without taking it literally. We call 
              this type of sutra an
              "interpretable" sutra.</p>

              <p><strong>Love:</strong></p>
              <p>Scott Kiloby</p>
              <blockquote>
              <h1>Love</h1>
              <p>Love is such a simple word, yet so misunderstood.</p>
              <p>In my first book, “Love’s Quiet Revolution,” I used the word love a 
              lot as a pointer.</p>
              <p>Through the years, I stopped using the word because people seemed to 
              misinterpret what was being said.</p>
              <p>By love, I don’t mean one person loving another person, either 
              romantically or platonically.  Certainly, that is a kind of love that 
              can arise.</p>
              <p>But love, with regard to non-dual realization, is something totally 
              different.</p>
              <p>Yes, this love is what is experienced when the sense of being a 
              separate person disappears.</p>
              <p>But that is only a small part of it.</p>
              <p>It’s not just the sense of a separate person that disappears.</p>
              <p>It’s the sense that nothing is separate.</p>
              <p>No matter where you go, you cannot find something that feels 
              independent from what you are.</p>
              <p>Nothing feels “out there,” estranged, or isolated.</p>
              <p>Life is intimately present.</p>
              <p>The sun feels just as inseparable as a bodily sensation.</p>
              <p>Ask yourself, how far is the thought, “Sun,” from the warmth of the 
              sun?  Both appear right here, in present awareness, inseparably.</p>
              <p>Love is the experience of all dualities collapsing.  It is the 
              recognition that there is no thought that can capture the freedom of 
              life.</p>
              <p>Opposites just don’t work anymore.</p>
              <p>Words like time v. timelessness, form v. formlessness just don’t 
              convey solid information.</p>
              <p>Dualities collapse, melting into one sweet essence.</p>
              <p>Love is seeing two people arguing, knowing that there can be no right
               without wrong, and so the two are inseparable even in the heat of 
              conflict.</p>
              <p>The entire world feels intimate precisely because no separate thing 
              can arise without a thought arising.  Things are really thoughts.  And 
              thoughts appear intimately and inseparably within the awareness, right 
              here and now, that sees them.</p>
              <p>Even the duality between awareness and thought disappears.</p>
              <p>Love is not being able to find a thought that is actually independent
               of awareness.</p>
              <p>This nondual love cannot be comprehended.  It is beyond the mind.  
              The most profound thought and the most absurd thought are equally 
              drenched in love.  They are both love pretending to be two different 
              things. </p>
              <p>The heart knows it unquestionably.  But it is not the kind of love we
               normally experience, thick with attachment to an other.</p>
              <p>In this love, there is no other.  There is only love, appearing in 
              every form.  And there is a knowing that there aren’t really separate 
              forms at all.  Paradoxically, each form is loved completely and totally 
              in its own right.</p>
              <p>This is a complete unknowing.  But it is not simply the act of 
              throwing one's arms up in the air and saying, "I don't know."  That is 
              just another label, a superficial statement.  This is a deep, deep 
              unknowing that goes to the very core of being.  This unknowing removes 
              every ounce of what you take to be a separate self, leaving only love.  
              This is an unknowing that is not attached to the past and has no 
              expectations for future.  Therefore, whatever arises is perfect. </p>
              <p>There is only love.  So simple, so sweet.  Nothing to comprehend.  
              Love just is.  It is being whatever it is being in this moment.  Nothing
               is excluded.</p>

              <p>Every phenomena is conditions depending, or arising if you please, a process of conditions being in place, while one phenomena ceases, another arises. The cutting tool machine exists not just due its physical components of the machine, but also the assembler, the machines that turn out the components of of your cutting tool machine, which is in turn another  process . What also of the materials of components, is'nt it a process too, of mining of ore, subsequent processing of it? </p>
              <p>Then, there is that of the assembler, is it  a "it" or "he"? Let's say he's a human, is'nt  he a product of process born of man and woman, stream of processes of going to school, getting educated, picking up engineering, mechanical skills, finally ending in this particular factory assembling this particular cutting tool machine!</p>
              <p>Everything arise from a process and processes preceding it, never of something out of nothing!  </p>
              <p>Why do we get angry or happy or sad, melancholic for that matter, there's always reasons, factors or process leading to it, The different is of being aware and  level of awareness, nothing mystical about that!</p>

              <p>''God" is "Love", is love your supreme ideal, any any ultimate values which you like to ascribe to God or even love. As long as you draw no lines or set exceptions, your God or Love is boundless and unconditional. When you go into a religious rapture or euphoria, then you can be said to in and union with God. This is the emotional aspect which draws to the devotion of God!</p>
              <p>Romantjc love  is the attraction, physical and emotional bonding of individuals, culminating in the rapture of the union. Anyway, when you fall deeply in love, it always seems like it is the real thing and love will never die. </p>

              <p>Partly true - but of course, reading by itself is no harm.</p>
              <p>It is that if we cling to any ideas of God when practicing that is of harm. Like pointing to the moon, no pointers are the moon itself. What you want is to 'get' the moon itself.</p>
              <p>Whatever is transcendental can only be approached through a direct, intuitive, non-conceptual awareness.</p>

              <p>Partly true - but of course, reading by itself is no harm.</p>
              <p>It is that if we cling to any ideas of God when practicing that is of harm. Like pointing to the moon, no pointers are the moon itself. What you want is to 'get' the moon itself.</p>
              <p>Whatever is transcendental can only be approached through a direct, intuitive, non-conceptual awareness.</p>
              <p>Here's some pointers for those who want to have that direct experience of the transcendental:</p>

              <p>Thusness:</p>
              <p><em><br>For your first wish, you may need to have an initial glimpse of our inner most essence. You can try the direct approach by asking yourself this,<br><br>“Without using any languages, ‘I’, ‘me’ or any signs or symbols, how is ‘I’ experienced?”</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>AEN:</p>
              <p><em>Yesterday I watched these videos, I think they're very good and tells you how all symbols and label, such as 'I am my body' is not the pure experience.</em></p>
              <p><em>They're good esp part 2. Those interested or practicing self inquiry may want to watch this.</em></p>
              <p><em><a title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNOzlHcOEto" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNOzlHcOEto">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNOzlHcOEto</a> (part 1)</em></p>

              <p><em>Though I must reiterate what Thusness said:</em></p>
              <p><em><strong><br>Of all teachings, no teaching is more important then a direct ‘touch’ of our Buddha essence; but of all dangers, none is more dangerous than misinterpreting our essence after the ‘touch’.</strong></em></p>
              <p><em><strong>The ‘touch’ of the pure sense of existence is often wrongly understood due to our karmic tendencies.  Use the doctrine of Anatta and Emptiness as antidote.</strong></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thusness:</p>
              <div class="quote_body" style="display: none;">
              <p>Thanks for the encouragement. I still don't really understand the concept of 'Anatta' and Emptiness. And my main worry is as mentioned by you, misinterpreting the Buddha essence after the 'touch'.</p>

              <p><br>It's just my personal advice to anyone truly wanting to connect with Creator/Source/God, to read less, analyse less, experience more, feel more. The connection needs to be made with your heart and mind combined, not your mind alone. A mind operating without the heart is only good for analysing academic papers and spiritual articles.</p>
              <p>Many writers out there on the Internet and bookstores have no clue what they are writing or talking about, as they have yet to experience it for themselves. Even for the few writers who have experienced themselves and know what they are writing about, many readers have no clue how to interpret what they are reading. Which is why the academic debates and battles over existence of Creator/Source/God is never-ending. At the end of the day, just believe what one is comfortable with. If one is meant to understand and experience something, he will be able to, somehow.</p>
              <p>Though I'm blunt here, I mean no offence to anyone. Just my honest sharing. :)</p>
