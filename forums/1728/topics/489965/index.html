              demands on anyone’s faith. For people from a culture where the dominant
              religions <em>do</em> make such demands, this is one of Buddhism’s most
              attractive features. It’s especially appealing to those who—in reaction to the
              demands of organized religion—embrace the view of scientific empiricism that
              nothing deserves our trust unless it can be measured against physical data. In
              this light, the Buddha’s famous instructions to the Kalamas are often read as
              an invitation to believe, or not, whatever we like.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><em><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Don’t go by reports, by legends, by traditions, by scripture, by logical
              conjecture, by inference, by analogies, by agreement through pondering views,
              by probability, or by the thought, “This contemplative is our teacher.” When
              you know for yourselves that “these mental qualities are skillful; these mental
              qualities are blameless; these mental qualities are praised by the wise; these
              mental qualities, when adopted and carried out, lead to welfare and to
              happiness”—then you should enter and remain in them. (</span></em><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Anguttara Nikaya<em> 3.65)</em></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Pointing to this passage, many modern writers have gone so far as to say
              that faith has no place in the Buddhist tradition, that the proper Buddhist
              attitude is one of skepticism. But even though the Buddha recommends tolerance
              and a healthy skepticism toward matters of faith, he also notes a conditional
              imperative: if you sincerely want to put an end to suffering (that’s the
              condition) you should take certain things on faith, as working hypotheses, and
              then test them by following his path of practice. The advice to the Kalamas, in
              fact, contains the crucial caveat that you must take into account what wise
              people value.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>This caveat gives balance to the Buddha’s advice: just as you shouldn’t
              give unreserved trust to outside authority, you can’t give unreserved trust to
              your own logic and feelings if they go against experience and the genuine
              wisdom of others. As other early discourses make clear, wise people can be recognized
              by their words and behavior as measured against standards set by the Buddha and
              his awakened disciples. The proper attitude toward those who meet these
              standards is faith:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><em><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>For a disciple who has conviction in the Teacher’s message and lives to
              penetrate it, what accords with the Dhamma is this: “The Blessed One is the
              Teacher, I am a disciple. He is the one who knows, not I.” (</span></em><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Majjhima Nikaya<em> 70)</em></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Repeatedly the Buddha stated that faith in a teacher is what leads you
              to learn from that teacher. Faith in the Buddha’s own awakening is a requisite
              strength for anyone else who wants to attain awakening. As it fosters
              persistence, mindfulness, concentration, and discernment, this faith can take
              you all the way to the deathless.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>So there’s a tension in the Buddha’s recommendations about faith and
              empiricism. Few Asian Buddhists I know find the tension uncomfortable, but
              Western Buddhists—raised in a culture where religion and faith have long been
              at war with science and empiricism—find it very disconcerting. In my
              discussions with them, they often try to resolve it in the same ways in which,
              historically, the tension between Christian faith and scientific empiricism has
              been resolved in our own culture. Three general positions stand out because
              they are both common and clearly Western. Consciously or not, they attempt to
              understand the Buddha’s position on faith and empiricism in a way that can be
              easily mapped onto the modern Western battle lines between religion and
              science.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>The first interpretation has its roots in the side of Western culture
              that totally rejects the legitimacy of faith. In this view, the Buddha embodies
              the Victorian ideal of the heroic agnostic, one who eschewed the childish
              consolations of faith in favor of a purely scientific method for strengthening
              one’s own mind. Because his method focused entirely on the present moment,
              questions of past and future were totally irrelevant to his message. Thus any
              references to faith in such issues as past karma, future rebirth, or an
              unconditioned happiness separate from the the senses are later interpolations
              in the texts, which Buddhist agnostics, following the Buddha’s example, should
              do their best to reject. The second interpretation has roots in the side of
              Western culture that has rejected either the specifics of Christian faith or
              the authority of any organized religion, but has appreciated faith as an
              essential requirement for mental health. This view presents the Buddha as a
              hero from the Romantic era, appreciating the subjective value of faith in
              establishing a sense of wholeness within and interconnectedness without,
              regardless of what the object of that faith might be. In other words, it
              doesn’t matter where faith is directed, as long as it’s deeply felt and
              personally nourishing. Faith in the Buddha’s awakening, in this view, means
              simply believing that he found what worked for himself, which carries no
              implications for what will work for you. If you find the teaching on karma and
              rebirth comforting, fine: believe it. If not, don’t. What’s important is that
              you relate to your faith in a way that’s emotionally healing, nourishing, and
              empowering.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>A third interpretation encompasses the first two, but—instead of
              presenting the Buddha as a hero—depicts him as trapped in his historical
              situation. Much like us, he was faced with finding a meaningful life in light
              of the worldview of his day. His views on karma and rebirth were simply
              assumptions picked up from the primitive science of ancient India, while his
              path of practice was an attempt to negotiate a satisfying life within those
              assumptions. If he were alive today, he would try to reconcile his values with
              the discoveries of modern science, in the same way that some Westerners have
              done with their faith in monotheism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>The underlying assumption of this position is that science is concerned
              with facts, religion with values. Science provides the hard data for which
              religion should provide meaning. Thus each Buddhist would be performing the
              work of a buddha by accepting the hard facts that have been scientifically
              proven for our generation and then searching the Buddhist tradition—as well as
              other traditions, where appropriate—for myths and values to give meaning to
              those facts, and in the process forging a new Buddhism for our times.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Each of these three interpretations may make eminent sense from a
              Western point of view, but none of them do justice to what we know of the
              Buddha or of his teaching on the role of faith and empiricism on the path. All
              three are correct in emphasizing the Buddha’s unwillingness to force his
              teachings on other people, but—by forcing our own assumptions onto his
              teachings and actions—they misread what that unwillingness means. He wasn’t an
              agnostic; he had strong reasons for declaring some ideas as worthy of faith and
              others as not; and his teachings on karma, rebirth, and nirvana broke radically
              with the dominant worldview of his time. He was neither a Victorian nor a
              Romantic hero, nor was he a victim of circumstances. He was a hero who, among
              other things, mastered the issue of faith and empiricism in a radical way. But
              to appreciate that way, we first have to step back from the Western cultural
              battlefield and look at faith and empiricism in a more basic context, simply as
              processes within the individual mind.<br> <br> <strong>ALTHOUGH WE LIKE TO</strong> think that we base our decisions on hard facts, we
              actually use both faith and empiricism in every decision we make. Even in our
              most empirically based decisions, our vision is hampered by our position in
              time. As Kierkegaard noted, we live forward but understand backward. Any
              hardheaded business entrepreneur will tell you that the future has to be taken
              on faith, no matter how much we know of the past. What’s more, we’re often
              forced into momentous decisions where there’s no time or opportunity to gather
              enough past facts for an informed choice. At other times we have too many
              facts—as when a doctor is faced with many conflicting tests on a patient’s
              condition—and we have to go on faith in deciding which facts to focus on and
              which ones to ignore.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Faith also plays a deeper role in many of our decisions. As William
              James once observed, there are two kinds of truths in life: those whose
              validity has nothing to do with our actions, and those whose reality depends on
              what we do. Truths of the first sort—truths of the observer—include facts about
              the behavior of the physical world: how atoms form molecules, how stars
              explode. Truths of the second sort—truths of the will—include skills,
              relationships, business ventures, anything that requires your effort to make it
              real. With truths of the observer, it’s best to stay skeptical until reasonable
              evidence is in. With truths of the will, though, the truth won’t happen without
              your faith in it, often in the face of unpromising odds. For example, if you
              don’t believe that becoming a pianist is worthwhile, or that you have the
              makings of a good pianist, it won’t happen. Truths of the will are the ones
              most relevant to our pursuit of true happiness. Many of the most inspiring
              stories in life are of people who create truths of this sort when a mountain of
              empirical evidence—racism, poverty, physical disability—is against them. In
              cases like this, the truth requires that faith actively discount the immediate
              facts. If we dig even deeper into the psychology of decision-making, we run
              into an area for which no scientific evidence can offer proof: Do we actually
              act, or are actions an illusion? Are our acts already predetermined by physical
              laws or an external intelligence, or do we have free will? Are causal
              relationships real, or only a fiction? Even the most carefully planned
              scientific experiment could never settle any of these issues, and yet once we
              become aware of them we have to take a stand on them if we want to put energy
              into our thoughts, words, and deeds.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>These were the areas where the Buddha focused his teachings on
              empiricism and faith. Although the First Noble Truth requires that we observe
              suffering until we comprehend it, we have to take on faith his assertion that
              the facts we observe about suffering are the most important guide for making
              decisions, moment by moment, throughout life. Because the Third Noble Truth,
              the cessation of suffering, is a truth of the will, we have to take it on faith
              that it’s a worthwhile and attainable goal. And because the Fourth Noble
              Truth—the path to the cessation of suffering—is a path of action and skill, we
              have to take it on faith that our actions are real, that we have free will, and
              yet that there’s a causal pattern to the workings of the mind from which we can
              learn in mastering that skill. As the Buddha said, the path will lead to a
              direct experience of these truths, but only if you bring faith to the practice
              will you know this for yourself. In other words, “faith” in the Buddhist
              context means faith in the ability of your actions to lead to a direct
              experience of the end of suffering.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>The Buddha offered these teachings to people seeking advice on how to
              find true happiness. That’s why he was able to avoid any coercion of others:
              his teachings assumed that his listeners were already involved in a search.
              When we understand his views on what it means to search—why people search, and
              what they’re searching for—we can understand his advice on how to use faith and
              empiricism in a successful search. The best way to do this is to examine four
              of his similes, called <em>upamana</em> in Pali, illustrating how a search should
              be conducted.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>The first simile illustrates search in its most raw and unfocused form:</span></p>

              don’t bother to ask if our suffering is predetermined or our actions have any
              hope of success. We simply put up a struggle and do what we can to escape. It’s
              our natural reaction.</span></p>

              is this happening to me?”—and we search for a way to put an end to the
              suffering. When he stated that he taught nothing but suffering and the end of
              suffering, he was responding to these two reactions, providing an explanation
              of suffering and its end so as to do away with our bewilderment, while at the
              same time showing the way to the end of suffering so as to satisfy our search.
              He had no use for the idea that our suffering comes from our struggle to resist
              suffering; that the search for an end to suffering is precisely what keeps us
              from seeing the peace already there. In light of the above simile, simply
              relaxing into a total acceptance of the moment means relaxing into the prospect
              of being burned alive.</span></p>

              faith in the Buddha’s awakening comes in. As the Buddha once stated, he didn't
              tell us everything he awakened to. What he told was like a handful of leaves;
              what he learned was like all the leaves in the forest. Still, the leaves in the
              handful contained all the lessons that would help others to awaken. Right
              understanding begins with learning what those specific lessons are.<br> <br> <strong>THE MOST IMPORTANT LESSON,</strong> and the most important item of faith, is
              simply the fact of the awakening itself. The Buddha achieved it through his own
              efforts, and he did so, not because he was more than human, but because he developed
              mental qualities we all have the potential to develop. To have faith in his
              awakening thus means having faith in your own potential for awakening.</span></p>

              as well. It’s not simply the case that he found what worked for him, while what
              works for you may be something else entirely. No matter how much you twist a
              cow’s horn, it’ll never produce milk. The Buddha’s insights penetrated into how
              things work, what it means for them to work. These insights apply to everyone
              throughout time.</span></p>

              focused on a principle of causality that explains how we live in a world where
              patterns of causality fashion events, and yet those events are not totally
              predetermined by the past.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>The principle is actually a dual one, for there are two kinds of
              causality interweaving in our lives. The first is a cause giving results in the
              immediate present: <em>when this is, that is; when this isn’t, that isn’t.</em> When you turn on a stereo, for example, the noise comes out; when you turn it
              off, the noise stops. The second type of causality is a cause giving results
              over time: <em>from the arising of this comes the arising of that; from the
              cessation of this comes the cessation of that.</em> If you study now, you’ll
              have knowledge long into the future. If you damage your brain, the negative
              effects will be long-term as well.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Applied to karma, or intentional action, the dual principle of causality
              means that any moment of experience consists of three things: (1) pleasures and
              pains resulting from past intentions, (2) present intentions, and (3) pleasures
              and pains immediately resulting from present intentions. Thus the present is
              not totally shaped by the past. In fact, the most important element shaping
              your present experience of pleasure or pain is how you fashion, with your
              present intentions, the raw material provided by past intentions. And your
              present intentions can be totally free.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>This is how there is free will in the midst of causality. At the same
              time, the pattern in the way intentions lead to results allows us to learn from
              past mistakes. This freedom within a pattern opens the way to a path of mental
              training, mastered through experience, that can lead to the end of suffering.
              We practice generosity, virtue, and meditation to learn the power of our
              intentions and in particular to see what happens as our intentions grow more
              skillful, so skillful that present intentions actually stop. Only when they
              stop can you prove for yourself how powerful they’ve been. And where they stop
              is where the unconditioned—the end of suffering—is found. From there you can
              return to intentions, but you’re no longer their captive or slave.</span></p>

              empirical evidence to corroborate them—noting, for instance, how your reaction
              to another person’s misery depends on how attached you are to that person—but
              he never attempted a full-scale empirical proof. In fact, he heaped ridicule on
              his contemporaries, the Jains, who tried to prove their more deterministic
              teaching on karma by claiming that all those who kill, steal, lie, or engage in
              illicit sex will suffer from their actions here and now. “Haven’t you seen the
              case,” the Buddha asked, “where a man is rewarded by a king for killing the
              king’s enemy, for stealing from the king’s enemy, for amusing the king with a
              clever lie?” Even though the basic principle of karma is simple enough—skillful
              intentions lead to pleasure, unskillful intentions to pain—the dual principle
              of causality through which karma operates is so complex, like a Mandelbrot set,
              that you would go crazy trying to nail the whole thing down empirically.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>So instead of an empirical proof for his teaching on karma, the Buddha
              offered a pragmatic proof: if you sincerely believe in his teachings on
              causality, karma, rebirth, and the Four Noble Truths, how will you act? What kind
              of life will you lead? Won’t you tend to be more responsible and compassionate?
              If, on the other hand, you were to believe in any of the alternatives—such as a
              doctrine of an impersonal fate or a deity who determined the course of your
              pleasure and pain, or a doctrine that all things were coincidental and without
              cause—what would those beliefs logically lead you to do? If you acted
              consistently in line with them, would they allow you to put an end to suffering
              through your own efforts? Would they allow any purpose for effort at all? Or
              again, if you simply refused to commit to a coherent idea of what human action
              can do, would you be likely to pursue a demanding path of practice all the way
              through to the end?</span></p>

              interconnectedness, and oneness that comes with strong concentration. Yet
              nirvana isn’t connected to anything we’ve ever experienced. It’s already there,
              but hidden by all our desires for physical and mental activity. To touch it, we
              have to abandon our habitual attachment to activity. To believe that such a
              thing is possible, and that it’s the ultimate happiness, is to take a major

              superior to the heartwood of nirvana. In their case he used all the psychic and
              intellectual powers at his disposal to humble their pride, for he realized that

              steps of the practice—going into the wilderness as a monastic; adhering to the
              precepts; developing restraint, contentment, and strong concentration; seeing
              past lives and gaining vision of the beings of the cosmos dying and being
              reborn in line with their karma—as simply footprints and scratch marks of the
              Buddha’s awakening. Only when you have your own first taste of awakening,

              faith with honest skepticism. To act on this faith is to test it, the way you’d
              test a working hypothesis. You need faith to keep following the footprints, but
              you also need the honesty to recognize where faith ends and knowledge begins. This
              is why, in the Buddhist context, faith and empiricism are inseparable. Unlike a
              monotheistic religion—where faith centers on the power of another, and
              skepticism implies a rejection of that power—faith in the Buddha’s awakening
              keeps pointing back to the power of your own actions: Do you have enough power
              over your intentions to make them harmless? Do harmless intentions then give
              you the freedom to drop intention entirely? The only way you can answer these
              questions is by being scrupulously honest about your intentions, to detect even
              the slightest traces of harm, even the slightest movement of intention itself.
              Only then will you know the deathless, totally unconditioned by intention, for
              sure. But if you claim to know things that you don’t, how can you trust
              yourself to detect any of these things? You’ve got to make your inner honesty
              worthy of the subtle truths you’re trying to prove. This is why science will
              never be able to pass valid judgment on the truths of awakening, for the path
              deals in matters that outside experimenters can’t reach. Although others may
              sympathize with your suffering, the suffering itself is an experience you can
              share with no one else. The honesty and skillfulness of your intentions is an
              affair of your internal dialogue, something that is also purely your own.
              Scientists can measure the neurological data indicating pain or intentional
              activity, but there’s no external measurement for how the pain feels, or how
              honest your intentional dialogue may be. And as for the deathless, it has no
              physical correlates at all. The closest that outside empirical measurement can
              get is to take pictures of the footprints on the ground and the marks in the
              trees.</span></p>

              Sariputta did. He kept following the path, without jumping to dishonest
              conclusions, until he saw the elephant within. Then, when the Buddha asked him,
              “Do you take it on faith that these five strengths—faith, persistence,
              mindfulness, concentration, and discernment—lead to the deathless?” Sariputta
              could answer honestly, “No, I don’t take it on faith. I know.”</span></p>

              even the sense of the functioning of the mind can’t reach. If you want to
              confirm his knowledge, you have to touch that dimension in the only place you
              can access it: inside yourself. This is one of two ways in which the Buddha’s

              hypothesis, but the test of that hypothesis requires an honesty deeper and more
              radical than anything science requires. You have to commit yourself—every
              variation on who you feel you are—totally to the test. Only when you take apart
              all clinging to your inner and outer senses can you prove whether the activity
              of clinging is what hides the deathless. The Buddha never forced anyone to
              commit to this test, both because you can’t coerce people to be honest with
              themselves, and because he saw that the pit of burning embers was coercion
              enough.</span></p>
