            <div class='col-md body'><br><img src="http://www.medicinebuddha.org/Peter_Iseli_Card2_copy.jpg"><br><br>About the Medicine Buddha<br><br>Medicine Buddha is one of many buddhas who have attained the state of perfect enlightenment for the benefit of all sentient beings.  The enlightened mind has eliminated all negativity and perfected all positive qualities.<br><br>Medicine Buddha's blue sky-colored holy body signifies omniscient wisdom and compassion as vast as limitless space and is particularly associated with healing both mental and physical suffering.  Making a connection with him, practicing meditation, reciting his mantra or even just saying his name helps us achieve our potential for ultimate healing.<br><br>The historical Shakyamuni Buddha provided teachings on healing and systems of medicine which were collected into four volumes called "The Four Medicine Tantras". These teachings became the basis for the system of medicine practiced in Tibet and other Buddhist lands. They are characterized by a belief that all disease is essentially rooted in a psychosomatic cause, namely, spiritual confusion. His Holiness the Dalai Lama teaches that although there is no beginning point of the root confusions, there can be an end to them through enlightenment. The many confusions may be traced to three main poisons, or wrong attitudes, of greed (grasping), hatred (fear), and ignorance (mistaken beliefs). Until the mistaken attitudes are released, all other cures are at best, only temporary. His Holiness also teaches that, unlike ignorance, wisdom does have a beginning, but no end! Once we do cleanse our beliefs, we reach a luminous enlightened mind, free of stain, which remains eternally so.<br><br>In the Medicine Tantras, Shakyamuni describes Medicine Buddha as an enlightened being who has special powers of healing. The special healing blessings of Medicine Buddha may be obtained by reciting his name or mantra. For centuries, Buddhists have been reciting this mantra prayer, to bring an ultimate healing of spiritual disease, as well as cures for everyday problems of the body and mind.<br><br>Land of Medicine Buddha has been dedicated by Lama Zopa Rinpoche (our Spiritual Director) as a place of healing, where the blessings of the Medicine Buddha may be experienced, especially by awakening and nurturing our good heart. The Medicine Buddha's name "Lord of Medicine Radiating Lapis Lazuli Light" in Sanskrit is "Bhagavan Bhaishajyaguru Vaiduryaprabha".<br><br>The Medicine Buddha's short mantra:<br><br>TAYATHA OM BHEGHANDZE BHEGHANDZE MAHA BHEGHANDZE BHEGHANDZE RADZA SAMUDGATE SOHA<br><br>The Medicine Buddha's long mantra:<br><br>OM NAMO BAGHAWATE BHEGHANDZE GURU BHEDURYA PRABARAJA TATHAGATAYA ARHATE SAMKYA SAM BUDDHAYA TAYATHA OM BHEGHANDZE BHEGHANDZE MAHA BHEGHANDZE BHEGHANDZE RADZA SAMUDGATE SOHA<br><br>The Medicine Buddha's dharani:<br><br>TADYATHA GHU ME GHU ME / I MI NI MI HI MA TI MA TI SAPTA TATHAGATA / SA MA DHYA DHIGHITE / AH TE MA TE / PA LE PA PA SHODHANI / SARVA PAPAM NA SHA / YA MA MA BUDDHA BUDDHOTTAME / U ME KU ME / BUDDHA KSHETRA PA SHODHANI / DHA ME NI DHA ME / ME RU ME RU ME RU SHI GHARE / SARVVA AH KA LA MRITU / NI PARANI / BUDDHE SU BUDDHE BUDDHA ADHIKHTHANA / RAKHANTU ME / SARVVA DE WA SA ME AH / SA ME SAMANTA HARANTU / SARVVA BUDDHA BODHISATTVA / SHAME SHAME PRASHAMANTU ME / SARVVA ITU PA DRA PRA BA DYA TA YA / PURANE PURANE PURAYAME / SARVA ASHAYA / BAIDURYA PRATI / BHA SE SARVVA PA PAKHA YADA RE SVAHA<br><br><a href="http://www.medicinebuddha.org/medicine_buddha.htm#About%20the%20Medicine%20Buddha" rel="nofollow">http://www.medicinebuddha.org/medicine_buddha.htm#About%20the%20Medicine%20Buddha</a><br><br></div>

I roughly remembered a true story I was told over a year ago, by a Buddhist friend who experienced it himself. I can't really remember the detail now as it has been a long time.. but anyway...<br><br>This guy had some problem and needed to go for brain surgeries several times... Before he went, he went to a foreign lama who came to Singapore to teach the teachings on Medicine Buddha. I can't remember which Lama, but I know the name starts with S. Anyway, during some kind of ritual (or maybe not ritual, something else), everyone was sitting in a circle. The lama walked to him and pulled him out of the circle, and told him he got (Karmic) Obstructions, and he needs to practice well.<br><br>Soon, he went for the surgery (or is it not? i cant remember)... I believe he had been practising.. and then he slipped into a coma. For 4 days he remained unconscious, until the 4th day, the first thing he remembered was seeing a figure of a man, he done quite some description but i really cannot remember it anymore. After awaking from it he asked the doctors/nurses whether someone came to visit him. They said nope, nobody had visited him when he woke up. It was later he visited the lama again, and the lama told him the figure was a manifest of the Medicine Buddha, and he was saved by the Medicine Buddha. Later he went for several surgeries and succeeded. I still see him sometimes these days.</blockquote></div>
