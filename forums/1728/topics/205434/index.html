Meaning he does not hold any lineage and is not authorised to teach the tantras although he does that. Nevertheless, Lu Sheng Yen lied about it by providing photos of his meeting with some other lamas, although none of the lamas recognise him.<br><br>2) Created his own sutra which he teaches, called the True Buddha Sutra which is not about Buddhism but a mixture of his own ideas, Chinese traditions and certain elements of Buddhism into a folklorish story (just like any other stories that he created)<br><br>3) Involved in sex and other scandals.<br><br>4) If you look at the website, you will find it full of fanciful bed time stories which he created.<br><br>5) The things he taught are not true dharma, but a mix of chinese folk belief and other teachings with buddhism.<br><br>and many other reasons.....<br><br>All are advised to stay away from this school and their teachings.</div>

Actually, the body of Living Buddha Lian-shen is that of Buddha Amitabha, his speech that of Bodhisattva Maitreya, his mind that of Buddha Shakyamuni, and his hands those of Vajrapani. Therefore, as Padmasambhava had predicted, Living Buddha Lian-shen is the Vajra Emanation of the Body, Mind, and Speech of all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. Any offering made to Living Buddha Lian-shen is being made to his Three Bodies (the Dharma Body, the Bliss Body, and the Transformation Body), and there is no difference between such merits and merits acquired from making offerings to ten thousand billion Buddhas.  </blockquote><a href="http://web.singnet.com.sg/~aricalim/t14.html" rel="nofollow">http://web.singnet.com.sg/~aricalim/t14.html </a></div>

Depending on the buddhist organisations that is conducting, some will only allow members who attended some kind of basic buddhism course to take refuge. There are some who just do it like that.<br><br>Teacher is not perfect though they are experienced. Experienced Dhamma Teacher (ordained or lay alike) at the end of the day will advise a buddhist to refer to buddhistic principles, rather than tailor-made anything. Zen (Chinese, Korean or Japanese) and Vajrayana (I assume you refer to the Tibetan tradition) had evolved into a culture that integrates at their various location. From what I see, they have what it is suitable to the locals but may not necessary mean a universal solution to all.<br><br>But I'll like to stress again I am not discreditting any good monks/nuns as I'd read some of famous masters and find their book to be good.
