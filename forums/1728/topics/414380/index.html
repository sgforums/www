              <p><span style="color: black;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; line-height: normal; font-size: small;  ">Composed by the Venerable Master Hua on January 31, 1987 at Gold Mountain Monastery</span><br><br>We bow to the Buddha and recite the Buddha's name
              in order to be reborn in the </span><span style="color: black;">Land</span><span style="color: black;"> of </span><span style="color: black;">Ultimate Bliss</span><span style="color: black;">. Everyone knows that Amitabha Buddha is the host in the
              Western Land of Ultimate Bliss. Guanyin Bodhisattva is the figure to the left
              of Amitabha Buddha, and Great Strength Bodhisattva is the figure to his right.
              They both help Amitabha Buddha to propagate the Dharma-door of
              Buddha-recitation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">Today we are going to talk about Great Strength
              Bodhisattva. Why is he called Great Strength Bodhisattva? Because he has great
              strength. How great? When he raises his hands or takes a step he shakes the
              entire three thousand great thousand world system.<span> </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">There are countless worlds in the three thousand
              great thousand world system. A sun, a moon, one </span><span style="color: black;">Mount</span><span style="color: black;"> </span><span style="color: black;">Sumeru</span><span style="color: black;">, and one set of four continents together make up one world
              system. A thousand suns, a thousand moons, a thousand </span><span style="color: black;">Mount</span><span style="color: black;"> </span><span style="color: black;">Sumerus</span><span style="color: black;">, and a thousand sets of four continents together make up
              one "small" thousand world system. A thousand small world systems
              make up a "middle-sized" world system. A thousand middle-sized world
              systems make up a "large" world system. Nowadays, sending a rocket to
              another planet isn't anything extraordinary. Moving from this planet to another
              planet is just a small step within the three thousand great thousand world
              system. It's nothing much to talk about.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">Great Strength Bodhisattva moves his hands and
              feet and shakes the entire three thousand great thousand world system. Not only
              does he shake the earth, but he smashes and shakes all the six desire heavens
              and the demon king's palace as well. So this Bodhisattva can't walk or gesture
              casually. He can't be like us and wave his arms or stamp his feet with joy. If
              he just moved his hands and feet slightly, the entire three thousand great
              thousand world system would vibrate. If this Bodhisattva danced around a bit,
              the whole three thousand great thousand world system would be destroyed. But
              because he has samadhi, he keeps unmoving and is always in samadhi in the </span><span style="color: black;">Land</span><span style="color: black;"> of </span><span style="color: black;">Ultimate Bliss</span><span style="color: black;">.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">This Bodhisattva belonged to the retinue of
              Amitabha Buddha. He followed Amitabha Buddha in leaving the home-life and in
              cultivating life after life. So when Amitabha became a Buddha, he accompanied
              him to help him propagate the Buddhadharma.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">Because he vigorously cultivated the Dharma-door
              of recitation, he could achieve the samadhi of reciting the Buddha's name.
              Since he had perfected his cultivation of merit and virtue, he received a
              prediction from the Buddha. The Buddha predicted that in the future he would be
              named Skillfully Dwelling Merit and Virtue Treasury King Thus Come One. His
              title will be Skillfully Dwelling Merit and Virtue Treasury King Buddha. This
              Bodhisattva's wisdom light shines everywhere. It can break through the darkness
              and ignorance of all living beings.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">Great Strength Bodhisattva cultivated the
              Dharma-door of Buddha-recitation. The first method of the Dharma door of
              Buddha-recitation is holding the name Buddha-recitation. How does one practice
              it? Holding the Buddha's name means reciting "Namo Amitabha Buddha, Namo
              Amitabha Buddha..." Great Strength Bodhisattva does not recite the
              Buddha's name only after having accomplished Buddhahood in this life.
              Throughout countless kalpas, in life after life, he has been cultivating the
              Dharma- door of Buddha-recitation, and the Buddha-recitation Samadhi. What does
              samadhi mean? Samadhi means proper concentration, which comes from Buddha-recitation.
              After proper reception, he obtained samadhi, and thus obtained the benefit that
              he could recite to the point of being mindful without confusion. So in the
              Buddha-recitation of holding the name, you need only recite the words
              "Namo Amitabha Buddha."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">We should think it over, what are Great Strength
              Bodhisattva and Guanyin Bodhisattva doing? They are mindful of the Buddha, and
              so are Manjushri Bodhisattva and Universal Worthy Bodhisattva. Earth Store
              Bodhisattva is also reciting the Buddha's name. All day long these four great
              Bodhisattvas are mindful of the Buddha. Even as Bodhisattvas who have already
              obtained the fruition, they are still mindful of the Buddha, so how much the
              more should we ordinary people be so. We should hold and recite the Buddha's
              name.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">So we should not take this Dharma-door of
              Buddha-recitation lightly. We shouldn't say, "Oh, that's just for silly
              old people; me, I'm smart and educated, I don't need to recite the Buddha's
              name." If you say you are wise, are you wiser than Guanyin Bodhisattva,
              Great Strength Bodhisattva, Manjushri Bodhisattva, Universal Worthy
              Bodhisattva, or Earth Store Bodhisattva? Is your wisdom greater than the wisdom
              of these Bodhisattvas? They are all reciting the Buddha's name. Is your
              eloquence greater than that of Manjushri Bodhisattva, Universal Bodhisattva,
              Guanshiyin Bodhisattva, Earth Store Bodhisattva, or Great Strength Bodhisattva?
              Can you surpass them? Are your spiritual penetrations greater than theirs?
              Don't think that the scientists putting together a rocket and sending it off to
              space is something very wonderful. This is happening because now everyone can
              manufacture these things. We have now reached the level where we have the
              knowledge and understanding to make this happen. There's nothing special to it.
              But the wonderful functioning of the spiritual penetrations of Guanyin
              Bodhisattva, Great Strength Bodhisattva, Manjushri Bodhisattva, Universal
              Worthy Bodhisattva, and Earth Store Bodhisattva are way beyond our imagination
              and conception, and they are all reciting the Buddha's name. So the Dharma-door
              of Buddha-recitation is unsurpassed, it is the most supreme one. It saves you
              energy, time, and money. You don't have to spend anything, all you have to do
              is recite "Namo Amitabha Buddha, Namo Amitabha Buddha...," and then
              you can become a Buddha.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">In the Dharma-ending Age, all the Sutras will
              disappear and become extinct. Only the Amitabha Sutra will still remain in this
              world for a hundred years, and it will take across countless people. When the
              Amitabha Sutra is extinct, only the six syllables of "Namo
              A-mi-to-fo" (Homage to Amitabha Buddha) will be left in this world, and
              they will remain for one hundred years. After a hundred years, there will be no
              Buddhadharma in this world, and only the four syllables "A-mi-to-fo"
              (Amitabha Buddha) will remain for another one hundred years. After this, the
              Buddh-dharma will disappear completely, and at that time no one will understand
              what the Buddhadharma is. Nobody will know anything about it. So the Dharma-door
              of Buddha-recitation is the most wonderful one. Because of this Great Strength
              Bodhisattva as well as the other Bodhisattvas Mahasattvas all recite the
              Buddha's name.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">Holding the name Buddha-recitation means holding
              and reciting the Buddha's name, which is very convenient, very easy. It saves
              your money and your energy. It is the most direct method.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">The second method of recitation is contemplating
              an image Buddha-recitation. You only need to contemplate Amitabha Buddha's
              thirty-two marks and eighty minor characteristics. Contemplate his golden-hued
              body and his adornment with the special marks of a Buddha. Not to mention his
              other marks, his white hair-mark light can shine around five </span><span style="color: black;">Mount</span><span style="color: black;"> </span><span style="color: black;">Sumerus</span><span style="color: black;">, which means his white light is as high as five </span><span style="color: black;">Mount</span><span style="color: black;"> </span><span style="color: black;">Sumerus</span><span style="color: black;">. Amitabha's eyes are as wide as the four great seas--can
              you imagine that? His eyes are as large as four great seas, have you ever seen
              that? And how big do you think his body is? It won't be easy to describe. You
              could say his body is as huge as a gathering of hundreds of thousands of
              millions of planets. If you can figure it out by contemplating Amitabha
              Buddha's image, you will attain the Buddha-recitation Samadhi.<span> </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">If you wish to obtain the Buddha-recitation
              Samadhi, first you should purify your three karmas of body, mouth, and mind.
              You cannot recite the Buddha's name and scold people at the same time; you
              cannot be mindful of the Buddha and think about other things recklessly at the
              same time, or have any evil thoughts. If your body is involved in killing,
              stealing, and sexual misconduct; if your mouth is involved in loose speech,
              false speech, harsh speech, or double-tongued speech; and your mind is filled
              with greed, hatred, and stupidity, your three karmas are impure. Your three karmas
              being pure means that your body is without the karma of killing, stealing, or
              sexual misconduct; your mouth is free from the four evil karmas of loose
              speech, false speech, harsh speech, and double-tongued speech; and your mind
              has none of the three poisons of greed, hatred, and stupidity. Then the three
              karmas of body, mouth, and mind are pure. If you are able to purify your three
              karmas, reciting the Buddha's name is like throwing a pearl into muddy water so
              that the muddy water becomes clear. Recitation of the Buddha's name enters a
              confused mind--originally you have a lot of false thoughts--but if you can
              recite the Buddha's name in the middle of these false thoughts, the false
              thoughts will gradually merge with the sound of the Buddha-recitation and slowly
              they will become Buddha-recitation. So there is a saying:<br> <br> <em>When the water-clearing pearl is tossed in muddy water,<br> The muddy water will certainly become clear.<br> When the Buddha's name enters a confused mind,<br> The confused mind will certainly become a Buddha.</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">Contemplating and thinking Buddha-recitation.
              Contemplation means that you contemplate and think about the Buddha, whether
              you are walking, standing, sitting, or lying down. This method also consists of
              the contemplation of the Buddha's wonderful and adorned marks. Contemplating an
              image means that you face the Buddha's image and contemplate it.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">There is also real mark Buddha-recitation. Real
              mark also means investigating Chan. Investigating Chan, real mark, has no mark.
              Real mark has no mark and yet it contains all marks. If you say there's nothing
              there, it still contains everything; if you say there's something there, there
              is nothing. When you reach this kind of a state, you will naturally understand
              the principle of real mark. Real mark: reciting and yet not reciting, not
              reciting and yet reciting. The wind can't blow you about, the rain can't fall
              on you. When you reach the state of real mark Buddha-recitation, you can't help
              reciting. If you want to recite, you won't be aware of it; if you don't want to
              recite, you won't be aware of it, either. In this kind of samadhi, one can
              practice Buddha-recitation in samadhi. If you can attain this level, you will
              definitely be reborn in the Land of Ultimate Bliss and will see the Buddha when
              your lotus flower opens.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">People in the Saha world are born from wombs;
              people in the Land of Ultimate Bliss are born transformationally. People who
              wish to learn from the Buddha should spend time studying the Buddhadharma.
              Don't settle for partial understanding or be unwilling to learn when you
              realize you don't understand something. Don't think that since you can't
              understand something thoroughly, you won't even try to understand. Don't have
              an attitude of setting up a restricted area for yourself, of not wanting to go
              forward. That is simply destroying your future. We must reach the ultimate
              point of:<span> </span></span></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: black;">Passing beyond the mountains and rivers,<span> </span><br> there seems to be no road ahead;<br> Beyond the bright flowers and dark willows<span> </span><br> lies another village.</span></em></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">If you can recite to the point of reciting and yet
              not reciting, not reciting and yet reciting, you unite with the
              Buddha-recitation. Being unconfused, you will certainly be reborn in the Land
              of Ultimate Bliss and see the Buddha when your lotus flower opens.<br> We are now discussing Great Strength Bodhisattva. How can he have such great
              strength? Because he has a straight mind. He had straight mind when he started
              to cultivate. "The straight mind is the Way-place." Because he had a
              straight mind, he could influence other people to recite the Buddha's name.
              Helping others to recite enabled him to become the Dharma protector of Amitabha
              Buddha. Being a Dharma protector means helping and protecting one's teacher's
              vow power to be accomplished. So Great Strength Bodhisattva still recites the
              Buddha's name. He recites and you also recite, and so his and your
              Buddha-recitation become one, two and yet not two. You recite and he recites,
              both of you recite, so there is a response with the Way.<span> </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">When your skill fully ripens, Great Strength Bodhisattva
              will welcome you and take you to the Land of Ultimate Bliss as you wish. Why
              does he want to take you there? Because of his great vow power. He wants to
              protect his master, since his master has vowed, "After I have accomplished
              Buddhahood, if anyone who recites my name were to fail to become a Buddha, I
              won't become a Buddha in the first place." So he protects his master's vow
              power. If anyone recites the Buddha's name, Great Strength Bodhisattva has made
              the vow that he will take that person to the Land of Ultimate Bliss. Applying
              both self-power and other-power in this way, one can then attain to the Land of
              Ultimate Bliss.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">A verse in praise says:<br> <em>He is as straight as an arrow, his wisdom is god-like;<br> With vast and great strength he enters the door of<br> nonobstruction.<br> Shaking the three thousand world system he subdues<br> the demon kings;<br> Living beings take refuge with him and certify to the<br> wonderful Dharma body.</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">He is as straight as an arrow: His mind is
              straightforward. The straight mind is the Way-place. His wisdom is god-like:
              His wisdom is as inconceivable as that of a god. Vast and great strength: His
              strength is much greater than that of any other Bodhisattva. He enters the door
              of nonobstruction: He attains the Dharma door of perfect nonobstruction.
              Shaking the three thousand worlds system: He shakes the three thousand great
              thousand worlds. He subdues the demon kings: He subdues all demon kings. Living
              being take refuge with him: All living beings take refuge with him. And certify
              to the wonderful Dharma body: All beings can become Buddhas.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">Another verse says:<br> <em>Amitabha Buddha's light is limitless;<br> Great Strength Bodhisattva protects this Dharma king.<br> He guides living beings to return to the Pure Land,<br> Universally gathering all sentient beings into the Lotus Land.<br> The nine grades of lotuses appear in the pools of seven jewels;<br> The myriad conducts are perfected in the water of eight virtues.<br> Cultivators with faith and vows uphold and recite the name,<br> And board the boat of wonderful enlightenment together.</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">Amitabha Buddha's light is limitless: Amitabha is
              a Sanskrit word which means limitless light. Amitabha, the Buddha of Limitless
              Light is also named Amitayus, the Buddha of Limitless Life. Great Strength
              Bodhisattva protects this Dharma king: Great Strength Bodhisattva has vowed to
              protect and uphold the Dharma of Amitabha Buddha, the Dharma king.<br> He guides living beings to return to the Pure Land: He gathers in living beings
              to get them to return to the Pure Land: He has vowed to gather in all living
              beings to the Land of Ultimate Bliss.<span> </span>Universally
              gathering in all sentient beings into the Lotus Land: He universally gathers in
              all creatures to the Land of Ultimate Bliss.</span></p>

              middle inferior 7. inferior superior 8. inferior middle 9. inferior inferior.
              Each of the nine grades also has nine ranks, making eighty-one in all. So the
              lotuses appear in the seven-jeweled pool.</span></p>

              <p>If the practitioner did not attain rebirth in Amitabha Buddha Pureland, there's still many benefits in chanting. It's still a meritorious activity.</p>
              <p>Remember the one who recited Namo Buddha when being chased by a Tiger. A story in unlimited life sutra.</p>
              <p>Later after many many many lifetimes later, the buddha took in him and he became an arhat due to the namo buddha he recited. Namo Buddha = homage to the buddha.</p>
              <p>Usually after I chant, I dedicate merit to all sentient beings.</p>
              <p>The same goes for sutra even if u don't understand it, still recite as It plants imprints in 8th conscious.</p>
