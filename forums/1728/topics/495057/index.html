              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">A lay practitioner reveals one of the most liberating decisions
              of her life: celibacy.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">I won’t mince words. I’m celibate. And it’s because of the
              dharma.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">I’m not sure why writing that feels so exhibitionistic, so
              confessional. That the statement is extremely personal goes without saying.
              I’ve never sought to discuss all the sex I’m not having (as a friend likes to
              joke) publicly. But in the time I’ve been a student of Buddhism, well over half
              my life, it’s the one detail of my practice that ever made anyone balk, or that
              got treated as a problematic behavior. If the subject of my nonexistent love
              life comes up, I often hear from friends or colleagues, including some Buddhist
              ones, that I’m probably still shaken by the demise of my marriage (seven years
              ago), that I’ll change my mind, that I don’t know what irresistible liaison the
              future could bring, that I’m squelching my real feelings.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Refraining from all sexual activity is one of the eight
              precepts taken by lay Buddhists during lunar observance days or by dedicated
              practitioners, usually affiliated with monasteries, who want to devote all
              their energy to meditation and study. I suppose it shouldn’t come as a surprise
              that taking up this precept strikes people as aberrant. Most of us operate with
              the deeply ingrained assumption that we should go around in twos, that it’s our
              best shot at happiness. We share a pervasive psychotherapeutic view that people
              become effective social beings via healthy romantic relationships. Our word
              celibacy, in fact, goes back to an Indo-European compound meaning “to be
              alone.” As a culture, aloneness is not something we go for.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But for as long as human beings have been organizing
              themselves into religious communities, there have been celibate contemplatives,
              in search of seclusion, and the very earliest chronicles of their spiritual activities
              show them defending their lives of renunciation and simplicity to disapproving
              parents and community members. The Theragatha and Therigatha, the collections
              of verses by the Buddha’s elder monks and nuns, and the Vinaya, the monastic
              code of conduct, are peppered with stories about families who tried to bribe,
              trick, or cajole their sons and daughters to return to marriage and householder
              life. There’s the poem of Subha, the goldsmith’s daughter, whose relatives
              offered her gold coins and bullion to leave the monastic sangha. In fact, the
              Buddha instituted the celibacy rule for monks and nuns—a fundamental practice
              for dissolving sensual passion—in direct response to a monk whose family
              persuaded him to sleep with his former wife.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Nowhere in the Buddha’s teachings did he forbid laypeople
              from having sex, or tell them that celibacy was a prerequisite to pursuing the
              path to awakening. To the contrary, the canon is full of anecdotes about the
              benefits of practice within the bounds of a stable, respectful relationship.
              The late Thai master Ajahn Maha Boowa likened conjugal sensuality to a kitchen
              fire: “Both are necessary to establishing and maintaining a successful family,”
              he said. “Marriage is necessarily a sexual partnership, while a kitchen fire is
              indispensable for preparing the family’s food. If both are used carefully, with
              proper circumspection, they can sufficiently fulfill people’s basic needs in
              life.” Certainly Buddhists in such a successful union can attest to the power
              of the bond to keep you on the straight and narrow, in a good way; a safe arena
              from which to observe the lure of outside influences—lust and other
              distractions—as they arise and pass away. Families in the 21st century come in
              infinite variety, and there are all kinds of units in which to be emotionally
              content and spiritually engaged, including couples that have decided to be
              celibate for the sake of religious practice.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">While a celibate life may appear drastically reduced from the
              outside, the renunciate’s inner life blossoms and expands exponentially.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But while the Buddha left laypeople to make their own choices
              in the realm of sex and romance, his view on celibacy for monastics was crystal
              clear. He taught that sexual activity is part and parcel of craving
              (kama-tanha, the craving for sensuality), described in the second noble truth
              as the cause of suffering, a source of clinging and attachment (upadana, or
              attachment to sensual pleasure), a hindrance to meditation and a fetter or
              obstruction to liberation. More obstructive than the object of desire itself is
              the mental activity we generate around it—the constant thinking and planning
              and anticipation about how we get the goods. When sex is involved, kama-tanha
              is a given. When sex is not involved, it can be easier to see how kama-tanha
              takes over. The Pali term for “celibacy” (in striking contrast to our own word)
              is brahmacariya, meaning to behave, or walk, in a divine or sublime way.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Throughout the discourses, the Buddha hammers home the
              drawbacks of sensuality. The Potaliya Sutta, for instance, uses a series of
              analogies to describe the frustration of seeking reliable happiness in sense
              pleasure. “Suppose a dog, overcome with weakness and hunger, were to come
              across a slaughterhouse, and there a dexterous butcher or butcher’s apprentice
              were to fling him a chain of bones—thoroughly scraped, without any flesh,
              smeared with blood. What do you think: Would the dog, gnawing on that chain of
              bones—thoroughly scraped, without any flesh, smeared with blood—appease its
              weakness and hunger?” Because those bones offered nothing of substance, and
              like all worldly things are impermanent, the dog, we understand, “would get
              nothing but its share of weariness and vexation.” (All translations by
              Thanissaro Bhikkhu.)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">I can’t pinpoint when I realized I could stop gnawing on that
              particular chain of bones, that living singly and without sex was my ticket out
              of a lot of weariness and vexation, and that it made me happier than any
              romantic relationship I’d ever had. That I could make a vow to myself to remain
              in this state. Eliminating sex and romance—and more significantly, the thinking
              about and pursuit of those things—from my list of concerns opened up tremendous
              mental space that for most of my life had been given over to strategizing,
              analyzing, regretting, and agonizing. I was inspired by monks and nuns I know,
              and by the Buddha’s promise that while a celibate life may appear drastically
              reduced from the outside, the renunciate’s inner life blossoms and expands
              exponentially. My existence as an urban working mother precludes most of what
              monks and nuns do in the course of a day, but this is a piece of monastic life,
              along with meditation and seclusion, that I can practice in the privacy of my
              own home.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Mind you, I have had my cake and eaten it, too. I had
              relationships, licit and not, bore two children I’m crazy about, and didn’t
              give celibacy serious thought until I’d consumed a life’s worth of experiences.
              For most people, foregoing sex in the teens or twenties or thirties, when we
              marinate in hormones and hear the loud tick of our biological clocks, is a
              commitment of a different order, one I never considered touching at that age.
              In the time I’ve considered myself a Buddhist, I’ve done an awful lot of things
              that Buddhists shouldn’t do.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">When I was younger, getting drunk, killing bugs, taking
              supplies from the office, telling lies, and sleeping with people I had no
              business sleeping with were all part of the relatively normal landscape of my
              days. Even the seemingly neutral activity of partnering up—cohabitating, then
              getting married—often went hand in hand with secrecy, deceit, resentment, and
              dissatisfaction. I somehow thought I could embrace the precepts intellectually
              and follow them when it was convenient. (There’s no shortage of popular Western
              Buddhist teachings that tout the precepts as suggestions, not absolutes.)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">It took me a long time to see how thoroughly I was making
              myself suffer—and that I was dragging my loved ones along with me. I was a
              meditator, but like the worst horse in the parable, I couldn’t take a hint from
              the flick of a whip. Finally, though, I began to pay attention to the lash
              ripping my flesh, tearing all the way to the bone. Sticking to the precepts
              requires constant self-monitoring, discernment, and effort, but there comes a
              point when the practicality, the boon, of the thing sinks into the organic body
              and saturates one’s actions. Violating the precepts gets harder to do.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Copping to the fact that I could drop the project of
              romance—and that it could enhance my ability to follow the path—was like being
              unzipped from a straitjacket I didn’t know I was wearing. Or more to the point,
              it was like discovering I carried around a weapon with which I was constantly
              shooting myself, and then suddenly seeing I could put it down. I felt a
              profound sense of safety and assuredness in letting go the idea that I should
              couple up. Indeed, a sense of security is a major goal of celibacy: The Buddha
              extols that quality in the Mahamangala Sutta, the sermon on great protection or
              blessing:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Austerity, celibacy, </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">seeing the Noble Truths, </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">realizing Unbinding:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">This is the highest protection.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Elsewhere, celibacy is described as leading to “freedom from
              danger, freedom from animosity, freedom from oppression to limitless numbers of
              beings.” My teacher often describes how the celibacy of monastics is designed
              to make everyone feel secure. Like Caesar’s wife, who had to look pure as well
              as be pure, the chaste comportment of monks and nuns helps assure the laity
              that they are trustworthy and creates conditions for the laity to be
              trustworthy, too.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In my time of being celibate, I’ve experienced a sense of
              levity and ease I never knew before. Encounters and relationships with other
              people, however complex, carry so much less of the murky ambivalence they might
              once have involved—much of the fantasizing and projection, my internal
              jockeying and feeding, is diminished. I’m reminded of a computer game called
              Minecraft, a favorite of my son and his cronies, in which you explore, do
              battle, and build constructions in a 3D world of textured cubes that generates
              itself incessantly, ad infinitum—like a digital version of the mind’s
              effluence. Players can use “resource packs,” bundles of files that modify
              colors, textures, sound, and type in a Minecraft world. Being celibate has been
              like getting a really good resource pack—the game looks and feels entirely
              different. My concentration has become more stable, and some of the energy in
              my body seems to have transformed into a deeper, brighter vitality.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Our society celebrates the ideal of sexual pleasure above all
              other forms of gratification—it is the fiery engine of consumer culture and
              permeates every aspect of cultural production. In that context, celibacy mostly
              has a bad rap. Certainly delusion and repression like to masquerade as
              chastity. And in many religious settings, most notably the Catholic Church, but
              in plenty of Buddhist centers, too, a counterfeit celibacy has coincided with
              staggering abuse and exploitation. In theory and practice, celibacy can tell us
              lot about who we are. “It gives us insight into a culture’s worldview, social
              values, gender relations, ethical implication, religious roles or offices,
              conception of the physical body, and its connections to its practitioner’s
              connection to spiritual and religious power,” writes Carl Olson, a professor of
              religious studies at Allegheny College, in Celibacy and Religious Traditions.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In her freewheeling survey of the subject, The History of
              Celibacy, the Canadian historian Elizabeth Abbot describes the special relief
              from sexism and patriarchy that religious celibacy held for women. In early
              Christianity, for example, “women seize[d] on this new doctrine as a tool to
              emancipate themselves from the drudgery of marriage and childbearing.
              Determinedly celibate, they transformed themselves into independent people who
              traveled extensively, studied at a time when education was a male preserve,
              wrote, preached, and directed their own lives, frequently in the company of
              like-spirited chaste women or men.” Amma Sarah, a 5th-century Desert Mother
              [nomadic Christian ascetic], described the relentless pressure she felt to
              marry and live the life of a householder: “If I prayed God that all people
              should approve of my conduct,” she wrote, “I should find myself a penitent at
              the door of each one, but I shall rather pray that my heart may be pure toward
              all.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Of course, the Buddha’s female disciples had figured this out
              half a millennium earlier. Some of the saltiest poetry in the Therigatha is
              attributed to awakened nuns who formerly were married. This is “Mutta”
              speaking:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">So freed! So thoroughly freed am I! —</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">from three crooked things set free:</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">A nun known as “Sumangala’s Mother,” too, lists the shackles
              of domesticity—particularly her “moldy old pot with the water snake smell”—high
              on the list of conditions she gleefully jettisoned on the path.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">For all the variety of sexual experience in our world, and in
              spite of the fact that lots of us adopt celibacy in middle age, it is a topic
              surprisingly hard to research, and I have encountered few other lay Buddhists
              living as I do (though I think they’re out there). Even the Internet, fairly
              glutted with Christian sites advancing the virtues of celibacy, reveals little
              reportage on celibacy in Buddhist lay practice, though I did find one
              thoughtful blog post called “Why Celibacy Is Awesome” and another that listed,
              among the top reasons to forgo sexual relationships, how the celibate can stop
              wasting money on “expensive and uncomfortable lingerie.” (We can cultivate
              well-being and blameless conduct, and save money at the same time? Sign me up.)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">When monks and nuns take the vow of celibacy, they don’t go
              it alone. They are gathered up into the sangha and inexorably build close
              relationships with other monastics. There are strategies shared for stanching
              lust and doubt, and time in meditation to deconstruct the fabrication of
              desire, and nobody thinks it’s weird. Taking a similar step as a layperson can
              be lonely and isolating. When a friend who is a dharma teacher fields questions
              from students about whether or not they should take up celibacy, he cautions
              them to examine their intention very carefully. “Is this something they’re
              really ready for? Or are they using it to distance themselves from something
              painful?” The lexicon of attachment theory would term this an “avoidant.”
              Indeed, the mettle of the ego needs to be intact before we transform our social
              lives to serve our spiritual aspirations.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">I do sometimes wonder if this state will feel different when
              my children have left home and I don’t have the constant warmth of their
              presence, and my attention is no longer drawn into the spinning orbits of their
              everyday lives. I also wonder about the pitfalls of what the Buddha called
              bhava—the formation of identity around a desire—inherent in being celibate. If
              I was once intoxicated with sex and built an identity around seeking and
              getting sensual pleasure, do I now risk being intoxicated with my lack of
              attachment to romance, and fueling my ego with that? Another dimension of my
              situation that gives me slight pause is that I’m not providing my kids much in
              the way of a role model for their own future partnering. Children learn to
              navigate relationships—any kind of relationship—in seeing adults interact
              skillfully. Mostly, mine see me alone. Still, when I let go of the worry and
              projection, I know that signing up for eHarmony is no guarantee of a pleasant
              future for any of us (I’d wager the opposite), and I hope seeing that coupledom
              is not the only path to fulfillment, and having a mother who is content, may be
              another kind of benefit to them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">I succumb, often unconsciously, to all kinds of sensuality—my
              fondness for pressing the snooze button on the morning alarm comes immediately
              to mind—but the strength I’ve gotten from other aspects of practice, including
              my vow of celibacy, is the inspiration to keep battling my kilesas, or
              defilements. I recall hearing a monk answer a student’s questions about whether
              there’s a difference between indulging in the sense pleasure of sex, and the
              sense pleasure of eating sweets. Aren’t they just points on the spectrum of
              craving, she asked? Yes, he replied, but they involve vastly different degrees
              of entanglement. “Look at it this way: I’ve known several people who were
              widely considered to be arahants [enlightened beings],” he said. “None of them
              had sex, but they all ate dessert.”</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Arahantship, I’m quite sure, won’t figure in my near future,
              perhaps not even in my near future lives. But I will take my cues from the
              noble ones: I’m going to enjoy my profiteroles, in moderation, and skip the
              fornication. Celibacy or no, happiness comes and goes. My householder world
              still beckons. The moldy old pot with the water snake (or, in this case,
              spaghetti sauce) smell sits waiting in the sink. The kids have their homework
              and their stresses and demands. My rent is overdue. But the evening ahead, and
              my mind and my breath, are all mine.</span></p>
