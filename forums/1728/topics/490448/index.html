              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Simply stated, female
                  ginkgos stink. This is not a sexist remark if you’re addressing a dioecious
                  tree — simplified, a tree that grows either male or female flowers on separate
                  plants. The male ginkgo bears no fruit, but those of the female are uniquely
                  malodorous. They have been likened to vegetal vomit (the acrid scent
                  attributable to butyric acid in the soft outer parts of the fruit), and though
                  hard to appreciate, it imparts some adaptive value to the ginkgo fruit —
                  attracting or discouraging interest.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.4375rem; text-align: justify;">Near the corner of Avenue U and 23rd Street, not
                  far from where I grew up in Brooklyn, a female ginkgo tree was planted where a
                  male tree was undoubtedly intended. The sheer abundance of this tree’s fruits
                  each autumn required herculean feats just to walk past. Holding my breath, I’d
                  sprint by the tree and the dozens of rank yellow fruits that lay like stink
                  bombs all around it. My first encounter with the ginkgo was while running an
                  errand to my parent’s preferred Chinese laundry, located around the corner.
                  Having passed the stench, I opened the shop’s door only to find an overflowing
                  bag of the horrid little fruits on the counter — the owner still beaming with
                  delight at this locavore bumper crop.</span></p>
              <p class="story-body-text" style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.4375rem; max-width: 540px;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>It was years later that I discovered the tree
                  was a ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba), a species that is the sole living descendant of
                  an ancient lineage. When dinosaurs roamed the earth, trees very like the modern
                  ginkgo provided them food and cover.</span></p>
              <p class="story-body-text" style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.4375rem; max-width: 540px;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>Consequently, the plants have some very odd
                  attributes, including one particularly vivid reproductive strategy. Like cycads
                  —<span> </span><a href="http://dendro.cnre.vt.edu/forsite/idtype.htm"><span style="color: #326891;">their
                  gymnosperm relatives</span></a><span> </span>—
                  and ferns, the ginkgo produces motile sperm. This is not metaphoric sperm: This
                  very stationary tree produces a wriggling, swimming sperm cell capable of
                  fertilizing female ginkgo ovules.</span></p>
              <p id="story-continues-2" class="story-body-text" style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.4375rem; max-width: 540px;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>Ginkgos (from a
                  distance, at least) are beautiful trees with bisected, fan-shaped leaves that
                  turn golden in October. The tree is considered sacred in several Buddhist
                  traditions and was cultivated in and near temples for generations. In fact, the
                  tree was originally thought to be extinct in the wild until two populations
                  were located in China. Such native ginkgos remain rare, with a preference for
                  rich, streamside habitats.</span></p>
              <p id="story-continues-3" class="story-body-text" style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.4375rem; max-width: 540px;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>By contrast, as a street
                  tree, the naturalized ginkgo is uncommonly sturdy. Very drought-tolerant, it
                  can survive, root-bound in a tree pit, a number of insults: air pollution, poor
                  soil, pet waste and the constant salting of roads. The ginkgo may be one of the
                  world’s toughest trees — in fact, six are known to have survived the atomic
                  bomb and still grow in or near Hiroshima, Japan.</span></p>
              <p class="story-body-text" style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.4375rem; max-width: 540px;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>I can only guess what
                  the owner of the Chinese laundry was preparing to do with her collected ginkgo
                  fruits, but some simple recipes can be found on the Internet for those who wish
                  to pursue such a culinary adventure. It is important to note that the fleshy
                  outer part of the fruit (the sarcotesta) can cause skin irritation in some
                  individuals, so wearing rubber gloves is recommended while digging out the
                  edible inner seed. Some also react to the nuts, so limiting the quantity
                  consumed is probably wise.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;">A new mother is also faced with the stress of integrating the intense needs of a new baby into her lifestyle while tending to her mate and perhaps other children and returning to work. All of these responsibilities that women ?? and those who are cared for by them ?? have taken for<a href="http://www.healthcaresups.com/cerebrrin-scam/">Cerebrrin</a>ranted for millennia demand high??quality nutrients. Our food supply presently contains only half the nutrients that food contained in the 1940s due to the nutrient depletions in our soil. This fact makes it very difficult, if not impossible, for a mother to fully replenish the nutrient reserves her body donated to make her baby's body solely from the food she eats. Eating highly refined and processed "junk" foods further depletes vital nutrients, which deepens the need to replenish postnatal nutrients even more.</p>
