              Enlightenment <br> Khunu Lama Rinpoche </span>
              </p><p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';"><br> Before listening to this teaching, first cultivate bodhicitta, thinking, "I 
                want to receive enlightenment for the benefit of all mother sentient beings." 
                In other words, before listening to teachings, it is necessary to think of, 
                to remember, all mother sentient beings. <br> The subject today is Lam-drön, A Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment, which 
                was written in Tibet by Atisha, who was also called Dipamkara Shrijnana, who 
                was born the son of a Bengali king. Bengal is in northeast India. <br> Buddhadharma had already been established in Tibet before Atisha's arrival there, 
                but an evil king called Langdarma (Udumtsen), who was said to have horns growing 
                from his head, hated the Dharma and cause it to degenerate in Tibet. But even 
                though the teachings had been corrupted, they still existed, but not as purely 
                as before. It took about sixty years to restore the teachings to their original 
                purity in what became known as the later spreading of the Dharma in Tibet. <br> How that happened was that in western Tibet, in the kingdom of Gugé, 
                there lived a Tibetan king, Lha Lama Yeshe Ö, and his nephew, Jangchub 
                Ö. They decided to invite a learned and realized teacher from the great 
                Indian monastery of Vikramashila to spread Dharma in Tibet. When they investigated 
                to see who was the most learned and realized person there, they discovered that 
                Atisha would be by far the best one to invite. <br> But before Lha Lama Yeshe Ö could request Atisha to come from Vikramashila 
                to Tibet, he needed to find gold to make a proper offering, so went to a place 
                called Garlog in search of it. But the ruler of Garlog threw him in prison, 
                where he died. In that way, Lha Lama Yeshe Ö he sacrificed his life to 
                bring Atisha to Tibet. <br> Then his nephew, Jangchub Ö, sent emissaries to India to invite Atisha 
                to Tibet. When he finally met Atisha, he explained how the Dharma there had 
                degenerated during Langdarma's rule and how correct teachings no longer existed 
                in Tibet. He requested Atisha to write the precious teaching, A Lamp for the 
                Path to Enlightenment, to give fundamental teachings to the Tibetan people because 
                they were so ignorant. He requested Atisha to explain about refuge, bodhicitta 
                and so forth. Therefore, Atisha wrote the precious teaching, A Lamp for the 
                Path to Enlightenment, the source of all the Gelug lam-rim texts, as well as 
                those of the Sakya and the other schools of Tibetan Buddhism, who all practice 
                the graduated path to enlightenment and quote the Lam-drön in their teachings. 
                Furthermore, the Lam-drön is based on the Prajnaparamita teachings of Shakyamuni 
                Buddha. <br> After generating bodhicitta, our main task is to attain enlightenment. Now, 
                even though we might think that life in samsara is pleasant, it's not. There 
                is no true pleasure in samsara. Enlightenment can be attained only through the 
                practice of Dharma. Therefore, we should all practice Dharma. <br> In terms of teachings in general, there are two types: Buddhadharma and the 
                teachings of the mu-teg-pa (Skt: tirthika) [See Meditation on Emptiness, pp. 
                320-21.] The latter are teachings based on mistaken beliefs, an understanding 
                opposite to that of Buddhadharma - teachings followed by outsiders. By following 
                such non-Buddhist teachings, you can be born anywhere from the lower realms 
                to the peak of samsara, the highest of the four formless realms, but can never 
                escape samsara. <br> Within the Buddhadharma, there are also two divisions: Hinayana and Mahayana. 
                By following Hinayana teachings, you can escape from samsara but cannot attain 
                enlightenment. To attain enlightenment, you have to practice Mahayana teachings. 
                Within the Mahayana, there are the teachings spoken by the Buddha himself and 
                those recorded later by the learned followers of the Buddha, the great Indian 
                pandits. Included in the latter are such teachings as those written by the six 
                great pandits, the ornaments of the world. Then there are also the teachings 
                written by learned Tibetan masters. The teaching we are discussing here is that 
                written by the learned pandit Dipamkara Shrijnana. <br> What does the Lam-drön contain? It derives from the Abhisamayalankara and 
                explains the three levels of teaching: the paths of the lower, intermediate 
                and highest practitioner, especially that of the highest. <br> The text opens with the title of this teaching in Sanskrit, which in Tibetan 
                is Jang-chub lam-gyi drön-ma. This is followed by homage to Manjushri. 
                <br> 1. The first verse includes three things. First there is homage to the Triple 
                Gem: the buddhas of the three times, the oral teachings and realization of them, 
                and the sangha-those who have received the unshakable, or noble, path. Second, 
                he mentions that his pure disciple, Jangchub Ö, requested him to give this 
                teaching. Third, he makes the promise, or vow, to write this teaching, this 
                lamp for the path to enlightenment, the Lam-drön. <br> 2. In the second verse, Atisha explains what he's going to write about: the 
                graduated paths of the persons of least, intermediate and greatest capacity. 
                These are also the paths that Lama Tsong Khapa explains in his short, middle-length 
                and great lam-rim teachings; in the various lam-rim teachings of Lama Tsong 
                Khapa, he, too, explains the graduated paths of the persons of least, intermediate 
                and greatest capacity. <br> 3. Of the three levels of follower, Atisha first explains the graduated path 
                of those of least capacity. Such people think, "I don't care what suffering 
                or happiness I experience in this life; I must avoid rebirth in the lower realms 
                and attain an upper rebirth." With this in mind, beings of least capacity 
                abstain from negative actions and practice virtue. <br> 4. Persons of intermediate capacity develop aversion to not only the sufferings 
                of the three lower realms but also to those of the upper realms; to the whole 
                of samsara. Such practitioners abstain from negative actions in order to free 
                themselves from samsara, without concern for other sentient beings. <br> 5. Who, then, are the beings of greatest capacity? They are those who, having 
                understood their own suffering, take it as an example of the suffering that 
                other beings are also experiencing and generate the great wish of wanting to 
                put an end to the suffering of all sentient beings. <br> 6-11. There are six preparatory practices. First, visualize the merit field 
                and make offerings. Then kneel down with your hands in prostration and take 
                refuge in the Triple Gem. After that, generate love for other sentient beings 
                by thinking of the sufferings of death, old age, sickness and rebirth as well 
                as the three sufferings and the general suffering of samsara. In that way, generate 
                bodhicitta. <br> 12-17. It is necessary to generate the aspiration to attain enlightenment, and 
                the benefits of doing so have been explained in the sutra called Array of Trunks. 
                Atisha also quotes three verses from another sutra, the Sutra Requested by Viradatta, 
                to further explain the benefits of bodhicitta. <br> 18-19. There are two types of bodhicitta, relative and absolute. Within the 
                category of relative there are two further divisions, the bodhicitta of aspiration-wanting 
                to receive enlightenment for the benefit of other sentient beings, thinking, 
                "Without my receiving enlightenment, I cannot enlighten others"-and 
                the bodhicitta of engagement, actually following the bodhisattva's path by taking 
                the bodhisattva precepts and engaging in the actions of a bodhisattva, thinking, 
                "In order to engage in positive actions and avoid negative ones, I am going 
                to practice the six perfections." <br> 20-21. The teachings explain that in order to practice engaged bodhicitta, we 
                should take the bodhisattva ordination, but in order to do so we should hold 
                one of the seven levels of pratimoksha ordination, such as gelong, gelongma, 
                getsul, getsulma and so forth. Ideally, then, we should hold one of these fundamental 
                ordinations before taking the bodhisattva vow, but the learned ones say that 
                in general, those who avoid negative karma and create virtuous actions can receive 
                bodhicitta, even if they don't hold any pratimoksha precepts. <br> 22. The bodhicitta of aspiration can be generated without dependence upon a 
                lama, but engaged bodhicitta depends on a lama. To find a lama from whom we 
                can take the bodhisattva vow, we have to know the qualifications of such a lama. 
                <br> 23-24. First, the lama should know all about the ordination and how to bestow 
                it. He should have compassion for the disciple and himself be living in the 
                bodhisattva ordination. That's the kind of lama we need to find in order to 
                take the ordination. But what if we can't find a perfect lama like that? Atisha 
                then goes on to explain what we should do in that case. <br> 25-31. The Ornament of Manjushri's Buddha Land Sutra explains how, long ago, 
                Manjushri received bodhicitta. This is what we can do. Visualize the merit field 
                and all the buddhas and generate bodhicitta, the wish to receive enlightenment. 
                Then promise, "I invite all sentient beings as my guest to the sublime 
                happiness of liberation and enlightenment. I will not get angry or harbor avarice, 
                covetousness, jealousy and so forth. I will not harm other sentient beings in 
                any way. I will live in pure discipline by avoiding all negative actions, even 
                worldly desires and sense objects of attachment, such as attractive sounds and 
                beautiful forms and so forth. I shall give up such things. As all the buddhas 
                have followed pure moral conduct, so shall I. <br> "I will not try to receive enlightenment for myself alone. Even though 
                it takes and endless amount of time to work for even one sentient being, I shall 
                remain in samsara. I shall make pure the impure realms of sentient beings, places 
                where there are thorns, rocks and ugly mountains. I shall also purify my three 
                doors of body, speech and mind and keep them pure. I shall create no negative 
                actions from now on." <br> 32-35. The best way of keeping our three doors pure is by generating the bodhicitta 
                of aspiration and engaging in bodhicitta and following the path to enlightenment. 
                This depends on observing the three different levels of moral conduct. If we 
                do this properly, we can complete the two collections of merit and transcendent 
                wisdom. One thing that really helps us complete these two collections is the 
                ability to foresee the future, therefore we should try to acquire clairvoyance. 
                Without it, we are like a baby bird that has not yet grown feathers and whose 
                wings are undeveloped, and remains stuck in its nest, unable to fly. Without 
                clairvoyance, we cannot work for other sentient beings. <br> 36-37. The person who has achieved the psychic power to foresee the future can 
                create more merit in a day than a person who does not have this ability can 
                create in a hundred years. Therefore, to complete the collections of merit and 
                transcendent wisdom quickly, it is necessary to acquire the psychic power to 
                see past, present and future. <br> 38. In order to do this, it is necessary to achieve samadhi-single-pointed concentration. 
                For this, we must understand the details of the method of attaining samadhi, 
                such as the nine stages, the six powers and the four mental engagements. [See 
                Opening the Eye of New Awareness pp. 53-66.] <br> 39. In order to practice samadhi meditation properly, we must ensure that the 
                conditions are perfect. If they are not, then even though we try practicing 
                it hard for even a thousand years, we'll never achieve it. Therefore, we should 
                find a perfect environment, remain quiet and avoid having to do work such as 
                healing the ill and making astrological predictions-any activity that keeps 
                us busy. <br> 40. The way to meditate to attain single-pointed concentration is to focus our 
                mind on a virtuous object, such as an image of the Buddha. Visualize such an 
                image in front of us and simply concentrate on that. As we focus our mind on 
                the object again and again, we'll be able to hold it for increasingly greater 
                periods of time, and through the continuity of such practice will eventually 
                attain calm abiding (shamatha) and single-pointed concentration. Thus we will 
                gain ngön-she or, literally, higher seeing, the psychic power to see the 
                future and so forth. <br> 41-43. But that is not the point. Next we have to practice lhag-tong, or vipashyana-penetrative 
                insight. Without it, our samadhi cannot remove our delusions. In order to eradicate 
                our two levels of obscuration-the obscurations of delusion (nyön-drib) 
                and the obscurations to knowledge (she-drib)- we must achieve the wisdom realizing 
                the non-self-existence of the I. Doing so also depends upon achieving method, 
                such as compassion and so forth. It's a mistake to practice only wisdom and 
                not method. This can lead us to fall into individual liberation, the lower nirvana. 
                Similarly, practicing only method and not wisdom is also a mistake and causes 
                us to remain in samsara. <br> 44-46. The Buddha taught that of the six perfections, the last of the six is 
                the path of wisdom and the first five-charity, morality, patience, effort and 
                concentration-are the path of method, or skillful means (Tib: thab). First, 
                we should meditate on method, then on wisdom, then on both together. By practicing 
                both together, we can receive enlightenment; by practicing the wisdom of selflessness 
                alone, we can't. <br> 47-49. Realizing the five aggregates (Skt: skandhas), the twelve sources and 
                the eighteen constituents as empty of self-existence is recognized as higher 
                wisdom. There is existence and non-existence: there is no such thing as the 
                production of the existent, nor is there such a thing as production of the non-existent. 
                There is no such thing as production of both existent and non-existent, nor 
                is there production of neither existent nor non-existent. That is one form of 
                logic negating the production of both the existent and the non-existent. There 
                is also another form of logic negating production of a thing from self, other, 
                both or neither-the four extremes. The main thing to discover here is non-self-existence. 
                That can be found through the first line of logical reasoning, which negates 
                production of the existent and the non-existent, and through the second, which 
                negates production of the four extremes. <br> 50-51. It can also be discovered through a third line of reasoning that examines 
                things to see whether they are one or many. These lines of reasoning are elaborated 
                by Nagarjuna in his Seventy Stanzas on Emptiness and in other texts such as 
                his Treatise on the Middle Way. <br> 52-54. These things are explained in those texts, but here they are mentioned 
                just for the purpose of practicing meditation. Meditating on the non-self-existence 
                of the I and the non-self-existence of all other phenomena is meditation on 
                shunyata, or emptiness. When the wisdom realizing emptiness analyzes the subject 
                and the object, it cannot discover self-existence in either of those. Moreover, 
                it cannot find self-existence in the wisdom of emptiness. Thus, we realize the 
                emptiness of even the wisdom of emptiness itself. <br> 55-58. Since this world is created by superstition (Tib: nam-tog) [conceptuality], 
                if we eradicate the creator, superstition, we can attain liberation. The Buddha 
                said that it is superstition that causes us to fall into the ocean of samsara. 
                Therefore, that which is to be avoided is superstition, but the emptiness of 
                superstition, which is like the sky, like empty space, is that which is to be 
                practiced. By achieving this, we will be able to see the absolute nature of 
                existence. Therefore, the bodhisattvas' practice is to avoid superstition and 
                thus to achieve the non-superstitious mind. Through the various different means 
                of logic-by realizing the emptiness of the produced and of inherent existence-we 
                can avoid superstition and achieve the wisdom of shunyata. <br> 59. Then we can also attain the different levels of the path of preparation 
                (Tib: jor-lam), the second of the five paths. We attain the four levels of this 
                path and gradually the ten bhumis (Tib: sa), or bodhisattva grounds, as well. 
                Finally, we attain the eleventh level, enlightenment itself. <br> 60-67. Having realized shunyata, we can also gain the general realizations of 
                tantra, such as the four powers of pacification, wrath, control and increase, 
                and other attainments, such as accomplishing the "good pot." Accomplishing 
                the good pot means doing a particular meditation in retreat for a long time, 
                and if you are successful, just by putting your mouth to the opening of a pot 
                and saying something like, "May I become the king of this country," 
                your wish will be fulfilled-in this case, you will become king of that country. 
                Or, we can gain the tantric power of "eye medicine." By accomplishing 
                this technique, if you apply this ointment to your eye, you can see such things 
                as gold, jewels and other precious things even hundreds of miles beneath the 
                surface of the earth; no matter how far away it is, you can see it. <br> By practicing tantra, we can receive enlightenment without the need of much 
                austere practice. The tantric was to enlightenment is through happiness, while 
                other paths to enlightenment are through hard, austere practice. <br> There are four different level of tantra, such as highest yoga tantra and so 
                forth; four different aspects of the tantric teaching. So, first we have to 
                receive initiation. In order to do so, we have to make material offerings, such 
                as gold, or even members of your family; a spouse, or a sibling, requesting 
                our guru for the initiation with great devotion. If our guru is pleased, he 
                will then give us the initiation out of his compassion. Having taken an initiation, 
                we also receive the great fortune of being able to receive enlightenment and 
                all these high realizations that come with it. <br> There are four different initiations: the vase, secret, transcendent wisdom 
                and word initiations, the latter being where the guru imparts clarification, 
                or proof, through verbal explanation. However, the secret initiation should 
                not be given to those living in ordination. If monks, for example, take the 
                secret initiation, they have to leave the monastic order, because those who 
                have taken the secret initiation are required to practice with a female consort. 
                If they do these practices without first returning their ordination, they lose 
                it, the consequence of which is rebirth in the hells. <br> To receive tantric commentaries, you first have to receive initiation. Without 
                initiation, you cannot receive tantric teachings. You also cannot perform pujas 
                of burnt offering or give tantric teachings. <br> 68. In the last verse, Atisha closes this text by describing himself as an elder 
                (Tib: nä-tän), a full monk who, in the first twelve years after taking 
                ordination, hasn't created any moral falls; a senior full monk. He states that 
                he has briefly explained the teaching on the steps of path as requested by his 
                noble follower, Jangchub Ö. <br> Conclusion <br> Every lam-rim teaching ever written refers back to this text, A Lamp for the 
                Path, irrespective of the Tibetan Buddhist tradition; not only Gelug, but also 
                Nyingma, Kagyu and Sakya. Where does the Lamp itself refer back to? That is 
                to the prajnaparamita teachings. In terms of prajnaparamita texts, there are 
                elaborate, intermediate and short, but the author of all of them is the Buddha. 
                Therefore, all lam-rim texts have their source in the teachings of the Buddha. 
                <br> If you want to understand the lam-rim well, you should study it as extensively 
                as possible. When you understand the lam-rim well, you will understand the Lamp 
                for the Path. Once you do, you should teach it all over the world. Even within 
                the Mahayana tradition, the teaching has many aspects, but in general, it contains 
                great knowledge. The main thing, however, the fundamental thing, is concern 
                for others, working for others, benefiting others. Followers of the Hinayana 
                are concerned with only their own samsaric suffering; in order to escape it, 
                they follow the path of the three higher trainings: higher conduct, higher concentration 
                and higher wisdom. But there are many ways in which the Mahayana is different 
                from and higher than the Hinayana, many ways in which this can be explained, 
                but the main difference is that Mahayana practitioners are more concerned with 
                working for the welfare of others than their own. <br> People nowadays might think of helping other people, but Mahayana practitioners 
                benefit not only other people but also suffering hell beings, pretas, animals 
                and every other sentient being. There is not one sentient being who has not 
                been our mother; all sentient beings have been our mother numberless times, 
                therefore, we should be concerned for their welfare, wanting them to become 
                enlightened as quickly as possible. This, then, is the fundamental difference 
                between the Hinayana and the Mahayana, this concern more for others than oneself, 
                in particular, the wish to enlighten all sentient beings. That's what makes 
                the difference. <br> It is excellent that you are studying the vast and profound teachings of the 
                Mahayana, thinking about them, analyzing them intently, and you should continue 
                to do so. In general, there are many religions and everyone thinks that the 
                teaching of his or her own religion is the best. But just saying that one's 
                own religion is the best doesn't prove it's the best; that doesn't mean anything. 
                Therefore, simply saying that Buddhadharma is the best religion in the world 
                doesn't make it so. However, there are many logical reasons you can use to prove 
                that Buddhadharma is, in fact, the best. <br> For example, even accepting and practicing bodhicitta is very different from 
                not practicing bodhicitta. Even in this, there's a big difference between Buddhism 
                and other religions; the fact of the presence of the practice of bodhicitta 
                shows that Buddhism is higher than other religions, that Buddhism is the best. 
                Buddhism also talks about dependent origination and emptiness; it explains dependent 
                origination as it exists, right there. So, not only in conduct but also in view, 
                Buddhism is very different from other religions and therefore the best. There 
                are many ways to prove this. <br> However, Buddhadharma is something that the more and more you study it, the 
                deeper and deeper it becomes, the more and more profound you find it to be. 
                This is a quality unique to Buddhadharma. With other teachings, the more you 
                study them, the lighter they become. <br> If you have understood any of what I have taught here, keep it in mind and build 
                upon it. When you have understood more, keep that as your foundation and build 
                further upon that. In this way, your knowledge will continually increase. Then, 
                like the sun rising, spread Dharma in the West. <br> There are many countries, such as Vietnam, where Buddhism existed for centuries, 
                but none were like Tibet. In those countries, there existed only one aspect 
                of the Buddhadharma, not all, but in Tibet, all the aspects of the teaching 
                existed, Hinayana, Sutrayana and Vajrayana. In order to study all this, you 
                should learn the Tibetan language, study its grammar, and follow your lama properly. 
                <br> [Dedication prayers are made and then the monks and nuns try to make offering 
                to Rinpoche.] <br> Please, don't offer me anything. I have enough to eat and drink; that's all 
                I need. The reason I have given you this teaching is not to receive something 
                but for you to practice purely. I'm not building monasteries or making offerings 
                to statues and so forth, so I have no need for money. I accept offerings only 
                when I lack for something. When I have enough, I don't accept offerings, especially 
                not from monks or nuns. My idea of wealth is different. Otherwise, teaching 
                and taking money is a bit like making business. For now, I just want you to 
                practice, but if things get bad and I don't have enough to eat or drink, then 
                maybe I'll accept something. <br> [Then everybody received a blessing from Rinpoche, one by one.] </span></p>
