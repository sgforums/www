              <p><em>Awareness is not like a mirror reflecting but rather a manifesation. Luminosity is an arising luminous manifestation rather than a mirror reflecting. The center here is being replaced with Dependent Origination, the experience however is non-dual.</em></p>

              <p><em>Conventionally we experience in the form of subject and object interaction taking place in a space-time continuum. This is just an assumption. Experientially it is not so.

All these are just provisional explanations for one to understand.</em></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>What seen is Awareness.  What heard is Awareness.  All experiences are non-dual in nature.  However this non-dual luminosity cannot be understood apart from the ‘causes and conditions’ of arising.  Therefore do not see ‘yin’ as Awareness interacting with external conditions.  If you see it as so, then it still falls in the category of mirror-reflecting.  Rather see it as an instantaneous manifestation where nothing excluded.  As if the universe is giving its very best for this moment to arise.  A moment is complete and non-dual.  Vividly manifest and thorough gone leaving no traces.</p>

              <p>I have just glanced through the last few posts. I have not read them in detail. If I am not wrong, there seems to be some discussion about the issue of Rangtongpa (intrinsic Emptiness) and Zhangtongpa (extrinsic Emptiness / Absolutism). This is a hotly debated issue in Tibetan Buddhism as well.</p>
              <p>As I am a stauch (Prasangika) Madhyamika, I am naturally a Rangtongpa. However, I do embrace the Zhangtongpa view abeit secondary to Rangtong. I believe that Rangtong and Zhangtong are not mutually exclusive. They can be reconciled / synthesized as a single coherent truth,<strong> though the Rangtong element still prevail over the Zhangtong.</strong></p>
              <p>As a strong adherent to Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka and Ju Mipham Namgyal Gyatso's understanding, I believe in the <strong>Emptiness of Emptiness</strong> rather than <strong>Emptiness as an absolute Truth.</strong> If Emptiness is being miscontrued as an Utimate Truth with an absolute ontological / metaphysical status, it will be reduced to a Creator God as in Islam or Brahman as in Hinduism.</p>
              <p>Emptiness is "Utimate" as a truth in the sense that everything is empty of its own being (including the tathagatagarbha), rather than being an Absolute Substratum from where the phenomenal world spring out. Emptiness is itself empty of own being for it is dependent on the conventional world / truth.</p>
              <p>Therefore, the relation between the Utimate and Conventional Truths (the Two Truths theory) must not be miscontrued as the former being "higher" than the latter. Most Buddhists have fallen into this trap.The two Truths should be taken as "two faces of the same coin".</p>
              <p>Just ask yourself "<strong>How can Emptiness be discerned without the conventional world?". </strong></p>
              <p>We should not let Buddhism to be reduced to Monotheism. We should not let Emptiness to be associated with Allah by the Muslim. If we the buddhists fail to see the Truth of Buddhism correctly, Buddhism will soon be subsumed / subordinated  by the Muslims. The Muslims had repeatedly claimed that Emptiness experienced by the Buddhists is Allah. Based on my observations, the muslim scholars had made great effort to transform and reinterpret Islam into a form closer to Buddhism by importing teachings from  Buddhism for this purpose. Sufism is a good example of such an adaptation. Their understanding of Allah has taken a pantheistic shift.  Please DO NOT misunderstand that the muslim scholars are trying to foster religious integration and harmony.Their objective is to make Islam the only TRUTH by subordinating Buddhism under it. They are trying to crush Buddhism by <strong>Blurring the line of differences.</strong></p>

              <p>But at the same time they serves as 'antidotes' or 'rafts' and 'skillful means' that can help overcome certain subtle attachments. Shentongpa is particularly helpful in overcoming the false view of nihilism, Rangtong is helpful in overcoming the false view of eternalism.</p>

              view to refute views outside Buddhism, those that lack an understanding

              <p>I have to agree with some of the very important
                          points you brought up. It is that ultimate reality easily becomes
                          misconstrued as a metaphysical essence, the subtrate of all phenomena,
                          the Absolute, Atman-Brahman, and so on.</p>
              <p>I seldom hear Muslims talk about the Buddhist realisation of Emptiness as realisation of Allah, unless perhaps of course, the Islamic mystics (Sufis) which are still a minority group among Muslims. (the article you pasted last time doesn't sound like it comes from the hands of a contemplative Muslim with transcendental experience, but rather IMHO shows very very little understanding of Buddhist teachings and lots of total mis-interpretation of scriptural meanings) But it is pretty clear to everyone who don't have dusty eyes that Buddhism outrightly rejects an external Creator.</p>
              <p>However, it gets more subtle than that, and the subtler we go the more confusing it becomes. Many of these mystics (like the Islamic Sufis) have 'transcendental experiences' and it is a common misunderstanding that this is the same realisation in all religions including Buddhism. To them, God is not an external Being as portrayed in the essay you posted previously, not an old man sitting up there waiting for you to have a cup of coffee with him, i.e. not a personal God but rather is the Pure Being that can be experienced through total surrender of the small, egoic self (for monotheistic path their path is by surrendering, and Islam literally means 'Surrender' or 'Submission'), whereby the self completely dissolves into the pure essence of God.</p>
              <p>God, to them, is basically the substance wherein thoughts and phenomena arise from and subsides to, while the substance itself remains unmoved and unaffected. While that view partially comes from true transcendental experience, it is partly due to our deep karmic conditoining/propensities at seeing dualistically and inherently which misinterpretes such transcendental experiences into an eternal, unchanging metaphysical essence. The insight into non-dual (no separation between substance and phenomena) and furthermore the insight into the Emptiness nature of Awareness is lacking.</p>

              <p>In this area Buddhism has thrown light into many subtleties that other religions/contemplative traditions [Hindu Advaita &amp; Kashmir Shaivism, Taoism, Judaist Kabbalah, Christian Mysticism, Islamic Sufism, and more] have overlooked. (more on that below)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As I wrote months ago:</p>
              <p><span class="MsgBodyText"><br> <br> On the surface it seems very similar. For example, Hinduism teaches
                          Self-realisation, Non-ego, and purportedly provides a path to
                          enlightenment and liberation for its followers. (Mystical) Taoism,
                          Christian Mysticism, Islamic Sufism, Judaist Kabbalah and so on are
                          also very similar.<br> <br> Because when we're talking about the core of religions, it's the
                          mystics/contemplatives that are the 'highest level' practitioners...
                          who seek to understand the truth of their religions not just by belief,
                          theories or even feelings/emotions (common religious seekers may have
                          powerful life-changing experiences or encounters with the divine
                          force/spirit, or miracles, but Spirit/God will always seem to be
                          "separate" from the "seeker" until they realise union/its true nature)
                          but by complete union with the true essence of god.<br> <br> But for the mystics, its a direct experience of the UNION with the
                          Divine Presence of God, or in Hinduism they call it the realisation of
                          the (true) Self, which is a non-personal Self, its the true self, the
                          God-self. "God-consciousness". It's a complete dissolving of any sense
                          of individuality into God/true-Self, a sort of non-dual experience (but
                          not the kind of non-duality in Buddhism) and realising the true
                          identity of luminous pure consciousness as God. It is an aspect of our
                          Buddha-Nature (explained below).<br> <br> In Hinduism its the identity of atman with Brahman (God, the Whole).
                          Means completely dropping false notions of self and become/realise the
                          true divine mind.<br> <br> In Christianity, Paul said: I no longer live, but Christ lives in me! (Gal. 2.20) -- see <a href="http://frimmin.com/faith/mysticismintro.php">http://frimmin.com/faith/mysticismintro.php</a><br> <br> In Taoism, Chuang Tzu calls it entering the Divine, the One. The Tao. And the forgetting of the 'self'.<br> <br> The falling away of self is common to all religions. But in Buddhism,
                          No-Self is not a state or stage of the falling away of the ego or
                          personality or a state of union with divine, it's actually a Dharma
                          Seal or the nature of reality. And, there is no identification with an
                          eternal witnessing consciousness as the Self, the view and experience
                          of other mystics.<br> <br> That means, almost all of those mystics experience
                          Consciousness/Awareness as an Eternal Watcher (which is God), a
                          non-judging and permanent watcher watching everything in life yet
                          remaining unaffected and unchanged. But when non-duality is realised,
                          it's seen that there is no Observer apart from Observed. The true face
                          of consciousness is seen. Scenery sees, there is no seer. Sound hears,
                          there is no hearer. Thought thinks, there is no thinker. All along the
                          transience rolls and knows; no separate watcher is real or needed.<br> <br> As an example, the Hindu Advaita-Vedantins when they experience pure
                          consciousness, they will make Consciousness into a permanent
                          luminous-void background reality where phenomenon arise and subsides
                          within while the background is unchanged (notice the duality here)...
                          they will fail to realise that consciousness is everything without a
                          background.<br> <br> The core difference in Buddhism compared to other religions/teachings
                          is the teaching of Dependent Origination, Emptiness. Even if they have
                          realisation of Non-Duality (that consciousness is not an eternal
                          formless witnessing background substratum where illusory phenomena pops
                          in and out within the only absolute reality, substratum/background
                          while the substratum/background is unchanged, but is instead all
                          manifestation without a background), they will fail to see that
                          consciousness and conditions cannot be separated, and the nature of
                          consciousness is Empty. For example, Kashmir Shaivism teaches that
                          since all things are the Absolute Shiva, and Shiva is real, everything
                          is real. This is the realist point of understanding, but they will fail
                          to understand that consciousness is Empty and inseparable from
                          conditions.<br> <br> <em>(Wikipedia: Among the various Hindu philosophies, KaÅ›mir Åšaivism is
                          a school of Åšaivism categorized by various scholars as monistic[1]
                          idealism (absolute idealism, theistic monism[2], realistic idealism[3],
                          transcendental physicalism or concrete monism[4]). These descriptors
                          denote a standpoint that Cit - consciousness - is the one reality.
                          Matter is not separated from consciousness, but rather identical to it.
                          There is no gap between God and the world. The world is not an illusion
                          (as in Advaita Vedanta), rather the perception of duality is the
                          illusion.)</em><br> <br> I am not good at explaining, but just want to say that the subtlety of
                          spirituality cannot be overlooked. Have a good understanding of
                          No-Self, Emptiness/Dependent Origination, and everything will be very
                          clear.<br> <br> The problem with all religions/mysticism outside Buddhism, and actually
                          much of modern Buddhism, is that it stresses on the luminosity aspect
                          of Buddha Nature, and overlooks the Emptiness aspect of Buddha Nature.
                          Luminosity and Emptiness (which means dependent origination) is
                          inseparable.</span></p>
