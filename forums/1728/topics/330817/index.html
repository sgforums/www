              </span></p><p><strong>[Precious Human Birth]</strong><br> <br> In order to obtain the framework for the practice of dharma, this
              precious human
              existence, which, in being free and well favored, offers excellent
              opportunities, one must practice excellent virtue, since this is its
              karmic seed. Since the proportion of sentient beings that do practice
              virtue thoroughly is very small, the result, a free and well-favored
              existence, is difficult to obtain.</p>
              <p>When one considers the numbers of other sentient beings, such as
              animals, it is evident that human existence is just a remote
              possibility. Therefore, you should, above all else, work at dharma
              wholeheartedly so that the human existence now obtained is not wasted.</p>
              <p><strong>[Uncertainty of Life]</strong></p>
              <p>Furthermore, since life is uncertain, the causes of death are
              numerous, and one can't even be sure that death won't come today, one
              must exert oneself in the dharma right away. At the time of death,
              except for virtuous and nonvirtuous actions, nothing will follow, not
              wealth, food, possessions, nor land, body, or status. Since these are
              not even as helpful as a straw, there is not the slightest need for
              them.</p>
              <p><strong>[Karma]</strong></p>
              <p>After death, the power of karma causes one to experience birth in
              one of the six classes of beings. Whichever it is, there will be
              nothing but suffering, not even a strand of
              happiness. Since happiness and suffering infallibly develop from
              virtuous and
              non-virtuous actions, one should not do anything evil even at the risk
              of your life. One should practice only virtuous actions with great
              diligence.
              You should energetically train yourself in this kind of thinking.</p>
              <p><strong>[Abandon Attachment]</strong></p>
              <p>At the end of every period of meditation, perform the    seven-branch prayer
              [which dedicates merit <em>to others</em>] as many times as you are able to. In
              post-meditation periods, put the points of your reflections into practice.</p>
              <p>These instructions apply to all forms of preparation and actual practice.</p>

              <p>Don't follow your mind. When you are supposed to meditate, meditate. The mind will have excuses not to meditate, and it may even think it needs 'more urgency' to meditate, which is just more stories. You don't need a story for you to meditate. Just do what you need to do.</p>
              <p>As my local dharma teacher used to tell us -- the mind is basically unreliable, and ever-changing, sometimes you think of something, then you change your mind later, and so on. So let's say you may have intended to meditate this morning but later something happens and you changed your mind. It's very very impermanent. But your Buddha-Nature, pure awareness is ever-present. So we must rely on awareness and not on our mind (ä¾�è§‰, ä¸�ä¾�å¿ƒ). Constantly be mindful, watch your mind, and don't get caught up by your mind's distractions, and so on.</p>
              <p>But also it's not that buddha-nature and mind are two different things. My local dharma teacher also reiterates from the Avamtasaka Sutra, that Buddha, Mind and Sentient Beings are not three different things. The point is not to push away all thoughts but not get caught up by the mind. Thoughts still arise when required, but there is no abidance. But if you are distracted, that is an example getting caught up.</p>
              <p>And as å…ƒéŸ³è€�äºº says,<span style="font-size: small;"> æ‰€ä»¥å¼€æ‚Ÿä¹‹å�Žï¼Œå¦„æƒ³ã€�å¦„å¿µã€�å¦„å¿ƒï¼Œéƒ½ç¿»æˆ�æˆ‘çš„ä½›æ€§çš„å¦™ç”¨äº†ã€‚ä»Šå¤©å†�ç»™å¤§å®¶ä¸‹ä¸ªæ³¨è§£ï¹•å¦„å¿ƒã€�å¦„æƒ³ã€�å¦„å¿µï¼Œ<strong>ç�€ç›¸å°±æ˜¯å¦„ã€‚å��è¿‡æ�¥ä¸�ç�€ç›¸ï¼Œæ‰€æœ‰ä¸€åˆ‡æ€�æƒ³éƒ½æ˜¯æˆ‘ä»¬ä½›æ€§çš„å¦™ç”¨ï¼Œæ‰€æœ‰ä¸€åˆ‡æ€�æƒ³éƒ½æ˜¯æˆ�å°±ä¸€åˆ‡äº‹ç‰©çš„å¦™ç”¨ï¼Œéƒ½æ˜¯æˆ‘ä»¬ä½›æ€§çš„å¦™ç”¨ã€‚</strong></span></p>

              <p>Thank you for posting on this topic, Isis. It is such an important topic.</p>
              <p>The motivation to practice comes and goes. Inspiration to practice comes and goes. Because right now, our motivation to practice is very much based on particular conditions which are not lasting. We have yet to gain unshakeable confidence in the Dharma and the path, such that we will naturally engage in the practice.</p>
              <p>The key to motivate ourselves to practice is in the generation of renunciation mind. The mind of renunciation is the ground for all Dharma practices. It's been said that "Revulsion is the foot of meditation". If we think hard enough about the faults of Samsara... not just Samsara, even in our human life...even living in such a privileged place like Singapore...if we really reflect on how unsatisfactory, how wu2 nai4 life really is......if we really observe the poeple around us and realise no matter what they have, they will still not be truly happy for a long time, all these reflections and realisations will really reduce our interest in samsaric pursuits. Therefore, it is very helpful to constantly contemplate on the 4 thoughts that AEN mentioned above.</p>
              <p>In the beginning, we should establish some kind of a disciplined routine, like what everybody else mentioned above, as it'll help us "tide over the lazy times". It's very good if one could spend a fixed amount of time (e.g. 5-30min) just to contemplate on the 4 thoughts. Yet even more important than that, is to constantly bring to mind these 4 thoughts during our daily lives.</p>
              <p>To quote one of my favourite teachers, Khenpo Yongzin Rinpoche, who said, "Dismantling the ego, is the unpaid full-time job of a Buddhist". He also said, "Daily activities can be used as accessories to our practice." Whether you are working for success in your career, or any other aspects of your life, it is absolutely fine, especially if you can use it as an accessory to your practice - the practice of renunciation, compassion and emptiness.</p>
              <p>One of my teachers, Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche, also taught that for ordinary people like us, we should try to make aspirations as much as possible. We can always make daily aspirations to be able to continually generate motivation to practice. We can also make aspirations to have more "spiritual wealth" in our lives. Now, spiritual wealth, as he explained, can be really scary, cos it can be anything like divorce, bankruptcy, death or anything that will really turn us away from Samsara and thus give rise to the motivation to strive towards Buddhahood. So if we do not have the guts to pray for "spiritual wealth" yet, we can always aspire to "have the courage to wish for spiritual wealth one day".</p>
              <p>The essence of it all is really using all the (imperfect) conditions that we have right now to give rise to more favourable conditions that will continually lead us to be in the company of good spiritual friends and have the external and internal conditions to practice.</p>
              <p>Finally, to end it off, I wish to say that for you to even feel concerned about not being motivated to practice indicates that you are already inclined to practice. You already think that practice is good for you, which is why you are disturbed by not constantly feeling motivated. So that kind of disturbance is your "spiritual wealth". May you continually have that kind of disturbance and may the mind of renunciation grow on and on.</p>

              <p><br>Sensory pleasures themselves are mere conditioned arising and are not the problem. As you identified correctly, attachment is the real problem. Even if one were to live absolutely simply like a mendicant, one can still have lots of attachment, sometimes very subtle ones, e.g. being proud of living simply, thus one will still not be liberated from suffering. Identifying the real enemy is important, because then we know who to target.</p>
              <p>However, in the beginning, it is useful to reduce sensory pleasure, not because there's anything wrong with these pleasures, but really because of our strong habitual inclinations that can get strengthened as we indulge in these pleasures. But if you do decide to reduce sensory pleasures, do it knowing that your target is attachment and not those pleasures.</p>
              <p>When you sometimes do enjoy sensory pleasures, try to keep in your mind contemplating how impermanent, illusory and transient they are. If possible, try at least for a few seconds, to watch your mind. Try to do those few seconds again and again, for as many times as possible. Watching the mind means knowing it without getting involved. Not getting involved means not following it to continue creating stories, as well as not rejecting it cos rejecting is also giving fuel to generate more thoughts. If you find yourself seeking pleasure, know it. If you give rise to a thought that "it's not good to be attached to sensual pleasures", know that thought. If you think that you are doing the right thing, know that thought. If a doubt arises that maybe I'm doing it wrongly, know that thought. If you have any bodily sensations or visions or any experiences, know it. If you feel happy about your experiences, know it. If you feel discouraged about your own practice, know it.</p>
              <p>Whatever happens, just watch, just know, just be in the present. Do nothing. That is how we can use our daily lives to practise, in addition to the daily routine of sitting/whatever form of practice we have.</p>

              <p>Right...</p>
              <p>As with anything do it with moderation, but what you do is not the problem (unless it's harmful or against the precepts), but the attachment. I know of enlightened peopleS (with 'S') who like music, movies, and so on. But I don't think they are attached to them.</p>
              <p>But certainly, cutting down on unnecessary things is important, if you are a serious practitioner.</p>
              <p>An excerpt from Dharma Dan:</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.interactivebuddha.com/faq.shtml">http://www.interactivebuddha.com/faq.shtml</a></p>
              <p><em>While I managed to do this stuff while having jobs, relationships,
                              graduate studies, and the like, <strong>it was nothing resembling easy or
                              cheap. I gave up nearly all of my vacation time for years to retreats,
                              my career development was delayed, I spent much <span style="color: #ff0000;">less time doing other
                              things so that I could sit daily (such as TV, time with
                              friends/family)</span>,</strong> there were relationship stresses, money that was
                              borrowed and often very tight, and the like. I still think it was the
                              right thing to do, but I recommend being realistic about what this may
                              cost on many fronts, particularly if you have children, who, in my
                              humble opinion, deserve your time and commitment. <strong>Sometimes it takes some time for people to gently strip their lives
                      down a bit in healthy and non-destructive ways to make some more time
                      for the dharma. </strong>Others will make radical changes and go off in wildly
                      new directions. I generally recommend that people try to find a local
                      sitting group and/or some kind of teacher. Each person, situation, and
                      time is different, but carefully consider that the life you will awaken
                      to is the actual, ordinary life you live, so make it a good one, and
                      realize that when your spiritual quest is over, there is still the
                      laundry. </em></p>

              <p><br>happiness is impermanent, yes, but i think mature people could remember his happiness, forget unhappiness, and try to avoid unhappiness in the future, though some are unavoidable, like death,</p>
              <p>But as long as i enjoy a happy life in this countable life, i think it's enough,for some people, satisfy their desire maybe happy, but it's not true for me, after long time suffering in university, i happen to succeed pulling me out of this suffering, so in the future, no matter what i do, the first concern is always does this make me happy, and it's also one important criteria on how i will choose my job, many people have been dazzled by desire, they always want to earn more money, but they forget , earning more money, is trying to make your life better, after they realise that, they are already old, fat, and unhealthy, so i gonna to set some meaning in my life, i will do decent job, marry, have a baby, try every thing in this life could bring me happiness, i never believe such rebirth thing, i think it's an expedient way to teaching, so i gonna do meaningful thing in this life, don't care about next life, even there is a next life, as long as i do right in this life, i will get blessed in next life,</p>
              <p>But i don't feel only meditation is the path, like i said çƒ¦æ�¼æ˜¯è�©æ��ï¼Œso when a person is happy, he should just enjoyed it, and make the happiness sustainable, note ,i am not talking about desire, it's happy,</p>
              <p>Like i said is what you do defines you, even you meditate a lot you don't do good in life ,it's no use, so first you should make your parent happy, r you filial, r you obedient, it's mutual thing, if you happen to be borned in a not-so-good family, it's another thing,</p>

              <p>Seeing reality is not about feeling better in the sense that your life circumstances becomes more favourable or pleasant, but it is completely liberating from the illusion of a separate self or the illusion that all phenomena have inherent existence. Pain can continue to arise after enlightenment, like physical pain or sickness or death.</p>
              <p>When you liberate from this illusion, there is no more reference points ('me'), even if pain arise it is seen they arise to no one and there is no abidance -- and hence one is no longer trapped or subject to suffering. It's a complete release from the self-centered reference point into the spontaneously manifesting and self-liberating nature of phenomena.</p>
              <p>With insight there is bliss, but this bliss is not conditioned by pleasant or unpleasant states. It is the bliss of Clarity, which is the highest bliss of nirvana. This is not a 'feeling' that depends upon the perceived 'pleasantness' or 'unpleasantness' of our life and surroundings.</p>
              <p>All feelings are impermanent and conditioned, but the clarity of our true nature never ceases.</p>

              <p><br> happiness is impermanent, yes, but i think mature people could
                                          remember his happiness, forget unhappiness, and try to avoid
                                          unhappiness in the future, though some are unavoidable, like
                                          death,</p>
              <p>But as long as i enjoy a happy life in this countable life, i
                                          think it's enough,for some people, satisfy their desire maybe
                                          happy, but it's not true for me, after long time suffering in
                                          university, i happen to succeed pulling me out of this suffering,
                                          so in the future, no matter what i do, the first concern is always
                                          does this make me happy, and it's also one important criteria on
                                          how i will choose my job, many people have been dazzled by desire,
                                          they always want to earn more money, but they forget , earning more
                                          money, is trying to make your life better, after they realise that,
                                          they are already old, fat, and unhealthy, so i gonna to set some
                                          meaning in my life, i will do decent job, marry, have a baby, try
                                          every thing in this life could bring me happiness, i never believe
                                          such rebirth thing, i think it's an expedient way to teaching, so i
                                          gonna do meaningful thing in this life, don't care about next life,
                                          even there is a next life, as long as i do right in this life, i
                                          will get blessed in next life,</p>
              <p>But i don't feel only meditation is the path, like i said
                                          çƒ¦æ�¼æ˜¯è�©æ��ï¼Œso when a person is happy, he should just enjoyed it, and

                                          desire, it's happy,</p>
              <p>Like i said is what you do defines you, even you meditate a lot
                                          you don't do good in life ,it's no use, so first you should make

              <p>Next you said you don't believe in rebirth and think that rebirth is just an expedient means, presumably to gain followers. But this is far from the truth. Rebirth is a reality, and there are countless practitioners who can remember their past lives. There are also scientific studies done and much evidence and proof that rebirth is a reality.</p>
              <p>I personally know of many people who remember their past lives. When I met with our moderator Longchen in the past, he told me 4 of his immediate past lives. There were he even more lifetimes he remembered which he didn't tell me.</p>
              <p>I won't talk about the last 2 lifetimes (3rd and 4th past life) he told me because he did tell me not to mention it. All I can say is that he was lived in Japan, and China, respectively. But in his immediate past life, he was a European involved in the Western mystical circles, and fought in World War 1 near Paris. He was also an artist then, he could remember painting in that past life (he is now in the Design industry in this life also). In the 2nd immediate past life, he was a monk in Tibet, the red hat sect. And this explains his interest in Dzogchen teachings in this lifetime.</p>

              <p>There are many methods, depends on your character.<br>If you are one that is very compassion, you can comtemplate on other people who is less fortunate than you. Have you ever read any news about someone very old age, only son die in earthquake. or someone who was mistreated, kena whacked until become handicapped. As a buddhist, you should know that there are many things you can do to help them. The greatest help that you can give them is by becoming a buddha.</p>
              <p>If like that still can't touch you, you can also think your guru or bodhisatva that you respect so much, contemplate on their kindness, you know that they want to see you practice the dharma and grow up spiritually. They been so kind to you, so how could you do something that upset them.<br><br>Alternatively, you can do something that is more challenging yet gives you greater return. You will likely face more obstacles, but it still worth it.<br><br>You can also get together more often with buddhist friends who practice diligently, pay more attention on their strength over you. Never ever see other people's mistake. You will realize how lack of practice you are.<br><br>Hope that helps. :)</p>
