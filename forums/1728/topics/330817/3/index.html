              <p> <em>Are the Mind-only Pure Land and the Self-nature Amitabha the same as or different from the Western Pure Land and Amitabha in the Pure Land ?<br><br>It is because the Mind-only Pure Land exists that we are reborn in the Pure Land of the West. If the mind is not pure, it is impossible to achieve rebirth in the Pure Land. Even when those who have committed cardinal transgressions achieve rebirth through ten recitations, such rebirth is due to their reciting the Buddha's name with a pure mind, thus eliciting a response from Amitabha Buddha. </em><strong><strong>Ordinary people generally think that if the Pure Land is Mind-Only, then it does not exist. This is the understanding of demons and externalists.</strong> Such a deluded view, which appears correct but is in reality wrong, affects more than half of all people and causes practitioners to forfeit true benefits.<br><br></strong><em>It is precisely because of the Self-Nature Amitabha that the practitioner must recite the name of Buddha Amitabha of the West seeking rebirth in the Pure Land - so as to achieve the Self-Nature Amitabha through gradual cultivation. If he merely grasps at the Self-Nature Amitabha but does not recite the name of Buddha Amitabha of the West, he cannot achieve immediate escape from Birth and death - not even if he is truly awakened, much less if (like most people who ask this question) he is pretentious and just indulges in empty talk without engaging in practice.<br><br>Thus the answer to your question [are the mind-Only Pure Land and the Self-Nature Amitabha the same as or different from the Western Pure Land and Amitabha in the Pure Land?] is that they are one yet two before Buddhahood is attained, two yet one after Buddhahood is attained.</em></p>

              <p>My Master visited Pure Land and saw Amitabha before.</p>
              <p><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">Disciple: Master, how do we
                                      witness Sukhavathi?<br> <br> Master Shen Kai: That's easy. But Sukhavathi is very far away. How
                                      far? It's passing through hundreds of thousands of millions of
                                      Buddhalands. In between this hundreds of thousands of millions of
                                      Buddhalands are not Buddhalands but Hui Tu. Buddhalands are pure
                                      where Buddhas dwell. Sukhavathi is hence very very far away. Far
                                      does not mean we don't believe.<br> <br> In the sutras, Buddha used to explain that it's very very near. So
                                      near that nobody believe it's true. There's no choice as sentient
                                      beings are too greedy, hence say it's very very far away and not
                                      easy to go or reach. So He expound the Amitabha Sutra, where Buddha
                                      spoke without people asking. If a person is not greedy, then
                                      Dharmakaya is very near as it encompass everything.<br> Since it's entire existence, it's so near to reach like space
                                      everywhere exist Dharmakaya. Without Dharmakaya, Earth cannot be in
                                      the space. Cars cannot works. Every thing is benefited by
                                      Dharmakaya.<br> <br> When people do business, they need an initial funding, now Buddha
                                      say you don't need that initial funding, you believe in Amitabha
                                      and recite His name.<br> When one see people wearing a gold necklace, but it's just a piece
                                      of metal chain like the one you see in jail to chain prisioners.
                                      Then Buddha told sentient beings not to be obsess with gold, you
                                      just need to recite Amitabha and don't need any initial funding and
                                      you can reborn in a place where gold is use for building
                                      constructions.<br> So does Sukhavathi really exist? Yes. Don't think Buddha is lying.
                                      You can GO NOW and witness yourself and come back to tell people.
                                      Master tell you I been there before, you all might disbelieve. So I
                                      will describe it to you.<br> Sentient beings on Earth are very small, Bodhisattvas of Sukhavathi
                                      are really Big and tall. A person standing next to Amitabha only
                                      reach the height of Amitabha's toe! When I reached Sukhavathi, only
                                      wish to pay homage to Amitabha, and adore Amitabha.<br> Amitabha Buddha reply: What do you seek here in Sukhavathi?<br> Shen Kai: Honored One, i came to seek Dharma.<br> Amitabha Buddha ask: What kind of Dharma?<br> Shen Kai: i'm not sure. Seeing Amitabha's forehead is adorned with
                                      a curled hair. i wisk to seek that Dharma, Honorable One.<br> (Back to reality.) That's how I cultivate and got my curled hair,
                                      but this Dharma method cannot anyhow expound to people. It's is
                                      because you people have doubt in Sukhavathi. Thinking it doesn't
                                      exist. Hence I tell you my experience. Due to the busy schedule,
                                      the white hair is curled. When it grew longer to 3 inch, it will
                                      extend when i'm washing the face. That's the proof.<br> <br> How did Ocean of suffering (ku hai wu bian) come about? Because
                                      beings of samsara cannot sever emotion, love and greed. Sentinet
                                      beings cry a lot. Separation from friend, family, love ones, people
                                      cry. Son is leaving, mother crys, so does the son. Mother is dying,
                                      sons also crys. When people want's to eat, the mouth starts to
                                      water. This is greed. People need to work, they swear. In a life
                                      them, people generate so many water. One person, say one bucket of
                                      water, 100 pax, 100 bucket form a pool of water. If millions of
                                      millions of people cannot sever emotion, love and greed, form an
                                      Ocean of water.<br> <br> In our world there's male and female. Those who goes to jail, 99%
                                      are involve with female. But in Sukhavathi, there's not male nor
                                      female form.<br> <br> (translated by Sinweiy)</span></p>

              <p><br>But America is out there, it's not mind only, but if you talk like seeing reality way, it will disappear, but pure land is in Mind, if it's really out there like America does, i think it's not pure land, it's ET's hometown,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And some say doing dana is not chasing benefit, if you doing dana is for chasing benefit, it's wrong, the right way is u should love to do that, if you do good thing just for residing in paradise, it's attachment,</p>
              <p>I remember some buddhist is scarified when telling him dharma is empty, they find they can resort on nothing hold nothing, but the whole buddhism teach empty.Of course, paradise is empty.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So you see, there are many wrong doing in buddhism, so i think the how point of buddhism is achieving some state of mind, you can do meditation or reading sutra, but first of all i think buddhism should be interesting. People only sit there for hundred years, it's not buddhism, it's dying ,or sleeping. Buddism is the deepest thing ever, meanwhile it's interesting.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i am not saying it does not existed, but in mind only, by mind maybe you can travel thousand of mile, maybe you will reside on some place, but it's mind only, meanwhile it's real, because it's in your mind, why some master pinpoint some stone ,then the stone become gold, because it's in mind, gold is nothing different to stone</p>

                                                                              be very clear that it is this experience that they are talking

              <p>Next, America is Mind-Only. Everything is the manifestation of Mind. And everything you see, hear, smell, is empty of any inherent, objective existence 'out there', and is beyond the extremes of existence, non-existence, both existence and non-existence, or neither existence nor non existence. While appearing vividly as the luminous display of Buddha-Nature, it is empty of any findable essence or location, i.e. everything is non-local.</p>
              <p>Like a red flower that is so vivid, clear and right in front of an
                                                      observer, the “redness” only appears to “belong” to the flower, it is
                                                      in actuality not so. Vision of red does not arise in all animal species
                                                      (dogs cannot perceive colours) nor is the “redness” an attribute of the
                                                      mind... and in Buddhism we recognise that there are other realms' (or
                                                      you can call 'dimensions') beings who can see something completely
                                                      different. If given a “quantum eyesight” to look into the atomic
                                                      structure, there is similarly no attribute “redness” anywhere found,
                                                      only almost complete space/void with no perceivable shapes and forms.
                                                      Whatever appearances are dependently arisen, and hence is empty of any
                                                      inherent existence or fixed attributes, shapes, form, or “redness” --
                                                      merely luminous yet empty, mere Appearances without inherent/objective
                                                      existence. What gives rise to the differences of colours and
                                                      experiences in each of us? Dependent arising... hence empty of inherent
                                                      existence. (ç¼˜èµ·æ€§ç©º) In the same way that colours and flowers are empty of inherent/objective existence, everything else in the world, including America, is empty of inherent/objective existence. This is the nature of all phenomena. They are not existing
                                                      in a 'really-out-there' kind of way.

                                                      completely different mode of perception). ‘'The Flowerness' is an
                                                      illusion that does not stay even for a moment, merely an aggregate of
                                                      causes and conditions. Analogous to the example of ‘flowerness’, there
                                                      is no ‘selfness’ serving as a background witnessing either -- pristine
                                                      awareness is not the witnessing background. Rather, the entire whole of
                                                      the moment of manifestation is our pristine awareness; lucidly clear,
                                                      yet empty of inherent existence. This is the way of ‘seeing’ the one as
                                                      many, the observer and the observed are one and the same. This is also
                                                      the meaning of formlessness and attributelessness of our nature. But
                                                      this does not mean that awareness is void or nothing, it is full of
                                                      forms, full of colours, as Emptiness is Form... just empty of 'inherent
                                                      existence'. So Emptiness, in Buddhism, strictly means Dependent

              <p> </p>
              <p>Buddha taught in Lankavatara Sutra,</p>
              <p><strong><br> There are two kinds of attachment: attachment to objects as having a self-nature, 
                                                        and attachment to words as having self-nature. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The first takes place by not 
                                                        knowing that the external world is only a manifestation of mind itself;</span></span> and 
                                                        the second arises from one's clinging to words and names by reason of habit-energy. 
                                                        In the teaching of no-birth, causation is out of place because, seeing that 
                                                        all things are like maya and a dream, one does not discriminate individual signs. 
                                                        That all things are un-born and have no self-nature because they are like maya 
                                                        is asserted to meet the thesis of the philosophers that birth is by causation. 
                                                        They foster the notion that the birth of all things is derived from the concept 
                                                        of being and non-being, and fail to regard it as it truly is, as caused by attachments 
                                                        to the multitudiousness which arises from discriminations of the mind itself. </strong></p>

              <p>The Blessed One replied, saying: Mahamati, the error in these
                                                      erroneous teachings that are generally held by the philosophers lies in

                                                      rises from the mind itself; but depending upon these manifestations of

                      do meditation or reading sutra, but first of all i think buddhism
                      should be interesting. People only sit there for hundred years,
                      it's not buddhism, it's dying ,or sleeping. Buddism is the deepest

              <p>Buddhism is not about all about meditation, but meditation is an important aspect of Buddhism, of the 8 fold path.</p>
              <p>But also, to be meditative does not necessarily mean just sitting. Sitting meditation is important, but so is the meditative mind in our everyday lives important. The point is to extent your practice throughout your daily lives.</p>

              <p>Buddha, in Shurangama Sutra:</p>
              <p>"Ananda, you have not yet understood that all the defiling objects that appear, 
                      all the illusory, ephemeral phenomena, spring up in the very spot where they 
                      also come to an end. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Their phenomena aspects are illusory and false, but their 
                      nature is in truth the bright substance of wonderful enlightenment. Thus it is 
                      throughout, up to the five skandhas and the six entrances, to the twelve places 
                      and the eighteen realms;</strong></span></span> the union and mixture of various causes and conditions 
                      account for their illusory and false existence, and the separation and 
                      dispersion of the causes and conditions result in their illusory and false 
                      extinction. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Who would have thought that production and extinction, coming and 
                      going are fundamentally the eternal wonderful light of the Tathagata, the 
                      unmoving, all-pervading perfection, the wonderful nature of True Suchness! If 
                      within the true and eternal nature one seeks coming and going, confusion and 
                      enlightenment, or birth and death, one will never find them.</strong></span></span>"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(note: As Thusness always say, 5 Skhandas, 18 Dhatus is Buddha-Nature.)</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>You still have not realized that in the Treasury of the Tathagata, the nature of 
                      form is true emptiness and the nature of emptiness is true form. That 
                      fundamental purity pervades the Dharma Realm.</strong></span> Beings’ minds absorb itaccording 
                      to their capacity to know. Whatever manifests does so in compliance with karma. 
                      Ignorant of that fact, people of the world are so deluded as to assign its 
                      origin to causes and conditions or to spontaneity. These mistakes, which arise 
                      from the discriminations and reasoning processes of the mind, are nothing but 
                      the play of empty and meaningless words."</p>

              <p>No, because you have the wrong understanding of Mind-Only.</p>
              <p>You think that "<em>it is actually your thoughts that is important,

              The clearer the body, the brighter one’s Buddha Nature shines. In the
              beginning, we still need the body. It’s like a lamp. The Buddha Nature
              is this flame. But we may still be conscious of shadows. As we progress
              we feel that the body is the universe itself and that our Buddha Self
              shines throughout it like the sun.<br></span></p>

              <p>The next thing is, although if you may realise that this place is pure land, it cannot also be denied that there is an Amitabha's pure land in the west, which is manifested due to Amitabha's vows as expedient means for sentient beings.</p>
              <p>As I said, America is also Mind-Only, but you can't say it doesn't exist. It is beyond the extremes of existence, non-existence, both and neither. It appears as the manifestation of Mind along with causes and conditions.</p>

              <p>As Zen Master Han-Shan said,</p>
              <p>The next thing is, although if you may realise that this place is pure land, it cannot also be denied that there is an Amitabha's pure land in the west, which is manifested due to Amitabha's vows as expedient means for sentient beings.</p>
              <p>As I said, America is also Mind-Only, but you can't say it doesn't exist. It is beyond the extremes of existence, non-existence, both and neither. It appears as the manifestation of Mind along with causes and conditions.</p>

              <p>Mind is Buddha... but what is Buddha?</p>
              <p>Thought cannot grasp that. It has to be an intuition... that resonance comes from intuitive awareness, not from the conceptual mind. All concepts are just symbolic definitions, words,
              language, that we impute on ourselves.</p>
              <p>I'm this, I'm that... I'm Singaporean... I'm male... I'm Chinese (race)... I'm of this political view... I'm Buddhist... etc etc</p>
              <p>Some are so called 'facts' but they are really just our projected symbolic representations, it is not reality itself.</p>
              <p>It
              is not found in direct experience... 'Singaporean' is not a thing that
              can be found in our experience, it is just a thought! Ultimately 'I' am
              not the definitions I project unto myself, I am not what the birth
              certificate tell me, I am <strong>not the definitions I project unto myself.<br> </strong></p>
              <p>And these definitions change along with times and
              circumstances, one day if I migrate to somewhere else, the country
              tells me I am of a new nationality, I project a new definition, a new
              view of 'myself'.</p>
              <p>But none of these definitions are 'my self' --
              they are just thoughts arising in your mind, that can be re defined any
              moment. It cannot be found in your own direct experience.</p>
              <p>Before you knew anything, when you were a baby, before you learnt to define yourself, who are you?</p>
              <p>As Thusness said, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>“Without using any languages, ‘I’, ‘me’ or any signs or symbols, how is ‘I’ experienced?”</strong></span></p>
              <p>What is the I AM before I am this or I am that?</p>
              <p>If you can feel the truth intuitively, you are closer to what it is.</p>
              <p>No
              language, no logic, no theory, no philosophy can answer that for you.
              They just give you new definitions, and all the definitions are your
              mental projection, they are not who you are.</p>
              <p>Let go all of them, let go all thoughts, before all thoughts... and language.... who are you? How is 'I' experienced?</p>
              <p>Of all teachings, no teaching is more important then a direct ‘touch’ of our Buddha essence; but of all dangers, none is more dangerous than misinterpreting our essence after the ‘touch’.<br><br>The ‘touch’ of the pure sense of existence is often wrongly understood due to our karmic tendencies. Use the doctrine of Anatta and Emptiness as antidote.</p>

              <p>comments:</p>
              <p><em>Although Advaita Vedanta spoke of Awareness, awareness is not the transience (thoughts, sound...etc) But here there are 2 important points to take note. First is that Buddha Nature is the transience. Second it is more of 'åº”'. Means with the condition of the eye, forms arise.  With ears, sound arises.<br></em></p>
              <p><em>Awareness is not like a mirror reflecting but rather a manifesation. Luminosity is an arising luminous manifestation rather than a mirror reflecting. The center here is being replaced with Dependent Origination, the experience however is non-dual. </em></p>
              <p><em>One must learn how to see Appearances as Awareness and all others as conditions. Example, sound is awareness. The person, the stick, the bell, hitting, air, ears...are conditions. One should learn to see in this way. All problems arise because we cannot experience Awareness this way.</em></p>
              <p><em>Conventionally we experience in the form of subject and object interaction taking place in a space-time continuum. This is just an assumption. Experientially it is not so. One should learn to experience awareness as the manifestation. There is no subject, there is only and always manifestation, all else are conditions of arising. All these are just provisional explanations for one to understand. </em></p>
              <p><em>After one have intuitive experience of anatta (no-self), one should give up all views and conceptual and enter into direct vivid experiences. Before that, right view is important. After the experience of anatta, do not dwell too deeply into conceptual views, it will only serve as a disservice.</em></p>
