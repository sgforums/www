            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Short Ninja:<br><br>falling into the animal realm? Rebirth means being reborn as a human being right?</blockquote>Not always. There are six realms of rebirth, which can be divided into 31 planes of existence. Whta are the six realms?<br><br>The 3 higher realms: Humans, Asura, Devas (Heaven)<br>3 lower realms: Hell, Ghost, Animal<br><br>That makes up the six realms of existence in samsara. Every single sentient being who are still not enlightened and liberated from samsara, at the time of death, will undergo rebirth to the six destinations of rebirth, depending on what karma he has.<br><br>One who is evil -- i.e never keep 5 precepts, does unwholesome deeds, these beings will fall into the 3 lower realms and undergo much suffering until that karma has exhausted, then he can be reborn in the higher realms again.<br><br>One who has wholesome karma, i.e having abided by the 5 precepts, done the 10 virtuous deeds, practised generosity, filiality, etc, these people can be reborn in the higher realms, human realm, and even the deva (celestial) realm in the afterlife.<br><br>Therefore we must avoid doing all that is evil and do all that is good. In this way we will not accumulate any unwholesome karma that will affect our next birth negatively.<br><br>But not only that! Because by avoiding evil and doing all that is good, you are only accumulating good karma for future lifetimes. No matter what amount of good karma you accumulate, one day they will be used up, and you might then fall back into the lower realms. Samsara is a world of sufferings, everyone here will undergo the pain of birth, ageing, sickness, death, the 8 distresses, and so on, and even those in heaven will eventually suffer the pain of death, etc. One who can recall his countless previous lives will realise how much sufferings one undergoes through the many lifetimes of being in samsara. Therefore we must also practise purifying our mind, developing wisdom, to become liberated from the cycles of birth and death, and liberate from the wheel of samsara.<br><br>Through practising the dharma, we can then liberate from all the sufferings in our lives, attain everlasting bliss of nirvana and clarity.<br><br><blockquote>I also believe that when you die your mental state does not end there it goes into the different bardo state of mind just like when you are in a dream state.</blockquote>That is right. Our mental continuum does not cease at the time of death, and will go through the process and cycles in the bardo state and eventually be reborn into the 6 realms of existence.<br><br>Unless -- we practise the dharma, we may be reborn in pure lands/buddha lands of the Buddhas (i.e Amitabha's Western Pure Land), or best, if we recognise our innate Mind of Clear Light at the time of death as our true nature, we will then be liberated into this Clear Light, our primordial Buddha essence. However this requires us to practise right now.. when we are alive. If we are not even liberated in daily living, don't think it's likely to be liberated at death.</div>

There was this disciple of my Master... his cultivation was very strong, he practiced many years diligently after my Master... and his meditation is so strong that people can see light emanating from him during his meditations. His practised has reached certain levels that during a long meditation/practise retreat at my Master's monastery, he had attained an intuitive glimpse of his true nature/buddha nature.<br><br>However, having 'jian zheng' (glimpsed/seen reality) does not mean he has 'xiu zheng' (perfect his cultivation and attain full liberation), which requires continuous practice and deepening of one's enlightenment/realisation even after an initial realisation.<br><br>Though having practised so diligently and even having glimpsed his own true nature, he later indulged himself in playing chess... and just forgot about his practise altogether. He no longer meditates or practise the dharma, and simply indulge himself in playing chinese chess. Which is such a pity because he probably will have gone far in his practise and attainments if he continued to practise diligently like before...<br><br>Anyway, so he continued to indulge in chess until some years later, he died. At that time, they were going to perform pujas on him and invited my Taiwanese teacher Missionary Chen Ming An to help him.... when my teacher arrived, he looked around and saw that the Anatarbhava (the intermediate Bardo body) was not around in the room. Using his psychic abilities, he then located his Anatarabhava in some streets away, watching his old friends playing chess, totally obsessed with the game. (if nobody were to guide him at that time, he might very well have become a ghost stuck in that place)<br><br>My teacher quickly brought him back... then gave him dharma guidance. Because of his past cultivation, he was able to quickly 'regain' his practise, and there are people who saw certain signs (if I remember, some light coming out from the top of his head) signalling that his consciousness has left and reborn in a higher realm. However, he has not attained liberation, because he did not continue his practise diligently even though his practice did bear some fruit in the beginning.<br><br>Update: SO for us, who do not even have much cultivation to begin with, better not be so attached with our indulgence... and especially at the time of death.... too much obsession can cause us to be stuck in the ghost realm. Even for someone who has certain level of cultivation, if he stop halfway, will not be able to gain liberation..<br><br>Also, as my Taiwanese teacher say, gambling is really no good. Why? Other than its ability to ruin your life and corrupt your mind... even in future lives it will have negative effect. Because if you gamble, your social circle is full of people who have agenda, i.e want to win your money. In your future lifetimes, you will also meet many people who has agenda and do certain things behind your back (i.e backstab you) and so on to gain something from you...</div>
