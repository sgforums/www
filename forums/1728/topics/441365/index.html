              <p><em>You said: <span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Nirvana is a phenomenon beyond all conventional phenomena.</span></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nirvana is not a phenomenon but the cessation of afflictive phenomenon. Nirvana has two types: nirvana with remainder, which is the cessation of all afflictions, defilements, and suffering, but with the remainder of sense faculties and sense awareness fully functioning.</p>
              <p>Nirvana without remainder is the total cessation of all suffering plus the cessation of body-mind: it happens during the break-up of the physical body of an Arahant who has gone into the final passing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">You said: Conventional phenomenon is subjected to conditional &amp; duality influences – in continuous &amp; constantly changing state of affairs.</span><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"> </span><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"> Nirvana phenomenon would arise when there is non-existence of conditional &amp; duality influences – a complete neutralising state of affairs.</span><br style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nirvana is not a phenomenon and therefore cannot arise. Nirvana means cessation of afflictive arising.</p>
              <p>Also, the Nirvana with Remainder - the Nirvana experienced by an Arhant before death, still allows for the experience of pleasant, unpleasant and neutral feelings and sensations.</p>
              <p>In other words, the Arahant is aware of pleasant sensation as pleasant, unpleasant as unpleasant, neutral as neutral, however he does not give rise to craving, aversion, and mental suffering as a result of such experiences.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">You said: There is no mind, no thinking, no becoming, no changing, no evolution, no clinging, no wanting, no impermanency in Nirvana.</span><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"> </span><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"> Moreover, Nirvana is not about wanting for nothing. In the first place, there is no wanting to begin with, therefore, wanting could not be the cause for nothing.</span></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It depends on which Nirvana you mean: Nirvana with Remainder still allows for changing thoughts and sense perceptions. However, it is the cessation of craving and mental suffering. In Nirvana without Remainder (after the physical breakup of an arahant's body), indeed there is no mind, no becoming, etc.</p>
              <p><em><br></em></p>
              <p><em>You said: <span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Letting go is not the same as giving up hope (a frustrated expression).

              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"> </p>

              <p>Actually you should desire for Nirvana, and act on that desire by practising the eightfold path. When you have achieved Nirvana, that desire is naturall fulfilled, and all desires are naturally ceased. However that original desire for Nirvana is still important.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">You said: Wholesome would mean seeing things as they truly are &amp; in totality of perspectives; unwholesome would mean seeing things as they delusively are &amp; in non-totality of perspectives.</span><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"> </span><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"> As such, for one to be awakened or otherwise is entirely a personal aspiration and not a commandment of sorts.</span></em></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><em>In Buddhism, there are no commandments to be found; no hierarchical ranking between followers, etc. All sort of authoritative claims based on personal gratifications are purely egocentric in nature and devoted followers must not put in their faith blindly on anything; come what may.</em></span><br style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Agreed, there are no commandments, only guidelines, advise, and teachings.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em><br style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><br style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><strong style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">You said: To see it, know it and let go<br>– no need to grasp it<br>– this is how one practices<br>‘Seeing things as they are’<br>– see only with eyes and mind, don’t get into any involvement; more importantly – let go the<br>self and ego factors.<br><br>Be freed, be liberated, be disappeared!</strong></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is good, however to "let go the self and ego factors" requires realization of anatta - in other words it is not merely a matter of intentionally letting go. It requires you realise that no inherent, independent, separate self or agent is there to begin with: in seeing just the seen, no seer. By practicing insight meditation and contemplation you can achieve such realizations. Otherwise no matter how you try to let go, you will never completely be able to let go or achieve effortlessness.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>As a matter of fact, Nibbana can be described, and has been described countless times by the Buddha as the cessation of afflictive phenomena:</p>
              <p><strong><em></em> </strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><strong><em><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:16px;">But
                                   with the remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance comes 
                                  cessation of volitional formations; with the cessation of volition­al 
                                  formations, cessation of consciousness.... Such is the cessation of this
                                   whole mass of suffering.” </span></em></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">Nibbana is not a phenomon but rather the cessation of afflictive phenomenon. Descriptions are phenomenon and that is an entirely different issue altogether. Also, descriptions are not afflictive (just as sense perceptions are not inherently afflictive), therefore there is no need to fear descriptions. What we have to relinquish are our afflictions - craving, aversion, ignorance.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You said:</p>
              <p><em><span> 
                                                        Phenomenon can neither be created nor
                                                          destroyed – just like the energy elements – it only moves on from
                                                          one to another scenario.</span></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In Buddhism, phenomena are neither created, nor can they be destroyed. There is no agent or creator of phenomena. Rather, phenomena arise due to causes and conditions.</p>
              <p>For example, when someone hits the bell with a stick, with the condition of the stick, the person hitting, the bell, the vibrations, the air, the ear, and so on - all these causes and conditions come together and a new phenomenon called "hearing sound" arises.</p>
              <p>This new and complete phenomenon is neither the same as the ear, nor does it come from the ear, nor was it created by the ear, is neither same as the air, nor does it come from the air, nor was it created by the air, is neither same as the stick, nor does it come from the stick, nor was it created by the stick, is neither same as the bell, nor does it come from the bell, nor was it created by the bell, and so on.... rather, it is when all these causes and conditions meet - a new and complete phenomenon called "hearing sound" arises.</p>
              <p>And with the cessation of those causes and conditions, the experience "hearing sound" too ceases - therefore with the arising of this, comes the arising of that, and with the cessation of this, comes the cessation of that. This is the principle of dependent arising. Phenomenon arises according to conditions and ceases with the cessation of conditions.</p>
              <p>I do not say that energy "transforms" since no two moments of phenomenon can be similar, rather, it is that there is a continuity of a causal process, so it is A1, A2, A3.... and so on, each moment of arising a new and complete phenomenon of dependent origination, that ceases upon its arising. There is absolutely no continuity of a metaphysical substance or essence, even the elements themselves are empty of any independent, permanent, locatable essence or substance. Arising and ceasing moment to moment.</p>
              <p>Now, with the remainderless cessation of ignorance, comes the remainderless cessation of the entire twelve links of dependent origination. Since afflictive arisings have their causes, with the uprooting of the root ignorance, comes the cessation of afflictive births and arisings.</p>
              <p><em><br></em></p>

              <p>You must have the desire to make the effort. The Buddha tells us to rely on craving to end craving:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>“‘This body comes into being through craving. And yet it 
                                  is by relying on craving that craving is to be abandoned.’ Thus was it 
                                  said. And in reference to what was it said? There is the case, sister, 
                                  where a monk hears, ‘The monk named such-and-such, they say, through the
                                   ending of the preparations, has entered &amp; remains in the 
                                  preparations-free deliverance of the mind &amp; deliverance through 
                                  wisdom, having known &amp; realized them for himself in this very life.’
                                   The thought occurs to him, ‘I hope that I, too, will — through the 
                                  ending of all preparations will enter and remain in the 
                                  preparations-free deliverance of the mind &amp; deliverance through 
                                  wisdom, having known &amp; realized them for myself in this very life..’
                                   <strong>Then, at a later time, he abandons craving, having relied on craving.</strong> <em>(So aparena samayena taá¹‡haá¹ƒ nissÄ�ya taá¹‡haá¹ƒ pajahati)</em> ‘This body comes into being through craving. And yet it is by relying 
                                  on craving that craving is to be abandoned.’ Thus was it said. And in 
                                  reference to this was it said. {<a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.159.than.html">AN 4. 159</a>}</p>

              <p>And here the second one which tells us that "Desire to achieve Nibbana" is important:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>One day a brahmin came to visit the venerable Ananda. He 
                                  asked the venerable Ananda: “How can you ever overcome desire if you 
                                  desire for Nibbana?”. Then the venerable Ananda gave a simile: When you,
                                   dear brahmin, were at home, did you not think: “I wish to go to the 
                                  monastery to see the venerable Ananda”. Tell me, what happened to that 
                                  desire of yours?” – Then the brahmin answered: “Well, that wish of mine 
                                  was fulfilled once i came to the monastery.” – Then venerable Ananda 
                                  said: “In the same way someone would desire to achieve Nibbana, but on 
                                  reaching Nibbana that desire would be fulfilled.” [Thanks to Daniel and

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">And neither is the path one of dissociating oneself with the condition of pain, agony, etc. Since dissociation is inherently dualistic - it presumes there is a self that can dissociate from the 'other'. You may dissociate from the 'other', and yet the afflictive experiences, and the sense of self continues to arise. Therefore dissociation cannot liberate, only the realization of anatta and emptiness can liberate us from clinging and suffering.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 4.7pt;">Now to achieve such a realisation, you need right effort, which is sustained by desire, and with the right kind of desire and effort you do contemplative practices that investigates the nature of phenomenon, and as a result knowledge and vision with regards to the nature of phenomenon arise, and with the knowledge and vision of phenomenon as they are - dispassion arises, and with dispassion and the knowledge and vision of the nature of phenomenon comes the fading away and cessation of ignorance, craving, clinging and the whole host of afflictive arisings. In other words, without true wisdom and realization, no matter how you try to let go, you will not be able to let go completely and effortlessly and be able to attain nirvana.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 4.7pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 4.7pt;">If you do not realise anatta, emptiness, dependent origination by direct realization, then no matter how you try to let go, you will not be able to let go completely, effortlessly, uprooting the roots of ignorance and craving. You may be able to enter into meditative states where such gross afflictions are temporarily suppressed in samadhi, however it is only by wisdom and realisation can they be fundamentally relinquished (permanently).</p>

              <p>It is not about my words versus your words. It is do you understand what phenomena is? That they are arising and passing each moment according to causes and conditions, each moment not similar from another moment... I am speaking from experiential realisation (see <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2010/12/my-e-booke-journal.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2010/12/my-e-booke-journal.html</a> ) and have no confusion regarding the nature of phenomenon. I am therefore, of course not speaking from the opinions of others, however to showcase that my statements are not only supported by my own experience, but they are also said by Buddha, Dogen, and countless masters.</p>
              <p>If you understand this, you will understand what Zen Master Dogen means by "firewood does not turn into ash", "winter does not turn into spring" and so on. He further clarifies: firewood abides in the phenomenon of firewood, independent of past and future as it is a distinct and complete manifestation - yet interdependent with those causal conditions. You cannot thus say something transforms into something. Only when we see this, can we realize and actualize the wisdom of anatta and anicca.</p>

              <p>Lastly, it is only by arising insight and wisdom that we can let go. Otherwise all attempts at letting go only lead to shamatha states and do not end our afflictions. Nirvana is the end, the cessation of afflictions and suffering. Nirvana is not a temporary state of shamatha, it is the complete and permanent abandoning of ignorance, craving, afflictions by the wisdom into the true nature of phenomenon.</p>

              <p>When addressing on a problem, in the first place, we need to make a check whether our point of view is from the <em>Conventional</em> perspective or from the <em>Ultimate</em> perspective.</p>
              <p>If from the <em>Conventional</em> perspective, then we agree that duality or  multiplicity does exist.  Therefore, <em>Nirvana</em> is a phenomenon because we are speaking as a subject on the other side of the object or matter.  In other words, the subject is pondering on the object - phenomenon arises.</p>
              <p>However, if from the Ultimate perspective, then we agree that no duality or multiplicity arises.  Therefore, <em>Nirvana</em> is not a phenomenon (also applies on all other things) because there is no subject to ponder on the object or matter.  In other words, no phenomenon arises if we speak from the<em> Ultimate</em> perspective.  This is also known as <em>the deepest fact about things -</em> it is beyond mind and concepts and words in the sense that it is beyond our usual way of perceiving things.</p>
              <p>Once again, it is just like describing the same elephant from different perspectives among different beings. </p>

              <p>Hi Takso, you broke up your reply into two posts and I have only read the first part for now.  I will read the rest later  :)</p>
              <p>For now, I'm just a little confused that you have mentioned the emptiness of emptiness, yet also mentioned that emptiness inherently exists.  Does emptiness have an inherent quality? </p>
              <p>Also, you mentioned:  <span>"<em>The above
                                      is a rather strange paradox but still logical because emptiness is
                                      a universal or infinite phenomenon.<span> </span> Therefore, it is evident that object could arise out of emptiness
                                      due to the 2<sup>nd</sup> scenario clarified as above and it is the
                                      ambience for the origination of existence.</em>"</span></p>
              <p>I have so far been under the impression that emptiness is a quality, or a manner of description, and not some "universal or infinite phenomenon" as you have stated.  To say that emptiness is "the ambience for the origination of existence" seems to reify a backdrop against which phenomenon arises; it goes against saying that emptiness is empty.</p>
              <p>Could you clarify?</p>

              <p>Hi realization,</p>
              <p>As again, your questions would point to describing the same elephant from different perspectives among different beings. </p>
              <p>Let us analyse this.  The general definition of <em>universal</em> and <em>infinite</em> is as follows: -</p>
              <p><em>Infinite</em> = immesurably great; unbounded; unlimited.</p>
              <p><em>Universal</em> = applicable to all purposes, conditions, or situation, adaptable or adjustable to many circumstances.</p>
              <p>From the above desciptions, I believe you would be clear on the characteristics of emptiness.</p>
              <p>As mentioned earlier, emptiness corresponds to 2 distinct scenarios: - </p>
              <p>1.  Inherent existence.</p>
              <p>2.  Dependent arising.</p>
              <p>Point  1 - It means that if we focus purely on emptiness, it cannot be segmented or dissected further to see the real origin.  Emptiness is not dependent on any other origin components to produce emptiness.  Emptiness in itself is the core and basic origin.  Therefore, it has unchanging nature that all conventional phenomena lack.  This conclusion is made from the <em>Ultimate</em> perspective - seeing into the within of the within.</p>
              <p>Point 2 - Emptiness would not exist without a dependent partner.  If there were no objects to analyse, then emptiness as such could not be realised.  Without objects, there can be no emptiness - a circumstance that points to <em>emptiness</em> of emptiness.  This conclusion is made from the <em>Conventional </em>perspective - seeing as a subject on the other side of the object or matter.</p>
              <p>As a summary, an enlightened mind would see and realise on both the above scenarios at the same time (a wholesome conclusion).</p>
