              <p>Takso, some of the stuff you said is theoretically sound, however I do not agree with making emptiness an inherent existence.</p>
              <p>Emptiness is the unchanging nature of all phenomena, that is true. However it is simply the 'lacking of findability, metaphysical essence, graspability, locatability' that is being spoken of. In other words, the nature of all things are that they are nature-less, they are empty of inherent existence or attributes.</p>
              <p>Emptiness is empty of inherent existence.. there is no inherent existence of emptiness. There is no findability of an "unfindability". Emptiness is just this unfindability of an inherent existence anywhere: of a self (subjective experiencer), or an object (any experienced object).</p>
              <p>Don't make emptiness into another view - emptiness is merely a non-asserting negation.</p>
              <p>As Namdrol says here:</p>
              <div style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: small;"><em>"The great 11th
                                              Nyingma scholar Rongzom points out that only Madhyamaka accepts
                                              that its critical methodology "harms itself", meaning that
                                              Madhyamaka uses non-affirming negations to reject the positions of
                                              opponents, but does not resort to affirming negations to support a
                                              position of its own. Since Madhyamaka, as Buddhapalita states
                                              <strong>"does not propose the non-existence of existents, but
                                              instead rejects claims for the existence of existents"</strong>,
                                              there is no true Madhyamaka position since there is no existent
                                              found about which a Madhyamaka position could be formulated;
                                              likewise there is no false Madhyamaka position since there is no
                                              existent found about which a Madhyamaka position could be
                                              rejected."</em></span></div>
              <div style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; line-height: 150%;">.......<br></div>
              <p><em><br>Dependent origination is not a view. It is the pacification of 
                      views. Emptiness is not a view, it is the pacification of views. This is
                       stated countless times in Madhyamaka texts. <br><br>Where there is no view, there is no proliferation. Where there is no proliferation, there is no view. <br><br>view = proliferation. <br><br>N</em></p>
              <p>Lastly, I would suggest meditating on the luminous nature of mind first (luminous clarity, luminous presence, pure awareness), and then seeing the inseparability of luminosity and emptiness. Otherwise the understanding of emptiness remains conceptual. Dzogchen, Mahamudra, Zen, and so on stresses a lot about this. Even Theravada too, but in another more gradual way.</p>

              <p>No!</p>
              <p>This is false. The Buddha never taught that cessation of memory leads to cessation of ignorance. Rather, he taught that knowledge and vision (realization of emptiness) leads to the end of ignorance. So what you provided is a falsely fabricated version of dependent origination that is simply false.</p>
              <p>First of all, we CANNOT cease memory (apart from being merely a temporary shamatha state that does not liberate) - memory will always be a necessary and important function in our everyday lives. The Buddha himself remembered 91 aeons of his past lives. Also, Buddha never taught anything like 'living in the present moment means no more ignorance'.</p>
              <p>You can live in the present moment and still be as ignorant as ever (the sense of self and clinging is imprinted and latent, and cannot be removed merely by remaining in a non-conceptual state). Also, you can engage in recalling events of the past, and still be as wise (i.e. your wisdom of emptiness is never diminished by the activity of recalling). What is required is realization into anatta and emptiness. There is thinking, no thinker. Thoughts are empty but vividly manifest. Recalling, engaging in thoughts is not an affliction (Buddhas and awakened beings continue to do that) - it is the view of selfness that is the cause of afflictions.</p>
              <p>I think this is a very poor understanding of dharma by the author.</p>
              <p>I don't have time but hope simpo_ can comment when he sees fit. (I will only be back in Singapore a week later) I know some of our moderators are often busy, but for the sake of right dharma being propagated and remain in the world, sometimes we all (not just monks and nuns) have the responsibility to do our part and engage in sharing our insights and experience. It seems that those who truly know are getting rare in this degenerate age.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 4.7pt;">Every second; every minute, every hour; every day &amp; night - we observe things, let things pass by; learn something; let go something &amp; finally realise something. Somehow, we have actually learned, graduated &amp; liberated out of something without much realising.  In other words, every one of us has actually tasted “little” Enlightenment in one way or another and this has already become good and sweet motivation for us to elevate up and move forward until we are ready to fully liberate ourselves from this <em>Samsara</em> realm.  </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 4.7pt;">Enlightenment isn't just 'learning more things' since 'learning more things' can mean 'learning more mundane things.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 4.7pt;">Enlightenment is the realization of the nature of reality, the inseperability of luminosity and emptiness, the nature of phenomenon, the realization of anatta and emptiness that can liberate us from all clinging, proliferations, and views.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 4.7pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 4.7pt;">Also, the realization of anatta, emptiness, is permanent and once seen cannot be unseen. It is not something you learn "bit by bit". Learning bit by bit is conceptual knowledge, not direct experiential realization of anatta or emptiness.</p>

              <p>Hi All,</p>
              <p>Will write as a sharing from my understanding only.</p>
              <p>No-self and emptiness are profound realisations. They have to be directly experienced.</p>
              <p>With each realisation, the understanding of our self and its relationship to the phenomenal world changes.The changes (in understanding) are very dramatic, especially for the insight of emptiness. There are not something that you can reason or think your way into realisation.</p>
              <p>These realisations are often accompanied by direct expereinces of perceptual clarity, vividness, penetrating transparency and luminousity. However, it is alway stressed that these qualities must not be attached too.</p>
              <p>Also, will like to stress that initial realisations are just 'entry points' to further refinement and development. More often than not, they do not mean that we are fully enlightened.</p>
              <p>To see if we are fully enlightened, we must be honest with ourselves. Do we still have frustrations under life threatening or difficult circumstances? If we are, then we are not fully enlightened. I, for one, cannot say than i am fully enlightened. But, certainly can understand and experience how the realisations (of no-self and emptiness) and the sustaining of them leads to resolution.</p>

              <p>Dear All,</p>
              <p>The only way to cease all the arguments, twisting of words or understanding is to meditate, meditate, and meditate.</p>
              <p>As simpo has mentioned, to see if we are enlightened, we must be honest with ourselves.  I fully agreed on this statement.</p>
              <p>The fact is that no concepts, words or language could describe or interpret precisely one's experiences. </p>
              <p>When one realise fully on the present moment, the memory aggregate would eventually vanish; for memory of the past would lead to new becoming process in the future, and thus ignorance continues eventually across time and plane of existence.</p>
              <p>Remember, there is no mind, no memory, no becoming, no clinging, no desire, no ignorance, no happiness, no sadness, no changing in the eternal bliss of Nibbana.  If one desire to attain full enlightenment - one has to see it, know it, let go and liberate.  Dukkha would diminish along the way - the more of realisation leads to the more of cessation =&gt; ultimate realisation = ultimate cessation.</p>
              <p>A word of advice to all is that do not be receptive, do not be defensive, just stays cool and analyse thoroughly on any mentioned words, texts, sutras, etc.  Be wise to apply Middle Path approach as recommended by the Buddha.</p>
              <p>Apply your wisdom and you would find your answers to it.  The door is open and you need to walk in the path by yourself; someone could only shine the light or show the way in.</p>
              <p>Therefore, one should apply wisdom in all thoughts or actions and never be too fascinated or obsessed with what was written or mentioned in the so-called texts, doctrines, sutras, etc.</p>
              <p>I wish you all a fruitful journey to Enlightenment.</p>

              <p>I have, and it is very clear from experiential insight that you are twisting the words of Buddha and misrepresenting the Dharma. Please reflect and study more and don't misrepresent the Dharma.</p>
              <p><em><br></em></p>
              <p><em>Remember, there is no mind, no memory, no becoming, no clinging,
                                                  no desire, no ignorance, no happiness, no sadness, no changing in
                                                  the eternal bliss of Nibbana</em>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is sense perceptions, there is mind, there is memory in the Nirvana with remainder (Nirvana experienced by the arahant before bodily breakup). There is no sense perceptions nor mind after the bodily breakup of the Arahant after his final passing, known as Nirvana without remainder.</p>
              <p>The Nirvana with remainder is simply cessation of the three poisons: craving, aversion and ignorance. Past karmas will surface to give rise to consciousness, mind, sense experiences, and obviously memory.</p>
              <p><strong>There is no liberation through cessation of memory. Or rather, there is no cessation of ignorance through cessation of memory. Cessation of ignorance is through knowledge and vision of things as they are (anatta and emptiness), not 'ceasing memory' or 'staying with the present'. Liberation is solely through the arising of insight/wisdom that sees the true nature of phenomena, thus ending ignorance, leading to dispassion and relinquishing of afflictions, clinging, craving, and suffering. Having ended afflictions, there is no more causes for a future samsaric birth.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>More importantly, liberation is not through 'living in the present moment'. You can live in the present moment and still no insights occur, and still you remain as ignorant as ever, and still you are as far from liberation as ever. Staying with the 'present' is simply a shamatha practice.<br></strong></p>

              <p>Hi All,</p>
              <p>Will write as a sharing from my understanding only.</p>
              <p>No-self and emptiness are profound realisations. They have to be
              directly experienced.</p>
              <p>With each realisation, the understanding of our self and its
              relationship to the phenomenal world changes.The changes (in
              understanding) are very dramatic, especially for the insight of
              emptiness. There are not something that you can reason or think
              your way into realisation.</p>
              <p>These realisations are often accompanied by direct expereinces
              of perceptual clarity, vividness, penetrating transparency and
              luminousity. However, it is alway stressed that these qualities
              must not be attached too.</p>
              <p>Also, will like to stress that initial realisations are just
              'entry points' to further refinement and development. More often
              than not, they do not mean that we are fully enlightened.</p>
              <p>To see if we are fully enlightened, we must be honest with
              ourselves. Do we still have frustrations under life threatening or
              difficult circumstances? If we are, then we are not fully
              enlightened. I, for one, cannot say than i am fully enlightened.
              But, certainly can understand and experience how the realisations
              (of no-self and emptiness) and the sustaining of them leads to
              resolution.</p>

              <p>Yes what you said is very true. That is why there is a gradation from 1st bhumi to 10 bhumi, sotapanna to arahantship. The realization of anatta/emptiness is the same between sotapanna and arhant, 1st bhumi bodhisattva and Buddha, while the afflictions removed and qualities attained differ according to the stages.</p>

              <p>IMO, one of the difficulty along the path after the initial realisation (stream entry?) is that it is hard sustaining the realisation throughout.</p>

              <p>In the 1st stage, the defilements arises without us realising that they are the conditions that causes the sense of self. In another word, awareness is not sharp enough to discover the defilements.</p>
              <p>In the 2nd stage, we have spotted the defilements and have decided to eliminate them. Here we are determined to destroy all the defilements.</p>
              <p>In this 2nd stage, our attempt at 'eliminating' defilement is dualistic. Defilements are observed, but are viewed dualistically as 'objects' requiring elimination.

              nature of the 'affliction/defilement'.</p>
              <p>In another word, the defilements are dualistically regarded...
              before their nature can be realised and ascertained. There
              are, in my experience, 2 stage of dualistic conditioning...</p>
              <p>In the 1st stage, the defilements arises without us realising
              that they are the conditions that causes the sense of self. In
              another word, awareness is not sharp enough to discover the
              defilements.</p>
              <p>In the 2nd stage, we have spotted the defilements and have
              decided to eliminate them. Here we are determined to destroy all
              the defilements.</p>
              <p>In this 2nd stage, our attempt at 'eliminating' defilement is
              dualistic. Defilements are observed, but are viewed dualistically
              as 'objects' requiring elimination. This again throw us into
              subject-object division. This is due to failure in understanding
              the nature of the defilements.</p>

              <p>To Longchen:<br><br>Thanks. <br><br>Imo the key is in paying clear attention 
              (mindfulness) and meditative investigation on the defilements until their nature 
              becomes clear: impermanent, unsatisfactory and nonself is the way to insight and 
              as a result natural dropping occurs. It cannot be willed but it can occur as a 
              natural dropping through seeing with naked awareness, but not by reacting to it, 
              nor is it by temporarily suppressing the arising of thoughts (both which are 
              dualistic action presuming that there is a doer that can control the objects of 
              arising, and therefore cannot lead to a true resolution of defilements). 
              <br><br>However when insight arise into the nature of defilements, we naturally 
              stop being drawn in by the allurement of the defilements. We clearly see 
              defilements as suffering/unsatisfactory, as as being empty. Sentient beings are 
              entranced by craving for temporary pleasures, not knowing that the very craving 
              and clinging leads to suffering: in the same way that scratching a sore wound 
              may feel very "right" or pleasurable but is actually making things much worse 
              and increasing the suffering every time you scratch. It is the blindness of 
              sentient beings to the nature of that craving that sustains the samsaric cycle 
              of suffering.<br><br>So liberation from defilements can only happen when we 
              realize the nature of defilements and craving we harbour are like hot charcoal 
              that burns, naturally we drop - it is not by reasoning or willing ourselves to 
              drop. This deep seeing thus naturally leads to disenchantment, dispassion and 
              liberation.<br><br>This is why arahants can no longer give rise to craving: not 
              because he has strong will, but because his combination of wisdom and samadhi is 
              so complete that he can no longer be delusioned about the nature of craving and 
              suffering. It is like you can no longer pick up an object once you recognise it 
              to be hot charcoal.<br><br>Practicing this way also leads to an experiential 
              understanding of the four noble truths: suffering, cause of suffering (craving), 
              end of suffering, way to end suffering.<br><br>Here is something I find useful 
              and effective regarding dealing with addictions:<br><br>"In addition to various 
              recovery programs, the most effective way of undoing addiction that I know of is 
              by giving non-judgmental, open attention to what is happening right now in this 
              moment without seeking a result or trying to change it in any way – simply 
              seeing it clearly. Let's take alcoholic drinking as an example. If you're not 
              yet ready or able to completely stop drinking, then pay attention to the whole 
              process of drinking as it happens. Notice that first impulse for a drink – see 
              what triggers it, be aware of how it happens, notice what it feels like in the 
              body. What is this urge itself actually like? What thoughts are showing up, what 
              mental images, what storylines, what sensations? Is it possible to pause for a 
              moment and fully experience the bodily sensations that go with this urge for a 
              drink, the sense of urgency, the excitement, whatever it is? And then the whole 
              process of "deciding" whether to give in to this urge or whether to resist – how 
              does that so-called decision-making process actually unfold, what are your 
              thoughts telling you? And then buying the bottle, opening it up, pouring the 
              first drink – what does each moment in this process feel like in the body? And 
              then the first sip, what is that like? And how do you feel after one drink – 
              what is pleasurable about it, what isn't? What moves you to have a second drink? 
              What is this urge – do you really want another drink, or is there a fear of what 
              you might feel if you don't keep drinking? How do you feel after that second 
              drink – do you actually like how you feel? What do you like about it and what 
              don't you like? What do you feel like the next morning? What thoughts and 
              stories are arising? Simply paying attention to this whole unfolding process and 
              observing it every step of the way. You'll learn a lot. There are no "right" or 
              "wrong" answers to these questions, and the answers may be different at 
              different moments. It's all about paying attention, being aware of your 
              thoughts, noticing the storylines, feeling the sensations in the body, 
              discovering what is actually going on every step of the way.  When you realize 
              that you are pinching yourself, and when you see how it happens – what the 
              allurement is, how it seduces you, how you do it, how ultimately unsatisfying it 
              is, how it hurts – naturally, you stop.<br><br>The more the light of awareness 
              shines on these habitual mechanisms, and the more clarity there is about how 
              they work,  the more choice and the more possibility there is. The urge for a 
              drink may still arise, but it may be possible not to go with it. And when it 
              isn't possible, then you drink. And you notice what that's like. Maybe over time 
              drinking happens less and less, and maybe alcoholic drinking falls away 
              completely at some point. Maybe at some point a clear decision to stop emerges, 
              or a decision to go into some recovery program, or whatever it might be. It is 
              not actually "your" decision, it is the action of Life Itself."<br><br>- Joan
