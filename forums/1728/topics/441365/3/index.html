              Existence cannot be defined, how to define that  which cannot be, even the word define is a noun.

              In daily living one can be a teacher or a driver or ... aka the ''wave'', but one does not remain the wave, one does not identify to the waves of roles, expereinces and accumulate it, one lets go and remains availabe and responds to the intuitive offerings/manifesting ''ocean''

              <h2>Where There Is No Cold or Heat</h2>
              </div>
              <div>By Ted Biringer, on November 26th, 2010</div>
              <div>
              <p><strong>A monk asked Tozan, “When cold and heat come, how can we
                                      avoid them?”</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Tozan said, “Why don’t you go to the place where there
                                      is no cold or heat?”</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The monk said, “What is the place where there is no cold
                                      or heat?”</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Tozan said, “When it’s cold, the cold kills you; when
                                      it’s hot, the heat kills you.”</strong></p>
              <p>This is not advice to “accept” your situation, as some
                                      commentators have suggested, but a direct expression of authentic
                                      practice and enlightenment. Master Tozan is not saying, “When cold,
                                      shiver; when hot, sweat,” nor is he saying, “When cold, put on a
                                      sweater; when hot, use a fan.” In the state of authentic practice
                                      and enlightenment, the cold kills you, and there is only cold in
                                      the whole universe. The heat kills you, and there is only heat in
                                      the whole universe. The fragrance of incense kills you, and there
                                      is only the fragrance of incense in the whole universe. The sound
                                      of the bell kills you, and there is only “boooong” in the whole
                                      universe…</p>

              <p>Why not?  It's only about realisation per se and nothing in physical form has changed.  We still have our mind, our conscious, our perceptions, etc. remain intact as humans in the material world.  Nothing else in our mental faculties have changed; only our attitude has shifted from our normal way of understanding circumstances to more profound realisation on circumstances. </p>
              <p>At the end of the day, it is entirely a personal choice to cease or not to cease the suffering in life.</p>
              <p>As again, the Buddha has shown the Ultimate Way to cease the suffering.  The Buddha has only opened up a new perspective for one to understand the reality.  No one is commanded to follow the footsteps of the Buddha.</p>
              <p>Once again, our fate in life is determined by ourselves.  If we choose to continue with the cycle of suffering, so be it.  Do not blame others for it, do not be confused about it.  Your ignorance is yours to bear with.</p>
              <p>The saying goes.....</p>

              <p>I asked you because you describe ceasing all twelve links which is only possible after the death of an Arhant or in states like nirodhasamapatti where normal functioning cannot occur...</p>
              <p>For an Arhant who is still living, ignorance and craving ceases, but normal bodily senses and faculties, and feelings (perceptions of pleasant, unpleasant or neutral sensations), still arise owing to past karma (which means there is still dependently arisen phenomenon), even though they no longer create new ones or new causes for future births. This is called the cessation with remainder, in contrast with cessation without remainder (parinibbana).</p>
              <p>Also isn't it contradictory that you said your mind is intact, and yet in the pictures you said the mind disappears into 'a blackhole of emptiness'.</p>
              <p>Can you describe what 'blackhole of emptiness' means, experientially?</p>

              "The black hole of Emptiness forms when the dependent nature of phenomenon dies out and fades away; and the force of awakening caused the Mind to collapse into it to infinitely singular point"
              
              If you are talking about emptiness as the nature of phenomenon, then no, emptiness is not formed when dependent phenomena cease.
              
              Rather, what dependently originates, is precisely empty.
              
              If you are talking about emptiness as a state of relative cessation, which makes it confusing because in other instances you talk about emptiness as the nature of phenomenon, then, relative cessation is not about collapsing the mind into a single point. Enlightenment has nothing to do with mind collapsing into a single point so I have no idea what you are talking about.
              
              In fact there is nothing in Buddhism about mind collapsing into single point, unless you are talking about one pointedness. But one pointedness is not a characteristic of nirvana, rather it is just a necessary mental component when doing tranquil meditation. I.e. You need one pointedness to concentrate the mind on the breathing

              "[Emptiness creates the Samsara, but it enables also the escape or the liberation from it to Nibbana.]"
              
              No. You are making emptiness into a metaphysical essence, a substratum, a source or creator. As Thusness warned before,
              
              "This is not to pick on Advaita Vedenta teachings.Â  Phrase like â€œeverything arises from Emptiness and subsides back to Emptinessâ€� is equally misleading.Â  By doing so, we have made â€˜Emptinessâ€™ into a metaphysical essence; similarly not to make the same mistake for â€œcauses and conditionsâ€�, not to objectify it into a metaphysical essence.Â  All are provisional terms to point to our insubstaintial, essenceless and interdependent nature."
              
              There is really no such thing as "emptiness" - emptiness simply means that interdependently arisen activities are empty of any inherent, locatable, graspable, tangible, substantial, core or existence.
              
              As Thusness used to say before, "In actuality there is no 'Emptiness' to be cognized beyond concepts for 'Emptiness' is just a 'raft' that exist only in conceptuality." And "Thus only for the purpose of communication the above quote is written that way; there is only 'Emptiness' to be cognized by a dualistic/inherent mind,Â no 'Emptiness' to be cognized in true luminosity."
              
              Namdrol also says: "The great 11th Nyingma scholar Rongzom points out that only Madhyamaka accepts that its critical methodology "harms itself", meaning that Madhyamaka uses non-affirming negations to reject the positions of opponents, but does not resort to affirming negations to support a position of its own. Since Madhyamaka, as Buddhapalita states "does not propose the non-existence of existents, but instead rejects claims for the existence of existents", there is no true Madhyamaka position since there is no existent found about which a Madhyamaka position could be formulated; likewise there is no false Madhyamaka position since there is no existent found about which a Madhyamaka position could be rejected."
              
              
              Emptiness is a non-asserting negation: it negates inherent existence of "selves" and "objects" without asserting some ultimate reality or ultimate substratum. To fall into such a view (asserting emptiness as an ultimate substratum) is to become an eternalists (like hindus), while to assert the non-existence of things is to become a nihilist. The middle way is simply to reject views of existence, without asserting non-existence, or some transcendental ultimate reality. Emptiness is empty, there is no "emptiness" ultimately. Just a raft, a non-asserting negation, a fire that burns the candle that consumes both itself and the candle in the end, not leaving any thing (positions, views, etc), not even something called "emptiness". Yet vivid luminosity and appearances are not denied - still as vivid and clear as ever.
              
              So how samsara arise? Samsara is not created. Samsara does not come from something called "emptiness". Samsara arise according to causes (craving, ignorance), and subsides with the cessation of causes (the end of craving, ignorance, afflictions). 
              
              Emptiness is not a thing, it is not an escape from samsara. Samsara does not "escape" into emptiness, because emptiness is not some substratum of things. He said nirvana is the escape from samsara. What is nirvana? Cessation of afflictive arisings (samsara) is nirvana. Cessation is the escape from nirvana, not some substratum of things.
              
              Emptiness as the nature of all phenomena is not the same as relative cessation, since all relative arisings are already ultimately empty, emptiness in the sense of being the nature of everything (lack of independent essence) is thus not a state of nothingness or state of cessation.

              --------
              
              At this juncture, it is necessary to have clarity on what Emptiness is not to prevent misunderstandings:
              
              â€¢ Emptiness is not a substance
              â€¢ Emptiness is not a substratum or background
              â€¢ Emptiness is not light
              â€¢ Emptiness is not consciousness or awareness
              â€¢ Emptiness is not the Absolute
              â€¢ Emptiness does not exist on its own
              â€¢ Objects do not consist of emptiness
              â€¢ Objects do not arise from emptiness
              â€¢ Emptiness of the "I" does not negate the "I"
              â€¢ Emptiness is not the feeling that results when no objects are appearing to the mind
              â€¢ Meditating on emptiness does not consist of quieting the mind
              
              Source: Non-Dual Emptiness Teaching (http://www.heartofnow.com/files/emptiness.html)
              And I would like to add,
              
              Emptiness is not a path of practice
              Emptiness is not a form of fruition

              "[Literally, in Nibbana, all basic elements i.e. energy, matter and space are practically frozen. Any input would churn no output - this arises, that ceases; that arises, this ceases.]"
              
              
              Nibbana means cessation. Not "frozen".
              
              There is no such thing as "this arises, that ceases". This was not taught by Buddha. You are again distorting the teaching of dependent origination. The Buddha teaches this: 
              
              "When there is this, that is.
              With the arising of this, that arises.
              When this is not, neither is that.
              With the cessation of this, that ceases."
              
              When conditions are present, afflictions Will arise.
              
              Nirvana is the cessation of afflictive causes (craving and ignorance), and due to the cessation of afflictive causes, the entire chain of afflictive dependent origination also ceases.
              
              An analogy the Buddha gave is that when the fuel for the fire runs out, the flame stops burning.
              
              So cessation happens in the manner of  "this ceases, that ceases"

              <p>The tunnel of light vision is not the experience of clear light. Clear light is not a visually experienced light as in the tunnel of light. A lot of people don't understand this and distort its meaning. <strong>Clear Light is simply a Metaphor for the sheer brilliance and illuminating quality of pure awareness, not a visually experienced light.</strong></p>
              <p>Worse still, a lot of people experience seeing bright light in meditation, and think it has anything at all to do with Buddha-nature. They are screwed, completely deluded by appearances.</p>
              <p>When you realize the true clear light, you don't see any funny lights. It is just pure awareness.</p>
              <p>As Lobsang P. Lhalungpa clearly states:</p>
              <p>"Lucid awareness" refers to an individual's pure consciousness, which is detached from any dualistic discrimination. A perfect insight into the intrinsic void of reality, it is wisdom with clarity. This is one of those important points that have been misinterpreted in the West. The literal rendering of the original Tibetan term "osel" (spelled 'od-gsal) as "clear light" seems to be the case. It is a metaphor, signifying an inbred clarity.</p>
              <p>The Tibetan text (f. 204 B, l. 4) gives the following description:</p>
              <p><em>The meaning of osel (clear light) consists of its being a natural state - detached from any absolute emergence or cessation and from any substance or element - and being unstained and immutable like spaces or nondifferentiable from it.</em></p>
              <p>Furthermore, the common description "the void of clear light" (Tib. osel tongpanyi, spelled 'od-gsal stong-pa-nyid; Skt. pratibhasa sunyata) makes my point eminently clear."</p>

              <p>By the way, while the subsidance of gross mental experiences can result in a glimpse of clear light, it does not mean that clear light itself is not a 'dependent phenomenon'.*</p>
              <p>Also, more often than not, a glimpse of clear light in the gap between of thoughts is simply a mere glimpse and can lead to the I AM sort of understanding. The Hindus also talk about pure luminous consciousness in the gap between two thoughts (see latest post in <a href="/forums/1728/topics/439257">http://sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/439257</a>). Without insight into the twofold emptiness, we will not gain liberation this way.</p>

              <p>*Clear light mental activity is not dependent on ignorance, so it is in itself not an afflictive phenomenon (adventitious defilements can be destroyed leaving luminosity intact), but it is defiled by afflictions in the manner Buddha spoke of:</p>
              <p>"Luminous, monks, is the mind.<a id="fnt-1" class="noteTag" name="fnt-1" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an01/an01.049.than.html#fn-1">[1]</a> And it is defiled by incoming defilements." <span class="altID">{I,v,9}</span></p>
              <p>"Luminous, monks, is the mind. And it is freed from incoming defilements." <span class="altID">{I,v,10}</span></p>
              <p>"Luminous, monks, is the mind. And it is defiled by incoming 
              defilements. The uninstructed run-of-the-mill person doesn't discern 
              that as it actually is present, which is why I tell you that — for the 
              uninstructed run-of-the-mill person — there is no development of the 
              mind." <span class="altID">{I,vi,1}</span></p>
              <p>"Luminous, monks, is the mind. And it is freed from incoming 
              defilements. The well-instructed disciple of the noble ones discerns 
              that as it actually is present, which is why I tell you that — for the 
              well-instructed disciple of the noble ones — there is development of the

              <p>Nonetheless you should understand mind as also an activity that dependently originates, even though not afflictively.</p>
              <p>Here is an excerpt regarding the dependent origination of clear light by His Holiness the Dalai Lama in his book 'Dzogchen: Heart Essence of the Great Perfection':</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Question: Is the fundamental innate mind of clear light dependent on causes and conditions? If it is not dependent, how can it be empty of independent existence?</p>
              <p>HHDL: This is a very good question. Often in the texts we find mention of the fundamental innate mind of clear light being not produced by causes and conditions. Now here it is important to understand that in general when we use the term 'produced phenomena' there are different connotations. Something can be called 'produced' because it is a production of delusions and the actions they induce. Again, it may also refer to a production by causes and conditions. And there is also a sense of 'produced' as being caused by conceptual thought processes.</p>
              <p>Certain texts speak of the activities of the Buddha as permanent and non-produced in the sense that they are continuous, and that as long as there are sentient beings, the activities of the buddhas will remain without interruption. So, from the point of view of their continuity, these activities are sometimes called permanent.</p>
              <p>In the same manner, the fundamental innate mind of clear light, in terms of its continuity, is beginningless, and also endless. This continuum will always be there, and so from that specific point of view, it is also called 'non-produced'. Besides, the fundamental innate mind of clear light is not a circumstantial or adventitious state of mind, for it does not come into being as a result of circumstantial interaction of causes and conditions. Rather, it is an ever-abiding continuum of mind, which is inherent within us. So from that viewpoint, it is also called 'non-produced'.</p>
              <p>However, although this is the case, we still have to maintain that, because it possesses this continuity, the present fundamental innate mind - this present instant of consciousness - comes from its earlier moments. The same holds true of the wisdom of Buddha - the omniscient mind of Buddha - which perceives the two truths directly and simulttaneously, and which is also a state of awareness or consciousness. Since it is a state of awareness, the factor which will eventually turn into that kind of wisdom, namely the fundamental innate nature of clear light, will also have to be maintained to be a state of awareness. For it is impossible for anything which is not by nature awareness to turn into a state of awareness. So from this second point of view, the fundamental innate mind of clear light is causally produced.</p>

              <p>Also, he explains,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>The fundamental mind which serves as the basis of all phenomena of 
                                            cyclic existence and nirvana is posited as the ultimate truth or nature 
                                            of phenomena (dharmata, chos nyid); it is also called the ‘clear light’ 
                                            (abhasvara, ‘od gsal) and uncompounded (asamskrta, ‘dus ma byas). In 
                                            Nying-ma it is called the ‘mind-vajra’; this is not the mind that is 
                                            contrasted with basic knowledge (rig pa) and mind (sems) but the factor 
                                            of mere luminosity and knowing, basic knowledge itself. This is the 
                                            final root of all minds, forever indestructible, immutable, and 
                                            unbreakable continuum like a vajra. Just as the New Translation Schools 
                                            posit a beginningless and endless fundamental mind, so Nying-ma posits a
                                             mind-vajra which has no beginning or end and proceeds without 
                                            interruption through the effect stage of Buddhahood. It is considered 
                                            ‘permanent’ in the sense of abiding forever and thus is presented as a 
                                            permanent mind.<strong> It is permanent not in the sense of not disintegrating 
                                            moment by moment but in the sense that its continuum is no interrupted…</strong></p>
