              <p>Some articles which I found insightful.</p>
              <p>http://theendofseeking.net/Labeling%20and%20Natural%20Functioning.html</p>
              <h2>Labeling and Natural Functioning</h2>
              <p>The mind is a wonderful tool and it has brought us so much -
              computers, internet and BitTorrent. It does have its place. Mind
              function and thought - under 'proper adult supervision' - is there
              doing its job. It is it's Natural function. There is no 'me' in any of
              that. No problem. No suffering. No separation. No Worries.</p>
              <p>An engineer sorting out a machine that does not work, or
              designing a water tower that needs to be built, or me figuring out how
              some electrical wiring works - all Natural Functioning. But even there,
              the resolution often lies in non conceptual awareness - the pure
              looking, without thought - a moment of clarity, space, stillness. Great
              insights can occur then. Like with Einstein. Or small insights, like
              with the electrical wiring.</p>
              <p>The Natural Functioning of Seeing is there, without a separate
              concept of 'me'. The Natural Functioning has always been there. The
              Natural Functioning of the Seeing itself is a Functioning of Awareness
              which is beyond brain function - the 'no-thing' that is beyond the
              brain. How many things would be seen without the Aliveness, without the
              Awareness?</p>
              <p>Then the thought 'I see' comes up, or the thought 'I think',
              which brings in the apparent separate entity 'I' and attributes the
              seeing/thinking to that. But the seeing, which is a function of
              Awareness, has already occurred. There was no 'I' there at the instant
              of seeing.</p>
              <p>The vast bulk of our life is Natural Functioning and occurs
              without thought. Even if 'we' are thinking of something else at the
              time the Functioning still occurs. We do not need to think 'chair' to
              register the chair, or think 'door' to register the door. There is a
              knowing there which does not need the words or the concepts. If we come
              across something that we do not recognize, or does not make sense, the
              mind is used to help sort that out - that is Natural Functioning. There
              is nothing personal in that - no 'me' there at all in this Natural
              Functioning.</p>
              <p>We walk around the city, drive cars, clean our teeth. We see
              stuff - and only a very, very small part of which we label. Mostly we
              just see - and the knowing is there without reference to the database
              in the head. You see a red light and stop the car - without having
              thoughts about red lights, deceleration or remembering which one is the
              brake. All without reference to the 'me', or any reference point. You
              drive into a sudden 'opening' in the traffic stream - by seeing, then
              acting, as one - without a mental process of thinking about it.</p>
              <p>We learn stuff - and the mind helps a lot in that. Then as
              learning progresses - thought drops away, the concepts drop away -
              leaving just the Functioning.</p>
              <p>Roger Federer playing tennis is pure Natural Functioning. Even
              though the mind was involved in developing these skills, the mind
              function has fallen away - all that is left is the Natural Functioning
              and knowing - without reference to the past and without
              labeling/conceptualization and without any 'me'. He does not think
              'ball' every time he sees one. He does not even need a concept called
              'ball' - who needs a concept when you have a knowing about the
              actuality?</p>
              <p>Using the mind in this way is Natural Functioning. It is the
              way we learn and is built into us. It is our Natural Functioning. Just
              as learning is built into the cats in their 'catty' way - as their
              Natural Functioning.</p>
              <p>You can look  at a clock and tell the time, but without the translation into words and concepts.  Just seeing.</p>
              <p>Labeling takes us into conceptual thought, references to the
              past and in the main adds nothing to what is already seen and known.
              Knowing that the name of a fish is 'Guppy' and its scientific name is
              Lebistes reticulatus adds nothing to what has been seen. We do not
              understand anything more at all - but we think that labeling is
              necessary and think that it is knowledge.</p>
              <p>Labeling a certain sensation/feeling as 'anger' or 'anxiety'
              takes us into conceptual thought, into the past and the future and away
              from the Actuality.</p>
              <p>'Witnessing the anger' as a 'spiritual practice' does nothing
              at all as that is purely conceptual. The anger does not exist - it is
              just a concept. 'Anger' is just a label and labeling it as such does
              not bring us any more understanding of what is actually there. The
              Actuality is the feeling/sensation/energy movement and not the label,
              the concept - 'anger'.</p>
              <p>Add to that the 'witness' that does the 'witnessing' - is also
              conceptual and a label that adds nothing. The actuality is that all
              there is - is 'seeing' - there is no entity doing the seeing - pure
              seeing by awareness itself, which is not an entity. Labeling and
              conceptualizing makes it appear as if there is a separate entity there.</p>
              <p>The vast bulk of our life is Natural Functioning and is without
              labeling - only a very, VERY small proportion of what we see is
              labeled. We survive very well with minimal labeling as there is an
              effortless, instant knowing there. The knowing is already there with
              the seeing. How else can the label be added, literally as an
              afterthought, yet again?</p>
              <p>Having said all that - there is a place for words, labels and conceptualization.</p>
              <p>But not in 'running the show'.</p>

              <h5>http://theendofseeking.net/Is%20there%20a%20Doer.html</h5>
              <h2>Is there a 'Doer'?</h2>
              <p>It is true that "We are Lived", "Life Lives Us" and "We are an expression of the One Life".</p>
              <p>Does this mean that we are not the 'Doer' of anything?</p>
              <p>Actions arise, things get done - there is no doubt about that.</p>
              <p>The question remains - Who or what is the 'Doer'?</p>
              <p>We only have two candidates  nominated as the 'doer'.</p>
              <ol>
              <li>Awareness / Aliveness / Consciousness / Presence-Awareness / Intelligience-Energy / God.
              <p> </p>
              </li>
              <li>The 'me', the ego, the reference point. </li>
              </ol>
              <p><br> Looking in more detail</p>
              <ol>
              <li>Awareness / Consciousness / Aliveness.
              <p>Awareness
              / Intelligence-Energy is Omnipresent - which means that it is Present
              in every possibly location in the Universe, without being 'more
              Present' in some places and 'less Present' in others.</p>
              <p>There
              is no possible separation that can exist - and all apparent separation
              is an illusion. One is All. There is no room for a separate 'god' and
              no room for a separate 'you' or a separate 'me'.</p>
              <p>There cannot be a separate 'doer'.</p>
              <p>Some
              hold that "Consciousness is the 'ultimate doer' ", but that is
              Dualistic. There is no separation between Consciousness and anything
              else, even an 'ultimate 'doer'. The 'ultimate doer' is just a concept,
              a label, an abstraction. The actuality is there is only DO-ing but no
              separate 'Doer' except in the mind as a thought.</p>
              <p>Everything
              arises in Consciousness in the immediacy of the Present Moment. It does
              not arise from a 'separate Doer' or a 'separate Source'.</p>
              <p>Consciousness is non-personal - there is no entity  that can be a 'Doer' or a 'Source'.</p>
              <p>Everything just arises. That is it.</p>
              <p>There is only Consciousness / Awareness / Intelligence - Energy. God.</p>
              <p> </p>
              </li>
              <li>The 'me', the ego </li>
              <p>The ego is just a thought. The 'me' is just a thought.     It has no power at all in it's own right.</p>
              <p>The 'me' cannot be the 'doer' but it certainly claims to be.</p>
              <p>Awareness sees and the       'me' says "I see".  Awareness hears and the 'me' comes in and says "I hear".</p>
              <p>The seeing and the hearing have already occurred before the thoughts "I see" and "I hear" arise.</p>
              <p>These thoughts are 'after thoughts'      - occurring after the event to which they refer.</p>
              <p>Thoughts have no power of themselves.</p>
              <p>Thoughts cannot be the 'doer'.</p>
              </ol>
              <p>The understanding is that there IS NO DOER AT ALL. Everything just arises in consciousness.</p>
              <p>We are Lived. Life Lives us.</p>
              <p><strong>But what then of the statement 'I am not the doer'? </strong></p>
              <p>This statement is flawed for two reasons - the assumptions on which it is based.</p>
              <ol>
              <li>There
              is an assumption that a 'me' or an 'I' actually exists as a separate
              entity. So there is a belief in a non-existent 'me' which denies being
              the 'doer'.
              <p>That entity, when investigated is found not to exist, at which point the issue of 'who is the doer' is no longer an issue.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p>The
              'doer' actually does not exist anywhere else other than thought. It is
              an abstraction. What happens is DO-ing, which is a Movement of
              Consciousness in the immediacy of the Present Moment.</p>
              <p>The
              mind (which likes to divide and separate) latches onto this and
              describes it in terms of a DOER and something that is DONE - but in
              fact there is only DO-ing.</p>
              <p>So the statement "I am not the doer" is correct except that there is no 'I' and there is no 'doer'.</p>
              </li>
              </ol>
              <p><strong>How
              about "there is no doer and people should not be blamed for what they
              apparently 'do' and nor should you blame yourself either ". </strong></p>
              <p>This statement is seriously flawed as well, in addition to the reasons above, which equally apply to this statement</p>
              <ol>
              <li>In
              blaming yourself there is an implicit belief in the 'me' that is doing
              the blaming and the same 'me' that is being blamed. So it is the Ego
              blaming the Ego. Total mind stuff. None of this exists except in the
              imagination.
              <p> </p>
              </li>
              <li>Whether there is blaming or not is
              not the issue - the issue is the solid and steadfast belief in the
              existence of the 'me' in the first person. There is a similar belief in
              the separate entity of others (their 'me'). All are illusions. None
              actually exist.
              <p>If there is no 'me' here - how possibily could there be a 'me' over there?</p>
              <p> </p>
              </li>
              <li>When the 'me' is seen through - seen for the fiction that it is - the subject of blaming does not arise. It is a red herring. </li>
              </ol>
