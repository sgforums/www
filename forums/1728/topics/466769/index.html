            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong><br>The understanding of Nirvana in the different schools of Buddhism</strong><br><br>Just saw Geoff (nana/jnana) wrote a great informative post explaining the different understanding of Nirvana in the various Hinayana or Mahayana traditions of Buddhism:<br><br>"For the TheravÄ�da, nibbÄ�na is an ultimately real dhamma (paramatthadhamma) and the only dhamma that is not conditioned (asaá¹…khata). It is an object of supramundane cognition (lokuttaracitta) and is included in the mental phenomena sensory sphere (dhammÄ�yatana) and the mental phenomena component (dhammadhÄ�tu). The four paths, four fruits, and nibbÄ�na are classified as the unincluded level (apariyÄ�panna bhÅ«mi), that is, not included in the sensual realm, the form realm, or the formless realm. According to the Visuddhimagga, nibbÄ�na "has peace as its characteristic. Its function is not to die; or its function is to comfort. It is manifested as the signless; or it is manifested as non-diversification (nippapañca)."<br><br>According to the SarvÄ�stivÄ�da, nirvÄ�á¹‡a is an analytical cessation (pratisaá¹ƒkhyÄ�nirodha) that is a disjunction from impure dharmas that occurs through analysis (pratisaá¹ƒkhyÄ�na), which is a specific type of discernment (prajñÄ�). This analytical cessation is substantially existent (dravyasat) and ultimately exists (paramÄ�rthasat).<br><br>For SautrÄ�ntika commentators nirvÄ�á¹‡a as an analytical cessation (pratisaá¹ƒkhyÄ�nirodha) is a merely a conceptual designation (prajñapti) and doesn't refer to an entity or state that is substantially existent (dravyasat). It is a non-implicative negation (prasajyapratiá¹£edha), that is, a negation that doesn't imply the presence of some other entity. Therefore nirvÄ�á¹‡a simply refers to a cessation that is the termination of defilements that are abandoned by the correct practice of the noble path.<br><br>According to the YogÄ�cÄ�ra, for those on the bodhisattva path, nirvÄ�á¹‡a is non-abiding (apratiá¹£á¹­ha nirvÄ�á¹‡a). The dependent nature (paratantrasvabhÄ�va) is the basis (Ä�Å›raya) of both defilement and purification. The all-basis consciousness (Ä�layavijñÄ�na) is the defiled portion (saá¹ƒkleÅ›abhÄ�ga) of the dependent nature. Purified suchness (viÅ›uddhÄ� tathatÄ�) is the purified portion (vyavadÄ�nabhÄ�ga) of the dependent nature. Synonyms for purified suchness are the perfected nature (pariniá¹£panna) and non-abiding nirvÄ�á¹‡a. Non-abiding nirvÄ�á¹‡a is the revolved basis (Ä�Å›rayaparÄ�vá¹›tti) that has eliminated defilements without abandoning saá¹ƒsÄ�ra.<br><br>Madhyamaka authors accept the notion of non-abiding nirvÄ�á¹‡a, but they don't use the three natures model used by the YogÄ�cÄ�ra. Rather, they simply consider all things to be conceptual designations (prajñapti) that are empty of nature (svabhÄ�va). For them, conceptual designations are relative truth (saá¹ƒvá¹›tisatya) and only emptiness is ultimate truth (paramÄ�rthasatya).<br><br>Zen, Pure Land, VajrayÄ�na, etc., are practice traditions more so than doctrinal schools, and authors writing from any of these perspectives would generally rely on YogÄ�cÄ�ra or Madhyamaka Å›Ä�stras or a specific MahÄ�yÄ�na sÅ«tra."<br><br>Dmytro asked: "Hi ÑÄ�á¹‡a,<br><br>And how you would put the Buddha's description of Nibbana in relation to said above?"<br><br>Geoff replied: "Given the definition given in SN 38.1, SN 43.1-44, and Abhidhamma Vibhaá¹…ga 184, I would say that it's a designation (paññatti, prajñapti) referring to the elimination of passion, aggression, and delusion. Or with regard to the four paths (stream-entry, etc.), a designation referring to the elimination of fetters terminated by each path. This is similar to the SautrÄ�ntika interpretation."<br><br>I concur. Sautrantika has the closest understanding of Nirvana to the original teachings of Buddha, which I shall elaborate in the comments section.</p></div>

               Theravadins have a slightly eternalistic interpretation of Nibbana. In 
              the past, the Sautrantika (which was even much more popular than 
              Theravada until it died out in India along with the whole of Buddhism in
               general, leaving Theravada in other countries like Sri Lanka etc) which
               follows the Buddha's teachings or suttas more to the letter would 
              strictly define nirvana in terms of cessation or elimination of fetters.
               Which is what the Buddha taught that Nirvana is. An eternalistic 
              interpretation of Nirvana as some ultimately existing reality has no 
              basis at all in the Pali canon/Buddha's words which clearly defined in 
              so many instances that Nirvana, not-conditioned, not-born, death-free 
              and so on is simply synonyms for the "elimination of passion, aggression
               and delusion".

               analogy given by the Buddha on Nirvana is a fire going out - and 
              Nirvana simply means cessation, termination, gone out, etc. And with 
              cessation there is no remainder of any kind of being or existence, nor 
              could it be understood in terms of non-being, both or neither.</span><br id=".reactRoot[20].[1][2][1]{comment628596980500855_628597330500820}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[23]"><br id=".reactRoot[20].[1][2][1]{comment628596980500855_628597330500820}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[24]"><span id=".reactRoot[20].[1][2][1]{comment628596980500855_628597330500820}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[25]">"Even
               in the Vedic period there was the dilemma between `be­ing' and 
              `non-being'. They won­dered whether being came out of non-being, or 
              non-being came out of being. Katham asataþ sat jàyeta, "How could being 
              come out of non-being?"[23] In the face of this di­lemma regarding the 
              first be­ginnings, they were some­times forced to conclude that there 
              was neither non-being nor being at the start, nàsadàsãt no sadàsãt 
              tadànãm.[24] Or else in the confusion they would sometimes leave the 
              matter unsolved, say­ing that perhaps only the creator knew about it.</span><br id=".reactRoot[20].[1][2][1]{comment628596980500855_628597330500820}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[26]"><br id=".reactRoot[20].[1][2][1]{comment628596980500855_628597330500820}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[27]"><span id=".reactRoot[20].[1][2][1]{comment628596980500855_628597330500820}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[28]">All
               this shows what a lot of confusion these two words sat and asat, being 
              and non-being, had created for the philosophers. It was only the Buddha 
              who presented a perfect solution, after a complete reappraisal of the 
              whole problem of existence. He pointed out that existence is a fire kept
               up by the fuel of grasp­ing, so much so that, when grasping ceases, 
              existence ceases as well.</span><br id=".reactRoot[20].[1][2][1]{comment628596980500855_628597330500820}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[29]"><br id=".reactRoot[20].[1][2][1]{comment628596980500855_628597330500820}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[30]"><span id=".reactRoot[20].[1][2][1]{comment628596980500855_628597330500820}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[31]">In
               fact the fire simile holds the answer to the tetralemma in­cluded among
               the ten unexplained points very often found men­tioned in the suttas. 
              It concerns the state of the Tathàgata after death, whether he exists, 
              does not exist, both or neither. The presumption of the ques­tioner is 
              that one or the other of these four must be and could be an­swered in 
              the affirmative.</span><br id=".reactRoot[20].[1][2][1]{comment628596980500855_628597330500820}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[32]"><br id=".reactRoot[20].[1][2][1]{comment628596980500855_628597330500820}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[33]"><span id=".reactRoot[20].[1][2][1]{comment628596980500855_628597330500820}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[34]">The
               Buddha solves or dissolves this presumptuous tetra­lemma by bringing in
               the fire simile. He points out that when a fire goes out with the 
              exhaustion of the fuel, it is absurd to ask in which direction the fire 
              has gone. All that one can say about it, is that the fire has gone out: 
              Nibbuto tveva saïkhaü gacchati, "it comes to be reckoned as `gone 
              out'."[25]</span><br id=".reactRoot[20].[1][2][1]{comment628596980500855_628597330500820}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[35]"><br id=".reactRoot[20].[1][2][1]{comment628596980500855_628597330500820}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[36]"><span id=".reactRoot[20].[1][2][1]{comment628596980500855_628597330500820}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[37]">It
               is just a reckoning, an idiom, a worldly usage, which is not to be

              there in its own right. They would not say where, but sometimes they 
              would even say that it is everywhere. With an undue grammatical 
              em­phasis they would say that it is on coming to that Nibbàna that lust 
              and other defilements are aban­doned: Nibbànaü àgamma ràgàdayo khãõàti

              <p>To be more precise, rejecting Nirvana as a true existence frees you from the substantialist attachment of Nirvana belonging to *some* of the Hinayana schools, since among the main Hinayana schools, only Theravada and normal Sarvastivadins hold a substantial view with regards to Nirvana whereas the Hinayana school of the Sautrantika do not hold Nirvana to be a truly existing entity.<br><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><br>Basically since the Pali suttas do not suggest a substantialist view of Nirvana, we can logically deduce that the early Sangha or arahants did not view Nirvana as some true existence, but it is the result of latter deductions and commentaries that Nirvana is being treated that way.<br><br>Annihilation of a real being or entity does not apply either when a true existing entity cannot be established in the first place for it to be annihilated later.

              <p>No, Hinayana is not synonym for Theravada. Actually, there were 18 Hinayana schools in the past. But the only surviving one out of the 18 today is Theravada. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Why? Because of the Islamic invasion in the 13th century which virtually wiped out all of Buddhism from India including the more popular Hinayana schools at that time, leaving only the 'less popular Hinayana schools' like Theravada which remain unaffected since they only existed in places like Sri Lanka and other places. Needless to say, Mahayana also remained unaffected since they only existed at the outskirts and other places outside India at that time.</span><br><br>The emptiness of Theravada focuses on person-empty, while Mahayana teaches both person-empty and dharma-empty. However in the earliest suttas, i.e. Pali Suttas, that the Hinayana schools follow, the dharma-empty teachings are already taught but later not grasped correctly thus resulting in doctrines of substantial dharmas in the Abhidharma later.</p>

              <p>Ajahn Brahmavali:<br><br>Dear Dania,<br> <br> I feel a bit awkward criticizing Ven. Bodhi. I consider him as one of my
               main teachers of the Dhamma. For a long time I have been reading his 
              writings and much of my comprehension of the Dhamma is due to his 
              excellent translations and commentaries. I have a great sense of 
              gratitude towards him and much respect. At the same time, I suppose 
              there comes a time when a student has gained enough understanding to 
              stand on his own two legs. So perhaps in this case it would not be wrong
               to present my own understanding of this issue.<br> <br> It seems to me that the main mistake Ven. Bodhi makes here is to give a 
              direct answer to a question that is based on a misunderstanding. There 
              is an exchange between Ven. SÄ�riputta and Ven. MahÄ�kotthita in the 
              Anguttara Nikaya (AN4:173) which makes this very point:<br> <em><br> </em></p>

              <p>So these very questions are just proliferations; they are 
              misconceived. The Dhamma is not about attaining or not attaining an 
              existing reality. It’s about ending suffering. The reason why anyone is 
              concerned about what happens when the <em>arahant </em>dies is because of their sense of self. The sense of self makes us perceive the death of an <em>arahant </em>either
               as annihilation or some sort of eternal existence. Once the false sense
               of self is removed, one no longer perceives the death of an <em>arahant </em>in
               either of these ways, and the concern about what happens to them after 
              death just falls away. I feel Ven. Bodhi should have pointed this out 
              rather than try to answer the question. That would have been much more 
              useful for the inquirer’s understanding of the Dhamma.  <br> <br> Having said this, I also do not find Ven. Bodhi’s arguments persuasive. 
              Before I consider Ven. Bodhi’s individual points, I should point out a 
              general danger in arguing that <em>NibbÄ�na </em>is “an existing reality”. It is impossible to conceive of a reality beyond the six senses, at least for non-<em>ariyans</em>. For this reason, any idea of <em>NibbÄ�na </em>as an existing reality will by default be understood in terms of the eternal continuation of one or more of the five <em>khandhas</em>. The result of this will often be attachment to a refined form of the five <em>khandhas</em>, in particular refined states of <em>samÄ�dhi</em>, and taking this as <em>NibbÄ�na</em>.
               So the best thing to do is to put this question aside and instead 
              practice the path until one penetrates non-self. Only when one sees this
               will one understand that the very question was misconceived.<br> <br> Now let me try to reply to some of Ven. Bodhi's points.<br> <em><br></em></p>
              <p><em> </em></p>
              <div class="bbcode_container"><em> </em>
              <div class="bbcode_quote"><em> </em>
              <div class="quote_container"><em> The Buddha refers to Nibbana as a 'dhamma'. For example, he says "of
               all dhammas, conditioned or unconditioned, the most excellent dhamma, 
              the supreme dhamma is, Nibbana". 'Dhamma' signifies actual realities, 
              the existing realities as opposed to conceptual things.</em></div>

              </div>
              </div>
              <p>The full quote that Ven. Bodhi is referring to reads: “To whatever
               extent there are phenomena conditioned or unconditioned, dispassion is 
              declared the foremost among them, that is, the crushing of pride, the 
              removal of thirst, the uprooting of attachment, the termination of the 
              round, the destruction of craving, dispassion, cessation, <em>nibbÄ�na</em>.” (AN4:34) Here, as is common in the <em>suttas</em>, <em>NibbÄ�na </em>is used synonymously with nirodha. <em>Nirodha</em> means “cessation”, the very opposite of a “reality existing in itself”. To fit in with this, <em>NibbÄ�na </em>must simply refer to “extinguishment”, which is its literal meaning, rather than to an existing reality.<br></p>
              <div class="bbcode_container">
              <div class="bbcode_quote">
              <div class="quote_container"><em>However, the unconditioned dhamma is not produced by causes and conditions. </em></div>
              <div class="quote_container"><br></div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>“Extinguishment” is unconditioned because it is not dependent on 
              conditions. That is, it is “free from the conditioned”, which is 
              probably a more appropriate translation of <em>asankhata </em>than “unconditiooned”. Once <em>NibbÄ�na </em>is achieved, it is irreversible, and thus <em>asankhata</em>.<br></p>
              <div class="bbcode_container">
              <div class="bbcode_quote">
              <div class="quote_container"><em>The Buddha also refers to Nibbana as an 'ayatana'. This means realm, plane or sphere. </em></div>
              <div class="quote_container"><br></div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p><em>Ä€yatana </em>often does refer to a “realm, plane or sphere”, but not always. For example at AN9:46, <em>saññÄ�vedayitanirodha</em>, “the cessation of perception and feeling” (which is the cessation of the mind), is called an <em>Ä�yatana</em>. Here the word <em>Ä�yatana </em>simply seems to point to the fact that such cessation is possible. In this context <strong>Ä�yatana </strong>cannot refer to a “realm”; rather it refers to the ending of all realms. Again, when <em>NibbÄ�na </em>is called an <em>Ä�yatana </em>(which actually is very rare; the most celebrated occurrence being Ud 8:1), it is probably used in the same way as <em>nirodhÄ�yatana</em>, and it is perhaps best translated as “the principle of extinguishment“.<br></p>
              <div class="bbcode_container">
              <div class="bbcode_quote">
              <div class="quote_container"><em>The Buddha also refers to Nibbana as a 'dhatu,' an element, the 'deathless element' (amata-dhatu). </em></div>
              <div class="quote_container"><br></div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>The word <em>dhÄ�tu</em>, too, is used in a variety of contexts, and the translation “element” is often not suitable. These contexts include <em>saññÄ�vedayitanirodhadhÄ�tu </em>(“the <em>dhÄ�tu </em>of the cessation of perception and feeling”), <em>avijjÄ�dhÄ�tu </em>(“the <em>dhÄ�tu</em> of ignorance”), <em>nirodhadhÄ�tu</em> (“the <em>dhÄ�tu </em>of cessation”) and then there is the passage <em>jÄ�tipaccayÄ� bhikkhave jarÄ�maranaá¹ƒ uppÄ�dÄ� vÄ� TathÄ�gatÄ�naá¹ƒ anuppÄ�dÄ� vÄ� TathÄ�gatÄ�naá¹ƒ á¹­hitÄ� va sÄ� dhÄ�tu</em> (“monks, from the condition of birth, there is old age and death; 
              whether TathÄ�gatas arise or not, that dhÄ�tu persists”) (SN12:20). In all
               these cases “principle” might be the most suitable translation of <em>dhÄ�tu</em>. Given this wide usage of the word <em>dhÄ�tu</em>, it is not given that <em>nibbÄ�nadhÄ�tu </em>must refer to something existing. Rather, “the principle of extinguishment” might again be a suitable translation.<br></p>
              <div class="bbcode_container">
              <div class="bbcode_quote">
              <div class="quote_container"><em>He also speaks of Nibbana as something that can be experienced by 
              the body, an experience that is so vivid, so powerful, that it can be 
              described as "touching the deathless element with one's own body”. </em></div>
              <div class="quote_container"><br></div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>In my understanding of the <em>sutta </em>idiom, this expression (“experienced with the body”; <em>kÄ�yena phusati</em>) means “direct experience”, i.e. in contrast to inferential understanding. Even the attainment of full cessation (<em>saññÄ�vedayitanirodha</em>)
               is said to be experienced “with the body”, that is, “directly” 
              (AN4:87). In this case, presumably, the meaning is that you experience 
              the process of entering and emerging from cessation. The meaning of 
              directly experiencing the <em>amatadhÄ�tu</em>, “the death-free principle”, should probably be understood in the same way.<br></p>
              <div class="bbcode_container">
              <div class="bbcode_quote">
              <div class="quote_container"><em>The Buddha also refers to Nibbana as a 'state' (pada), as 
              'amatapada' - the deathless state - or ‘accutapada’, the imperishable

              <div class="quote_container"><br></div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>In the main NikÄ�yas, this expression only occurs in verse, once in
               the Dhammapada and once in the TheragÄ�thÄ�. It is very difficult to draw
               any conclusion on the basis of such rare usage, but I would suggest 
              that <em>pada </em>here is used like <em>dhÄ�tu </em>is used above, and that it therefore should be understood in the same way.<br></p>
              <div class="bbcode_container">
              <div class="bbcode_quote">
              <div class="quote_container"><em>Another word used by the Buddha to refer to Nibbana is 'sacca', which means 'truth', an existing reality. </em></div>
              <div class="quote_container"><br></div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Again, there is also <em>nirodha-sacca</em>, which is the third noble truth, which is <em>NibbÄ�na</em>.<br> <br> In sum, <em>NibbÄ�na </em>is very closely related to <em>nirodha</em>, and 
              they are frequently used as synonyms. There is little indication that 
              they should be understood as referring to different realities. On the 
              contrary, when they are respectively translated as “extinguishment” and 
              “cessation”, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that they must be 
              referring to the same thing.<br> <br> I think one of the main reasons people tend to see <em>NibbÄ�na </em>as a “state” is that most translations into English leave <em>NibbÄ�na </em>untranslated. I believe this is a mistake. The word <em>NibbÄ�na </em>in
               itself is meaningless to English speakers, and thus they will tend to 
              read almost anything into it, in particular the idea of an existing 
              “something”. Once you translate <em>NibbÄ�na </em>with “extinguishment”, it becomes much more difficult to read inappropriate ideas into it. Nobody, as far I know, understands <em>nirodha</em>, “cessation”, as some kind of “state”.  In the same way, if we read “extinguishment” rather than <em>NibbÄ�na </em>in the English translations, I believe we would be much less likely to regard it as a “state”.<br> <br> With metta.</p>
