              <p>Recently I've been watching snippets of dharma talks by one of the most 
              famous Chinese Mahayana master around today (though probably not 
              popularly known in the west due to the absence of English translations) 
              who lives in Taiwan, Ven. Hui L<span class="st">ü</span> (<span class="long-title yt-uix-expander-head" title="æ…§å¾‹æ³•å¸«ä½›å­¸è¬›åº§ - å¤§ä½›é ‚é¦–æ¥žåš´ç¶“å¤§ç¶±-5" dir="ltr">æ…§å¾‹æ³•å¸«; pronounced as Hui Lyu)</span>.
               He is so popular among the Chinese (especially in Taiwan, China, as 
              well as South East Asia) that sometimes up to 200,000 people would 
              attend his lectures. Thusness and I thinks his speeches are very good. 
              He is a lineaged Ch'an/Zen master (48th generation lineage holder of the
               Caodong/Soto school and the 42th generation lineage holder of the 
              Linji/Rinzai school) and his wisdom is exceptional. Not only is he 
              deeply enlightened, he is also very knowledgeable (he read through the 
              whole of Tripitaka at least thrice over a period of 15 years, sleeping 
              only one or two hours at night).<br> <br> Decided to do some English translations.<br> <br> p.s. to our Chinese readers, this video is also great but I did not transcribe it: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_1TeV5y8eE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_1TeV5y8eE</a><br> <br> ---------------------------------<br> <a href="http://www.blogger.com/goog_2115252529"><br></a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4O-gAYr5k0">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4O-gAYr5k0</a><br> <br> <span id=".reactRoot[1].[1][2][1]{comment387371391346837_396605557090087}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2]"><span id=".reactRoot[1].[1][2][1]{comment387371391346837_396605557090087}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0" class="UFICommentBody"><span id=".reactRoot[1].[1][2][1]{comment387371391346837_396605557090087}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[3]"><span id=".reactRoot[1].[1][2][1]{comment387371391346837_396605557090087}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[3].0"><span id=".reactRoot[1].[1][2][1]{comment387371391346837_396605557090087}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[3].0.[6]">å¤§

               who are greatly realized do not view/conceive of dharmas. They do not 
              have anything at all, because every dharma is fundamentally empty, every
               dharma is disjointed. They also do not conceive of a body. Why is this 
              so? The four great elements are also fundamentally empty, the five 
              aggregates have always been without a 'self'. Therefore, what does it 
              mean to illuminate/see that the five aggregates are empty? Form is 
              emptiness, feelings, perception, volition and consciousness are also 
              empty. Why do we say that form is emptiness? Form is emptiness, 
              emptiness is buddha-nature, form is the display of buddha-nature. 
              Therefore, for those who are truly realized, [it is seen that] his 
              nature of mind is outpouring within all dependently arisen dharmas, and 
              within the arising and ceasing [dharmas], one attains that not-born and 
              not-ceasing unconditioned dharma, and there is no such thing as [a 
              dichotomy of] 'conditioned' or 'unconditioned'. One sees within a split 
              instant, eternity, and eternity IS this split instant, they are equal 
              without duality.</span><br id=".reactRoot[1].[1][2][1]{comment387371391346837_396605557090087}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[3].0.[13]"><br id=".reactRoot[1].[1][2][1]{comment387371391346837_396605557090087}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[3].0.[14]"><span id=".reactRoot[1].[1][2][1]{comment387371391346837_396605557090087}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[3].0.[15]">Therefore
               we should understand: not conceiving of dharmas, not conceiving of 
              body. Body is composed of [the four great elements of] cohesion (water),
               solidity or inertia (earth), expansion or vibration (air) and heat or 
              energy content (fire). These four great elements are fundamentally 
              empty, the five aggregates - form/matter, feelings, perception, volition
               and consciousness, are originally ungraspable/unobtainable. Every 
              single dharma, the wise knows that every single dharma, has originally 
              been without a self. And in this very instant moment of no-self, that 
              itself is Buddha-nature. Therefore, when the Buddhadharma talks about 
              negation/deconstruction, all appearances are illusory false appearances. When 
              talking from the standpoint of affirmation, dust after dust 
              [phenomena] is the True Mind, every single bit of micro-dust is the 
              shadows [appearance/display] of True Mind, every single dharma is entirely True. 
              When it has removed all our ignorance and suffering, broken apart our 
              attachments, removed our discriminations, everything in its completeness
               is the display of True Mind, every dust turns out to be True, there is 
              not a single dharma that is not True Mind, this is speaking from the 
              standpoint of affirmation. Standing from the perspective of negation/deconstruction, 
              all appearances are ungraspable/unobtainable. Standing from the 
              perspective of the world of fundamental body, every appearance is the 
              display of the world of fundamental body [i.e. dharmadhatu], it is the pure mind's 
              appearance/manifestation, there is not a single dharma that is not true.</span></span></span></span></span><br> <br> <span id=".reactRoot[1].[1][2][1]{comment387371391346837_396605557090087}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2]"><span id=".reactRoot[1].[1][2][1]{comment387371391346837_396605557090087}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0" class="UFICommentBody"><span id=".reactRoot[1].[1][2][1]{comment387371391346837_396605557090087}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[3]"><span id=".reactRoot[1].[1][2][1]{comment387371391346837_396605557090087}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[3].0">---------------------------------</span></span></span></span><br> <span id=".reactRoot[1].[1][2][1]{comment387371391346837_396605557090087}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2]"><span id=".reactRoot[1].[1][2][1]{comment387371391346837_396605557090087}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0" class="UFICommentBody"><span id=".reactRoot[1].[1][2][1]{comment387371391346837_396605557090087}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[3]"><span id=".reactRoot[1].[1][2][1]{comment387371391346837_396605557090087}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[3].0"><br></span></span></span></span>å¤§æ‚Ÿä¹‹äººï¼ŒçœŸå¦„æ— åˆ«ï¼Œç”Ÿä½›ä¸�äºŒï¼Œèƒ½æ‰€çš†æ³¯ï¼Œå¿ƒå¢ƒå�Œå¿˜ã€‚<br> <br> Those who are greatly realized [understands] that Reality and

               the purpose of cultivation is to attain enlightenment, to realize that 
              every dharma is fundamentally empty, returning to 
              no-attainment/ungraspability, returning to the nature of self in its 
              immediacy, realizing that there is nothing to attain/grasp. Originally 
              there is no birth, how could there be a cessation? Birth and cessation 
              are spoken to worldly beings, [in actuality] in this instant moment 
              there is already no birth and no cessation. It is not the case that 
              within birth and death, there is something that is unborn and undying. 
              We practitioners that read the sutras are often mistaken about this, 
              thinking that inside the birth and cessation of dharmas there is an 
              unborn and undying basic nature, that is wrong! Actually it is the case 
              that with regards to arising and ceasing dharmas, in that instant 
              moment, there has never been a self-nature, and through this one 
              realizes the basic nature that is not-born. We are saying that the birth
               and ceasing's very instant is dependently originated, empty in 
              nature, without self-nature, therefore they are without birth, without 
              cessation. We should very well go and ponder and realize this.</span></span></span></span></span><br> <br> ---------------------------------<br> <br> From (for those that can watch Chinese): <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDVQVq0UM6U&amp;feature=related">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDVQVq0UM6U&amp;feature=related</a><br> <br> Commentary on the Shurangama Sutra by Ven Hui Lu, on the chapter that discusses "All dharmas are Buddha-nature"<br> <br> ç¬¬äºŒç« ï¼Œä¸€åˆ‡æ³•æœ¬å¦‚æ�¥è—�ï¼Œå“ªä¸€åˆ‡æ³•å‘¢ï¼Ÿäº”é˜´ã€�å…­å…¥ã€�å��äºŒå¤„ã€�å��å…«ç•Œï¼Œæœ¬å¦‚æ�¥è—�ï¼Œè¿™ä¸ªä½œå¦‚ä½•è§£é‡Šå‘¢ï¼Ÿ<br> <br> Second chapter: Every single dharma is fundamentally the Treasury of the
               Thus Come One [tathagatagarbha/Buddha-nature], what are the dharmas? 
              Five aggregates, six entries, twelve sense bases, eighteen elements, are
               all fundamentally the Treasury of the Thus Come One. How do we explain

              and Consciousness; when the eighth consciousness transforms into the 
              Great Perfect Mirror Wisdom, the labels/conventional images of these 
              five aggregates completely disappears. Although the names are 
              transformed, its body is not transformed. This false name is being 
              transformed into what is being called the Great Perfect Mirror Wisdom, 
              [hence] Form IS Buddha-nature, feeling IS buddha-nature, perception IS 
              buddha-nature, volition IS buddha-nature, consciousness IS 
              buddha-nature.<br> <br> æ�¢å�¥è¯�è¯´ï¼šç…§è§�äº”è•´çš†ç©ºï¼Œå½“ä½“å�³ç©ºï¼Œä½›æ€§å°±æ˜¾çŽ°ã€‚ä¹Ÿå°±æ˜¯è¯´ï¼Œè‰²å°±æ˜¯èº«ï¼Œå�—æƒ³è¡Œè¯†å°±æ˜¯å¿ƒï¼Œèº«å¿ƒçœ‹å¾—ç ´ã€�æ”¾å¾—ä¸‹çš„äººï¼Œè€Œä¸”è¦�å®Œå…¨å½»åº•ï¼Œé‚£ä¹ˆå°±æ˜¯ä½›ï¼Œç…§è§�äº”è•´çš†ç©ºï¼Œåº¦ä¸€åˆ‡è‹¦åŽ„ã€‚<br> <br> To put it in another way: by illuminating/seeing that the five 
              aggregates are empty, that its essence is empty, Buddha-nature reveals 
              itself. Therefore it is saying, form/matter is body/matter, feelings, 
              perceptions, volitions, and consciousness is mind. Those who are able to
               see through/be disillusioned with Body and Mind, are able to let them 
              go, and furthermore are able to be complete [in disillusionment/letting 
              go], precisely that is Buddha, being able to illuminate that the five 
              aggregates are empty, and thus liberate all sufferings.<br> <br> æ‰€ä»¥ï¼Œä½›è½¬è¿™ä¸ªäº”é˜´èº«ä¸ºé‡‘åˆšä¸�å��èº«ï¼Œæ˜¯æŒ‡æ¶…ç£�å¦™æ€§ï¼Œè€Œä¸�æ˜¯æŒ‡ç›¸ï¼Œé‡Šè¿¦ä¸–å°Šåœ¨è¿™ä¸ªç›¸ä¸Šç¤ºçŽ°ï¼Œä¹Ÿæœ‰ç”Ÿã€�æœ‰è€�ã€�æœ‰ç—…ã€�æœ‰æ­»ï¼Œé‚£æ˜¯ä»Žç›¸ä¸Šé‡Œé�¢æ�¥è®²ã€‚<br> <br> Therefore, the Buddha transforms this body of five aggregates into the 
              Indestructible Diamond Body, that is refering to the Marvellous Nirvanic
               Nature, it is not refering to appearance. Shakyamuni Buddha manifests 
              in appearance birth, ageing, sickness and death, that is speaking from 
              the perspective of appearance.<br> <br> æ‰€è°“ä½›ï¼Œæ˜¯ç¦»ä¸€åˆ‡ç›¸ï¼Œå�³å��è¯¸ä½›ï¼›å¦‚æ�¥è€…ï¼Œå�³è¯¸æ³•å¦‚ä¹‰ã€‚æ�¢å�¥è¯�è¯´ï¼šè‰²å�—æƒ³è¡Œè¯†æ— è®ºæ€Žä¹ˆå�˜åŒ–ï¼Œä»–çš„å¿ƒéƒ½æ˜¯å¦‚å¦‚ä¸�åŠ¨ï¼Œèµ·å¿ƒåŠ¨å¿µï¼Œæ²¡æœ‰æˆ‘æ‰§ï¼Œä¹Ÿæ²¡æœ‰æ³•æ‰§ï¼Œæ‰€ä»¥å�«å�šäº”é˜´æœ¬å¦‚æ�¥è—�ï¼Œå¦™çœŸå¦‚æ€§ã€‚<br> <br> What is termed Buddha, is to leave [all conceivings with regards to] all
               appearances, that is named as all Buddhas; the Thus Come One means 
              being 'such' with regards to all dharmas. In other words: no matter how 
              form, feelings, perceptions, volition and consciousness changes, his 
              mind is always unmoving in suchness, whenever his mind arises and 
              thought moves, there is no attachment to self, nor attachment to 
              dharmas, therefore it is said that the aggregates are fundamentally the 
              Treasury of the Thus Come One, the marvellous nature of True Suchness.<br> <br> è¿™ä¸ªå…­å…¥ï¼šçœ¼ã€�è€³ã€�é¼»ã€�èˆŒã€�èº«ã€�æ„�ï¼Œå¯¹è¿™ä¸ªè‰²ã€�å£°ã€�é¦™ã€�å‘³ã€�è§¦ã€�æ³•ï¼Œæ„�æ€�æ˜¯è¯´ï¼šè¿™å…­å…¥ï¼Œå…¶å®žä¹Ÿæ˜¯å¦‚æ�¥è—�æ€§æ‰€åœ¨ç¼˜èµ·ä¸Šé‡Œé�¢å»ºç«‹çš„ï¼Œå¦‚æ�¥è—�æ€§ï¼Œå®ƒçœ‹ä¸�åˆ°ã€�æ‘¸ä¸�åˆ°ã€�å—…ä¸�åˆ°ï¼›ä½†æ˜¯ï¼Œå®ƒå�¯ä»¥èµ·ä½œç”¨ã€‚<br> <br> These are the six entries: eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind, being

              through the dependent arising of the Treasury of the Thus Come One. It 
              cannot be seen, cannot be touched, cannot be smelled; however, it can

              obscures] our pure mind; on the other hand these six entries are for the
               Buddha exactly the place that illuminates light and moves the earth,

              moving thoughts, therefore it is known that the six sense-objects that 
              are not prejudiced is to be in harmony with true enlightenment. As for 
              the entry of eyes, it is as said by the Buddha, what is known as entry

              beginningless ignorance, it is a false understanding, the Buddha has 
              never said such a saying; the Buddha has never said: from true emptiness
               comes marvellous existence, marvellous existence true emptiness, [I 
              have] searched throughout the entire Tripitaka [the three textual

              self-nature, conceiving that the Treasury of the Thus Come One is always
               unchanging in suchness, unchanging in suchness, like a pool of dead

              according to conditions. When the Buddha preaches the dharma he is also 
              in Samadhi, in movement, standing, sitting and sleeping, the ingenuity 
              in varying usage depends on natural intelligence, how could there be an

              completely and greatly realized people would say, for if you talk about

              change, if it were unchanging it would be like a pool of dead water, how

Therefore: Buddha nature is Impermanence. What is 
              known as Buddha-nature is Impermanence, is spoken from the point of view
               of marvellous activities; when Buddha-nature is spoken as permanent, it
               is spoken from the perspective of [fundamental] body, when speaking to 
              those who have not realized, this is the only way we can explain.<br> <br> è®²æ— å¸¸ï¼Œæ˜¯ä½›æ‚²å¤©æ„�äººï¼Œè®©ä½ è§‰æ‚Ÿä¸‡æ³•ç”Ÿç�­æ— å¸¸ï¼Œç©ºæ— è‡ªæ€§ï¼Œæ‰€ä»¥ï¼Œé‡Šè¿¦ä¸–å°Šä¸�å¾—ä¸�è®²æ— å¸¸ï¼Œè®©ä½ è§‰æ‚Ÿï¼Œæ��æ—©è§‰æ‚Ÿã€‚<br> <br> When speaking of Impermanence, that is due to the Buddha's bemoaning the
               state of the universe and pitying the fate of mankind, thus letting us 
              realize that the ten thousand dharmas are arising and ceasing in 
              impermanency, empty without self-nature, therefore, Shakyamuni Buddha 
              cannot avoid speaking about Impermanence to let you realize it earlier.<br> <br> è®²å¸¸ï¼Œæ˜¯å› ä¸ºç»™äºŒä¹˜äººæœ‰ä¸€ä¸ªä¾�é� ï¼Œè¯´æˆ‘ä»¬çš„å¦‚æ�¥è—�æ€§æ˜¯å¸¸ä¹�æˆ‘å‡€ï¼ŒäºŒä¹˜äººå�ˆæ‰§è‘—æœ‰ä¸€ç§�ä¸œè¥¿å�«å�šå¸¸ä¹�æˆ‘å‡€ï¼Œå�ˆæ‰§è‘—ä¸€ä¸ªå¸¸ã€‚<br> <br> When explaining Permanence, it is for the purpose of providing something
               to rely on for the practitioners of the two [lower] vehicles, wherefore
               we speak of our Treasury of the Thus Come One as Permanence, Bliss, 
              Self and Purity, however the practitioners of the two [lower] vehicles 
              then grasp after a kind of something that is 'Permanent, Blissful, Self 
              and Purity', and thus again becoming attached to an eternal something.<br> <br> (my personal comments: certainly this issue does not apply to the 
              'arahants' of Buddhism who have realized anatta or no-soul, maybe the 
              comment is more appropriate for adherents of the non-Buddhist tradition,
               the term 'two vehicles' originally meant for the arahants and 
              pratyekabuddhas have in latter days of Chinese Mahayana become a very 
              loose term used to imply all and any kind 'misguided practitioners')<br> <br> é‡Šè¿¦ç‰Ÿå°¼ä½›è®²æ— å¸¸ï¼Œæ˜¯ä¸ºäº†ç ´é™¤ä½ çš„è´ªï¼›è®²å¸¸ï¼Œæ˜¯ä¸ºäº†äºŒä¹˜äººæœ‰ä¸€ä¸ªä¾�é� ï¼ŒäºŒä¹˜äººå�´æ‰§è‘—æœ‰ä¸€ç§�ä¸œè¥¿å�«å�šå¸¸ã€‚<br> <br> When the Shakyamuni Buddha talks about impermanence, it is meant for 
              severing your craving; when speaking about permanence, it is meant for 
              providing a means of support for the practitioners of the two vehicles, 
              yet the practitioners of the two vehicles then attached to a kind of

              completely wrong. Imposing any kind of view is not allowed, not one

               emptiness comes the illusory, the Buddha has said: Not-two dharma door

              dependent arising is going in accord with conditions, and apart from

Then that would be splitting it into two, then this 
              is no longer the dharma door of non-duality. Dependent arising is 
              fundamentally empty, just that is the empty nature; birth and death are 
              fundamentally empty, just that is Nirvana, birth and death and nirvana 
              is without distance, Bodhi [enlightenment] is originally not one thing.</p>
