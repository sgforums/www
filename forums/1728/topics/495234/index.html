              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Sanitsuda Ekachai, The Bangkok Post, Feb 3, 2018</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Bangkok, Thailand -- People who believed that the majority of
              monks do not follow the Buddha's path have increasingly turned to meditation
              retreats led by non-monk teachers outside temples. A religious group called
              Techo Vipassana is one of them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The controversy surrounding a new religious group called
              Techo Vipassana led by a self-proclaimed enlightened woman should remind the
              clergy that, short of Sangha reform, it is fighting a losing battle in the
              modern faith market.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Like it or not, the time of monks monopolising Buddhist
              teachings and practices is now over.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Thanks to information technology, ordinary people can now
              have direct access to the Buddha's teachings without having to go through the
              "professionals" in temples as in the old days. The result is the rise
              of lay meditation masters -- both men and women, both genuine and fake.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Meditation retreats led by non-monk teachers outside temples
              are also an increasingly popular answer the middle class' spiritual quests that
              cannot be met by the traditional clergy.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Acharavadee Wongsakon, leader of the Techo Vipassana
              Meditation Centre, is just one of them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Ms Acharavadee became the centre of a controversy when her
              photos as a female religious guru surrounded by doting disciples went viral on
              social media. The photos show monks paying respects to her, implying her
              superior spiritual status while her seating in the religious ceremony gave her
              near-royal status.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Who is she? That question has spread like wildfire.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">What is this strange-sounding Techo Vipassana meditation? The
              term is unheard of in Buddhism. And while there are many self-proclaimed
              enlightened meditation masters in the faith market, why is Ms Acharavadee so
              deeply hated by the clergy?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">With an educational background in marketing and film-making,
              Ms Acharavadee worked in the advertising industry before making her name in
              high society as a jewellery designer and owner of a high-profile diamond store.
              She left high society about a decade ago to set up a Dhamma school for
              youngsters before setting up an organisation called "Knowing Buddha"
              to rally for legal punishment against abuses of Buddha images.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Then her books hit the book stands, establishing her new role
              as a meditation guru. In "Kharawat Banlu Tham", meaning enlightenment
              of lay Buddhists, she said the Buddha told her to write about her meditation
              experiences and ability to see past lives. In Techo Vipassana, she relates how
              the spirit of the late Somdet Phutthachan To Phrom Rangsi, a saint to Thai
              Buddhists, came to teach her a long-lost short cut to nirvana called Techo
              Vipassana.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">According to her website, Techo means the fire element. By
              sharpening mental concentration, the fire element in one's body will be ignited
              to burn up all mental impurities, resulting in lightning-speed enlightenment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">She claimed that was how she became spiritually liberated in
              a short period, and so did many others who followed her shortcut to
              enlightenment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Hers is a classic story line of the creation of new religious
              groups. You establish yourself as the chosen one with magical powers and direct
              access to the locals' saints or gods, the saviour who can provide a shortcut to
              salvation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">When traditional Buddhism tells you to be patient as it can
              take countless lifetimes to thoroughly purify your minds to end the cycle of
              births and deaths, it is not surprising that many in our fast-food culture are
              attracted to Ms Acharavadee's promise of nirvana in this lifetime.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Her meditation centre is serene, beautiful, comfortable and
              located in a scenic setting. The courses are well organised for mass retreats.
              And they are free. Obviously following the system of well-known Goenka
              meditation centres, the courses are supported through voluntary donations.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Interestingly, her claim about a long-lost meditation
              technique is quite similar to that of the Goenka school of meditation. While
              the body-scanning technique of the Goenka school is said to be passed down
              through generations of monks in Myanmar, Ms Acharavadee said she is the
              discoverer through extrasensory channels with a Buddhist saint.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">As curious as Ms Acharavadee's claims are, they are not the
              reason she got into trouble with the clergy.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In mid-January, she launched her "Stop Alajji"
              (stop wayward monks) campaign to "protect Buddhism" and asserted that
              the majority of monks cheat people into making merit for their own gain.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The monks were immediately up in arms.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Representing the voices of mainstream clergy, the website
              www.alittlebuddha.com fired the opening salvo. Ms Acharavadee is accused of
              insulting monks, being anti-clergy and breaking Buddhist teachings by falsely
              claiming and advertising her own enlightenment. Her fund-raising activities
              have also been questioned and calls were made for state intervention and
              punishment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Techo group acted fast. Last week, it held a press
              conference to apologise to "good monks" for going overboard by
              stating that most Thai monks are wayward as a way to emphasise the urgency of
              the problem.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">She blamed the controversy on defectors who maliciously used
              her photos on social media out of context to discredit her; and allegations of
              acting like a royal are particularly sensitive given the harsh lese majeste
              law.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">She called the allegation that she is demanding big donations
              from followers in return of a speedy enlightenment "the most vicious
              lie" of the defectors, and countered with a promise to sue them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Ms Acharavadee insists Techo meditation is in line with
              Buddhism's Satipatthana practices. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Satipatthana is a mindfulness meditation system to foster
              constant awareness of one's material form, feelings, mental activities and
              state of flux or impermanence.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">History dating back to Buddha's time is also full of lay
              Buddhists attaining different levels of spiritual purification through
              practising the precepts and meditation without having to be ordained, she
              argued.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Amid prevalent misunderstanding that spiritual liberation is
              only for monastics, she said she shared her spiritual experience not to boast
              about it, but to encourage people to practice insightful meditation and live
              correctly so they can be spiritually purified step by step.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">She denied the allegation that her group is a cult, insisting
              that her teachings come from Buddhism and she has a strong track record through
              her Knowing Buddha organisation as a protector of Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Talking about the monks' fury, I suspect that it also has
              much to do with the Techo leader being a woman.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Traditionally, a woman's role in our patriarchal clergy is to
              be subservient and supportive to monks. If women want a monastic life, they
              must accept a deferential status as nuns. If they attempt to achieve equality
              as female monks, they must be punished and, better still, eliminated.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Ms Acharavadee is certainly not the first female meditation
              teacher. The late Siri Krinchai revolutionised traditional meditation by making
              it systematic to accommodate mass retreat. Despite high public respect, she
              remained humble throughout her life.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But Ms Acharavadee is different. She claims sainthood for herself
              and openly belittles monkshood by telling people they don't need to go to
              temples because most monks are unworthy of respect.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The monks' rage has prompted the National Office of Buddhism
              to investigate whether the Techo Vipassana group "violates Buddhism and
              creates division in society".</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Yes, the same National Office of Buddhism that was recently
              embroiled in a corruption scandal involving its top executives colluding with
              senior monks to swindle state funds for temple restoration.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Do we really think this agency has the integrity to have a
              final say on what is "true" or "false" Buddhism? Should
              criticism against monks be prohibited? Should monks use state agencies to
              eliminate their competitors? Should the state intervene in people's beliefs at
              all?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Absolutely not.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Cults or not, we have no right to eliminate belief groups we
              disagree with unless they break the law.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Isn't tolerance what Buddhism teaches?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">I call Techo Vipassana a new religious group, not a cult,
              because it is a neutral term while cult has negative connotations which violate
              religious freedoms. It can also be easily abused to trigger hate leading to
              banishment for political purposes.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">When mainstream religious organisations can no longer meet
              the spiritual needs of a modern, fragmented society with diverse needs, the
              emergence of new belief groups is common, and should be accepted as such. Only
              when they violate the law shopuld intervention be necessary.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Admit it, Ms Acharavadee is not alone in believing the
              majority of monks do not follow the Buddha's path. It's why people are turning
              to groups who can give them the spiritual guidance they want.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">For new religious groups, the lessons learned from the Techo
              controversy are to stay safe by refraining from criticising the clergy, even of
              it is the truth.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">For the clergy, it should learn that the best way to survive
              in the competitive faith market is to return to the monks' original vocation as
              expected by the public. If not, being a crybaby by endlessly demanding state
              help will not stop new religious groups from stepping in to take the cake.</span></p>
