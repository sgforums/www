She had a specially interview coverage by CNN and received an award given by Her World magazine at the same year, for her lifetime work with the poor. For her ,there is no retirement.<br><br>This is a short summery from that clipping. The Amazing Mdm Teresa Hsu Chih always been my mentor.<br><br>The reporter found himself marvelling at her. She 's living proof of how young a 100-year-old can be.<br><br>" Be good.Live with love in your heart,"said Hsu Chih " Avoid harsh words and unhappy feelings." Simple words - do others dare live by her example?"<br><br>Doing good has made her absolutely fearless.This is her ultimate secret.<br><br>As she recieved her award , the reported thought."This woman has only $39 in her bank account.Yet she 's completely fearless.She's the most powerful person i 've ever met."<br><br>Later he asked ;" How do you start living a fearless life?"<br><br>Instead of giving an answer, she asked a question in turn."What are you afraid of?That is the first question you must ask yourself. Does fear help anybody?No,So why spend so much time on fear?"<br><br>"Fear is crippling. Fear takes all the joy out of living."<br><br>Mdm Hsu Chih begined each day at 4am. She credited her youth to a simple lifestyle. She has been a vegetarian all her life. She takes only one meal a day - mainly raw vegetables and fruits, which she blends and drinks as a juice. She believes cooking spoils the nutrition. Drinking this juice has been her daily habit since 1947. In this , she was decades ahead of medical opinion. Recent scientific research has discovered such a diet is rich antioxidants,which are life-strengthening substances that prevent diseases and slow down ageing.<br><br>Daily meditation is " as important as a healthy diet".A peaceful mind is the foundation of good health,she says;" i never time myself - i just meditate until i feel really drunk on peace"<br><br>Even when she was working and pressed for time, she always devoted one hour each morning to meditation. Night is different. " Then , the time was mine. Once , I started at 11:30pm and discovered it was 5 am when i finished. The deep quiet is very refreshing and better than sleep."<br><br>Every morning and evening , one will find her with her feet in the air, doing yoga.it has kept her body supply. She started when she was 69 and is now a yoga teacher.<br><br><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_p2Rj1krdETk/Src7jio5wiI/AAAAAAAAAmM/mxovaTrSSlc/s1600-h/teresa+hsu+chih3.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5383837361324540450" style="text-align: center; margin: 0px auto 10px; width: 320px; display: block; height: 240px; cursor: pointer;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_p2Rj1krdETk/Src7jio5wiI/AAAAAAAAAmM/mxovaTrSSlc/s320/teresa+hsu+chih3.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Lately , I received a forward mail featuring on this amazing woman at 110 years from my sister , and it seems everything about her still remained likes 10 years back.<br><br>She is 110 years old this year ( 2009 ). Small built and agile, she has grey hair , excellent hearing , and eyesight. She is one compassionate person who has helped others her entire life. For one century , she has been dedicating herself to others selflessly, unconditionally loving others, and especially caring for those who are poor , sick , old and suffering. As she puts it:" I did not come to this world alone. I have many companions and it is my responsibility to help them. I love them without any terms and conditions because we are a family. Even today , she still helps at the old folk home.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Learning yoga at the age of 69</span><br><br>Everyday she wold meditate , read , exercise , do charity , and do yoga. Her energy level and physical condition is comparable to the young people. This is especially true when she demonstrates the yoga movements with her soft and flexible limbs;seeing her moves her body makes one hold one's breath and grasp in admiration. She revealed the secret of her longevity as to work every day that she wakes up , to work without hesitation, and to be the voluntary worker of the society. At the same time she is careful not to speak ill words, not to be unhappy , and not to eat food cooked with strong fire; she refrain from meat , coffee , tea and alcoholic drinks. That is how she remains serene and joyful all the time, both physically and mentally.<br><br>She started learning yoga at the age of 69 and she talked about the wonderful experience of how her 'dreams came true ' in learning yoga.<br><br>one day , as she was reading ,something she loves to do very much , she read about the goodness of learning yoga.But what is yoga? she was not quite sure." How i wish someone would explain what yoga is to me and teach me yoga," she made a wish in her heart.<br><br>And the strangest thing happened. A few days after she made the wish to learn yoga , a man came to visit her old folks' home. He wore an orange long shirt and an orange hat.<br><br>" Are you a monk?" asked Hsu Chih<br>"Yes, i am." Said the man<br>" Do you teach yoga?"Hsu Chih asked<br>"Yes,My job is to teach yoga." Answer the man<br><br>As though the goddess has heard Hsu Chih's prayers and sent the yoga teacher to her. Since then , she started to learn and meditation from the teacher.<br><br>With yoga ,her body that was already healthy became even stronger and her energy level also became better. Of course , the good effort of dedicating herself to the poor and sick itself would harvest her the good karma of having a healthy body and a long life.<br></p>

              <p></p>
              <p>Teresa Hsu (<em>b. 1898, Swatow, China -</em> ), whose full name is Teresa Hsu Chih, is one of Singapore's most prominent and oldest social workers. The super-centenarian, who began devoting her life to helping the poor and destitute in the 1930s, has remained tireless in her humanitarian work even after turning 100. She is recognised not only for her unstinting contribution to society but also for her positive attitude towards life.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Early Life<br></span></strong>Hsu was born into dire straits. Besides having to deal with extreme poverty, which sometimes meant that she had only grass to eat, she lived with a physically abusive father. After he abandoned the family for another woman, Hsu, along with her grandmother, mother and three siblings, travelled to Penang, Malaysia by boat.<br><br>Having had to work to survive since young, Hsu had no formal education whatsoever, so she worked with her mother as a cleaner in a convent. In 1925, at the age of 27, she convinced the convent nuns to let her sit in on the children's classes - her first taste of literacy and reading, which was to later burgeon into a lifelong interest. Three and a half years later, she passed her Senior Cambridge examinations. With this qualification, she left for Hong Kong in 1933. There, she worked as a cleaner by day and learnt English, shorthand and typing by night. These skills landed her the job of stenographer.<br><br>In 1939, with the Japanese poised to enter Hong Kong, Hsu left for Chongqing, China, where she worked as a secretary and bookkeeper at a German news agency. Being close to the epicentre of the Second Sino-Japanese War provoked her into a new consciousness. She quit her high-paying job to volunteer with the Friends' Ambulance Unit, and this experience of helping injured soldiers made her decide to be a nurse.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Major Accomplishments<br></strong></span>Hsu went to London, England in 1945 and studied nursing at the London Nursing Council. Besides working in hospitals during her eight years in England, she also joined the International Voluntary Service for Peace, travelling across Europe to help the needy and to promote peace. In 1953, she left for Paraguay as a member of the German charity group Bruderhof. She stayed there for eight years, helping to start hospitals and homes for the aged. She returned to Penang in 1961 to be with her mother. While back home, she assumed the position of sister-in-charge at the Assunta Foundation in Petaling Jaya.<br><br>In 1963, Hsu came to Singapore and became the matron of Kwong Wai Shiu Hospital. In 1965, she founded the Home for the Aged Sick, one of the first homes for the elderly sick in Singapore. It was established on a 0.6-ha plot of land at Jalan Payoh Lai that was bought with money contributed by Hsu's elder sister Ursula. Hsu also used some of the money to buy public flats for the homeless. The sisters ran the home for five years, with Ursula in charge of the finances and Hsu in charge of managing the home while also supplementing the funds by selling home-grown fruits. However, they soon found it increasingly difficult to cope with the rising number of patients and approached the Rotary Club for assistance. Members of the club agreed to fund the home, but on condition that the sisters let them run the home as well.<br><br>Since retiring as matron of the home in 1983, Hsu has continued to care for the poor in her own capacity, such as by collecting old clothes for needy families. More notably, she has continued to reach out to the needy through the Heart-to-Heart Service, a non-profit, informal direct-help service that she had established. Through this service, she visits those under her charge - usually the single elderly and needy families - and provides them with cash allowances and food. Hsu explains that this service is called Heart-to-Heart because its work should inspire people to help by appealing directly to their hearts. In 2000, it was reported that Hsu had plans to start another home to care for the aged sick and mentally unsound.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Philosophy towards Charity and Life<br></strong></span>Social work is, doubtless, a natural extension of Hsu's life philosophy. She describes her drive to help others as instinctive, a reaction that wells up from her ability to empathise with the needy, having herself been destitute once. Moved by the generosity and kindness she has received from others, she is determined to extend her help to the poor people that she meets, calling them her brothers and sisters.<br><br>Hsu's philosophy towards life, especially one as long and fruitful as hers, is simple; positive thoughts and laughter, she has said, are her key sources of sustenance. Besides keeping her mind active through volunteer work and visiting various countries to give talks, she also keeps her body conditioned through yoga, something that she learnt only at the age of 69 and now teaches to the public. In addition to doing yoga twice a day, she meditates at 4 am daily, before taking a morning walk.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Awards<br></span></strong><strong>1988</strong> : Guinness Stout Effort Award.<br><strong>1994</strong> : Life Insurance Association Award, 1993.<br><strong>1997</strong> : Chinese Reader's Digest Hero for Today Award.<br><strong>2000</strong> : Her World 9th Woman of the Year Award.<br><strong>2002</strong> : Chou Ta-Kuan Foundation 5th Love of Lives Medal.<br><strong>2003</strong> : Honorary doctorate degree conferred by the University of Southern Queensland, Australia.<br><strong>2003</strong> : Active Senior Citizen of the Year.<br><strong>2004</strong> : Sporting Singapore Inspiration Award.<br><strong>2005</strong> : National Volunteerism and Philanthropy Special Recognition Award.<br><strong>2009</strong> : Public Service Star.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Family<br></strong></span>Hsu has never married, a conscious decision she attributes to the emotional shadows her father left behind.<br><br>Her mother, Tan Sok Chan, died at age 104 in 1981. Hsu eventually forgave her father; when he took ill in the early 1950s, she brought him from China to Singapore and cared for him till his death.<br><br>Hsu's elder sister Ursula and younger sister Lucy both became school principals. Ursula was the principal of the Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus in Bukit Timah. Hsu's younger brother Anthony became a Roman Catholic priest. All of Hsu's siblings have passed away.

              <p>I always wondered if Teresa Hsu is a Buddhist because I know she was a Catholic nun but she practised yoga (yoga is considered satanic). Now, I'm glad to know that she is a Buddhist.</p>
              <p>She is luckier than Mother Teresa because she knows, understands and accepts the law of nature (Karma). Mother Teresa doubted the existence of God till her last breath. If Mother Teresa had a chance to know about Buddhism and Karma, may be she would not have felt so lost.</p>

              <p>I always wondered if Teresa Hsu is a Buddhist because I know she was a Catholic nun but she practised yoga (yoga is considered satanic). Now, I'm glad to know that she is a Buddhist.</p>
              <p>She is luckier than Mother Teresa because she knows, understands and accepts the law of nature (Karma). Mother Teresa doubted the existence of God till her last breath. If Mother Teresa had a chance to know about Buddhism and Karma, may be she would not have felt so lost.</p>

              <p><br>It is wonderful to encounter the dharma indeed. Teresa Hsu mention in the youtube that in her own opinion - For her there is "really no religion". Love is her religion. All people are her brothers and sisters. .</p>

              <p>Mdm Hsu Chih begined each day at 4am. She credited her youth to a simple lifestyle. She has been a vegetarian all her life. She takes only one meal a day. Daily meditation is " as important as a healthy diet". A peaceful mind is the foundation of good health,she says;" i never time myself - i just meditate until i feel really drunk on peace"</p>

              <p>She seemed to be a living testament of Buddha Sakyamuni's renouncement from his throne to seek for the answer and showing the right path to all living beings on good health, longevity, wisdom life and the eternity of all sentient beings same as Buddha in 2500 years ago. Its real cool  :)</p>
