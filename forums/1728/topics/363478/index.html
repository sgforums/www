              <p><span id="intelliTXT"><strong>Practice of the 35 Buddhas<br> (part 1)</strong><br> <br> <strong>The two benefits of the practice</strong><br> <br> The <em>35 Buddhas</em> practice is a method to purify negative karmas, and to accumulate meritorious karma. The practice produces these two effects.<br> By purifying the bad karmas, your mind will be free from their
              influences. This means your mind will be clearer. When the negative
              karmas are diminishing, your wisdom will strengthen.<br> The other effect of the practice is that your mind will accumulate
              merit, a necessary condition for enlightenment. Merit supports you as
              you try to attain enlightenment. Merit affords you the opportunity to
              be enlightened. For instance, by your very good merits, you can be
              reborn in a Buddha field. A rebirth in a pure land is deemed optimal
              for enlightenment because the Buddhas are there. You can learn directly
              from them. They are there to guide you, and so you will be able to
              follow the teachings and become enlightened. Excellent causes and
              conditions such as these are dependent on your store of merits, so you
              have to know how to gather them. By doing the practice of the 35
              Buddhas, you will accumulate useful merits.<br> <strong>To understand through reason and logic</strong><br> <br> Whenever you hear about karma and the problems caused by it, your
              mind naturally thinks of it from your perspectives tied in with your
              traditions and history. Therefore I will give you some clear
              instructions to make out the differences between the truth of the
              teaching versus cultural and traditional attitudes.<br> First of all, when you listen to the Dharma teachings, you have to know
              that you are listening to a different subject, a different culture than
              those found in the European or Western countries. Secondly, when you
              listen, you have to judge whether it makes sense or not. Judge in a way
              where you consider the information through logic and reason. The
              teachings actually show you that logic. Learn that logic. It is not
              just Buddhist logic. It teaches you to think more clearly. It enhances
              your understanding, judgment, and wisdom. It enables you to understand
              that mind is mind.<br> <br> <br> <a href="http://www.bodhipath.org/249/">http://www.bodhipath.org/249/</a></span></p>

              <p>Foe Destroyers, fully enlightened Ones and transcendent Destroyers, who are 
                  existing, sustaining and living throughout the ten directions of sentient 
                  beings' worlds - all you Buddhas, please give me your attention. <br> In this life and throughout beginningless lives in all the realms of samsara, 
                  I have created negative karma, caused others to create it and rejoiced at 
                  it. <br> I have stolen offerings to holy objects, offerings to the sangha and offerings 
                  to the sangha of the ten directions. <br> I have caused others to steal these and rejoiced at such theft. <br> I have committed the five heinous crimes, caused others to do them and rejoiced 
                  at their doing. <br> I have committed the ten non-virtuous actions, involved others in them and 
                  rejoiced in their involvement. <br> Being obscured by all this karma, I've created the cause for myself and other 
                  sentient beings to be reborn in the hells, as animals, as pretas, in irreligious 
                  places, amongst barbarians, as long-living gods, with imperfect senses, holding 
                  wrong views and being displeased with the presence of a Buddha. <br> Now before these Buddhas, transcendent destroyers who have become transcen- 
                  dental wisdom, who have become the compassionate eye, who have become witness, 
                  who have become valid and see with their omniscient minds, I am confessing 
                  and accepting all these actions as negative. <br> I will not conceal or hide them and from now on I will refrain from committing 
                  these negative actions. <br> Buddhas and transcendent destroyers, please give me your attention. <br> In this life and throughout beginningless lives in all the realms of samsara, 
                  whatever root of virtue I've created through even the smallest act of charity 
                  such as giving one mouthful of food to an animal, whatever root of virtue 
                  I've created by keeping pure morality, whatever root of virtue I've created 
                  by abiding in pure conduct, whatever root of virtue I've created by fully 
                  ripening sentient beings' minds, whatever root of virtue I've created by generating 
                  bodhicitta and whatever root of virtue I've created of the highest transcendental 
                  wisdom, bringing together all these merits of both myself and others, I now 
                  dedicate them to the highest of which there is no higher, to that even above 
                  the highest, to the highest of the high, to that which is higher than the 
                  foe destroyer. <br> Thus I dedicate them completely to the highest, fully accomplished enlightenment. 
                  <br> Just as the Buddhas and transcendent destroyers of the past have dedicated, 
                  just as the Buddhas and transcendent destroyers of the future will dedicate 
                  and just as the Buddhas and transcendent destroyers of the present are dedicating, 
                  in the same way I make this dedication. <br> I confess all my negative karmas separately and rejoice in all merits. <br> I implore all the Buddhas to grant my request that I may realize the ultimate, 
                  sublime, highest transcendental wisdom. <br> To the sublime kings of human beings living now, to those of the past and 
                  to those who have yet to appear, to all those whose knowledge is as vast as 
                  an infinite ocean, with palms joined, I go for refuge.</p>

                  do, or rejoiced in when others have done them and so forth; in short, my entire 
                  accumulation of faults and offenses that hinder higher rebirth and liberation
