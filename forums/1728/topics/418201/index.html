              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">By: Loppon Namdrol (Malcolm Smith) @ <a href="http://www.atikosha.org">http://www.atikosha.org</a><br></h3>
              <h3 class="post-title entry-title"><a href="http://www.atikosha.org/2010/10/rig-pa.html">Rig pa</a></h3>
              <div class="post-header"></div>
              <p>The most important word in the intimate instruction section (man ngag 
              sde) of the teaching of the great perfection is "rig pa". It is a word 
              that has no effective equivalence in English, and within the last few 
              years many translators have ceased to try and translate it at all when 
              it is used as a noun in great perfection teachings and not as a verb 
              (where it means "to know").<br> <br> Today while translating a section from the <em>Self-originated Self-arisen Original Purity</em> revelations
               of Rigzin Godem (1337-1409), I came across a definition given by 
              Padmasambhava that I feel is instructive for those with some doubts as 
              to what "rig pa" is. He states:</p>
              <blockquote>“Rig pa” does not follow delusion after deluded appearances are consciously known (shes par rig) to be false</blockquote>
              <p>The
               operative term here is "consciously known" or "shes par rig". Rig pa is
               in fact a specific type of knowledge. Nevertheless, the word 
              "knowledge", like the word "awareness", is a word too fraught with other
               connotations to be used to accurately translate the term "rig pa" in 
              this context.<br> <br> These days there is a real danger of people conflating Dzogchen 
              teachings with the teachings of other so-called "non-dual" traditions 
              such as Advaita, Kashmir Shaivism and so on. It is important to 
              understand that "rig pa" is not some sort of over-arching 
              uber-consciousness like the cit of sat cit ananda in Vedantic teachings.<br> <br> Instead, rigpa is just the accurate knowledge of our own state, that deepens as we become more accustomed to the Dzogchen view.</p>
              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">Rigpa II</h3>
              <div class="post-header"></div>
              <div class="post-body entry-content">One can have many misunderstandings about rigpa. For example, on the 
              internet the other day, I saw a definition of rigpa that is very strange
               indeed:<br> <br> <blockquote>I'm defining rigpa as consciousness without dualistic thought.</blockquote><br> This sort of idea is very prevalent among those with no training in 
              Dzogchen, in the "tradition" of those who conflate the so-called 
              non-dualist traditions together, based on mere reading of texts in 
              translation.<br> <br> Now, depending on whether this consciousness without dualistic thought 
              is defined as fundamental and over-arching, or unique and personal, we 
              have the distinction between Hindu Vedanta and the mind-only position of
               Indian Buddhist Cittamatrins. It could even be the svasamvedana of the 
              Buddhist logicians, the non-conceptual self-knowing mind.<br> <br> Such definitions of vidyÄ� above bear no resemblance to the definitions 
              of vidyÄ� stated by Indian masters such as Vimalamitra. He defines vidyÄ� 
              very simply:<br> <br> <blockquote>...acute because of moving, subtle, and apparent, vidyÄ� is knowing, clear and unchanging</blockquote>
              <div>Further, in another text Vimalamitra writes:</div>
              <blockquote>The
               nature of the mind is not free from traces, so it is called “mind”. 
              That knowledge of the dharmakÄ�ya as empty is called “vidyÄ�". That also 
              gives rise to recognition of great clear emptiness. Remaining in that 
              stage is called “wisdom”. Remaining without concepts, free from the 
              errors of lethargy, agitation and so on, is called “dharmakÄ�ya”.</blockquote>
              <div>Reflect on these five sentences. By reflecting on them, one will have a clearer idea of what one's vidyÄ� is. </div>

              <p>In <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.atikosha.org/2010/11/rigpa-ii.html">http://www.atikosha.org/2010/11/rigpa-ii.html</a></p>
              <p>I asked Loppon Namdrol:</p>
              <p>"Hi Namdrol,</p>
              <p>As you mentioned about Hindu Vedanta... a question came to mind.</p>
              <p>I was just reading someone's post half an hour ago in another forum ( <a rel="nofollow" href="http://collectionofthoughts.com/bbpress/topic/1499/page/7?replies=200">http://collectionofthoughts.com/bbpress/topic/1499/page/7?replies=200</a> ). He/she ('star') states that according to Dzogchen view, everything is Consciousness, and therefore everything is real.</p>
              <p>What is your comment on this?</p>
              <p>Also, he/she states 'The Supreme Source' as a reference... in 
              which I also personally have some questions regarding this book: in 
              certain parts of the book, Consciousness is described as an all-creating
               agent, which sounds like God to me. How does Dependent Origination 
              apply here?"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To which he replied that the view 'Consciousness is all and all is real' is a non-Buddhist view of Kashmir Shaivism:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"This person has confused the Trika non-dual view with Dzogchen.</p>
              <p>The mind that is the all-creating king, as Norbu Rinpoche makes 
              clear, is the mind that does not recognize itself, and so enters into 
              samsara, creating its own experience of samsara.</p>
              <p>All conditioned phenomena are a product of ignorance, according to 
              Dzogchen view, and so therefore, everything is not real. The basis of 
              that ignorance is the basis, which is also not established as real.</p>
              <p>In Dzogchen, everything is unreal, from top to bottom. The basis, in 
              Dzogchen, is described as being "empty not established in any way at 
              all". If the basis is not real, then whatever arises from that basis is 
              not real.</p>
              <p>In Dzoghen, dependent origination begins from the non-recognition of 
              the state of the basis, when this happens, one enters into grasping self
               and other, and then the chain of dependent origination begins. "</p>

              <p>Someone asked my Master what is the Mind Source. Is it Buddha-Nature? (This is the common understanding in Zen)</p>
              <p>My Master's answer which shocked them is this: The Mind Source, the Mind that is the Source of all phenomena, is ignorance.</p>
              <p>This is the meaning of "when mind arises, all dharmas arise, when mind ceases, all dharmas cease".</p>
