              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.231;">Several months ago I gave brief mention of a
              situation in Burma (Myanmar) where a bar manager from New Zealand and two
              Burmese nationals were facing four years in prison for “insulting Buddhism”
              with a promotional ad they posted on the bar’s Facebook page showing the Buddha
              wearing headphones. (See the offending image </span><a style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.231;" href="http://theendlessfurther.com/the-world-as-satire/buddhaheadphones2">here</a><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.231;">.)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">Last week, a Burmese court sentenced bar
              manager Phil Blackwood, the bar’s Burmese owner Tun Thurein, and another
              manager Htut Ko Ko Lwina to 2½ years in prison with hard labor. When you
              consider all the stuff that gets posted on Facebook, an image of the Buddha
              wearing headphones seems pretty tame, and the sentence extreme. Indeed, putting
              those guys on trial in the first place strikes me as a travesty.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">The case is part of a larger controversy over
              religious images that came to a dreadful head when Charlie Hebdo, a satirical
              newspaper in France, was attacked by terrorists because of caricatures of the
              Prophet Muhammad it published. I will not rehash the issues surrounding the
              controversy in this post, except to remind readers that teachings based upon
              the Quran forbid the creation of visual images of Muhammad and even moderate Muslims
              find depictions of the Prophet offensive.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">That is relevant because at one time, there
              was a ban on images of Buddha. The Buddha supposedly asked his followers not to
              collect or venerate his relics and not depict his image. His followers almost
              completely ignored his instructions regarding his relics, but for nearly 600
              years, the only images used to represent the Buddha were a footprint, an empty
              seat, the Wheel of Dharma, or a Bodhi leaf.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">In the first century, the first images of the
              Buddha started to appear, and they typically showed Gautama standing or seated
              in a lotus position, and holding a begging bowl or making the gesture (</span><em style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">mudra</em><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">) of
              fearlessness. One of the areas where these representations began to emerge was
              Gandhara, and sculpture from that period displays a definite Greek influence.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">Since then folks have been going crazy making
              Buddha images, and today it is a very big business.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">If Buddha were around now, I think he would
              be inclined to take stuff like a Buddha with headphones in stride, perhaps even
              find it amusing.  I feel sure he would be outraged at the idea of
              imprisoning anyone for making such an image.  I also think he would have
              concerns about the commercialization of his image, and he would certainly be
              uncomfortable with the idea of worshiping his image. Of course, this is just
              conjecture on my part. What the historical Gautama thought, felt, actually
              taught, and what his life truly was, we shall never know,  because his
              time is so remote and his life story buried in myth, and as far as how he would
              think and act as a modern person, that is impossible to know.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">Nonetheless, I doubt he ever held himself out
              as anything other than a common, mortal human being.  We say he was an
              extraordinary human being; he would simply say that he was “awake.” And while
              many Buddhist will deny that Buddha is worshiped, all objective observers know
              that worship of Buddha is a reality in some forms of Buddhism, especially among
              rank and file devotees.  Rather early on, the myth-making process that has
              shrouded his true story, elevated the Buddha from a mortal man to a being who
              was supermundane, “perfect,” and the line between human and god became
              extremely thin.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">The </span><em style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">Kathavathu</em><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">, one of the seven books of the Pali Canon’s </span><em style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">Abdidhamma</em><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">,
              compiled during the reign of King Ashoka, and evidently produced in order to
              correct “various errors which had developed with regard to the Buddha,”
              discusses various views of the Buddhist schools existing at the time that
              promoted supernatural notions about the Buddha. Prof. Trevor Ling, in his book </span><em style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">The Buddha</em><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">,
              writes,</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">Among the points dealt with in the Kathavathu
              was the idea that the Buddha had not really lived in the world of men, but in
              the ‘heaven of bliss’, appearing to men on earth in a specially created,
              temporary form to preach the Dhamma. Together with this virtual deification of
              the Buddha there went also a tendency to deny him normal human characteristics,
              and on the other hand to attribute to him unlimited magical power.”*</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">This elevation and immortalization of Buddha was
              carried over into the Mahayana canon, but today, I think many people tend to
              have an earthly, prosaic view that is much more realistic and proper.
              Ultimately, as Thich Nhat Hanh says,</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">Concepts like ‘nirvana,’ ‘Buddha,’ ‘Pure
              Land,’ ‘Kingdom of God,’ and ‘Jesus,’ are just concepts; we have to be very
              careful. We should not start a war and destroy people for our concepts.” **</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">Now, if the government of Burma is so
              concerned about people insulting Buddhism then they would do something about
              those Buddhist extremists in their country who go around preaching hate and
              inciting violence against the Muslim minority there. Wouldn’t they?</span></p>

              <p>It is easy to forget, being Buddhist, is also a emotional label we attach to ourselves!</p>
              <p>We incorporate religion, nationality, creed, tribe, caste or class as part of our self in which we are wont to defend if we feel violated! Whether both real or imagined!</p>
              <p>When we are deprived of our wisdom and common sense, what we perceive as alien or unconventional, we easily form our prejudices and feel threatened! All those talk of loving kindness and compassion can be quickly tossed behind the back burner.</p>
              <p>So labelling ourselves as Buddhist is really no different as calling ourselves a Christian , Muslim or Hindu etc.</p>
              <p>We even fight over sports(soccer hooligans, remember?)</p>
              <p>Usually, a ethic group, if after a couple of generations, perhaps,  if there is still an inability to assimilate, suspicion and alienation will ensue. Especially, if there a distinct sense identity in both parties, either ethnic and national.</p>
              <p>Unless we are able to find someone who has a deep understanding of the Burmese psyche, and familiar with existing underlying tension, we can but only speculate.</p>
              <p> But it is relatively easy to further stoke further the sublimal tension out in the open for some unseen political motives!</p>
              <p>Hopefully, calm and tolerance will prevail!</p>
              <p>Just my 2cents worth!</p>
