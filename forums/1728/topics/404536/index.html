              <p>In my opinion, don't confess to your uncle's wife, it will cause embarrassment and how are you going to face them ? Confess and repent to Buddha if you are a Buddhist. It is also more effective to confess and repent to Buddha than to your uncle's wife. Buddhism is very practical, don't do foolish thing by confessing to your uncle's wife, it does not help you or your uncle's wife in anyway.</p>

              <p>I second dawnfirstlight's advice. Repent to the Buddha is enough. In Buddhism, we are told to repent to Buddha, not necessarily have to repent to the person (it depends on situation).</p>
              <p>Also, sometimes you just have to forgive yourself. We all make mistakes in life especially when young and ignorant, and continue to make mistakes even when we grow old. Let go of guilt.</p>
              <p>As Thusness mentioned before (not exact words though) that we should be able to let go of any right or wrongdoings - do not let right and wrong doings leave a trace in our consciousness.</p>
              <p>What's past is past, stay Present..</p>
              <p>See geis' thread, very important: <a class="entry-title" rel="bookmark" href="/forums/1728/topics/404502">Realizing Guiltlessness</a></p>

              <p>If you know of any repentance practices like 88 Buddhas or 35 Buddhas or Vajrasattva practice.  Do it.</p>
              <p>You can also do some chanting to purify your negative karma.  If you have no contact with Buddhism prior to this then you can try reciting Amituofo or Om Mani Padme Hung.  They will purify your karma over time. Not only this karma. </p>
              <p>Whatever has been done, you can just talk to the Buddha mentally, saying that you regret what has been done, you are not going to do it again.</p>
              <p>In Tibetan Buddhism, there are 4 factors that purify karma entirely:</p>
              <p>1. Regret and not hiding whatever you have done in front of the Buddhas</p>
              <p>2. Relying on the Buddhas as a support for confession</p>
              <p>3. Performing some practice as an antidote, certain practices are prescribed for this, eg. Vajrasattva or Om Mani Padme Hung or Buddha name</p>
              <p>4. Resolve never to do it again.</p>
              <p>If the 4 factors are complete, one's karma is completely purified.</p>
              <p>If one is doing these practices diligently, one may experience certain signs of purification.  It is not a vague thing. The signs will come repeatedly.  Then that is a sign that your karma has been purified to a certain extent.  And this is referring to your karma from beginningless time till now.</p>

              <p>hi guilty,</p>
              <p>i won't like to make you feel guiltier really hahaha, but it's quite good to feel bad about being so motivated by lust.</p>
              <p>Try to change, feeling bad is a factor of regret and helps one to purify too.  Purify is not just some invisible thing happening.. for instance, if your mind becomes more relaxed and less pushed by lust then that is purification in itself. It is something you can sense and feel yourself.</p>
              <p>I feel that your habitual tendency is quite strong. You should try to do something about it. Like chanting OM MANI PADME HUNG then pray to Buddha say, help me change.</p>
              <p>I think you should worry more about your future acts than what you have already done. If you don't turn around, the habit may grow stronger and stronger. So try to turn the habit, don't let the habit turn you... Keep trying to... don't give up!</p>

Meaning "action" in Sanskrit, karma in Buddhism means that none of our actions are insignificant; the things we do determine what things will happen to us. With karma, action equals reaction; if we act in a positive manner, good things will happen to us. Conversely, negative actions result in negative reactions. Believers in reincarnation believe we carry our positive and negative karma with us from one life to the next. Thubten Chodren, a Buddhist nun and teacher who studied under the Dalai Lama, says you can purify your bad karma by practicing The Four Opponent Powers: Power of Regret, Power of Reliance/Repairing the Relationship, Power of Determination not to Repeat the Action, and Power of Remedial Action.</p>

Buddhism teaches that "regret" is different than "guilt." When you feel guilty about the action, it is self-serving because it centers on you and how you feel. Regret, on the other hand, "has an element of wisdom; it notices our mistakes and regrets them," Chodren says. If you've acted in a harmful way, you should think about what you've done and how your actions have negatively affected others. You should also think about how those actions may hurt you and others in the future.</p>

If your actions have caused harm upon another person or persons, it is important to apologize to them for what you've done. Sometimes this isn't possible because the person is dead, we've lost touch with him or we don't know who our actions have damaged. This is okay since what is more important, says Chodren, is to repair the damage within your own mind. "Here, we generate love and compassion, and the altruistic intention for those whom previously we held bad feelings about," she says. By changing those negative emotions within us that caused us to act negatively in the first place, we can change ourselves from within.</p>

You should set it in your mind that you will not commit the negative act again; the longer you are able to keep that promise to yourself, the more confidence you will gain that you can break bad habits and act in more positive ways. It is not always easy to do this, so if you do find yourself repeating a negative action, such as losing your temper or gossiping, Chodren says you should tell yourself you will not repeat the action for the next 2 days. Once you've achieved that goal, you can say to yourself "I will continue to try and not do that again."</p>

Practicing Buddhists have many methods of remedial action including reciting mantras, making offerings to a monastery or temple, and meditating. Chodren says you can also do things like perform community service such as volunteering at a hospital, feeding the homeless or teaching people to read. Any action that benefits others can be considered a remedial action.</p>

              <p>If you deeply feel you have done somebody wrong, or owe somebody something, repay him/her back! </p>
              <p>How? Start by being kind and considerate to that person!</p>
              <p>And also, now that your're an adult, how would you deal with a teenager full of hormones who have learnt to a an adult!</p>
              <p>Confess to the person if only the person is an open minded and understanding, otherwise, it will cause embarrassment to the person! Although you may be willing to accept the consequences, the victim do not deserve it!</p>
              <p>If desires or lust is present in  us, understand it is a primal urge,the important thing is how we manage it and not overwhelm us, or distract us and turn into an obsession. </p>

Once you have repented, just let it go. If you can't let it go and it keeps popping up in your mind, use the recitation of the name of Guan Shi Yin Pu Sa. Here's a section on chapter 25 of the Lotus sutra... If you can be constantly mindful of Guan Shi Yin Pu Sa, you will be able to rid of greed (lust included), hatred, and delusion.<br><br><strong>If living beings who have much sexual desire constantly and reverently recite the name of Gwan Shr Yin Bodhisattva, they will be separated from desire.<br>If those who have much hatred constantly and reverently recite the name of Gwan Shr Yin Bodhisattva, they will be separated from hatred.<br>If those who are very stupid constantly and reverently recite the name of Gwan Shr Yin Bodhisattva, they will be separated from stupidity.<br><br></strong>Explanation of the above 3 lines here...<br><br>"<strong>If living beings who have much sexual desire constantly and reverently recite the name of Gwan Shr Yin Bodhisattva, they will be separated from desire."</strong><br><strong><br>Commentary: <br>If living beings who have much sexual desire. </strong>Some people study the Buddhadharma on one hand, and entertain lustful desire on the other. The more they study the Dharma, the stronger their desire is. They think about sex all day long, until their desire thoughts are like flowing water. This is the worst of thoughts and the worst kind of behavior, a very bad sign. What should they do? They don't have to get nervous or worry. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">They should just <strong>constantly and reverently recite the name of Gwan Shr Yin Bodhisattva. </strong>It's not good enough just to recite it; you must also be reverent. You should bow more to Gwan Shr Yin Bodhisattva.</span></p>
              <p>Bowing to the Buddhas is just paying great reverence to the Buddhas. Most people don't understand what bowing to the Buddhas means. Adherents to externalist religions say it's just bowing to wooden idols. Blind people speak blind-talk. They don't have eyes; they can't see the Buddhas' light, and so they say it's idol worship. But bowing to the Buddhas represents the reverence in our heart.</p>
              <p>To respect the Triple Jewel, we must certainly bow to the Buddhas. Take care not to be arrogant and think, "I am great. I am greater than the Buddhas. Why should I bow to them?" That's a mistake. If people always bow and recite Gwan Yin Bodhisattva's name, <strong>they will be separated from desire.</strong> It's gone!</p>
              <p>You say, "But I like sexual desire. What am I going to do without it?"</p>
              <p>If you like it, you don't have to recite Gwan Yin Bodhisattva's name. That's all. It's simple enough. If you don't want your sexual desire, you can get rid of it. If you want to keep it, you don't have to get rid of it. Either way, it's up to you.<br><br>"<strong>If those who have much hatred constantly and reverently recite the name of Gwan Shr Yin Bodhisattva, they will be separated from hatred."<br><br>Commentary:</strong></p>
              <p><strong>If there are those who have much hatred</strong>, they should recite Gwan Yin Bodhisattva's name. Hatred manifests as overt anger. Anger is a kind of affliction. Affliction is just ignorance. Hatred is like fire.</p>
              <p>It is said, <em>"One spark of fire can burn up a forest of merit and virtue."</em> Therefore, there is an ancient saying that,</p>
              <p><em>The firewood gathered in a thousand days,</em></p>
              <p><em>Goes up in the fire of a single spark's blaze.</em></p>
              <p>You can gather firewood for a thousand days, a long time; but one little match can burn it all up. This describes how ordinarily we may try to do good and virtuous deeds. We may do this over a long period of time, but then we get mad and the fire of ignorance rises. All that merit and virtue is burned right off. If you have a big temper, you will produce ignorance whenever you open your mouth.</p>
              <p>What kind of people like to get mad? <em>Asuras</em>! Everyone has come down a particular path. Some have come down the Buddha path. Some have come down the path of gods. Others have come down the path of humans, <em>asuras</em>, animals, ghosts, or hell-beings.</p>
              <p>Those who have come down the Buddha path are, for the most part, compassionate. Those who have come down the ghost path are, for the most part, cheap and lowly. They never take a loss. They are really sneaky and slimy-not reliable. Unreliable people are said to be ghostly. Those from the path of humans have affinities with everyone. Those from the animal path are insatiably greedy for everything. The more the better! <em>Asuras</em> like to get angry. Those from the immortal path like things clear and light.</p>
              <p>So now we are talking about <em>asuras</em>. Have you noticed how there are some people who are just miserable all the time? They are always on the verge of "blowing their tops." They are just <em>asuras</em>. They have <em>asura</em>-natures. Can they change? Yes. How? The <em>Dharma Flower Sutra</em> tells us in detail. All you have to do is <strong>constantly and reverently recite the name of Gwan Shr Yin Bodhisattva</strong>. This means to recite all the time, without ever stopping. Recite constantly and be reverent by going to temples and bowing to Gwan Shr Yin Bodhisattva. You can't just bow today and not tomorrow, or bow in the morning and not bow at night. If you have no work to do, then spend your time bowing and reciting. Gradually, <strong>they will be separated from hatred</strong>. Your temper will vanish.</p>
              <p>You won't know quite how it happened, but strangely enough your temper will have disappeared. It's just that mysterious. You don't know about this, but I have had personal experience, and I know. I used to have a terrible temper. I used to hit and scold people. When I was very young, twelve or so, I liked to fight with people. No matter how big a person was, he had to listen to my orders or I would clobber him until he submitted. That's just an <em>asura</em>-nature. Later, when I studied the Buddhadharma, I realized that anger was wrong, and I changed. I always recited the name of Gwan Shr Yin Bodhisattva. So now, sometimes even when my own disciples bully me, I still don't get angry. My disciples may get mad at me, but I practice patience and endure it. I know that eventually they will understand that they are wrong. Before I used to get mad at people, and now, my disciples get mad at me!</p>
              <p>"Which ones?" You ask.</p>
              <p>"You know who you are," I say.</p>
              <p>Before, I got mad at others; now others get mad at me. This is just retribution. I have received these bad disciples who bully their good teacher. But the good teacher doesn't get angry anymore. I don't know where my temper went, but I am not going to look for it. If I find it again, it will be even worse!<br><br>"<strong>If those who are very stupid constantly and reverently recite the name of Gwan Shr Yin Bodhisattva, they will be separated from stupidity."<br><br>Commentary:<br>If those who are very stupid</strong>. We have already discussed greed and hatred. Now we will discuss stupidity. These are the three poisons. They poison our Buddha-natures and put them to sleep. Why haven't we awakened yet? Why is it that we live as if drunk and die in a dream? It's all because of the three poisons.</p>
              <p>The primary form of greed is sexual desire. Sexual desire is extremely harmful to people's natures. But most people think it's very enjoyable, and so they engage in all kinds of impure conduct. Day by day, the original Buddha-nature becomes covered with filth so that its light does not manifest. This is all because of greed for sex.</p>
              <p>Sexual desire and hatred are the same thing. Now we are talking about stupidity. What's that? Stupidity just means that you feel that you are not stupid. That's stupid! A person may think he is intelligent and wise, but then you ask him, "Where did you come from? Where are you going to in the future?" and he can't answer. He doesn't know where he came from or where he is going, and he says he is intelligent. He won't admit that he is stupid.</p>
              <p>In this world, everyone looks after the petty business of fame and profit. People toil for fame and profit all day long. They hurt each other, kill each other, and commit mayhem-all just for profit. If you put all the people in the world together, how many would there be? Two. One who seeks fame, and one who seeks profit.</p>
              <p>Fame and profit turn people entirely upside down. They don't wake up. From birth to death, they fight and struggle. Some seek to get elected to office. Others seek to get rich. Some run after the opposite sex or some other kind of happiness. But when this happiness goes, at the time of death they have no idea where they are going. And yet they still think they are incredible geniuses with great wisdom! "I am the smartest. I have the most wisdom. I was first in my class every year. I am ahead of everyone in everything!" Actually, how is it? As long as you haven't recognized your own original face, no matter how smart you are, it's a false intelligence. People with genuine wisdom will not think that they are wise.</p>
              <p>"Then will they think they are stupid?" you ask.</p>
              <p>No, they won't think they are stupid or wise. They will feel they are pretty much the same as everyone else. But in their thinking and attitudes, they will be clear. They are clear about the fact that everything is like an illusion; like a bubble, a shadow, a dew drop, or a flash of lightning. Knowing that everything is like a dream, they will not be greedy for glory, power, or wealth. Knowing that everything is an illusion, they will not be greedy for sex, power, or profit. It's all impermanent. All of it. And so the <em>Vajra Sutra</em> says, "All conditioned dharmas are like a dream, a bubble, or a shadow."</p>
              <p>What are conditioned dharmas? They are all those things with marks, all the things we perceive. All are like illusions, dreams, or bubbles. Would you say a bubble on the ocean is real? If you say it's real, it will soon pop and disappear. If you say it's false, there it is! Although it's there, it has no real substance. A shadow is also false. It's like dew in the morning. It's there, but as soon as the sun shines on it, it's gone. A lightning flash appears for but a moment.</p>
              <p>If you can look upon everything as being like a dream, an illusion, a bubble, a shadow, dew, or a lightning flash, then what attachments could there be? None. Without attachments, you'll have genuine understanding. You won't let your thinking wander as it will to the north, east, south, or west. You will put down polluted thinking and involvement with the dust of the world. Having put it all down, you couldn't not become a Buddha if you tried! You would have wisdom whether you wanted it or not. You would naturally be wise.</p>
              <p>When you don't have wisdom, you might think, "I'm pretty wise." But once you have true wisdom, you will think, "Oh, originally, this was mine all the time. It did not come from the outside." At that time you won't be arrogant. You won't think, "See me? I'm the smartest one here. I'm the prettiest one here. I'm the most talented, incredible, unusual person here." If you think like that, you are attached to appearances.</p>
              <p>"Appearances" just means your stinking skin-bag-the dream, illusion, bubble, shadow, dew drop, and lightning flash. All day long you put on your nice clothes, eat your fancy food, live in your fine house, and enjoy your amusements. You may think these are great, but when the time comes to die, they aren't going to help you out in the least.</p>
              <p>Besides, in order to satisfy their stinking skin-bags, people are busy all day long smoking, drinking, stuffing themselves with food, and trying to fill that bottomless pit. You can't fill a bottomless pit: it all keeps leaking right out! The more it leaks, the more you fill it; the more you fill it, the more it leaks. It certainly keeps you busy.</p>
              <p>Why do I eat one meal a day? Because three meals a day are just too much trouble! Most people think that eating fine food is a real pleasure; I think it's a lot of trouble. If you over-eat, your stomach hurts. If you don't eat enough, your greed isn't satisfied. You think, "That was good. I'd like to have a little bit more!" If you don't eat such good food, you won't be so greedy; and it's a lot easier for your stomach.</p>
              <p>It's just a lot of trouble and it all comes about because of stupidity. Being stupid, one seeks after pleasure, wealth, enjoyment, and fun with the opposite sex; it's all upside down. You can be as greedy as you want, and then what? When the time comes, you are still going to die. When the time comes to die, you won't have control over the situation at all. Isn't that stupid?</p>
              <p>Now, being so stupid, what do we do? Rely upon the method given in the <em>Dharma Flower Sutra</em>. If people <strong>constantly and reverently recite the name of Gwan Shr Yin Bodhisattva, they will be separated from stupidity</strong>. Recite the name of Gwan Shr Yin Bodhisattva, and your stupidity will disappear as your wisdom comes forth.</p>
              <p>If you know that you are stupid, you have recognized yourself. You have to have some wisdom to be able to realize that you are stupid. People without wisdom won't have any idea that they are stupid. The farther they run, the farther off they get. If it's not bad enough being stupid, they have to double it by thinking they're intelligent!</p>
              <p>How do we get rid of our stupidity? We must constantly and reverently recite the name of Gwan Shr Yin Bodhisattva. This is the most wonderful and efficacious method. It's a money-back guarantee, wonderful beyond words.</p>
              <p>Speaking of stupidity and wisdom, what is stupidity? What is wisdom? I'll tell you something you won't believe. Stupidity is wisdom; wisdom is stupidity! Why do I say this?</p>
              <p>Take a look at the <em>Heart Sutra</em>: "Form does not differ from emptiness; emptiness does not differ from form. Form itself is emptiness; emptiness itself is form."</p>
              <p>True form comes from true emptiness. True emptiness comes from true form. They are two and yet not two. If you know how to use it, it's wisdom; if you can't use it, it's stupidity. Stupidity and wisdom are not two. It just depends on whether or not you can use it. If you can use it, stupidity turns to wisdom; if you can't use it, wisdom turns to stupidity. They are two and yet not two. If you obtain genuine wisdom, then you will know, "Oh, originally it was like this," and you won't be upside down.</p>

              Hi guilty
              
              Thank you for your honest confession.
               
              By the fact that you are feeling bad and is fearful of its effect it shows that you are remorse of your action. I think a lot of positive suggestion has been given. Is good that you are starting to take control of your life.
              
              Whatever potential effects you need to bear in the future is still a question mark, by worrying does it lessen the effects. Remember for a effect to take place, it needs the right conditions. Not all rice seeds that a farmer sow in the field will grown to become harvest crop. However, I do want to remind as a online pal that some of your MRT touching acts do have the potential to land you jail if repeated. As sometime one can get carry away the act, when one is it. Therefore, I hope that you can overcome this area of your life before it become a crime (effect) in this lifetime.   
              
              Next, on a humanity level, you mentioned that you enjoy being close and bodily touch the woman in a crowded MRT. I am not sure if it imply that there is some unspoken emotional needs in your life. As the touching act bring gratification to you. Perhaps you are facing inferior complex issue and having some difficulty in developing positive relationship with the opposite sex. I hope that you can learn to love yourself in a positive way if maybe do seek help from counsellor.   
              
              By the way, I can see that you do admire Arhant for their abilities to overcome the earthly desire. According to law of physic there are no different between Arhant,historical Shakyamuni Buddha and our earthly body make up. We are make up of the same Big Bang atom. The only difference between us is the wisdom. They know how to use the wisdom to control the mind in return to overcome the body desire that arises out of greed, ignorance and hatred (3 poisons). Hence fear not, we are all in the same boat. We are all learning to overcome the 3 posions in our life that arises as various afflictions and problem in our life.
              
              Finally, pick up a practice that suit your preference so that whenever you recollect your practice your will desire to uphold the moral precept. When the right concentration has been developed, wisdom will arise to overcome your affliction. (see http://www.kktanhp.com/power_of_now_by_eckhart_tolle.htm for further reading)
              
              I shall end with this famous Christian prayer.
              
              Lord grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change. The things I can and the wisdom to know the difference. 
              
              Namu Myoho Renge Kyo!

              <p>Hi Guilty,</p>
              <p>By feeling a Sense of Remorse and Willing to Change your ways is already a form of Positive Karma. </p>
              <p>In order for a seed to grow and mature into a tree, the plant will needs time, Sunlight, water, soil etc. for it to grow into a tree. If we at this moment repent and strive not to make the same mistake again, we are actually trying to stop the bad karma to grow and even preventing it from growing into fruit.</p>
              <p>My advice is to practise taking refuge in the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha when you feel fearful. Practise chanting Guan Shi Yin Pusa because it can helps to calm your mind and also when you chant Namo Guan Shi Yin.. your every thought moment is on a compassion and not on something unwholesome. Hope my advice helps you somehow.</p>
              <p>Cheers</p>
              <p> </p>
