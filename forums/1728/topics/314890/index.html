            <div class='col-md body'><p>                                 WHERE DOES CESSATION TAKE PLACE?<br>A monk wanted to know where the four primary elements of earth, fire, water and air cease<br>totally without leaving any residue. He possessed iddhivida abhiññæ, higher knowledge of psychical<br>powers. So he went up to the six Planes of devas and sought of an answer. All the devas in<br>Catumahæræjæ, Tævatimasæ, Yæmæ, Tusitæ, Nimmænærati and Paranimmitavassavatø informed him to<br>approach the Great Brahma to get the solution to his riddle of the elements.<br>So he went to the Great Brahma and asked the latter about the place where the extermination<br>of the four elements takes place.<br>“O monk!” said the Great Brahma, “I am the greatest. I surpass all. None surpasses me. I see<br>all. Everything comes into being as I will it. I am the Lord of the Universe. I create the Earth and its<br>inhabitants. I am the creator. I am the father of all who come into being now and also of all who will<br>come into being in the future.”<br>Brahmajæla sutta discusses the theory of creation. According to it, at the beginning of the<br>world, a Brahma came into being in the Plane of the Brahmæs. He was then alone. As the gained<br>longevity, he felt oppressed with this lo neliness and so he thought to himself that it would be great if<br>he could have company. At this juncture some of the people on this earth gained jhæna and was<br>reborn in the Plane where the Great Brahmæ was residing. The new-comers were not as powerful as<br>himself. So he thought that they came into being because he willed them to be. They died in course<br>of time; but remained. Lesser Brahmæs, therefore, recognized him as their creator.<br>But the monk was not asking whether or not the Great Brahmæ was really the Great Brahmæ<br>who created the Universe. He only wanted to know the place where the four elements meet their end.<br>So he repeated the riddle; and the Great Brahmæ kept on saying that he was the creator. As the<br>questioner was persistent, he was at long last obliged to tell him the truth in the absence of all other<br>Brahmæs, for, he did not want to let them know his ignorance and, thereby, lost his prestige as the<br>all-knowing and the all-powerful.<br>“O monk!” he confided, “I do not know anything about the cessation of the elements. You are<br>wrong to have come to me when you have Buddha who can answer your question. Go to him!”<br>Then only the monk approached Buddha and asked: “Reverend Sir! Where do the four<br>primary elements come to cessation without leaving any residue?”<br>Buddha likened the monk to a bird flying out from a ship at sea in search of land. Not being<br>able to reach it, it comes back to the ship. “You should not have posed the question in the way you<br>did,” said Buddha, “Your question suggests as if there is a definite place outside the body where<br>cessation of the elements occur. In fact there is no such place. You should have asked where pathavø,<br>tejo, æpo and væyo lose their footing; that is to say where they lose existence. Likewise you should<br>have asked where do long and short, great and small and good and bad lose their footing. And, you<br>NIBBANAPATISAMYUTTA KATHA 65<br>should also have asked where do mind and matter get totally annihilated leaving no residue. If you<br>ask likewise, you shall have the answer.”<br>Then he uttered the gæthæ which begins with “viññænaμ anidassanaμ, anantaμ<br>sabbatopabhaμ,” which has been explained extensively before. In Nibbæna, the four elements<br>together with mind and matter have no footing. That is to say, they do not exist.<br>So far I have expounded the attributes of Nibbæna beginning with its state of emancipation<br>from the world of ta¼hæ to that of cessation of all formations of sa³khæra about which, I believe, all<br>that is to be said has been said.<br>As you have listened with respectful attention to this discourse on Nibbæna, may you be<br>rewarded with enlightenment of the Path and its Fruition that can lead you to Nibbæna where all<br>formations cease as cravings are discarded.</p></div>

              <h1>Attending to the Deathless</h1>
              <p>“When the heart is released from clinging,” said the Buddha, “then
                      consciousness does not land anywhere. That state, I tell you, is
                      without sorrow, afflication or despair.” Ajahn Amaro on abiding in the
                      consciousness that is completely beyond conditioned phenomena—neither
                      supporting them nor supported by them.</p>
              <p>A great passage in the suttas (<em>Anguttara</em><em> Nikaya</em> 3.128)
                      presents an exchange between two of the Buddha's elder monks. Venerable
                      Sariputta is the Buddha's chief disciple, the one most eminent in
                      wisdom and also in meditative accomplishments. Although he had no
                      psychic powers whatsoever, he was the grand master of meditators. The
                      other elder disciple of the Buddha, Venerable Anuruddha, had
                      spectacular psychic powers. He was the one most blessed with "the
                      divine eye"; he could see into all the different realms.</p>
              <p>The two disciples were an interesting mix. Sariputta's weakness was
                      Anuruddha's great gift. Anyway, shortly before his enlightenment,
                      Anuruddha came to Sariputta and said, "With the divine eye purified and
                      perfected I can see the entire 10,000-fold universal system. My
                      meditation is firmly established; my mindfulness is steady as a rock. I
                      have unremitting energy, and the body is totally relaxed and calm. And
                      yet still my heart is not free from the outflows and confusions. What
                      am I getting wrong?"</p>
              <p>Sariputta replied, "Friend, your ability to see into the 10,000-fold
                      universal system is connected to your conceit. Your persistent energy,
                      your sharp mindfulness, your physical calm and your one-pointedness of
                      mind have to do with your restlessness. And the fact that you still
                      have not released the heart from the outflows and defilements is tied
                      up with your anxiety. It would be good, friend, if rather than
                      occupying yourself with these concerns, you turned your attention to
                      the deathless element." (By the way, the Pali Canon has a lot of humor
                      in it like this, although it's rather similar to British humor and is
                      sometimes easy to miss.) So of course Anuruddha said, “Thank you very
                      much,” and off he went. Shortly thereafter, he realized complete
                      enlightenment. This was very understated humor.</p>
              <p>The point of their discussion, however, is really quite serious. As
                      long as we are saying, "Look at how complicated my problems are," or
                      "Look at my powers of concentration," we will stay stuck in samsara. In
                      essence, Sariputta told his colleague, "You're so busy with all of the
                      doingness and the effects that come from that, so busy with all of
                      these proliferations, you'll never be free. You're looking in the wrong
                      direction. You're looking <em>out,</em> looking at the meditation object <em>out there,</em> the 10,000-fold universal system <em>out there.</em> Just shift your view to the context of experience and attend to the deathless element instead."</p>
              <p>All it took was a slight shift of focus for Anuruddha to realize:
                      "It's not just a matter of all the fascinating objects or all the noble
                      stuff I have been doing—that's all conditioned, born, compounded and
                      deathbound. The timeless dharma is being missed. Look within, look more
                      broadly. Attend to the deathless."</p>
              <p>There are also a few places in the suttas (e.g., <em>Majjhima Nikaya</em> 64.9 and <em>Anguttara Nikaya</em> 9.36) where the Buddha talked about the same process with respect to
                      development of concentration and meditative absorption. He even made
                      the point that when the mind is in first jhana, second jhana, third
                      jhana and all the way out to the higher formless jhanas, we can look at
                      those states and recognize all of them as being conditioned and
                      dependent. This, he said, is the true development of wisdom: the
                      mindfulness to recognize the conditioned nature of a state, to turn
                      away from it and to attend to the deathless, even while the state is
                      still around. When the mind is concentrated and very pure and bright,
                      we can recognize that state as conditioned, dependent, alien, and
                      something that is void or empty. There is the presence of mind to
                      reflect on the truth that all of this is conditioned and thus gross,
                      but there is the deathless element. And in inclining toward the
                      deathless
                      element, the heart is released.</p>
              <p>In a way it is like looking at a picture. Normally the attention
                      goes to the figure in a picture and not the background. Or imagine
                      being in a room with someone who is sitting in a chair. When you look
                      across the room you would probably not attend to the space in front of
                      or beside that person. Your attention would go to the figure in the
                      chair, right? Similarly, if you've ever painted a picture or a wall,
                      there's usually one spot where there's a glitch or a smudge. So where
                      does the eye go when you look at the wall? It beams straight in on the
                      flaw. In exactly the same way, our perceptual systems are geared to aim
                      for the figure, not the ground. Even if an object looks like the
                      ground—such as limitless light, for example—we still need to know how
                      to turn back from that object.</p>
              <p>Incidentally, this is why in Buddhist meditation circles there's
                      often a warning about deep states of absorption. When one is in one, it
                      can be very difficult to develop insight—much more so than when the
                      mind is less intensely concentrated. The absorption state is such a
                      good facsimile of liberation that it feels like the real gold. So we
                      think, "It's here, why bother going any further? This is really good."
                      We get tricked and, as a result, we miss the opportunity to turn away
                      and attend to the deathless.</p>
              <p>In cosmological terms, the best place for liberation is in the human
                      realm. There's a good mixture of suffering and bliss, happiness and
                      unhappiness here. If we are off in the deva realms, it's difficult to
                      become liberated because it's like being at an ongoing party. And we
                      don't even have to clean up afterwards. We just hang out in the Nandana
                      Grove. Devas drop grapes in our mouths as we waft around with flocks of
                      adoring beings of our favorite gender floating in close proximity. And,
                      of course, there's not much competition; you're always the star of the
                      show in those places. Up in the brahma realms it's even worse. Who is
                      going to come back down to grubby old earth and deal with tax returns
                      and building permits?</p>
              <p>This cosmology is a reflection of our internal world. Thus the
                      brahma realms are the equivalent of formless states of absorption. One
                      of the great meditation masters of Thailand, Venerable Ajahn Tate, was
                      such an adept at concentration that as soon as he sat down to meditate
                      he would go straight into <em>arupa-jhana</em>, formless
                      states of absorption. It took him twelve years after he met his teacher, Venerable Ajahn Mun, to train himself <em>not</em> to do that and to keep his concentration at a level where he could
                      develop insight. In those formless states, it is just so nice that it's
                      easy to ask, "What's the point of cultivating wise reflection or
                      investigating the nature of experience? The experience itself is so
                      seamlessly delicious, why bother?" The reason we bother is that those
                      are not dependable states. They are unreliable and they are not ours.
                      Probably not many people have the problem of getting stuck in
                      arupa-jhana. Nonetheless, it is helpful to understand why these
                      principles are discussed and emphasized.</p>
              <p>This gesture of attending to the deathless is thus a core spiritual
                      practice but not a complicated one. We simply withdraw our attention
                      from the objects of the mind and incline the attention towards the
                      deathless, the unborn. This is not a massive reconstruction program.
                      It's not like we have to <em>do</em> a whole lot. It's very simple and
                      natural. We relax and notice that which has been here all along, like
                      noticing the space in a room. We don't notice space, because it doesn't
                      grab our attention; it isn't exciting. Similarly, nibbana has no
                      feature, no color, no taste and no form, so we don't realize it's right
                      here. The perceptual systems and the naming activity of the mind work
                      on forms; that's what they go to first. Therefore we tend to miss
                      what's always here. Actually, because it has no living quality to it,
                      space is the worst as well as the best example, but sometimes it is
                      reasonable to use it.</p>
              <h2>Unsupported Consciousness</h2>
              <p>In the Theravada teachings, the Buddha also talked about this
                      quality in terms of "unsupported consciousness." This means that there
                      is cognition, there is knowing, but it's not landing anyplace; it's not
                      abiding anywhere. "Attending to the deathless" and "unsupported
                      consciousness" are somewhat synonymous. They are like descriptions of
                      the same tree, from different angles.</p>
              <p>In describing unsupported consciousness, the Buddha taught:</p>
              <ul>
              Wherever there is something that is intended, something that is
                      acted upon or something that lies dormant, then that becomes the basis
                      for consciousness to land. And where consciousness lands, that then is
                      the cause for confusion, attachment, becoming and rebirth, and so on.<br><br> But if there is nothing intended, acted upon or lying latent, then
                      consciousness has no basis to land upon. And having no basis to land,
                      consciousness is released. One recognizes, 'Consciousness, thus
                      unestablished, is released.' Owing to its staying firm, the heart is
                      contented. Owing to its contentment, it is not agitated. Not agitated,
                      such a one realizes complete, perfect nibbana within themselves.
                      (Samyutta Nikaya 12.38 and 22.53) 
              </ul>
              <p>The Buddha used a whole galaxy of images, similes and forms like
                      this because they spoke to different people in different ways. In
                      another passage the Buddha asked his disciples, "If there was a house
                      with a wall that faced out towards the east and in that wall there was
                      a window, when the sun came up in the morning, where would the shaft of
                      sunlight fall?"</p>
              <p>One of his monks replied, "On the western wall." The Buddha then
                      asked, "And if there's no western wall, where would the sunlight land?"</p>
              <p>The monk answered, "On the ground." Then the Buddha responded, "And
                      if there's no ground, where will it land?" The monk replied, "On the
                      water."</p>
              <p>The Buddha pushed it a bit further and asked, "And if there's no
                      water, where will it land?" The monk answered correctly when he said,
                      "If there is no water, then it will not land." The Buddha ended the
                      exchange by saying, "Exactly so. When the heart is released from
                      clinging to what are called the four
                      nutriments—physical food, sense contact (sight, sound, smell, taste,
                      touch), intention and consciousness—then consciousness does not land
                      anywhere. That state, I tell you, is without sorrow, affliction or
                      despair" (Samyutta Nikaya 12.64).</p>
              <h2>Consciousness: Invisible, Radiant, Limitless</h2>
              <p>In several instances, the language of the Dzogchen tradition seems
                      strikingly similar to that of the Theravada. In Dzogchen, the common
                      description of the qualities of <em>rigpa</em>, nondual awareness, is
                      "empty in essence, cognizant in nature and unconfined in capacity." A
                      different translation of these three qualities is "emptiness, knowing
                      and lucidity, or clarity." In the Pali scriptures (Digha Nikaya 11.85
                      and Majjima Nikaya 49.25), the Buddha talks about the mind of the
                      arahant as "consciousness which is unmanifest, signless, infinite and
                      radiant in all directions." The Pali words are <em>viññanam</em> (consciousness), <em>aniddassanam</em> (empty, invisible or signless, non-manifestative), <em>anantam</em> (limitless, unconfined, infinite), and <em>sabbato pabham</em> (radiant in all directions, accessible from all sides).</p>
              <p>One of the places the Buddha uses this description is at the end of
                      a long illustrative tale. A monk has asked, "Where is it that earth,
                      water, fire and wind fade out and cease without remainder?" To which
                      the Buddha replies that the monk has asked the wrong question. What he <em>should</em> have asked is, "Where is it that earth, water, fire and wind can find
                      no footing?" The Buddha then answers this question himself, saying it
                      is in "the consciousness which is invisible, limitless and radiant in
                      all directions" that the four great elements "and long and short, and
                      coarse and fine, and pure and impure can find no footing. There it is
                      that <em>nama-rupa</em> (body-and-mind, name-and-form,
                      subject-and-object) both come to an end. With this stopping, this
                      cessation of consciousness, all things here are brought to an end."</p>
              <p>Such unsupported and unsupportive consciousness is not an abstract
                      principle. In fact, it was the basis of the Buddha's enlightenment. As
                      the Buddha was sitting under the bodhi tree, the hordes of Mara
                      attacked him. Armies were hurling themselves at the Buddha and yet
                      nothing could get into the space under the tree. All the weapons and
                      spears they threw turned into rays of light; the arrows that they fired
                      turned into flowers that came sprinkling down around the Buddha.
                      Nothing harmful to the Buddha could get into that space. There was
                      nowhere for it to land. Sight, sound, smell, taste and touch, long and
                      short, coarse and fine, pure and impure are all aspects of body and
                      mind. They represent attributes of all phenomena. Yet none of them
                      could find a footing. The Buddha was in a non-stick realm. Everything
                      that came toward him kept falling away. Nothing stuck; nothing could
                      get in and harm the Buddha in any way. To get a better sense of this
                      quality of unsupported consciousness, it's helpful to reflect on this
                      image. Also very useful are the phrases at the end of the passage just
                      quoted, particularly where the Buddha says, "When consciousness ceases,
                      all things here are brought to an end."</p>
              <h2>The Anatomy of Cessation</h2>
              <p>The concept of cessation is very familiar in the Theravada
                      tradition. Even though it's supposed to be synonymous with nibbana,
                      it's sometimes put forth as some event that we're all seeking, where
                      all experience will vanish and then we'll be fine: "A great god will
                      come from the sky, take away everything and make everybody feel high."
                      I don't want to get obsessed about words, but we suffer a lot or get
                      confused because of misunderstandings like this. When we talk about
                      stopping consciousness, do you think that means "Let's all get
                      unconscious?” It can't be that, can it? The Buddha was not extolling
                      the virtues of unconsciousness. Otherwise thorazine or barbiturates
                      would be the way: "Give me the anesthetic and we're on our way to
                      nibbana." But obviously that's not it. Understanding what is meant by
                      stopping or cessation is thus pretty crucial here.</p>
              <p>I've known people, particularly those who have practiced in the
                      Theravada tradition, who have been taught that the idea of meditation
                      is to get to a place of cessation. We might get to a place where we
                      don't feel or see anything; there is awareness but everything is gone.
                      An absence of sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, the body—it all
                      vanishes. And then these students are told, "This is the greatest
                      thing. That's what there is to look forward to." The teacher encourages
                      them to put tremendous hours and diligence into their meditation. When
                      one of these students told her teacher that she had arrived at that
                      kind of state, he got really excited. He then asked her, "So what did
                      it feel like?" and she said, "It was like drinking a glass of cold
                      water but without the water and without the glass." On another occasion
                      she said, "It was like being shut inside a refrigerator."</p>
              <p>This is not the only way of understanding cessation. The root of the word <em>nirodha</em> is <em>rudh</em>, which means "to not arise, to end, check or hold"—like holding a horse in check with the reins. So <em>nirodha</em> also has a meaning of holding everything, embracing its scope.
                      "Stopping of consciousness" can thus imply that somehow everything is
                      held in check rather than that it simply vanishes. It's a redrawing of
                      the internal map.</p>
              <p>A story from the time of the Buddha might help to expand our
                      understanding of what this means. One night while the Buddha was
                      meditating, a brilliant and beautiful devata named Rohitassa appeared
                      in front of him. He told the Buddha, "When I was a human being, I was a
                      spiritual seeker of great psychic power, a sky walker. Even though I
                      journeyed with great determination and resolution for one hundred years
                      to reach the end of the world, I could not come to the end of the
                      world. I died on the journey before I had found it. So can you tell me,
                      is it possible to journey to the end of the world?"</p>
              <p>And the Buddha replied, "It is not possible to reach the end of the
                      world by walking, but I also tell you that unless you reach the end of
                      the world, you will not reach the end of suffering." Rohitassa was a
                      bit puzzled and said, "Please explain this to me, Venerable Sir." The
                      Buddha replied, "In this very fathom-long body is the world, the origin
                      of the world, the cessation of the world, and the way leading to the
                      cessation of the world" (<em>Anguttara  Nikaya</em> 4.45, <em>Samyutta Nikaya</em> 2.26).</p>
              <p>In that instance the Buddha used the same exact formulation as in the Four Noble Truths. The world, or <em>loka</em><em>,</em> means the world of our experience. That's how the Buddha almost always uses the term "the world." He's referring to the world <em>as we experience it.</em> This includes only sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, thought, emotion
                      and feeling. That's it. That's what "the world" is—my world, your
                      world. It's not the abstracted, geographical planet, universe-type
                      world. It's the direct experience of the planet, the people and the
                      cosmos. Here is the origin of the world, the cessation of the world and
                      the way leading to the cessation of the world.</p>
              <p>He said that as long as we create "me and my experience"—"me in
                      here" and "the world out there"—we're stuck in the world of subject and
                      object. Then there is dukkha. And the way leading to the cessation of
                      that duality is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.
                      Geographically, it is impossible to journey to the end of the world.
                      Only when we come to the cessation of the world, which literally means
                      the cessation of its otherness or thingness, will we reach the end of
                      dukkha, unsatisfactoriness. When we stop creating sense objects as
                      absolute realities and stop seeing thoughts and feelings as solid
                      things, there is cessation.</p>
              <p>To see that the world is within our minds is one way of working with
                      these principles. The whole universe is embraced when we realize that
                      it's happening within our minds. And in that moment when we recognize
                      that it all happens <em>here,</em> it ceases. Its thingness ceases. Its otherness ceases. Its substantiality
                      ceases.</p>
              <p>This is just one way of talking and thinking about it. But I find
                      this brings us much closer to the truth, because in that respect, it's
                      held in check. It's known. But there's also the quality of its
                      emptiness. Its insubstantiality is known. We're not imputing solidity
                      to it, a reality that it doesn't possess. We're just looking directly
                      at the world, knowing it fully and completely.</p>
              <p>So, what happens when the world ceases? I remember one time Ajahn
                      Sumedho was giving a talk about this same subject. He said, "Now I'm
                      going to make the world completely disappear. I'm going to make the
                      world come to an end." He just sat there and said, "Okay, are you
                      ready? The world just ended. Do you want me to bring it back into being
                      again? Okay, welcome back."</p>
              <p>Nothing was apparent from the outside. It all happens internally.
                      When we stop creating the world, we stop creating each other. We stop
                      imputing the sense of solidity that creates a sense of separation. Yet
                      we do not shut off the senses in any way. Actually, we shed the veneer,
                      the films of confusion, of opinion, of judgment, of our conditioning,
                      so that we can see the way things really are. At that moment, dukkha
                      ceases. There is knowing. There is liberation and freedom. There is no
                      dukkha.</p>
              <h2>Is the Sound Annoying You?</h2>
              <p>If people were trying to meditate and wanted to shut the world out,
                      Ajahn Chah used to give them a very hard time. If he came across a nun
                      or a monk who had barricaded the windows of their heart and was trying
                      to block everything out, he would really put them through it. He drew
                      in one monk of this type as his attendant for a while and he would
                      never let him sit still. As soon as he saw the monk close his eyes to
                      "go into meditation" he would immediately send him off on some errand.
                      Ajahn Chah knew that cutting yourself off was not the place of true
                      inner peace. This was because of his own years of trying to make the
                      world shut up and leave him alone. He had failed miserably. Eventually
                      he was able to see this is not how to find completion and resolution.</p>
              <p>Years ago, when he was a wandering monk, living on his own on a
                      mountainside above a village, he kept a strict meditation schedule. In
                      Thailand they love outdoor, nightlong film shows because the nights are
                      cool compared to the very hot days. Whenever there was a party, it
                      tended to go on all night. About fifty years ago, public address
                      systems were just starting to be used in Thailand and every decent
                      event had to have a PA going. It was blasted as loud as possible all
                      through the night. One time, Ajahn Chah was quietly meditating up on
                      the mountain while there was a festival going on down in the village.
                      All the local folk songs and pop music were amplified throughout the
                      area. Ajahn Chah was sitting there, seething and thinking, "Don't they
                      realize all the bad karma involved in disturbing my meditation? They
                      know I 'm up here. After all, I'm their teacher. Haven't they learned
                      anything? And what about the five precepts? I bet they're boozing and
                      out of control," and so on and so forth.</p>
              <p>But Ajahn Chah was a pretty smart fellow. As he listened to himself
                      complaining, he quickly realized, "Well, they're just having a good
                      time down there. I'm making myself miserable up here. No matter how
                      upset I get, my anger is just making more noise internally." And then
                      he had this insight: "Oh, the sound is just the sound. It's me who is
                      going out to annoy it. If I leave the sound alone, it won't annoy me.
                      It's just doing what it has to do. That's what sound does. It makes
                      sound. This is its job. So if I don't go out and bother the sound, it's
                      not going to bother me. Aha!"</p>
              <p>As it turned out, this insight had such a profound effect that it
                      became a principle that he espoused from that time on. If any of the
                      monks displayed an urge to try and get away from people or
                      stimulation—the world of things and responsibilities—he would tend to
                      shove them straight into it. He would put that monk in charge of the
                      cement-mixing crew or take him to do every house blessing that came up
                      on the calendar. He would make sure that the monk had to get involved
                      in things because he was trying to teach him to let go of seeing
                      meditation as needing sterile conditions—to see, in fact, that most
                      wisdom arises from the skillful handling of the world's abrasions.</p>
              <p>Ajahn Chah was passing along an important insight. It's pointless to
                      try to find peace through nullifying or erasing the sense world. Peace
                      only comes through not giving that world more substantiality or more
                      reality than it actually possesses.</p>
              <h2>Touching the Earth</h2>
              <p>Sometimes when I use the example of the Buddha sitting under the
                      bodhi tree, people still feel that this is a negation of the sense
                      world. There is an intimation of condescension, a looking down on that.
                      We become afraid when we hear people talking about dispassion towards
                      the sense world as it can offend our habits of life affirmation.</p>
              <p>The balance—and this is something we can experience for ourselves—is
                      not in negation. It comes when we stop creating each other and allow
                      ourselves to relax into a pure quality of knowing. In not fabricating
                      the world, ourselves or our stories, there is a gentle relaxation and,
                      ironically, we find ourselves far more attuned to life than ever. This
                      cannot happen while we are busy carrying around "me and you" and "it's
                      my life" and "my past" and "my future" and the rest of the world with
                      all its problems. Actually, the result of this relinquishment is not a
                      kind of numbness or a distancing but an astonishing attunement.</p>
              <p>Buddhist cosmology and the stories of the suttas always have a
                      historical, a mythical and a psychological element to them. When we
                      talk about the Buddha under the bodhi tree, we sometimes wonder, "Was
                      it actually <em>that</em> tree? Are we sure that he <em>really</em> sat
                      beside the river Nerañjara near Bodhgaya? How can anyone know it was
                      actually there?" The story goes that perhaps the Buddha did sit under a
                      tree, or a Nepalese prince sat under a tree, and something happened (or
                      stopped happening) somewhere in India a couple of thousand years or so
                      ago. In other words, there are both historical and mythological aspects
                      to the story. But the most crucial element is how this maps onto our
                      own psychology. How does this symbolize our experience?</p>
              <p>The pattern of the story is that even though the Buddha has totally
                      penetrated the cycles of dependent origination and his heart is utterly
                      free, Mara's army doesn't retreat. Mara has sent in the horrors, he has
                      sent in his beautiful daughters, he's even sent in the parental
                      pressure factor: "Well, son, you could have done a great job. You're
                      such a natural leader, you would have made a great king. Now there's
                      only your half-brother, Nanda, and he's a bit of a wimp, no good on the
                      battlefield. Well, I guess if you're going to do this monk thing, the
                      kingdom is going to go to rack and ruin. But that's all right, it's
                      fine. You just do whatever you want to do. Just be aware that you're
                      ruining my life; but don't worry, it's fine, it's okay."</p>
              <p>The forces of allure, fear and responsibility are all there. Yet the
                      Buddha doesn't just close his eyes and escape into blissful absorption.
                      As the armies of Mara come at him, he looks straight at them and says,
                      "I know you, Mara. I know what this is." The Buddha doesn't argue with
                      Mara or give rise to aversion towards Mara. He remains undeluded; he
                      doesn't react against what's happening in that moment. No matter what
                      Mara's armies do, none can get into that space under the bodhi tree.
                      All their weapons turn to flowers and incense and beams of light
                      illuminating the vajra seat.</p>
              <p>But even when the Buddha's heart is totally liberated, Mara still
                      won't retreat. He says to the Buddha, "What right do you have to claim
                      the royal seat at the immovable spot. I'm the king of this world. I'm
                      the one who should be sitting there. I'm in charge here. I'm the one
                      who deserves to be there, aren't I?" And he turns around to his horde,
                      his army 700,000 strong, and they all say, "Yes, indeed, Sire!" "See,"
                      says Mara, "everyone agrees. I belong there, not you. I'm supposed to
                      be the great one."</p>
              <p>What happens then is that, just as Mara has called his witnesses to
                      back him up, the Buddha calls on the mother goddess, Maer Toranee, as
                      his witness. The Buddha reaches down to the ground, touches the earth
                      and calls forth the earth mother. She appears and says, "This is my
                      true son. He has every right to claim the vajra seat at the immovable
                      spot. He has developed all the virtues necessary to claim the
                      sovereignty of perfect and complete enlightenment. You do not belong
                      there, Mara." The mother goddess then produces a flood from her hair
                      and the armies of Mara are all washed away. Later they come back full
                      of apologies, offering gifts and flowers and asking for forgiveness:
                      "Terribly sorry about that, Mother. I didn't really mean it."</p>
              <p>It's very interesting that Buddha thus did not become a fully
                      enlightened, teaching Buddha without the help of the mother goddess and
                      then, later, of the father god. It was Brahma Sahampati, the creator
                      god, the CEO of the universe, who came and asked the Buddha to teach.
                      Without those two figures, he would not have left the immovable spot
                      and he wouldn't have started teaching. So, mythologically, there are
                      some interesting little quirks to the tale.</p>
              <p>The Buddha's gentle gesture of touching the earth is a magnificent
                      metaphor. It is saying that even though we might have this enlightened,
                      free space internally, it needs to be interfaced with the phenomenal
                      world. Otherwise, there is no completion. This is why meditating with
                      the eyes open is, in a way, such a useful bridge. We cultivate a vast
                      internal space, but it is necessarily connected to the phenomenal
                      world. If there is only an internal, subjective experience of
                      enlightenment, we 're still caught. Mara's army won't retreat. The
                      hassles are everywhere—the tax returns, the permits, the jealousies. We
                      can see that they are empty, but they are still coming at us from all
                      directions.</p>
              <p>But in reaching out to touch the earth, the Buddha recognized, yes,
                      there is that which is transcendent and unconditioned. But humility
                      demands not simply holding to the unconditioned and the transcendent.
                      The Buddha recognized and acknowledged that "There is the conditioned.
                      There is the sense world. There is the earth that makes up my body and
                      my breath and the food that I eat."</p>
              <p>That gesture of reaching out from the transcendent is saying, How
                      could fully engaging with the sense world possibly corrupt the innate
                      freedom of the heart? This freedom cannot be interrupted, corrupted or
                      confused by any sense experience. Therefore why not allow it all in? By
                      openly, freely acknowledging the limited—needing to call the great
                      mother to bear witness, for example—the unlimited manifests its full
                      potential. If there is hesitency and the caution to keep the
                      conditioned at bay, that betrays a basic lack of faith in the natural
                      inviolability of the unconditioned.</p>
              <p>Another phrase that expresses this same principle is <em>cittam pabhassaram, akandukehi kilesehi</em>, meaning "The heart's nature is intrinsically radiant; defilements are only visitors" (<em>Anguttara Nikaya</em> 1.61). It's pointing out the fact that the heart's nature is
                      intrinsically pure and perfect. The things that appear to defile this
                      purity are only visitors passing through, just wandering or drifting
                      by. The heart's nature cannot truly be corrupted by any of that.</p>

              <p class="bodyText style10">A Detailed Account of the  Life Story of the late Sun Lun Gu Kyaung Sayadaw who found the Nature of Nibbana</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> (This detailed life story is  a record of what was heard from the mouth of the late Sun Lun Gu kyaung Sayadaw  of Myingyan.)</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> It
              is the inherent nature of an AriyÄ� to be obsessed with a persistent
              desire for escape from the perilous round of rebirths, characterized by
              constant perishing of mental and material phenomena. One such AriyÄ� to
              be, faring in SaÑsarÈ’s innumerable existences, happened to be born as
              a parrot during the time of Kassapa Buddha who appeared in the
              Bhadda-kappa (the present world) which is blessed by Five Buddhas.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> One
              day, the parrot happened to meet Kassapa Buddha. Being endowed with
              innate wisdom, he knew that it was a Noble Personage. He was inspired
              to pay homage to the Buddha. He offered a fruit to the Buddha
              respectfully with his wings touching each other above his head. The
              Buddha out of compassion accepted the bird’s gift and said, “May all
              your wishes come to fulfillment”. The parrot watched the Buddha with
              revered eyes as the Buddha departed, his little heart full of joy,
              uttering “O, what a good deed I have done!” Since the donee was the
              Buddha himself and the donor made his gift with strong conviction, the
              resultant was bound to be fruitful. The parrot was reborn in the good
              destinations of the seven planes of sensual existence under glorious
              circumstances. After faring in a number of Celestial realms, he was
              reborn in the human world as a great Tikicchaka Physician (N.B. The
              Sayadaw once said: “Those who had met me during my existence as a great
              Physician will come to me now and take up the practice of Dhamma under
              me.”) During the time of Gotama Buddha, the great Physician was reborn
              as the famous Barr-mai Sayadaw, mentor to King Man|hÄ� of Thaton,
              Thuwanna Bhumi, the great patron of the Buddha’s Teaching. After
              passing away from that existence, the future Sun Lun Sayadaw was reborn
              as a child of U Thant and Daw Tok of Sun Lun village in the southern
              part of Myingyan Township in Upper Burma. (N.B. During the British
              administration the country was divided into Upper Burma and Lower
              Burma, the upper region being still under Burmese King.)</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> At
              the time of conception, the father had a dream in which a man of noble
              appearance came to his house and asked for permission to stay in the
              house. U Thant told that man, not to stay with his family because he
              was very poor. Although he refused many times, the stranger insisted to
              stay, and at last had to agree. The family took the dream as
              auspicious. The mother Daw Tok after nine months of pregnancy, in the
              tenth month give birth to the child, the future- Sun Lun Sayadaw, at
              the few minutes before 4 am on the second waning day of Tabaung (March)
              in 1239 ME, which was the year 2421 of the SÄ�sanÄ� Era. The child had a
              particularly bright appearance. At the time of naming him, with the
              usual washing of the hair, in view of the good omens, he was named
              Maung Kyaw Din (Meaning Master Famous).</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> (U Thant and Daw Tok had  three children; Ma Thinn, Ko Kyaw Din and Ko Aung Khaing).</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> Ko
              Kyaw Din was placed under the Min-Kyaung Sayadaw of Myingyan for his
              education. He was a dull pupil and did not get far in his studies. So
              his father U Thant found him a menial post like his, in the office of
              the Deputy Commissioner of Myingyan.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> When
              Ko Kyaw Din grew up, he married Ma Shwe Yi of his native village. The
              couple begot four children but three died in infancy and only a son by
              the name of Ko Shein (a) Ko Kan Nyunt survived to this day.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> Ko
              Kyaw Din thought that his work as an office-boy in government office
              held no good prospects and resigned the job at the age of thirty. He
              worked as a cultivator in the family estate, a dry patch of land. One
              day, one U San Tin, said to achieved occult powers and was patronized
              by the (four) Great Guardian Kings of CatumahÄ�rÄ�ja DevÈs Realm, came to
              him and recited some strange prophetic words without any context. His
              words roughly might be translated that:</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> “Amai Bok’s skeins got  tangled, who’s there to clear up this mess? The shuttle moves  along amidst the threads of skeins.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> The ruined stump of the  pagoda emits rays! Ma Khway is dressed
              in the beautiful longyi of ‘Pondaw’ design with a green fringe and a
              checkered blue. The weaver’s gear made of ‘Kyun-bo’ teak puts forth a
              sound that can be heard from a distance of ten thousand Y|janÄ�s.”</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> U San Tin then explained his  words as follows: “The skeins that are tangled get entangled when put to the  loom, isn’t it?”</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> “Yes, of course”</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> “That
              being so, U Kyaw Din, the tangled skein called AvijjÄ� (Ignorance) by
              far more tangled than the skeins, will have to be disentangled by you
              with Sati (Mindfulness). A weaving factory will appear south of Sun Lun
              Village. When it does, you will have to promote the SÄ�sanÄ� at
              Kyun-bo-pin-kone. When you take up the work of promoting the SÄ�sanÄ�,
              there will be two teak pillars there. The meaning of the old stump of
              the pagoda emitting rays fore-tells the emergence of practice of the
              Buddha’s Teaching that has so far been forgotten by the people”.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> “Oh, all humbug, my friend,”  retorted U Kyaw Din. </p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> “Just wait and see” said U  San Tin.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> That
              year, they purchased another plot of cultivable land. At the beginning
              of the raining season U Kyaw Din and Daw Shwe Yi went to their field to
              clear it up to start ploughing. U Kyaw Din said to his wife: “We shall
              sow sessamum in our field this year. If we reap a yield of fifty
              baskets we shall offer a thousand lights at the pagoda”. Daw Shwe Yi
              replied, “Why fifty? If we get forty baskets we will make an offering
              of one thousand lights!” “Good, Ma Shwe Yi,” said the husband, let us
              be true to our word. At our offering we won’t have a procession with
              music as is the custom. In case the girls in the procession got their
              jewellery lost, it would mean botheration for us. Let’s make it a
              simple affair”.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> A
              few days later, they sowed sessamum seeds in the field. When the seeds
              sprouted there was no rain at the beginning of the rainy season and the
              tiny plants withered. Fortunately, they survived till the rains come.
              Other fields were not so fortunate: the plants did not survive. U Kyaw
              Din’s fields yielded forty baskets of sessamum- exactly forty!</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> True
              to their words, they pressed the sessamum into oil. Daw Shwe Yi
              proposed that nine viss of the oil be marked for offering of one
              thousand lights; nine viss would be offered to the SaÑghÈ. U Kyaw Din
              asked her how many bhikkhus would be the donees. Daw Shwe Yi said “four
              Bhikkhus, and two viss to be donated to each. The remaining one viss
              should see to the congregation at the ceremony”. And U Kyaw Din agreed.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> On
              the full moon day of Thadingyut (October) 1281ME, the couple made their
              light offering at the pagoda south east of the village. At the
              congregation where they listened to the sermon of the SaÑghÄ� and poured
              the consecration water. They gave to their guests pickled tea leaves,
              cheroots and betel - as was the custom. Meantime, U Kyaw Din was at the
              pagoda watching the burning little lamps of oil. He observed how the
              tips of the wicks turned black and the oil boiled. The sight moved his
              mind greatly.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> So
              much so that goose-flesh appeared on his skin. He was shaking
              violently. “Oh, it’s very extraordinary,” he thought himself. If I were
              to make a wish now, my wish will become fulfilled.” He felt convinced
              about it. So he made the wish: “May I become a Bhikkhu. May I teach
              Dhamma to the people. May they follow my example in the practice as
              instructed by me.”</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> Having
              made the wish whole heartedly, it occurred to him thus, I am quite
              illiterate: how shall I teach Dhamma as a Bhikkhu?” At that time, he
              was not only illiterate but also had not heard Dhamma taught by others.
              He had no knowledge about the various types of Enlightenment such as
              Pacceka Buddha-hood, the Chief Discipleship, the Great Discipleship and
              Ordinary Discipleship. So he simple wished for Bhikkhu-hood. Anyway, he
              was immensely pleased with himself for having spoken out his wish
              before the Buddha and was anticipating fully of its fulfillment.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> It
              was a decidedly prosperous year for him. He had heard people say that a
              marked prosperity forebodes death. Further, he had heard them says that
              when one’s horoscope happen to fall under the planet Saturn, one is
              liable to meet his death. And he knew that his horoscope was then
              falling under Saturn. Myingyan at that juncture was infected with the
              epidemic of plague (which came every year then). May be I might fell a
              victim to plague. In that case, he felt he had very little store of
              merit while being full of demerit. His good fortune that year
              particularly made him uneasy. He was obsessed with death.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> It
              was during those uneasy days that on a month of Tabaung (March) night U
              Kyaw Din dreamt a dream. In the dream, U Kyaw Din saw a Buddha Image
              come into the temporary pandal in front of his house and was making
              certain movements, smiling. U Kyaw Din said to his wife, “Just hand me
              that rice bowl. I will offer the rice to the Buddha with my hands.” As
              he was in the act of making his rice offering to the Buddha, the Buddha
              Image said to him, “O, what a fuss! I am talking to you only for now. I
              shall not talk to you in future.” At that U Kyaw Din woke up from his
              dream. He found himself trembling violently. He took the dream as an
              omen of his impending death. He roused up his wife from her sleep and
              told her about the dream. He urgently asked for some candles. Daw Shwe
              Yi told him to keep the dream to himself and fetched some candles for
              him. He took the candles and went straight to the Pagoda where he met
              his boyhood friend U Chi Daing. “What brings you here (at this
              unearthly hour),” asked U Chi Daing?</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> “I
              come to offer light to the Buddha,” replied U Kyaw Din. “I am terribly
              afraid of death!” U Chi Daing asked him of his date of birth and made
              some calculations. Then he said, “The horoscope says that this year
              your family is liable to lose a two-legged (meaning a human being in
              astrological parlance). U Kyaw Din said, “Dear fellow, don’t try to
              frighten me. I am already dying with fear of death!”</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> To this U Chi Daing replied:  “Look here Kyaw Din, I am telling you just what the horoscope says.”</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> U
              Kyaw Din was definitely shaken. He made an earnest request to his
              friend, “Old boy, let me join your daily worshipping sessions. Call me
              every day.” Meanwhile, the two friends were joined by U San Tin. U Kyaw
              Din also begged U San Tin to call him for the daily worshipping
              sessions.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> Not
              long afterwards, U Kyaw Din and U San Tin were dozing off while in
              conversation on the floor of the front part of U Kyaw Din’s place. Then
              U San Tin said, “These multitudes (sentient beings) are in as pitiable
              plight. They are suffering in the three kinds of scourge (War, Famine
              and Disease). They are falling off from an abyss after losing their
              way.” U Kyaw Din rejoined him saying, “True it is, we all have lost our
              way and are falling into an abyss. If only we got the right direction,
              I am prepared to take it.” To this U San Tin said: “The Right direction
              is not hard to find. Just wait at the cross-roads. Someone who can show
              the Right Direction will appear.” U Kyaw Din could not understand what
              U San Tin said and asked him what he meant. U San Tin did not answer,
              he was dozing off again. U Kyaw Din shook him and asked again. U San
              Tin said, “Don’t be afraid, there are the Triple Gems for us, the
              Buddha, the Dhamma and the SaÑghÄ� are our refuge.”</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> U
              San Tin’s words of encouragement did not bring solace to U Kyaw Din who
              was deeply agitated with the prospect of death. He felt that his fear
              would cause him great harm. He thought of curing his mental sickness.
              He confided with his friend, “U San Tin, my mind is sorely agitated, I
              feel that I am heading for a great misfortune. I need to cure my mind
              of this mental sickness. I think of going about it like this; I will
              put up a pandal in front of my house as I saw in my dream. I will have
              a Buddha Image properly arranged there and we shall all gather together
              for regular worshipping sessions. That way I hope I can get happiness.” </p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> “You please yourself,  friend,” said U San Tin.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> “Then come early tomorrow  morning. Let us gather some bamboo and put up a pandal.”</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> On
              the following evening, elderly people of the village gathered at U Kyaw
              Din’s place. Some were discussing about Mind and Mental Concomitants.
              Daw Shwe Yi gave light refreshment to the guests in the customary
              fashion. During the first one or two days, religious discussion that
              took place among the guests did not have any effect on U Kyaw Din’s
              mind. On the third evening, U Ba San, a clerk at the Steel Brothers
              company’s weaving factory came uninvited. He talked about Ä€nÄ�pÄ�na, Ledi
              Sayadaw’s method of VipassanÄ� meditation practice. The word Ä€nÄ�pÄ�na had
              a magic effect on U Kyaw Din’s mind. It stirred his mind so much that
              goose-flesh formed on his skin. “What has become of me?” he wondered.
              “It seems I am going to find the Right way. This man came without
              invitation. Perhaps he came just for my sake. My dream has come true.
              Here I waited at the cross-roads putting up a pandal. And he comes to
              talk about Dhamma, how to go about it. Surely I am going to gain what I
              want, if I try by his method.” Then he thought of his lack of learning.
              This method, he understood, was for literate persons only. He was quite
              illiterate. “How could he gain from his method?” He had his
              doubts. “Anyhow, I will wait till he comes again and ask him about it,”
              he bethought himself. The next evening when the clerk came, he waited
              at the entrance of the pandal and asked him. “Mr. Clerk, Sir, will an
              illiterate person like me be able to practise the way you said the
              other day?” To this the guest replied: “Literate or not, that doesn’t
              matter. Conviction (SadhÈ) and Effort (VÊriya) are the essential
              things.” U Kyaw Din asked again, “Then, how does one go about it?” U Ba
              San simply replied, “In-breaths and out-breaths, that’s Ä€nÄ�pÄ�na,” and
              went into the pandal.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> Those
              two words from his guest enervated him. With a glad heart, he went into
              an extension of his house at one side, sat in an easy chair fitted with
              a gunny cloth as seat, and started noting. “Ah, this is in-breath, this
              is out-breath”, “Now he was on the way. He continued the practice of
              in-breathing and out-breathing seriously and zealously. He was full of
              confidence for success. He had great conviction. And he worked
              energetically. One day, a neighbor U Shwe Lok, came and remarked.
              “Awareness must be present.” U Kyaw Din asked, “How is awareness to be
              present?” And U Shwe Lok answered. “Well, it’s that you must be aware
              of what you are doing.” “What’s the benefit of it” asked U Kyaw Din?
              “That is meritorious,” U Shwe Lok replied: “If that is meritorious,”
              said U Kyaw Din, “I will do it.”</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> U
              Kyaw Din practiced awareness in his work. When he chopped dried stalks
              of corn stems for cattle feed, he kept aware of every stroke of his
              cutting blade. In this way, he earned much merit while he finished the
              work more efficiently. His Insight got developed for developing
              awareness. In breathing, he kept aware of the touching of air at the
              tip of the nose. In walking, he kept aware of each touching of the sole
              with the ground. In weeding or in digging or in drawing water at the
              well, he kept aware of every movement.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> At
              every odd moment by day or by night he practiced mindfulness with full
              awareness- at home or on the field or in the Maung Yin Paw ravine, an
              out of the way place. There at the outskirt of the forest, he would
              meditate overnight. He gained concentration, thanks to his conviction
              and energetic effort. He saw multi-colored lights which he thought to
              be the multi-colored hues of the Buddha’s Rays. This give him
              encouragement much impetus. Not long afterwards, he saw a little ball
              hovering around his face. As he watched it with keen interest, it rose
              slowly upwards. He followed it as it rose till he found himself amidst
              the clouds.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> He
              was please with his progress. As he worked earnestly the next day, he
              noticed a little ball the size of a fire-fly emitting light. As he was
              looking it, the little ball rose upwards till he found himself amidst
              an array of pinnacled mansions. He thought those things as the place he
              was destined for. He came back satisfied and joyful, far from being
              afraid.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> As
              he practiced persistently, he observed painful sensations on his body.
              He was aware of the arising of painful sensation noting the fact with
              mindfulness. Touch and awareness are made mindful of at every
              occurrence. He became attuned to awareness at all times. When he
              talked, he talked only about mindfulness of awareness, i.e., about
              natural phenomena and that made him look odd in social dealings.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> People
              said, “this man has his screws loose.” U Kyaw Din preferred to be
              treated as a mentally deranged person, for that freed him of
              unprofitable social engagements and made him pursue his practice more
              fully. He made use of this opportunity by day and by night.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> As
              he advanced in his practice, he saw the people always going after
              sense-objects. He felt consternation about humanity. He had few words
              with his neighbors. When he happened to be speaking to them, he
              reminded them to be mindful. “Hey, you!” he would say, “Remember the
              Buddha, remember the Dhamma, remember the SaÑghÄ�. You are going to die
              in three days, (or) in five days, (or) in seven days.” But alas, those
              spoken to in those terms met their death as foretold by him. U Kyaw Din
              told people how he could see the internal organs of people, the
              denizens (inhabitants) of Niraya, the realm of continuous suffering,
              congested like maggots in a putrid carcass of a dog. When news of U
              Kyaw Din’s Super-human power spread, people came to him to trace their
              lost cattle, or to get prescriptions for sickness. U Kyaw Din became
              fed up. He felt the need for seclusion. So he spent most of his time
              meditating alone at the Maung Yin Paw ravine.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> (N.B: The Sayadaw later  said: Mundane powers are quite attractive: I was fortunate to be able to  outgrow them.) </p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> Touch,
              Awareness, Mindfulness — with these three essential features, the
              practice of VipassanÄ� proceeded for U Kyaw Din in his observance of
              natural breathing. With constant practice, he observed the painful
              sensations as they arise in his body. By constant mindfulness, Insight
              into rise and fall of physical and mental phenomena was attained. This
              in technical parlance is called Udayabbaya ÒÄ�Óa. This Insight enabled
              him to see the details of the inside of his body as though the body
              were cut open to see.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> (N.B:
              Seeing the process of arising and perishing of phenomena may be either
              in liquid form or in solid form. If the meditator proceeds with the
              practice, putting forth energetic effort, with a strong conviction and
              resoluteness, uninterruptedly day and night, he will reach a stage
              where he comes to understand the nature of the Mind, the Mental
              Concomitants and the Physical Body, how they arise and how they
              dissolve. The meditator can see these happenings clearly. The Insight
              into rise and fall of phenomena has three categories, the crude type,
              the middle type and the refined type. Only by one’s own practice can
              these fine points become comprehensible. These are the Sayadaw’s
              remarks in this matter.)</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> Note: Only so much needs be  told at this stage. : Author.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> (1).
              After attaining Insight into rise and fall of phenomena, on Thursday
              the 13th waning day of Wasou (July) 1282 ME, at about 10 pm U Kyaw Din
              attained the first Supra-mundane Knowledge, SotÈpana (First Stage).</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> U
              Kyaw Din continued with his work. Daw Shwe Yi was fretting all the
              time. She pulled out all the bamboo strips that made the flooring of U
              Kyaw Din cot (bed) and pushed him down. She pulled out all the bamboo
              strips so that no flooring was left, U Kyaw Din did not move away.
              Instead, he squatted on the beam of the cot. At last Daw Shwe Yi gave
              in. She replaced the bamboo strips on the cot (bed). U Kyaw Din said to
              her, “Why are you disturbing my work?”</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10">“I intend to be struck by  you” she replied.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> “Dear wife, I shall never  strike you. Try and talk me out of it.”</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> “You
              good for nothing man, keeping numb all the time like Prince Temiya (of
              the JÄ�taka). If you are so keen to meditate, why won’t you wear the
              yellow robes and stay at the monastery?”</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> Daw
              Shwe Yi kept up her fretting and fuming every day. U Kyaw Din kept
              patient since he was not still successful, like the aged Upaka of the
              scripture story.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> On
              another occasion, when U Kyaw Din was meditating, Daw Shwe Yi let-loose
              her cow from the tethered post and cried to her husband, “Look! The cow
              has gone loose from her post, U Kyaw Din, you go after the cow,
              quick!” That cow was dangerous one, use to attacking anyone coming near
              her. However, on this occasion she stood still without attacking
              anyone. Daw Shwe Yi got furious. Stamping her foot hard on the floor,
              she railed against her husband who seemed not to notice her and
              continued with his meditating work.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10">He
              progressed in his practice. His ability to be mindful on Sensation in
              the body developed. When others used abusive words against him, he felt
              displeasure. His mindfulness told him, “Look, anger has arisen in you.”
              At that same moment, he could choked his anger. He was encouraged by
              his fortitude due to constant mindfulness. He was pleased to remember
              that before he practiced mindfulness, he would certainly have slapped
              that abusive person on the face. Likewise, when he saw a pleasing form
              he felt pleasure. He understood that pleasure as greed. The eye merely
              saw the eye-object. The pleasing form was merely perception. It has
              nothing to feel pleased. Similarly, whenever he heard a sound, he
              understood it as perception of hearing; and whenever he touched some
              tangible objects, he understood it as perception of touch; whenever he
              smelt some odour, he understood it as perception of smell. In any of
              these perceptions he did not allow any pleasure or displeasure to arise
              in his mind. In this way, he had some understanding of the working of
              the mind in regard to sense objects.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> One
              night when U Kyaw Din, keeping mindfulness, fell asleep. He had a dream
              like this. He got into a booking office of a railway station where he
              bought a ticket. The station-master gave him four tickets. He took them
              and put them in his pocket. Soon the train started and he woke up from
              the dream. Not long afterwards, he had another dream. He saw in the
              dream an ox running towards him. He grabbed the tail of the animal. The
              tail broke loose from it and he had the tail left in his hand. Just
              then, he woke up from the dream. U Kyaw Din interpreted the dream. It
              portended, he thought, in that later part of the Buddha’s Teaching, he
              was going to break loose from the woeful world. Greatly encouraged by
              the dream, he put forth his effort.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> (2).
              On Saturday, the 13th waning day of Wagaung (August) at about 10 pm he
              won the second Supra-mundane Knowledge, SakadÈgÈmi (Second Stage).</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> (N.B.-
              Having had the first experience of winning the Supra-mundane Dhamma,
              the Sayadaw told us that the second attainment was not greatly
              different from the first apart from the way unpleasant sensations
              arose.)</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> After
              attaining the Supra-mundane Dhammas twice, U Kyaw Din came to use
              bombastic words. He was able to understand the laws of nature. When
              people of the village came to tell him that someone was sick, U Kyaw
              Din might say, “He is going to die,” then that man died. If someone was
              sick and U Kyaw Din said, “He’s not going to die yet,” then that man
              recovered. His words proved so correct that people dared not open any
              conversation with him. U Kyaw Din did not care about what people said,
              but went on zealously with his work.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10">(3).
              Then on Monday, the 13th waning day of Taw-tha-lin (September) 1282 ME,
              at about 10 pm, he struggled with extraordinarily severe pains arising
              within him, feeling as if all the sinew broke off and overcoming them,
              won the third Supra-mundane Knowledge, AnÈgÈmi (Third Stage).</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10">(N.B.:
              The third winning of the Supra-mundane Dhamma was marked by an emission
              of semen, which symbolized the extirpation of sexual interest. A most
              severe attack of painful sensation had to be met with. Overcoming it
              was a sure signal of success. The Sayadaw said that only when a
              meditator has overcome it he would say, “well done!”)</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> The
              next day, he found that he was free from fear so much so that he could
              remain unperturbed even when a thunderbolt fell in front of him. He
              went ahead with his work. He felt very much concerned with the plight
              of humanity. “Ah, these people are so occupied with sensual objects,”
              he felt. He dreaded living amidst the people. He had a strong desire to
              become a recluse i.e, to lead the homeless life of a Bhikkhu.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10">He
              reflected on the world to see the enemies that are to be contended
              with. He found Greed, Hatred, Bewilderment and Conceit. Of these, he
              found Greed to be the prime source of trouble. He therefore worked to
              get-rid of Greed. His method was Touch-Awareness-Mindfulness. As one
              touches something, one remains aware of the touch and notices the fact
              with mindfulness. By practising this way earnestly, greed gets less and
              less and becomes weaker and weaker. When he thought of any enemy that
              would still remain, he realized that his wife and children and own
              properties were the closest enemies for him.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10">He
              pondered on the state of affairs by way of cause and effect:- “This
              being bridled with impediments such as wife, children and properties
              are the resultants of the cause, and the cause is that I have not
              settled my debts. I must settle my debts now.” These were the thoughts
              that came to his mind.So he said to his wife, “(Ma Shwe Yi) you and I
              became husband and wife due to past Kamma. Do not settle my debts. Let
              me not settle your debts either. Let us agree to break up our wed-lock.
              I will regard you as my own sister and you will regard me as your own
              brother. Give me permission to become a Bhikkhu.”</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10">Daw
              Shwe Yi replied, “Don’t settle the debts owing to me. Don’t go away
              anywhere. Don’t turn a Bhikkhu. Stay here at the specially revered
              room. Let me treat you and look after you as an elder brother. It is
              said that a husband makes his wife respectable and that a wife makes
              her husband graceful. Besides, a woman without protection of her
              husband is liable to be abused and persecuted by others. To be my
              protector, don’t go away from here.” She used the best of her feminine
              eloquence to deter him from his plan.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> At
              that time, U Kyaw Din lacking general knowledge, thought that consent
              of wife was necessary to enter Bhikkhu-hood. He felt miserable for not
              being able to get his wife’s consent. His thought ran like this, “O,
              what a misfortune, living as a house-holder is full of faults. Where
              could I find a livelihood that is faultless? People around me are
              leading lives that are not free from blame. The only way to lead a
              faultless life is a choice between two things; turn into a Bhikkhu or
              else wear the rags and live like a mad man. Perhaps the second choice
              alone is open for me. So I shall wear a gunny bag with two holes at the
              upper corners, make a bigger hole at the top for putting the head. The
              gunny bag will serve as my garment as well as my bed-cloth. For my
              food, I will beg from house to house, carrying a cup. People will feed
              me as a beggar and no one will harm a poor beggar. That way I can lead
              a blameless life. What a splendid idea!” Those were the ideas that came
              to his desperate mind.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10">U
              Kyaw Din was a very unhappy man then. He could not eat properly. His
              strength waned. He thought he was going to die. He could not adjust
              himself to life around him. So he made a further appeal to his wife.
              But Daw Shwe Yi did not yield. Their neighbors took sympathy for U Kyaw
              Din and pleaded with the wife saying, “Ma Shwe Yi, give your consent
              now or he will surely die. Look at how he had starved himself and how
              run-down he has become – only bone and skin left of the man.” Daw Shwe
              Yi was still adamant. She replied to them, “O, let him die. Death is
              better than separation. I can forget if he was to die but how could I
              live alone seeing him as a total stranger? If I were to give my consent
              I shall be feeling miserable every time I see him.”</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> The
              friends persisted in their well-intentioned advice until the wife had
              to soften her stance. She told them, “Well, I shall give him permission
              for a fortnight or so.” U Kyaw Din then said, “Let it be so. If I did
              not find suited to Bhikkhu-hood, I shall return home at once but if it
              suits me, which depend on my past store of Kamma, let me stay a Bhikkhu
              for as long as my good Kamma holds.”</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10">Even
              then, Daw Shwe Yi had an outstanding task for U Kyaw Din. Their land
              which had been ploughed just recently was waiting the sowing of crops.
              She told him to be so good as sow some peas. “That’s not going to take
              long,” she told him. U Kyaw Din had to oblige. He yoked his pair of
              oxen and went to the fields. Once on the fields, when U Kyaw Din
              mounted the plough and gave his oxen the signal to move, the pair kept
              looking back at him and did not move forward. U Kyaw Din then thought
              thus, “My pair of oxen are usually very obedient. They never needed any
              prodding. Formerly, when ever I mounted the plough, they were always
              very eager to move, as if vying between each other. Now they are
              protesting against me – not wishing me to be working as a plough-man.
              If I were to ignore their protestation, there would be no one more
              stupid than me. Now is the time for me to be firm in my resolve,” so he
              calculated. Bracing himself thus, he dismounted, dissembled the plough,
              took the handling frame in his hand and leaned the plough-shaft against
              a near by tree. Then, unfastening the tether ropes on his bullocks, he
              said; “Now my good help-mates, I set you free. From now onwards you and
              I have parted ways for ever. You may go where ever you wish to go.” He
              then headed towards the monastery of Bhikkhu U Kyauk. On the way, he
              met Daw Tin, who asked him where he was going. He said he was going to
              the monastery to become a SÄ�maÓera (Novice). Daw Tin said, “I’ve got a
              used upper robe. Take it and don’t let Ma Shwe Yi know about it.”
              Taking it, he went and saw Bhikkhu U VÊriya (a) U Kyauk who gave him a
              lower robe and received him into the order of Bhikkhu as a Novice. He
              was named Shin Kavi by the Bhikkhu U VÊriya.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> As
              the Sayadaw U Kavi went forth into Bhikkhu-hood after leaving the
              plough-stock leaning against a nearby tree, he was known as
              “Tun-daung-ko-daw” or the Revered one who left the plough-stock leaning
              against a tree.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> (The
              Sayadaw U Kavi made his wish to become a member of the Order of Bhikkhu
              offering lights at the Pagoda in Tha-ding-gyut (October) 1281 ME and
              his wish was fulfilled on the 5th waning day of Tha-ding-gyut (October)
              1282 ME, just one year after wishing for it.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> Shin
              Kavi lost no time in continuing his meditation practice after becoming
              a SÄ�maÓera. He went alone to Maung Yin Paw ravine and resumed his
              practice. After five days of his joining the Order, he was joined by U
              Shwe Lok as another Novice who came and lived with him. One day, Shin
              Kavi saw a big mushroom by the side of the monastery and pulled it out
              of the earth, when a number of mushroom buds came out along with the
              big mushroom. He took it as a good omen fore-telling his successful
              endeavour, that he was about to free himself from this earthly
              existence which is woeful so he went on orduously with his work.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> (4).
              On Tuesday, on the 13th waning day of Tha-ding-gyut (October) 1282 ME,
              at about 10 pm, he saw a grand covered approach (to a pagoda) and also
              a flying chariot approaching him making a buzzing sound. He did not pay
              attention to it but just get absorbed in his meditation. However, he
              felt himself lifted up in his sitting, his body seeming to lose weight.
              He found that the chariot lay beneath him. Turning around, he saw at
              the four corners Great DevÈ Kings with Sakka, Lord of the DevÈs on the
              right side. He believed that these celestial personages had come to
              protect him as he was on the point of winning Supra-mundane Knowledge.
              Without making a shift in his posture, he remained engaged in his
              meditation. There upon he gained the fourth Supra-mundane Knowledge,
              Arahanta (Fourth Stage).</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10">After
              that he looked around, Sakka and the four Great DevÈ Kings were gone.
              On winning the Fourth Path Knowledge, he could see the whole universe
              with the topmost realm of BrahmÄ� and the nethermost (bottom most) realm
              of AvÊci, realm of continuous suffering. He saw Sakka and the Four
              Great DevÈ Kings announcing to the world in resounding voices that an
              Arahanta has arisen in the human world and were urging every one to go
              and pay their homage to the Noble-one.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10">After
              that, living beings closest to him came into his views. There were
              guardian spirits of the earth, guardian spirits of trees and also DevÈs
              of the celestial realms. An endless stream of resplendent DevÈs coming
              to pay homage to him. He then understood the existence of the three
              worlds that is, the world of Sentient Beings (Satta Loka), the world of
              Volitional Activities (Sa~khÈra Loka) and the world of Physical Base
              (OkÄ�sa Loka). As well as the three kinds of Internal world, the three
              kinds of External world. The world of Sentient Beings (Satta Loka), the
              world of Volitional Activities that condition the life of Beings
              (Sa~khÈra Loka) and the world of Physical Base (OkÄ�sa), he knew as the
              three kinds of External world. The three Internal world are Mind,
              Mental Concomitants and Corporeality he understood as the world of
              Sentient Beings (Satta Loka). The conditioning factors that cause the
              arising and dissolution of Mind, Mental Concomitants and Corporeality
              constitute the second kind of the world of Volitional Activities
              (Sa~khÈra Loka) of the three internal worlds and the Physical Base for
              the two other internal worlds to come into play constitute the third
              kind (OkÄ�sa Loka) of the three internal worlds. Further, he understood
              with discrimination the (Nine) attributes of the Buddha, the (Six)
              attributes of Dhamma and the (Nine) attributes of the SaÑghÄ�.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> Attainment
              of the Four Paths was related by him thus; firstly, he knew this is
              Corporeality (R|pa), this is Mentality (NÄ�ma), this is Mind (Citta),
              these are Mental Concomitants (Cetasika), this is the Truth of

              Woefulness (Magga SaccÄ�), this is Cessation of the Woefulness (Nirodha

              Knowledge) and Arahatta Phala (Fruition of Arahatta Knowledge). He
              reflected on and reviewed each of these Four Stages of his attainment
              and remained in a Blissful state (which is known only to the AriyÄ�s).</p>

              very few existence as a human being. Since his past existences were so
              numerous, he made a wish to see a particular existence that had been

              time of Kassapa Buddha, belonging to the Bhadda-kappa (the present

              <p>Question and Answer for path to Nibbana<br>1.1<br>How do we, in the four stages of Ä�nÄ�pÄ�nasati(mindfulness-of-breathing), decide when to go from one stage to an-other?<br>Answer 1.1<br>The Buddha taught Ä�nÄ�pÄ�nasati step by step: long breath, short breath, whole breath and subtle breath, only for easy understanding. At the time of actual practice, all four stages may occur at the same time. Then, if you can concentrate on the whole long breath, and the whole short breath for about one hour, then (as your concentra-tion improves) the breath will automatically become subtle, and<br>you can change to concentrate on the subtle breath. When the subtle breath is long, you should try to know the whole, long,subtle breath; when the subtle breath is short, you should try to know the whole, short, subtle breath.If the breath does not become subtle by itself, you should concentrate on it (attention(manÄ�sikÄ�ra)) with the decision that it should be subtle.<br>That way it will become subtle, but you must not make the breath subtle on purpose, nor make it long or short on purpose; just decide that it should be calm.<br>In this way, long breath, short breath, whole breath and subtle breath, all the four<br>stages, are included in a single stage. At the early part of the fourth stage, the breath becomes only very subtle. It does not cease entirely. The breath ceases entirely only at the fourth jhÄ�na. This is the subtlest stage</p>

              <p>Question 1.2<br>Is it necessary, in meditation, to have a nimitta?<br>Answer 1.2<br>In some meditation subjects (kammaññhÄ�na) like Ä�nÄ�pÄ�nasati(mindfulness-of-breathing), kasiõa meditation and repulsiveness meditation(asubha), a nimitta is necessary. If one wants to attain jhÄ�na in other meditation subjects, like recollection-of-The-Buddha(BuddhÄ�nussati),animitta is not possible. In lovingkindness meditation (mettÄ� bhÄ�vanÄ�), breaking down the barriers is called the nimitta.</p>
              <p>Question 1.3<br>Some say that while practising Ä�nÄ�pÄ�nasati (mindfulness-of-breathing) their soul goes out of the body. Is that true, or are they on the wrong path?<br>Answer 1.3<br>A concentrated mind can usually create a nimitta. When concentration is deep, strong, and powerful, then because of different perceptions, different nimittas appear. For example, if you want the nimitta to be long, it will be long; if you want it to be short, it will be short; if you want it to be round, it will be round;if you want it to be red, it will be red. So various perceptions may arise while practising Ä�nÄ�pÄ�nasati. You may perceive yourself as outside the body. It is simply a mental creation, not because of a soul. It is not a problem. Just ignore it, and return to being mindful of your breath. Only when you discern ultimate mentality- materiality(paramatthanÄ�ma-rÅ«pa)internally and externally, can you solve the problem of a soul: you will not find a soul anywhere. So, you need to breakdown the compactness of mentality and materiality, and realize ultimate mentality and materiality.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">It
              is because of the perception of compactness, that the perception</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">of
              a soul arises.To break down the compactness of materiality, you must first</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">discern
              the rÅ«pa-kalÄ�pas (small particles). Then you must discern the different types
              of ultimate materiality, which are at least eight</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">in
              each rÅ«pa-kalÄ�pa. Without doing this the perception of a soul will not disappear.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 6pt;">1</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Similarly,
              without breaking down the compactness of mentality,the perception of a soul
              will not disappear. For example, when your mind wanders, you may think that the
              wandering mind is your soul.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">And
              how do you break down the compactness of mentality?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Take,
              for example a mind-door cognitive-process of access concentration</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">that
              has the Ä�nÄ�pÄ�na pañ ibhÄ�ga-nimitta as object.Such a cognitive-process has one
              mind-door adverting-con-sciousness and seven impulsion-consciousnesses</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em><span style="font-size: 10pt;">(javanas) </span></em><span style="font-size: 11pt;">In the</span><em><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> </span></em><span style="font-size: 11pt;">mind-door adverting-consciousness moment
              there are twelve</span><em><span style="font-size: 10pt;"></span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">mental
              formations, and in each impulsion moment there are thirty-four mental
              formations.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">There
              are four types of compactness in such a cognitive process</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">that
              need to be broken down by insight knowledge:</span></p>

              that discerned the cognitive process you have just examined (the mind-door
              cognitive process of access concentration). This means the cognitive process

              CAUSES OR ORIGINS
              Of these eighty-two ultimate things Nibbana, inasmuch as it lies outside the scope of birth (Jati), does not not need any originator for its arising; neither does it need any cause for its maintenance since it also does not come within the range of decay and death (Jara-Marana). Hence Nibbana is unconditioned and unorganized. But, with the exception of Nibbana, the eighty-one phenomena, both mental and material, being within the spheres of birth, decay and death, are conditioned and organized things.
              
              Among the four causes already dealt with in connection with the material qualities, Kamma is merely an originator and Citta (mind) is simply a stimulus. The physical body develops, stands, and is maintained by the power of the warmth element called Utu and by the power of the essence of nutriment. If the forces of the latter two come to an end, the forces of the former two also can no longer operate but cease simultaneously.
              
              In the case of trees, for example, the seeds are only their origins. They grow, develop, and are maintained by means of the elements of earth and water. If these two principles fail them, the power of the seed also fails along with them. Here the physical body is like the tree; Kamma is like the seed; the warmth-element, or what is called Utu is like the earth; the nutritive essence is like the rain-water, which falls regularly at proper seasons; and mind is like the atmosphere and the heat of the sun, both of which give support from outside.
              
              With regard to the causes of mind and mental properties, three things are needed for the arising of Resultants; a past kamma, a basis to depend upon, and an object. The first is like the seed of the tree, the basis is like the earth, and the object is like the rain- water.
              
              Two things are necessary for the arising of each of the mental phenomena of the Morals, the Immorals and the Ineffectives, :- a basis to depend upon, and an object. However, to be more detailed, full rational exercise of mind (yonisomanasikara) is needed for the Morals, and defective irrational exercise of mind (ayoniso-manasikara) for the Immorals. The Ineffectiveness which have apperceptional functions have the same causes as the Morals. As for the two classes of consciousness called "Turning towards", if they precede the Morals, they have the same causes as the Morals and if they precede the Immorals they have the same causes as the Immorals. Here yoniso-manasikara means proper exercise of reason, and ayoniso-manasikara means improper exercise of reason. These are the functions of the two classes of consciousness called Avajjana, "Turning towards." On seeing a man, if the manasikara be rationally utilized, moral consciousness arises; and if the manasikara be irrationally utilized, immoral consciousness arises. There is no particular object which purely of itself will cause to arise only a moral consciousness, or only an immoral consciousness. The process of the mind may be compared to a boat of which the Avajjana-citta or "Turning-towards-thought" is the helmsman, so also the occurrence of the moral and the immoral consciousness lies entirely in the hands of Avajana.
              
              What the seed is to the tree, that the Manasikara is to the Morals and the Immorals. What the earth is to a tree, that their "Basis" is to the Morals and Immorals. While what the rain-water is to a tree, that their "object" is to the Morals and Immorals.
              
              We will now set forth the causes in another way.
              
              Each of the six classes of consciousness has four causes. For the arising of the consciousness of sight there is needed Cakkhu-vatthu, Ruparammana, Aloka and Manasikara. Of these, Manasikara is the name of the Avajjana-citta which turns the process of mind in the direction of the object of sight. Aloka means light. Unless there is light, the function of seeing will not take place, nor the process of cognition. Cakkhu-vatthu means eye-basis; and Ruparammana means object of sight, literally, form-object.
              
              For the arising of the consciousness of Sound, there is needed Sota-vatthu (ear-basis) Sadda-rammana (object of sound), Akasa and Manasikara. Here Akasa means the space through which sound is communicated to the ear. The function of hearing can take place only when it is present; the process of ear-door cognitions also occurs only when hearing takes place.
              
              For the arising of the consciousness of smell, there is needed Ghana-vatthu (nose basis), Gandharammana (object of smell), Vata and Manasikara. Here Vata means the air in the nose or the inhaled air. If this is not present, odours cannot come into contact with the nose-basis, and consequently the function of smelling and the nose-door cognitions cannot take place.
              
              For the arising of the consciousness of taste, there is needed Jivha-vatthu (tongue-basis), Rasarammana (object of taste), Apa and Manasakira. Here Apa means wetness of the tongue. If the tongue is dry, the savour or sapidity cannot come into contact with the tongue-basis, and consequently the function of tasting and the tongue-door cognitions cannot take place.
              
              For the arising of the consciousness of touch, there is needed Kaya-vatthu (body basis), Photthabbarammana (object of touch), Thaddha and Manasikara. Here Thaddha means the quality of the object of touch, i.e., the degree of coarseness of it. Only a some- what coarse touch can make an impression upon the body-basis. If the object of touch is too subtle, it cannot impinge upon the body-basis. And unless there is impingement, neither consciousness of touch nor the body-door, cognitions can arise.
              
              For the arising of the consciousness of mind, there is needed Hadaya-vatthu (heart-basis), Dhammarammana (object of thought) Manodvara (mind-door), and Manasikara. Of these, Dhammarammana means all objects comprising all material qualities other than the five-fold objects, all mental qualities, all ideas, and Nibbana. As a matter of fact, the five-fold objects (form, sound, smell, taste and touch) are also the objects of consciousness of mind, but in order to set forth what is not related to the five doors, or five senses, only thought-objects are mentioned here. Mano-dvara or mind-door means the continuum of sub-consciousness. Though the heart- basis is the place where consciousness of mind arises, since it does not possess the appropriate kind of sensuous organs, the impressions of objects cannot appear in it, hence they have to appear in the mind-door only.
