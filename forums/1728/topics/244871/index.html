James Chapter 1 v 1 - I think- not sure<br><br>"Seek and ye will find, ask and it shall be given unto you."<br><br>I've been through this personally and can understand what you are going through.<br>I would suggest you spend some quiet time on your own to do some serious soul-searching. Straighten yourself out. Find out exactly what it is that's gnawing you from within. At the same time, gain a netter appreciation of yourself, your strengths and our weaknesses. Then turn to prayer earnestly to ask God to grant you His spirit to guide you to the answers that you seek. Listen to the still small voice prompting you......<br><br>The answers may not come in an instant but over time. Exercise some patience and be steadfast in your quest for His guidance and wisdom.

It could be one complicated matters. Find a friend to talk about your problems ? Or taking a break out of everythings and coming back to it later.<br><br>If it is really a negative issue.. How about learning to let go of holding on this issue?<br><br>"Holding on to the past is like carrying a burden n trying to walk across a dangling bridge"<br><br>Why carry it so tightly if it is creating so much suffering?<br><br></div>

I would certainly keep an open mind, and found out more about what I want to find out... since you posted in the Buddhist forum I presume you like to find out about Buddhism... if you do, go ahead.. find out what Buddhism is about with an open mind.<br><br><blockquote>Kalama Sutra<br><br>"Rely not on the teacher/person, but on the teaching. Rely not on the words of the teaching, but on the<br>spirit of the words. Rely not on theory, but on experience.Do not believe in anything simply because you<br>have heard it. Do not believe in traditions because they have been handed down for many generations. Do<br>not believe anything because it is spoken and rumored by many. Do not believe in anything because it is<br>written in your religious books. Do not believe in anything merely on the authority of your teachers and<br>elders.
