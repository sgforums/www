            <div class='col-md body'>Most people when find themselves in a difficult situation, would naturally start to think of all possible negative outcomes which may or may not come true. As one grows older in life, there are bound to be more such harsh situations. Here is when the Dharma comes into play; it helps us to face reality, see it clearly, take it on, let it go and move on. Easily said than done? No. Unless we are pessimistic or see Reality as our enemy.<br><br>So, if we are the types that the mind tends to take a life of its own and run wild with negatives thoughts( which is not uncommon, that is why most of us must practice harder <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> ), my DIY solution is to prepare ourselves mentally and physically with the worst scenerio that may come in the situation we are in now, then when it finally come, we are all ready and will be in a better position to shoulder the outcome or even better still, solve it. Once the preparation and decision are made, leave it aside and give the best we can offer in our job or study and carry on as usual with our life, meaningfully ( by doing more good deeds or study and practise the Dharma, yeah, chanting also).<br><br>If we see life as unfair to us whenever a undesirable ( as we percieved to be) outcome hit us, then we have forgotten the law of cause and effect. It is exactly the law of cause and effect that we encountered situations in life, and it is through the law of cause and effect that we can change the situation and/or take it on bravely.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well lets go to the worst case scenario , so worst at the worst you just have to look for another new job and carry on . I personally frankly speaking not afraid you pple laffing at me had been sacked , told to resign , forced to resign , injured so have to resign to recuperate , kana sickness so have to resign to recuperate etc and now is still looking for a better and sincerely wish that will be a permanent job to end my job hopping . Most of the time pple just shoot at me say must be my fault but i myself know some of them i admit but the most not my fault at all . Even though i now have to pop pills everyday to prevent my sickness from recurring still i can't put it in my resume nor admit i got sickness . So my friend no matter how bad our situation is , we die die have to carry on with our life . No matter how bad our resume seem to be . I myself work in more then 8 companies on and off but in my resume i only put 3 . Not that i encourage pple to lie but this is real life we have to be practical to save ourself .</div>
