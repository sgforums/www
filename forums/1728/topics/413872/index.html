              <p>Event : Holiness Sakya Trizin Lamdre Teaching<br>Date : June 1 - June 30, 2011<br>Venue : Tsechen Kunchab Ling, 12 Edmunds Lane, Walden, New York 12586<br>Website : <a href="http://www.sakyatemple.org/activities_lamdre_main.php">http://www.sakyatemple.org/activities_lamdre_main.php</a></p>
              <p>Students of His Holiness the Sakya Trizin throughout the world are eagerly anticipating His Holiness’ western hemisphere teaching tour and period of residence at Tsechen Kunchab Ling during the summer of 2011.<br><br>The highlight of His Holiness' visit the the western hemisphere will be the Precious Lam Dre Teaching Cycle at Tsechen Kunchab Ling in the month of June. Receiving the Lam Dre teaching cycle from His Holiness the Sakya Trizin at Tsechen Kunchab Ling is a wonderful life-changing event, and a golden opportunity not to be missed. We hope you will be able to join us!<br><br>The Lam Dre or Path Including the Result is the most important and esoteric teaching cycle of the Sakya Order of Tibetan Buddhism. The teachings and meditations in the month-long cycle explicate the entire path to Buddhahood in two parts. The first part is the Triple Vision, composed of pith instructions and meditations from the sutras. The second part is the Triple Tantra, composed of pith instructions and meditations from the tantras. The Triple Vision is a prerequisite for the Triple Tantra.<br><br>The Lam Dre teaching is based on the Hevajra tantra and includes the Hevajra major initiation. It originated in ancient India with the Indian scholar and mahasiddha Virupa, who was abbot of Nalanda University. He received initiation and pith instructions directly from the tutelary deity Vajra Naitratmya, quickly attained very high realization, and demonstrated great spiritual powers and miracles, such as power over the elements and being unaffected by punishment or poison.<br><br>The teachings which Virupa bestowed to his disciples became known as the Lam Dre teaching, and four generations later it was transmitted to Tibet. There, Sachen Kunga Nyingpo, the first of the five founders of the Sakya Order, received and mastered these teachings, and later, due to his high realization he received it again directly from Mahasiddha Virupa himself. Since that time, the Lam Dre has been the special practice of the Sakya Order. It is a unique integration of philosophical explanation and meditation practice. Special explanation lineages of the Lam Dre teaching have developed within the Ngor and Tsar subschools of the Sakya Order.<br><br>The opportunity to receive the Lam Dre teaching in North America is rare; the last time it was given on this continent was in 2001. The summer 2011 Lam Dre teaching will be particularly special. Each day, His Holiness Sakya Trizin will bestow the teaching. Each afternoon, His Eminence Ratna Vajra Rinpoche, who is His Holiness the Sakya Trizin’s elder son, an experienced Lam Dre master, and a well-known lineage holder will guide meditation sessions. The opportunity to receive these teachings directly from them is a life-time blessing. For intelligent people desiring to learn the authentic Dharma from living masters, there is no better chance than this.<br><br>Lamdre at Tsechen Kunchab Ling June 1 - June 30, 2011<br><br>Read more at : <a href="http://www.sakyatemple.org/activities_lamdre_main.php">http://www.sakyatemple.org/activities_lamdre_main.php</a></p>
