              <p>Comments by AEN: the following article states the three stages of 
              experience the practitioner goes through during his practice (1: 
              relaxing mind and body, 2: the Great Self, 3: No Self). It also 
              distinguishes the I AM and One Mind stage (stage one to four) from the 
              experience of No Mind (stage five) as described by Thusness/PasserBy in <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">Thusness's Seven Stages of Experience</a><br> <br> An few important excerpts by Master Sheng Yen:<br> <br> <span style="font-style: italic;">...By the practise of Ch’an one can 
              eliminate the ‘I’; not only  the selfish, small ‘I’, but also the large 
              ‘I’, which in philosophy is called  ‘Truth’ or ‘the Essence’. Only then 
              is there absolute freedom...</span><br></p>
              <p><em>...When you are in the second stage, although you feel that      
                                 the ‘I’ does not exist, the basic substance of the 
              universe, or the                         Supreme Truth, still exists. 
              Although you recognise that all the                         different 
              phenomena are the extension of this basic substance or                  
                     Supreme Truth, yet there still exists the opposition of basic    
                                   substance versus external phenomena...</em></p>
              <p><em> ... One who has entered Ch’an does not see basic                       
                substance and phenomena as two things standing in opposition to       
                                each other. They cannot even be illustrated as being 
              the back and                         palm of a hand. This is because 
              phenomena themselves are basic                         substance, and 
              apart from phenomena there is no basic substance to                     
                  be found. The reality of basic substance exists right in the        
                               unreality of phenomena, which change ceaselessly and 
              have no                         constant form. This is the Truth...</em></p>

              <h2>A lecture by Master Sheng-yen (1977)</h2>
              <p><em>In
               1977 Shi-fu was at the very beginning of his teaching  career in 
              America. He was invited to give talks in various places and these were  
              admirably translated. In this talk the crisp vision of Ch’an that Shi-fu
               was  bringing from China and from the Japan of his final training is 
              clear for all to  see. As we set about creating a Ch’an suitable for 
              Europe this lecture has  striking and helpful cogency. It was published 
              in a small pamphlet of which  probably only a few remain. Tim Paine was 
              rummaging through the library at  Maenllwyd when he came across it and 
              spotted its excellence. It was in fact one  of the inspirations for 
              John’s first visits to the New York Ch’an Centre. We are  glad Tim 
              uncovered it again and we trust our readers will find it equally  
              inspiring. Shi-fu permits us to reproduce it here. Eds. </em></p>
              <p>I
               wish to start by telling you that Ch’an is not the same as  knowledge, 
              yet knowledge is not completely apart from Ch’an. Ch’an is not just  
              religion, yet the achievements of religion can be reached through Ch’an.
               Ch’an  is not philosophy, yet philosophy can in no way exceed the scope
               of Ch’an. Ch’an  is not science, yet the spirit of emphasising reality 
              and experience is also  required in Ch’an. Therefore, please do not try 
              to explore the content of Ch’an  motivated by mere curiosity, for Ch’an 
              is not something new brought here [to the  USA] by Orientals; Ch’an is 
              present everywhere, in space without limit and time  without end. 
              However before the Buddhism of the East was propagated in the  western 
              world, the people of the West never knew of the existence of Ch’an. The 
               Ch’an taught by Orientals in the West is not, in fact, the real Ch’an. 
              It is the  method to realise Ch’an. Ch’an was first discovered by a 
              prince named Siddhartha  Gautama (called Shakyamuni after his 
              enlightenment), who was born in India about  2500 years ago. After he 
              became enlightened and was called a Buddha, he taught  us the method to 
              know Ch’an. This method was transmitted from India to China,  and then 
              to Japan. In India it was called dhyana, which is pronounced ‘Ch’an’ in 
               Chinese, and ‘Zen’ in Japanese. Actually, all three are identical.</p>
              <p>Ch’an
               has universal and eternal existence. It has no need of  any teacher to 
              transmit it; what is transmitted by teachers is just the method  by 
              which one can personally experience this Ch’an.</p>
              <p>Some
               people mistakenly understand Ch’an to be some kind of  mysterious 
              experience; others think that one can attain supernatural powers  
              through the experience of Ch’an. Of course, the process of practising 
              Ch’an  meditation may cause various kinds of strange occurrences on the 
              level of mental  and physical sensation; and also, through the practice 
              of unifying body and  mind, one may be able to attain the mental power 
              to control or alter external  things. But such phenomena, which are 
              looked upon as mysteries of religion, are  not the aim of Ch’an 
              practice, because they can only satisfy one’s curiosity or  megalomania,
               and cannot solve the actual problems of peoples lives.</p>
              <p>Ch’an
               starts from the root of the problem. It does not start  with the idea 
              of conquering the external social and material environments, but  starts
               with gaining thorough knowledge of one’s own self. The moment you know 
               what your self is, this ‘I’ that you now take to be yourself will 
              simultaneously  disappear. We call this new knowledge of the notion of 
              self ‘enlightenment’ or  ‘seeing ones basic nature’. This is the 
              beginning of helping you to thoroughly  solve real problems. In the end,
               you will discover that you the individual,  together with the whole of 
              existence, are but one totality which cannot be  divided.</p>
              <p>Because
               you yourself have imperfections, you therefore feel the  environment is
               imperfect. It is like a mirror with an uneven surface, the images  
              reflected in it are also distorted. Or, it is like the surface of water 
               disturbed by ripples, the moon reflected in it is irregular and 
              unsettled. If  the surface of the mirror is clear and smooth, or if the 
              air on the surface of  the water is still and the ripples calmed, then 
              the reflection in the mirror and  the moon in the water will be clear 
              and exact. Therefore, from the point of view  of Ch’an, the major cause 
              of the pain and misfortune suffered by humanity is not  the treacherous 
              environment of the world in which we live, nor the dreadful  society of 
              humankind, but the fact that we have never been able to recognise our  
              basic nature. So the method of Ch’an is not to direct us to evade 
              reality, nor  to shut our eyes like the African ostrich when enemies 
              come, and bury our heads  in the sand, thinking all problems are solved.
               Ch’an is not a self-hypnotising  idealism.</p>
              <p>By 
              the practise of Ch’an one can eliminate the ‘I’; not only  the selfish, 
              small ‘I’, but also the large ‘I’, which in philosophy is called  
              ‘Truth’ or ‘the Essence’. Only then is there absolute freedom. Thus an  
              accomplished Ch’an practitioner never feels that any responsibility is a
               burden,  nor does he feel the pressure that the conditions of life 
              exert on people. He  only feels that he is perpetually bringing the 
              vitality of life into full  activity. This is the expression of absolute
               freedom. Therefore the life of  Ch’an is inevitably normal and 
              positive, happy and open. The reason for this is  that the practise of 
              Ch’an will continually provide you with a means to excavate  your 
              precious mine of wisdom. The deeper the excavation, the higher the 
              wisdom  that is attained, until eventually you obtain all the wisdom of 
              the entire  universe. At that time, there is not a single thing in all 
              of time and space  that is not contained within the scope of your 
              wisdom. At that stage wisdom  becomes absolute; and since it is 
              absolute, the term wisdom serves no further  purpose. To be sure, at 
              that stage the ‘I’ that motivated you to pursue such  things as fame, 
              wealth and power, or to escape from suffering and danger, has  
              completely disappeared. What is more, even the wisdom which eliminated 
              your ‘I’  becomes an unnecessary concept to you.</p>
              <p>Of
               course, from the viewpoint of sudden enlightenment it is  very easy for
               a Ch’an practitioner to reach this stage; nevertheless before  reaching
               the gate of sudden enlightenment one must exert a great deal of effort 
               on the journey. Otherwise the methods of Ch’an would be useless.</p>
              <h2>The Three Stages of Ch’an Meditation</h2>
              <p>At present [1977], the methods of meditation that I am teaching  in the United States are divided into three stages.</p>
              <h3>Stage 1: To balance the development of body and mind in order to  attain mental and physical health</h3>
              <p>With
               regard to the body, we stress the demonstration and  correction of the 
              postures of walking, standing, sitting and reclining. At the  same time 
              we teach various methods of physical exercise for walking, standing,  
              sitting and reclining. They are unique exercise methods combining Indian
               Hatha  Yoga and Chinese Tao-yin, and can bring physical health as well 
              as results in  meditation. Thus, one who practises Ch’an and has 
              obtained good results will  definitely have a strong body capable of 
              enduring hardship. For the mind we  emphasise the elimination of 
              impatience, suspicion, anxiety, fear and  frustration, so as to 
              establish a state of self-confidence, determination,  optimism, peace 
              and stability.</p>
              <p>A good student, after five or ten 
              lessons here, will reach the  first stage and be able to obtain results 
              in the above two areas. One of our  student’s reports stated: “This kind
               of Ch’an class is especially good for  someone like myself who, by 
              profession or habit, has been used to having the  brain functioning just
               about every minute of the day. I often find this Ch’an  sitting very 
              helpful as rest or relief. So even for no greater purpose, this  Ch’an 
              class has been very useful and should be highly recommended.” [from 
              Ch’an  Magazine Vol.1; No.1]</p>
              <p>In the first lesson 
              of each class, I always ask each of the  students individually his or 
              her purpose in learning Ch’an whether he or she  hoped to benefit the 
              body, or sought help for the mind. The answers show that  the latter 
              were in the majority. This indicates that people living in American  
              society today, under the strain and pressure of the present environment,
               suffer  excessive tension, and many have lost their mental balance. 
              Some are so severely  tense that they have to consult a psychiatrist. 
              Among those who come to learn  Ch’an, I have one woman student, an 
              outstanding lecturer in a well-known  university, who asked me at the 
              first meeting if I could help to relieve her  from tense and uneasy 
              moods. I told her that for a Ch’an practitioner this is a  very simple 
              matter. After five lessons she felt that Ch’an was a great blessing  to 
              her life.</p>
              <p>The method of the first stage is very 
              simple. Mainly it  requires you to relax all the muscles and nerves of 
              your entire body, and  concentrate your attention on the method you have
               just learned. Because the  tension of your muscles and nerves affects 
              the activity of the brain, the key is  therefore to reduce the burden on
               your brain. When your wandering thoughts and  illusions decrease, your 
              brain will gradually get a little rest. As its need of  blood is 
              reduced, more blood will circulate through the entire body. Meanwhile,  
              because of the relaxation of the brain, all the muscles also relax; thus
               your  blood vessels expand, you feel comfortable all over, your spirit 
              feels fresh and  alert, and your mental responses are naturally lighter 
              and more lively.</p>
              <p>If one’s object of study is just
               to acquire physical and mental  balance, and not to study meditation 
              proper, then one will probably feel that  the completion of the first 
              stage is enough; but many students are not content  with this, and 
              indeed, some from the outset are looking for the goal of the  second 
              stage.</p>
              <h3>Stage 2: From the sense of the small ‘I’</h3>
              <p>The
               first stage only helps to bring concentration to your  confused mind; 
              but when you practise concentration, other scattered thoughts  continue 
              to appear in your mind - sometimes many, sometimes a few. The concept  
              of your purpose in practising Ch’an is for mental and physical benefits.
               This is  a stage where your concept is purely self-centred. There is no
               mention of  philosophical ideals or religious experience. When you 
              reach the second stage,  it will enable you to liberate yourself from 
              the narrow view of the ‘I’. In the  second stage you begin to enter the 
              stage of meditation. When you practise the  method of cultivation taught
               by your teacher, you will enlarge the sphere of the  outlook of the 
              small ‘I’ until it coincides with time and space. The small ‘I’  merges 
              into the entire universe, forming a unity. When you look inward, the  
              depth is limitless; when you look outward, the breadth is limitless. 
              Since you  have joined and become one with universe, the world of your 
              own body and mind no  longer exists. What exists is the universe, which 
              is infinite in depth and  breadth. You yourself are not only a part of 
              the universe, but also the totality  of it.</p>
              <p>When 
              you achieve this experience in your Ch’an sitting, you  will then 
              understand what is meant in philosophy by principle or basic  substance,
               and also what phenomenal existence is. All phenomena are the floating  
              surface or perceptible layer of basic substance. From the shallow point 
              of view,  the phenomena have innumerable distinctions and each has 
              different  characteristics; in reality, the differences between the 
              phenomena do not impair  the totality of basic substance. For instance, 
              on the planet on which we live,  there are countless kinds of animals, 
              plants, minerals, vapours, liquids and  solids which incessantly arise, 
              change and perish, constituting the phenomena of  the earth. However, 
              seen from another planet, the earth is just one body. When  we have the 
              opportunity to free ourselves from the bonds of self or subjective  
              views, to assume the objective standpoint of the whole and observe all 
              phenomena  together, we can eliminate opposing and contradictory views. 
              Take a tree as an  example. From the standpoint of the individual leaves
               and branches, they are all  distinct from one another, and can also be 
              perceived to rub against one another.  However, from the standpoint of 
              the trunk and roots, all parts without exception  are of one unified 
              whole.</p>
              <p>In the course of this second stage, you 
              have realised that you  not only have an independent individual 
              existence, but you also have a universal  existence together with this 
              limitlessly deep and wide cosmos, and therefore the  confrontation 
              between you and the surrounding environment exists no more.  Discontent,
               hatred, love, desire - in other words dispositions of rejecting and  
              grasping disappear naturally, and you sense a feeling of peace and 
              satisfaction.  Because you have eliminated the selfish small ‘I’, you 
              are able to look upon all  people and all things as if they were 
              phenomena produced from your own  substance, and so you will love all 
              people and all things in the same way you  loved and watched over your 
              small ‘I’. This is the mind of a great philosopher.</p>
              <p>Naturally,
               all great religious figures must have gone through  the experiences of 
              this second stage, where they free themselves from the  confines of the 
              small ‘I’, and discover that their own basic substance is none  other 
              than the existence of the entire universe, and that there is no 
              difference  between themselves and everything in the universe. All 
              phenomena are  manifestations of their own nature. They have the duty to
               love and watch over  all things, and also have the right to manage 
              them; just as we have the duty to  love our own children and the right 
              to manage the property that belongs to us  This is the formation of the 
              relationship between the deity and the multitude of  things he created. 
              Such people personify the basic substance of the universe  which they 
              experience through meditation, and create the belief in God. They  
              substantiate this idea of a large ‘I’ the self-love of God and formulate
               the  mission of being a saviour of the world or an emissary of God. 
              They unify all  phenomena and look upon them as objects that were 
              created and are to be saved.  Consequently, some religious figures think
               that the basic nature of their souls  is the same as that of the deity,
               and that they are human incarnations of the  deity. In this way, they 
              consider themselves to be saviours of the world. Others  think that 
              although the basic nature of their souls is not identical to and  
              inseparable from that of the deity, the phenomenon of their incarnation 
              shows  that they were sent to this world by God as messengers to 
              promulgate God’s  intention.</p>
              <p>Generally, when 
              philosophers or religious figures reach the  height of the second stage,
               they feel that their wisdom is unlimited, their  power is infinite, and
               their lives are eternal. When the scope of the ‘I’  enlarges, 
              self-confidence accordingly gets stronger, but this stronger  
              self-confidence is in fact merely the unlimited escalation of a sense of
                superiority and pride. It is therefore termed large ‘I’, and does not 
              mean that  absolute freedom from vexations has been achieved.</p>
              <h3>Stage 3: From the large ‘I’ to no ‘I’</h3>
              <p>When
               one reaches the height of the second stage, he realises  that the 
              concept of the ‘I’ does not exist. But he has only abandoned the small  
              ‘I’ and has not negated the concept of basic substance or the existence 
              of God;  you may call it Truth, the one and only God, the Almighty, the 
              Unchanging  Principle, or even the Buddha of Buddhism. If you think that
               it is real, then  you are still in the realm of the big ‘I’ and have 
              not left the sphere of  philosophy and religion.</p>
              <p>I
               must emphasise that the content of Ch’an does not appear  until the 
              third stage. Ch’an is unimaginable. It is neither a concept nor a  
              feeling. It is impossible to describe it in any terms abstract or 
              concrete.  Though meditation is ordinarily the proper path leading to 
              Ch’an, once you have  arrived at the door of Ch’an, even the method of 
              meditation is rendered useless.  It is like using various means of 
              transportation on a long journey. When you  reach the final destination,
               you find a steep cliff standing right in front of  you. It is so high 
              you cannot see its top, and so wide that its side cannot be  found. At 
              this time a person who has been to the other side of the cliff comes  to
               tell you that on the other side lies the world of Ch’an. When you scale
               it  you will enter Ch’an. And yet, he tells you not to depend on any 
              means of  transportation to fly over, bypass, or penetrate through it, 
              because it is  infinity itself, and there is no way to scale it.</p>
              <p>Even
               an outstanding Ch’an master able to bring his student to  this place 
              will find himself unable to help any more. Although he has been to  the 
              other side, he cannot take you there with him, just as a mother’s own 
              eating  and drinking cannot take the hunger away from the child who 
              refuses to eat or  drink. At that time, the only help he can give you is
               to tell you to discard all  your experiences, your knowledge, and all 
              the things and ideas that you think  are the most reliable, most 
              magnificent, and most real, even including your hope  to get to the 
              world of Ch’an. It is as if you were entering a sacred building.  Before
               you do so, the guard tells you that you must not carry any weapon, that
                you must take off all your clothes, and that not only must you be 
              completely  naked you also have to leave your body and soul behind. Then
               you can enter.</p>
              <p>Because Ch’an is a world where 
              there is no self, if there is  still any attachment at all in your mind,
               there is no way you can harmonise with  Ch’an. Therefore, Ch’an is the 
              territory of the wise, and the territory of the  brave. Not being wise, 
              one would not believe that after he has abandoned all  attachments 
              another world could appear before him. Not being brave, one would  find 
              it very hard to discard everything he has accumulated in this life - 
              ideals  and knowledge, spiritual and material things.</p>
              <p>You
               may ask what benefit we would get after making such great  sacrifices 
              to enter the world of Ch’an. Let me tell you that you cannot enter  the 
              world of Ch’an while this question is still with you. Looking for 
              benefit,  either for self or for others, is in the ‘I’-oriented stage. 
              The sixth patriarch  of the Ch’an sect in China taught people that the 
              way to enter the enlightenment  of the realm of Ch’an is: “Neither think
               of good, nor think of evil”. That is,  you eliminate such opposing 
              views as self and other, inner and outer, being and  non-being, large 
              and small, good and bad, vexation and Bodhi, illusion and  
              enlightenment, false and true, or suffering of birth and death and joy 
              of  emancipation. Only then can the realm of Ch’an or enlightenment 
              appear and bring  you a new life.</p>
              <p>This new life 
              you have had all along, and yet you have never  discovered it. In the 
              Ch’an sect we call it your original face before you were  born. This is 
              not the small ‘I’ of body and mind, nor the large ‘I’ of the world  and 
              universe. This is absolute freedom, free from the misery of all 
              vexations  and bonds. To enter Ch’an as described above is not easy. 
              Many people have  studied and meditated for decades, and still have 
              never gained entrance to the  door of Ch’an. It will not be difficult, 
              however, when your causes and  conditions are mature, or if you happen 
              to have a good Ch’an master who guides  you with full attention. This 
              Master may adopt various attitudes, actions and  verbal expressions 
              which may seem ridiculous to you, as indirect means of  assisting you to
               achieve your goal speedily. And when the Master tells you that  you 
              have now entered the gate, you will suddenly realise that there is no 
              gate  to Ch’an. Before entering, you cannot see where the gate is, and 
              after entering  you find the gate non-existent. Otherwise there will be 
              the distinction between  inside and outside, the enlightened and the 
              ignorant; and if there are such  distinctions, then it is still not 
              Ch’an.</p>
              <p>When you are in the second stage, although
               you feel that the  ‘I’ does not exist, the basic substance of the 
              universe, or the Supreme Truth,  still exists. Although you recognise 
              that all the different phenomena are the  extension of this basic 
              substance or Supreme Truth, yet there still exists the  opposition of 
              basic substance versus external phenomena. Not until the  distinctions 
              of all phenomena disappear, and everything goes back to truth or  
              Heaven, will you have absolute peace and unity. As long as the world of 
               phenomena is still active, you cannot do away with conflict, calamity, 
              suffering  and crime. Therefore, although philosophers and religious 
              figures perceive the  peace of the original substance, they still have 
              no way to get rid of the  confusion of phenomena.</p>
              <p>One
               who has entered Ch’an does not see basic substance and  phenomena as 
              two things standing in opposition to each other. They cannot even  be 
              illustrated as being the back and palm of a hand. This is because 
              phenomena  themselves are basic substance, and apart from phenomena 
              there is no basic  substance to be found. The reality of basic substance
               exists right in the  unreality of phenomena, which change ceaselessly 
              and have no constant form. This  is the Truth. When you experience that 
              phenomena are unreal, you will then be  free from the concept of self 
              and other, right and wrong, and free from the  vexations of greed, 
              hatred, worry and pride. You will not need to search for  peace and 
              purity, and you will not need to detest evil vexations and impurity.  
              Although you live in the world of phenomenal reality, to you, any 
              environment is  a Buddha’s Pure Land. To an unenlightened person, you 
              are but an ordinary  person. To you, all ordinary people are identical 
              with Buddha. You will feel  that your own self-nature is the same as 
              that of all Buddhas, and the  self-nature of Buddhas is universal 
              throughout time and space. You will  spontaneously apply your wisdom and
               wealth, giving to all sentient beings  everywhere, throughout all time 
              and space.</p>
              <p>What I have said reveals a small part 
              of the feeling of one who  has entered the enlightened realm of Ch’an, 
              and is also the course which one  follows in order to depart from the 
              small ‘I’ and arrive at the stage of no ‘I’.  Nevertheless, a newly 
              enlightened person who has just entered the realm of Ch’an  is still at 
              the starting section of the entire passage of Ch’an. He is like one  who
               has just had his first sip of port. He knows its taste now, but the 
              wine  will not remain in his mouth forever. The purpose of Ch’an is not 
              just to let  you take one sip, but to have your entire life merge with 
              and dissolve in the  wine, even, to the point that you forget the 
              existence of yourself and the wine.  After tasting the first sip of 
              egolessness, how much farther must one travel?</p>
              <p>What kinds of things remain to be seen?</p>
              <p>I will tell you when I have the chance!</p>

              <p><strong>A Brief Personal History</strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: normal;">My questioning of life, the 
                  universe and what it is to be a
                  human being had all started in a war-torn country in June 1966 at age 
                  nineteen – when there was an identity inhabiting this body
                  complete with a full suite of feelings – and a Buddhist monk killed 
                  himself in a most gruesome way. There was I, a callow youth
                  dressed in a jungle-green uniform and with a loaded rifle in my hand, 
                  representing the secular way to peace. There was a fellow
                  human being, dressed in religious robes dowsed with petrol and with a 
                  cigarette lighter in hand, representing the spiritual way to
                  peace.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 5px;"><span style="font-size: normal;">I was aghast at what we were both doing ... and I sought to find a third alternative to being either ‘human’
                  or ‘divine’.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 5px;"><span style="font-size: normal;">This was to be the turning point 
                  of my life, for up until then, I was a typical western youth, raised to
                  believe in God, Queen and Country. Humanity’s inhumanity to humanity – 
                  society’s treatment of its subject citizens – was
                  driven home to me, there and then, in a way that left me appalled, 
                  horrified, terrified and repulsed to the core of my being with
                  a sick revulsion. I saw that no one knew what was going on and – most 
                  importantly – that no one was ‘in charge’ of the
                  world. There was nobody to ‘save’ the human race ... all gods were but a
                   figment of a feverish imagination. Out of a
                  despairing desperation, which was collectively shared by my fellow 
                  humans, I saw and understood that I was as ‘guilty’ as any
                  one else. For in me – as is in everyone – was both ‘good’ and ‘bad’ ... 
                  it was that some people were better than
                  others at controlling their ‘dark side’. However, in a war, there is no 
                  way anyone can consistently control any longer ... ‘evil’
                  ran rampart. I saw that fear and aggression and nurture and desire ruled
                   the world ... and that these were instincts one was born
                  with. Thus started my search for freedom from the ‘Human Condition’ ... 
                  and my attitude, all those years ago was this:</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 5px;"><span style="font-size: normal;">I was only interested in changing myself fundamentally, radically, completely and utterly.</span></p>

              <p style="margin: 5px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 5px;">For many years I sought genuine exploration and 
                              discovery of what it means to live a fully human life, and in
                              October 1992 I discovered, once and for all, what I was looking for. 
                              Since then I have been consistently living an incomparable
                              condition which I choose to call actual freedom – and I use the word 
                              ‘actual’ because this freedom is located here in this
                              very world, this actual world of the senses. It is not an affective, 
                              cerebral or psychic state of being; it is a physical
                              condition that ensues when one goes beyond Spiritual Enlightenment. In 
                              September 1981 I underwent a monumental transformation into
                              an Altered State Of Consciousness which can only be described as 
                              Spiritual Enlightenment.  I became Enlightened as the result of an earnest and intense process which commenced
                              in the January of that year. At approximately six o’clock on the morning of Sunday the sixth of September 1981, my ‘ego’
                              disappeared entirely in an edifying moment of awakening to an ‘Absolute Reality’. I lived in the Enlightened State for eleven
                              years, so I have an intimate understanding of the marked difference between Spiritual Enlightenment and actual freedom.</p>
              <p style="margin: 5px;">I travelled the country – and overseas to India –
                               meeting with people from all walks of life in an
                              attempt to discover why Spiritual Enlightenment, which has been within 
                              the human experience for thousands of years, had not
                              delivered the Peace On Earth it seemed to promise. As the process of 
                              becoming Enlightened is an extreme test of one’s mettle,
                              requiring nerves of steel, it seemed that only a rare few humans were 
                              destined to become Self-Realised. The question that
                              commanded my attention was why this was so. I was looking beyond the 
                              superficial and questioning even the most closely held ideas
                              and beliefs. Was there something more to discover ... something that lay
                               beyond Enlightenment that would usher in the beginning of
                              a genuine possibility of peace for all? Some Masters hinted at and 
                              alluded to ‘Going Beyond Enlightenment’ ... yet their
                              Teachings remained exactly the same. Some disciplines suggested that 
                              such a condition existed after physical death: when the soul
                              ‘quit the body’. The Hindu Mahasamadhi and Buddhist Parinirvana are two 
                              examples of this kind of thought.</p>
              <p style="margin: 5px;">Over the eleven years I had numerous experiences of a condition that seemed so extreme that one must surely
                              die to attain to it.<span style="font-size: xx-small;"><em>  </em></span>To
                              go
                               beyond Enlightenment seemed to be an impossibility whilst still alive 
                              and breathing. Then at midday on Friday the thirtieth of
                              October 1992 a curious event occurred, due to my intense conviction that
                               it was imperative that someone evince a final and
                              complete condition that would ‘deliver the goods’ so longed for by 
                              humanity for millennia. Just like my ego had dissolved,
                              back in 1981, my ‘soul’ disappeared. I was no longer a ‘Self’ existing 
                              for all Eternity and transcending Time and Space. I
                              no longer had a feeling of being – or ‘Being’ – and I could no longer 
                              detect the presence of The Absolute. There was no
                              ‘Presence’ at all.  Since that date I have
                              continued to live in a condition of complete emancipation and utter 
                              autonomy ... the condition is both permanent and actual. This
                              is different from Enlightenment in that it is most definitely 
                              substantial: there is no longer a transcendence, for I have neither
                              sorrow nor malice anywhere at all to rise above.</p>

              <p style="margin: 5px;">They have vanished entirely, leaving me both 
                  blithesome and benign – carefree and harmless – which leads
                  to a most remarkable state of affairs. The chief characteristics of 
                  Enlightenment – The Presence of The Absolute, Union with the
                  Divine, Universal Compassion, Love Agapé, Rapturous Bliss, Ineffable 
                  Ecstasy, Exalted Euphoria, The Truth, Timelessness,
                  Spacelessness, Immortality, Aloneness, Oneness, Pacifism, Surrender, 
                  Trust, Beauty, and Goodness – being redundant in this
                  totally new condition, are no longer extant. Herein lies the 
                  unmistakable distinction between this condition, which I call actual
                  freedom and the Enlightened State: I am no longer driven by a Divine 
                  Sense Of Mission to bring The Truth, Universal Love and
                  Divine Compassion to the world. I am free to speak with whomsoever is 
                  genuinely interested in solving the ‘Mystery of Life’
                  and becoming totally free of the Human Condition.</p>
              <p style="margin: 5px;">Thus, after The Altered State Of Consciousness has manifested itself, the soul is still present as ‘The
                  Self’. No matter how Enlightened or Liberated one may be, an ‘I’ is still in existence ... Timeless maybe, but still an ‘I’,
                  still in the body. The soul, as ‘The Self’, is a psychological entity identifying as being an Enlightened Master. The ego is
                  only half of one’s identity; the other half is the soul. When the ego dies, one has dispelled an illusion – the illusion of a
                  personal self – only to wind up living in a delusion – the delusion of an impersonal Self. To take oneself to be ‘The Self’,
                  the ‘Immortal Soul’, ‘The Supreme’, ‘The Absolute’, or ‘God On Earth’, is nothing short of institutionalised
                  insanity. The delusion must be dispelled in order to be actually free: along with the ‘death of the ego’ there must be a
                  corresponding ‘death of the soul’. Then ‘I’ – the self or ‘The Self’ – do not exist, psychologically speaking, in
                  any way at all. Then the Eternal Present also vanishes – along with all that other capitalised nonsense. Surpassing the Altered
                  State Of Consciousness is the third alternative ... an actual freedom.</p>
              <p style="margin: 5px;">Spiritual Enlightenment has been around for some
                   thousands of years ... and there is still no peace on earth.
                  Nowadays I know, experientially, why Enlightenment does not deliver the 
                  goods ... and, of course, I now know what does. I am not
                  an ‘Enlightened Master’ sitting in an exalted position ... and what a 
                  relief that is. I am a fellow human being, who happens
                  to live in a condition of perfection and purity, offering my experience 
                  to whomsoever is interested. We are all fellow human
                  beings who find ourselves here in the world as it was when we were born.
                   We find war, murder, torture, rape, domestic violence and
                  corruption to be endemic ... we notice that it is intrinsic to the human
                   condition ... we set out to discover why this is so. We
                  find sadness, loneliness, sorrow, grief, depression and suicide to be a 
                  global incidence – we gather that it is also inherent to
                  the human condition – and we want to know why. We all report to each 
                  other as to the nature of our discoveries for we are all
                  well-meaning and seek to find a way out of this mess that we have landed
                   in. Whether one believes in re-incarnation or not, we are
                  all living this particular life for the very first time, and we wish to 
                  make sense of it. It is a challenge and the adventure of a
                  life-time to enquire and to uncover, to seek and to find, to explore and
                   to discover. All this being alive business is actually
                  happening and we are totally involved in living it out ... whether we 
                  take the back seat or not, we are all still doing it.</p>

              <p>In spite of the fact that every single human 
              being has had at least one pure
              consciousness experience (PCE) – and usually more – in their lifetime, 
              they somehow can not differentiate between that peak
              experience of apperception (wherein ‘I’, the thought and felt ‘being’, 
              temporarily quits the scene and the actual world
              becomes apparent) and their pre-conceived notions that everyday reality 
              is an illusion disguising some metaphysical ‘Greater
              Reality’. The Glamour and the Glory and the Glitz of the Altered State 
              Of Consciousness has a tenacious grip upon the minds and
              hearts of a benighted humanity. It is indeed strange, to the point of 
              being bizarre, that so many persons will turn their backs on
              the purity of the perfection of being here – of being alive – at this 
              moment in time. Here in this actual world, which is
              where this flesh and blood body is living anyway, is the peace that 
              everyone says they are searching for. All that is required is
              that one comes to one’s senses – both literally and metaphorically – and
               spend the rest of one’s life without malice and
              sorrow. One will then be blithe and benign.</p>
              <p style="margin: 5px;">It is, of course, a bold step to forsake lofty 
              thoughts, profound feelings and psychic adumbrations and enter
              into the actuality of life as a sensate experience. It requires a 
              startling audacity to devote oneself to the task of causing a
              mutation of consciousness to occur. To have the requisite determination 
              to apply oneself, with the diligence and perseverance born
              out of pure intent, to the patient dismantling of one’s accrued social 
              identity indicates a strength of purpose unequalled in
              the annals of history. It is no little thing that one does ... and it 
              has enormous consequences, not only for one’s own
              well-being, but for humankind as a whole. With an actualism spread like a
               chain-letter, in the due course of time, global freedom
              would revolutionise the concept of humanity. It would be a free 
              association of peoples world-wide; a utopian-like loose-knit
              affiliation of like-minded individuals. One would be a citizen of the 
              world, not of a sovereign state. Countries, with their
              artificial borders would vanish along with the need for the military. As
               nationalism would expire, so too would patriotism with
              all its heroic evils. No police force would be needed anywhere on earth;
               no locks on the doors, no bars on the windows. Gaols,
              judges and juries would become a thing of the dreadful past ... terror 
              would stalk its prey no more. People would live together in
              peace and harmony, happiness and delight. Pollution and its cause – 
              over-population – would be set to rights without effort,
              as competition would be replaced by cooperation. It would be the stuff 
              of all the pipe-dreams come true.</p>
              <p style="margin: 5px;">But none of this matters much when one is 
              already living freely in the actual world. In actual freedom, life
              is experienced as being perfect as-it-is here on earth. One knows that 
              one is living in a beneficent and benevolent universe –
              and that is what actually counts. The self-imposed iniquities that ail 
              the people who stubbornly wish to remain denizens of the
              real world, fail to impinge upon the blitheness and benignity of one who
               lives in the vast scheme of things. The universe does not
              force anyone to be happy and harmless, to live in peace and ease, to be 
              free of sorrow and malice. It is a matter of personal
              choice as to which way one will travel. Human beings, being as they are,
               will probably continue to tread the ‘tried and true’
              paths, little realising that they are the tried and failed ways. There 
              is none so contumacious as a self-righteous soul who is
              convinced that they know the way to live as revealed in their ancient 
              and revered scriptures ... or in their much-prized secular
              philosophies and psychologies. So be it.</p>

              <p style="margin: 5px;">I live in peace and tranquillity, beholden to 
              none. With no loyalty to bind me, I have nothing to defend.
              With nothing to defend I have no need to attack. I have no sense of 
              mission to ‘change the world’. I am not driven by mystical
              forces to evangelise, to proselytise, to convert. If anyone is genuinely
               interested in finding out what the reason for their
              existence is, I am only too happy to participate in their enquiry. 
              Nevertheless, I can only help those who wish to be helped in
              the only way that I can help. I am free to be here in the world 
              as-it-is. Unadorned and unencumbered, I can stand on my own two
              feet, owing allegiance to no-one and nothing at all. I am supremely 
              content with life as-it-is, for perfection can be found in
              what others call imperfection ... and I have no desire to change 
              anything. To be here, intimately here in this moment in time,
              where this actual world is such a marvellous place to be alive in, is a 
              satisfaction and fulfilment unparalleled in the chronicles
              of antiquity.</p>
              <p style="margin: 5px;">Actual intimacy – being here now – does not come
               from love and compassion, for the affective states of
              being stem from separation. The illusion of intimacy that love and 
              compassion produces is but a meagre imitation of the direct
              experience of the actual. In the actual world, ‘I’ as ego, the 
              personality, and ‘me’ as soul, the ‘being’ – both
              subjectively experienced as one’s identity – have ceased to exist; 
              whereas love and compassion accentuates, endorses and
              verifies ‘me’ as being real. And while ‘I’ am real, ‘I’ am relative to 
              other similarly afflicted persons; vying for
              position and status in order to establish ‘my’ credentials ... to verify
               ‘my’ very existence. To be actually intimate is
              to be without the separative identity ... and therefore free from the 
              need for love and compassion with their ever un-filled
              promise of Peace On Earth. There is an actual intimacy between me and 
              everyone and everything ... actual intimacy is a direct
              experiencing of the other as-they-are. I am having a superb time ... and
               it is a well-earned superb time, too. Nothing has come
              without application – apart from serendipitous discoveries because of 
              pure intent – and I am reaping the rewards which are
              plentiful and deliciously satisfying. Actual intimacy frees one up to a 
              world of factual splendour, based firmly upon sensate and
              sensual delight. The candid and unabashed sensorial enjoyment of being 
              this body in the world around is such a luscious and
              immediate experience, that the tantalising but ever-elusive promise of 
              the mystique of love and compassion has faded into the
              oblivion it deserves.</p>
              <p style="margin: 5px;">The search for meaning amidst the debris of the 
              much-vaunted human hopes and dreams and schemes has come to
              its timely end. With the end of ‘me’, the distance or separation between
               ‘me’ and ‘my’ senses – and thus the
              external world – disappears. To be the senses as a bare awareness is 
              apperception, a pure consciousness experience of the world
              as-it-is. Because there is no ‘I’ as an observer – a little person 
              inside one’s head – to have sensations, I am the
              sensations. There is nothing except the series of sensations which 
              happen ... not to ‘me’ but just happening ... moment by
              moment ... one after another. To be the sensations, as distinct from 
              having them, engenders the most astonishing sense of freedom
              and release. Consequently, I am living in peace and tranquillity; a 
              meaningful peace and tranquillity. Life is intrinsically
              purposeful, the reason for existence lies openly all around. Being in 
              this very air I live in, I am constantly aware of it; I
              breathe it in and out; I see it, I hear it, I taste it, I smell it, I 
              touch it, all of the time. It never goes away – nor has it
              ever been away. ‘I’ was standing in the way of meaning.</p>
              <p style="margin: 5px;">This is an actual freedom. It is possible to be actually free, here on earth, as this body, in this
              life-time.</p>

              <p>Appendix No. 1</p>
              <p><strong>Description of being Enlightened</strong></p>
              <p>In 1980 I had a peak experience wherein I saw 
                  that
                  everything was already perfect as-it-is and that ‘I’, the psychological 
                  entity, was standing in the way ... and no-one else
                  was preventing me from achieving the ultimate goal of being a human. In 
                  that peak experience I saw ‘myself’. ‘I’ was the
                  end product of society and nothing more. ‘I’ was an emotional construct 
                  of all of the beliefs, values, moral, ethics, mores,
                  customs, traditions, doctrines, ideologies and so on. ‘I’ was nothing 
                  but an emotional-mental fabrication ... a sense of
                  identity with its conscience. I also saw that ‘I’ was a lost, lonely, 
                  frightened – and a very, very cunning – entity. Just
                  as those Christians who are said to be possessed by an evil entity and 
                  need to be exorcised, I saw that every human being had been
                  endowed with a social entity ... and it was called being normal. To say 
                  that I was amazed rather fails to adequately describe the
                  feeling of relief that after all there was a solution to the human 
                  situation here on earth. I was ecstatic.</p>
              <p style="margin: 5px;">That proved to be my undoing – as far as actual 
                  freedom is concerned. Ecstasy led to euphoria and euphoria
                  led to bliss. In the blissful state I manifested and became Love Agapé 
                  which led to an emanation of Divine Compassion for all
                  living beings who were suffering and in sorrow by virtue of the fact 
                  that they were ignorant of the Divine Order of things ... for
                  an Absolute had been revealed to me in that Love and Compassion – it was
                   that Love Agapé and Divine Compassion – and I had
                  been chosen to bring this self-same Love and Compassion to earth. I was 
                  to go through a process, when I returned to normal, that
                  would result in my being well-prepared to usher in this new age of peace
                   and prosperity to all humankind. As this revelation
                  continued, I saw a new ‘me’ coming into existence ... a grand ‘Me’, a 
                  glorious ‘Me’ and a spiritually fulfilling ‘Me’.
                  I was the Saviour Of Humankind!</p>
              <p style="margin: 5px;">(As all this was happening, a passing thought occurred to me, which was briefly contemplated ... then
                  banished: Who or what was it that was observing these two ‘me’s – the social ‘me’ and the grand ‘Me’? This trifling
                  question was to be of immense benefit years later when I realised that I was living in a delusion and that there was an actual
                  freedom lying beyond ... but I jump ahead of myself).</p>

              <p style="margin: 5px;">Three nights later I had a similar experience 
              and what I had witnessed on the first revelation was confirmed.
              Then nothing untoward happened for the next five months – this had been 
              in late July 1980 – until on the first day of January
              in 1981 when I began a ‘process’ that was to last for nine months, 
              culminating in my Divine Awakening on that September
              morning. The ‘process’ was both prosaic and extraordinary: on the one 
              hand I began undoing all the social conditioning that I
              had been subject to since birth and on the other hand I generated love 
              for all and sundry. I examined all the social traditions
              and customs etc., one by one, and released myself from their iron grip. I
               diminished hate and anger and sadness and loneliness by
              surrendering to and living in love and oneness ... which is the best 
              that a normal human could do by virtue of the socialisation
              process. I moved in and out of Sacred States of Heavenly Bliss and Love 
              Agapé and Divine Compassion and immersed myself in the
              entire ‘process’ with dedication and resolution. I adopted the principle
               of pacifism (‘turn the other cheek’) and
              developed Goodness of the highest order. I cleansed and purified myself 
              of all impure thoughts and deeds and worked both hard and
              industriously in my daily work. I practised honesty and humility in all 
              my interactions with other people and pondered the
              significance and ramifications of the Divine Order.</p>
              <p style="margin: 5px;">I totally believed in and had supreme faith in 
              The Absolute and its ability to bring about the Peace On Earth
              so long promised. That I was to play the central role in this Divine 
              Plan no longer came as a surprise to me, as I began to
              realise that I had long yearned to be part of the Salvation Process. I 
              understood that I had to die and be reborn and,
              consequently, went into a catatonic state that resulted in my being 
              carted off to hospital and kept under intensive care for four
              hours until I came out of it. I was never to be the same again, as 
              Divinity had been working on me whilst I was catatonic and from
              that date forward I was permanently in a state of human bliss and love 
              ... I could do no wrong. About six weeks prior to the sixth
              of September 1981 I had a revelation that I was going to really die this
               time, not become catatonic again, and that I was to
              prepare myself for it. I mustered all of my faith and resolution, 
              renewed all of my trust and dedication, and awaited the day. The
              night before I could hardly maintain myself as a thinking, functioning 
              human being as a blistering hot and cold burning sensation
              crept up the back of my spine and entered into the base of my neck just 
              under the brain itself. I went to bed in desperation and
              frustration at my apparent inability to be good enough to carry this 
              ‘process’ through to its supreme conclusion.</p>
              <p style="margin: 5px;">The next morning I awoke and all was calm and 
              quiet. Expressing relief at the cessation of the intensifying
              ‘process’ that had reached an unbearable level the night before, I lay 
              back on my pillows to watch the rising sun (my bedroom
              faced east) through the large bedroom windows. All of a sudden I was 
              gripped with the realisation that this was the moment! I was
              going to die! An intense fear raced throughout my body, rising in 
              crescendo until I could scarcely take any more. As it reached a
              peak of stark terror, I realised that I had nothing to worry about and 
              that I was to go with the ‘process’. In an instant all
              fear left me and I travelled deep into the depths of my very being. All 
              of a sudden I was sitting bolt upright, laughing, as I
              realised that this that was IT! was such a simple thing ... all I had to
               do was die ... and that was the easiest thing in the
              world to do. Then the thought of leaving my family and friends 
              overwhelmed me and I was thrust back on the bed sobbing. Then I was
              bolt upright once more laughing my head off ... then I was back on the 
              pillows sobbing my heart out ... upright, laughing ...
              pillows sobbing ... upright laughing ... pillows sobbing. At the fifth 
              or sixth time something turned over in the base of my brain
              – in the top of the brain-stem. I likened it to turning over a L.P. 
              record in order to play the other side ... with the vital
              exception that it would never, ever turn back again.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p style="margin: 5px;">It was over. I had arrived. I had become 
              Awakened to the Greater Reality. I was Love Agapé and Divine
              Compassion ... there was no separation between me and The Absolute. I 
              had a Divine Sense of Mission to spread The Word and I
              embarked on fulfilling my Sacred Duty, gathering some disciples on the 
              way, until 1984. Then I started to question just what I was
              doing and just what had happened to me. Something seemed to be wrong ...
               this had all been done before by other Masters and
              Messiahs, Saints and Sages, Avatars and Saviours, to no avail. In fact, 
              instead of bringing Love and Peace, they had left in their
              wake much bloodshed and hatred ... and I was one of them! Accordingly I 
              travelled to India to find out for myself exactly what was
              amiss with this whole Enlightenment business by meeting some of these 
              hallowed Gurus and imbibing the centuries of Eastern
              Spiritual Tradition for myself, instead of merely reading about it in 
              books.</p>
              <p style="margin: 5px;">It was to take me eleven years to get out of this massive delusion I was living in and go beyond it to arrive
              at where I am today. It was eleven years of coming to terms with the understanding that what I was living was a massive delusion
              of grandeur ... and that it was what every human being believed in, in some way, shape or form ... but that is another story.
              Today, I am no longer an Enlightened Master living in an Exalted State of Being ... I am me-as-this-body only, a fellow human
              being who has no sorrow or malice whatsoever to transcend; hence I am both happy and harmless. I am what I was on that fateful
              night in 1980 when I asked the question: ‘Who or what was it that was observing these two ‘me’s – the social ‘me’ and
              the grand ‘Me’?’ I am these sense organs in operation: this seeing is me, this hearing is me, this tasting is me, this
              touching is me, this smelling is me, and this thinking is me. Whereas ‘I’, the identity, am inside the body: looking out
              through ‘my’ eyes as if looking out through a window, listening through ‘my’ ears as if they were microphones, tasting
              through ‘my’ tongue, touching through ‘my’ skin, smelling through ‘my’ nose, and thinking through ‘my’ brain. Of
              course ‘I’ must feel isolated, alienated, alone and lonely, for ‘I’ am cut off from the magnificence of the actual world
              ... the world as-it-is ... by ‘my’ very presence.</p>
              <p style="margin: 5px;">Any identity whatsoever is a delusion.</p>

              <p>Appendix No. 2</p>
              <p><strong>Description of a 'Glimpse' of Actual Freedom</strong></p>
              <p>I was coming to the end of a time I went through
                       in an
                      endeavour to purify myself which I call my ‘puritan period’. I retreated
                       altogether from civilisation to a group of
                      uninhabited islands in the tropics off the north-eastern Australian 
                      seaboard where I stayed for the best part of three months in
                      total silence, on my own, speaking to no one at all and moving from 
                      island to island at whim. I had whittled my worldly
                      possessions down to three sarongs, three shirts, a cooking pot and bowl,
                       a knife and a spoon, a bank book and a pair of nail
                      scissors ... I was homeless, itinerant, celibate, vegan, (no spices; not
                       even salt and pepper), no drugs (no tobacco, no alcohol;
                      not even tea or coffee), no hair cut, no shaving, no washing other than a
                       dip in a river or the ocean. I possessed nothing else
                      anywhere in the world and had cut all family ties ... whatever I could 
                      eliminate from my life that was an encumbrance and an
                      attachment, I had let go of. In other words: whatever was traditionally 
                      seen as an impediment to freedom I discarded. It was there
                      I finally discovered that it was ‘Spiritual Enlightenment’ which was at 
                      fault and that I could ‘purify’ myself via these
                      ‘Tried and True’ means until the cows came home ... to no avail.</p>
              <p style="margin: 5px;">I was already in an Altered State Of 
                      Consciousness (this was in 1985 and my ego had dissolved in 1981) and
                      living in what has been described as the ‘Unknown’. I had had some 
                      serious reservations about the validity of this as an
                      ultimate state and had been to India the previous year to see if I could
                       ascertain why. My discoveries there had led me to
                      consider the possibility that Enlightenment was not the final stage, so I
                       was ripe and ready to plunge into the ‘Unknowable’.
                      I was able to experience what lay beyond Enlightenment several times ...
                       the first of these experiences occurred at maybe three in
                      the morning (I had no watch) and was accompanied by a sense of dread the
                       likes of which I had never experienced even in a war-zone
                      – made all the more acute because I had not experienced fear for four 
                      years (I was living in a state of Divine Compassion and
                      Love Agapé which protected me from malice and the underlying fear). This
                       dread contained the existential angst of discovering
                      that ‘I’ was nothing but a contingent ‘being’ and that ‘I’ would cease 
                      to ‘be’. Then the condition I went on to
                      experience had the character of the ‘Great Beyond’ – which I 
                      deliberately put in capitals because that is how it was
                      experienced at the time – and it was of the nature of being ‘That’ which
                       is attained to at physical death when an
                      Enlightened One ‘quits the body’ ... which attainment is known as 
                      ‘Mahasamadhi’ (Hinduism) or ‘Parinirvana’ (Buddhism)
                      and so on.</p>
              <p style="margin: 5px;">It seemed so extreme that the physical body must surely die for the attainment of it.</p>
              <p style="margin: 5px;">To put it into a physical analogy, it was as if I
                       were to gather up my meagre belongings, eradicate all marks
                      of my stay on the island, and paddle away over the horizon, all the 
                      while not knowing whence I go ... and vanish without a trace,
                      never to be seen again. As no one on the mainland knew where I was, no 
                      one would know where I had gone. In fact, I would become as
                      extinct as the dodo and with no skeletal remains. The autological self 
                      by whatever name would cease to ‘be’, there would be no
                      ‘spirit’, no ‘presence’, no ‘being’ at all. This was more than death of 
                      the ego, which is a major event by any
                      definition; this was total annihilation. No ego, no soul – no self, no 
                      Self – no more Heavenly Rapture, Love Agapé, Divine
                      Bliss and so on. Only oblivion. It was not at all attractive, not at all
                       alluring, not at all desirable ... yet I knew I was going
                      to do it, sooner or later, because it was the ultimate condition and 
                      herein lay the secret to the ‘Mystery of Life’.</p>

              <p style="margin: 5px;">The ‘death of the ego’ is only for the 
              orthodox-minded people; it is for those who are easily seduced by
              the Glamour and the Glory and the Glitz of the much-touted Altered 
              State. This is why pure intent is an essential prerequisite to
              ensure a guaranteed passage through the psychic maze. With pure intent 
              one will not rest until one has gone all the way. One will
              not be bewitched by the psychic Power and Authority, either. All these 
              allurements are but welcome food for the cunning entity,
              which wanting only its own survival, readily sublimates itself into The 
              Spirit. With the clarity born of pure intent one can see
              this play for what it is and move on freely and willingly to what lies 
              at the end of the wide and wondrous path ... the end of ‘being’.
              With pure intent one will not settle for second best, for it has been 
              seen in the peak experiences that the very best is possible,
              here on earth. One sees that ‘I’ must disappear entirely. There will be 
              no transcendence, no transmutation, no metamorphosis
              ... not any of these. For one who goes all the way, no phoenix will 
              exist to arise from the ashes – nothing Metaphysical will
              remain. There will be no ‘being’ at all. ‘I’ will become extinct.</p>
              <p style="margin: 5px;">I use the word extinct deliberately for it 
              carries a definitive meaning. Physically, death is the end of an
              individual member of the species, whilst extinction is the ending of the
               species itself. The psychological annihilation of ‘I’
              – in its entirety – is the psychological ending of the species known as 
              ‘humanity’. It is the end of ‘being’ and the
              end of an illusion. It is also the end of ‘Being’ and the end of 
              delusion. The Human Condition, with all its appalling sorrow
              and malice, can come to an end. All those would-be wise people who 
              state: ‘You can’t change human nature’ are, fortunately,
              wrong. Because it is possible for ‘me’ to become extinct, thereby 
              releasing the body from the ‘being’ within, I can walk
              freely in the world as-it-is ... this actual world. I, as this body 
              only, can live in that perfect purity twenty-four-hours-a-day.
              I can live in a state of benignity, which means a kindly and harmless 
              disposition. Life is a sincere and yet playful game and one
              is then free to enjoy it all, every moment again.</p>
              <p style="margin: 5px;">‘Humanity’, which gave birth to ‘me’, is being 
              sustained by ‘me’ remaining as a ‘being’. ‘I’
              am forever fettered by the Human Condition. The species known as 
              ‘humanity’ has searched for an Ultimate Fulfilment within the
              arena of the Human Condition for all of history. Such a search is 
              endless and futile, for it is a search within an illusion. Only
              further illusions – further states of ‘being’ – can be found there ... 
              or delusions. Becoming Divine is a delusion – a
              state of ‘Being’ that is actually an insult to intelligence. ‘I’ will 
              never find the ultimate fulfilment for ‘I’ am
              standing in the way of the ‘Mystery of Life’ being revealed. There is no
               way out, ‘I’ am doomed. ‘I’ must, inevitably,
              cease to ‘be’. Instead of bemoaning ‘my’ fate and vainly searching for 
              an escape, ‘I’ can see ‘myself’ for what
              ‘I’ am. This seeing is the beginning of the ending of ‘me’. The 
              extinction of ‘me’ is the ultimate sacrifice ‘I’
              can make to ensure the possibility of peace-on-earth for not only me but
               for all humankind.</p>
              <p>Ultimate fulfilment lies beyond extinction.</p>

              <p>Appendix No. 3</p>
              <p><strong>Description of Becoming Actually Free</strong></p>
              <p>In late September 1992 a woman, who had been coming to see
              me on and off for some time, earnestly asked that she be taken on as a disciple ... she seriously wished me to be her master. I
              was astounded, for I had been at pains to explain that I was not interested in being anyone’s master, for I considered the
              entire system of the master-disciple relationship, with its attendant surrender, trust, worship and obedience, to be not only
              insidious, but pernicious as in regards to another person’s freedom. I declined, of course, yet I had to question just what I
              was ‘putting out’ to people to precipitate such a request. What was my part in all this? What was I doing – indeed what was
              I being – to encourage another to consider taking this step? I had been dismantling various aspects of the make-up of the
              Altered State Of Consciousness that I was living in – a state of Spiritual Enlightenment that I called Absolute Freedom – and
              had thought myself to be virtually free of all that hocus-pocus that goes on in the name of freedom. I asked myself what turned
              out to be a seminal question:</p>
              <p style="margin: 5px;">‘What am I in relation to other people?’</p>
              <p style="margin: 5px;"><a name="peakexperience1"></a>I asked the 
              question in such a way so that I would not get a carefully
              thought-out and reasoned answer. I wanted an experiential result – and I
               kept the question burning in the depths of my psyche,
              discarding any intellectual answers that inevitably popped-up in the 
              course of the next five or six weeks. It troubled me deeply
              that I was in such a situation because I seem to be driven by some force
               to ‘Spread the Word’ and that was never my intention
              all those years ago when I first had what is known as a ‘Peak 
              Experience’ which initiated my incursion into all matters
              Spiritual, culminating in the ‘death’ of my ego and catapulting me into 
              this Absolute State. My intent back then had been to
              cleanse myself of all that is detrimental to personal happiness and 
              interpersonal harmony ... in other words: Peace on earth in my
              life-time. Instead of that rather simple ambition, I found that I was 
              impelled on an odyssey to be the latest Saviour of Humankind
              in a long list of Enlightened Beings ... and this imposition did not sit
               well with me, as they have all failed in their Divine
              Work. After something like five thousand years of recorded history, 
              humanity is nowhere nearer to Peace On Earth than before.
              Indeed, instead of the much-touted Love and Peace, much Hatred and 
              Bloodshed has followed in their wake. This abysmal fate is
              something I wish to avoid repeating, whatever the personal cost in terms
               of losing this much-prized State Of Being. My diagnosis
              was simple: if I were driven by some force – no matter how Good that 
              force be – then I am not actually free.</p>

              <p style="margin: 5px;">Then in the late afternoon of the day before 
              Friday the thirtieth of of October 1992, whilst out in an
              abandoned cow-paddock planting tree seedlings, I was struck by the 
              curious fact that at the beginning of my life I had been
              engaged in chopping down trees to turn the land into cow-pasture. Now 
              the needs of the situation were sharply reversed and so I
              paused in my task and stood erect, looking about me in this little 
              sub-tropical valley that the ex-dairy farm was nestled in. As I
              looked I idly mused upon the irony that the change in human needs 
              regarding physical survival had wrought such radical
              transformation in the attitudes toward the environment during the forty 
              five years I had been upon this planet. In a flash of a
              moment a vast understanding of the enormity of the Human Condition 
              transfigured my comfortable comprehension of what it was to be
              an Enlightened Master ... a Self-Realised Being. My entire affective and
               cognitive configuration – my highly prized state of
              awareness – was seen at a glance to be nothing more than a passionate 
              mental construct. In other words, my world fell apart.</p>
              <p style="margin: 5px;">I entered into a repeat of what I had first 
              experienced on an uninhabited island some seven years previously
              and nervousness and apprehension mounted to a fear that moved rapidly 
              through terror and horror to the dread that I knew so well
              from long ago. This was what my seminal question had produced and, 
              turning weak at the knees, I sank to the ground ... to no
              avail. I could not escape my destiny, for I was situated in a living 
              nightmare of what I swiftly came to see was nothing short of
              institutionalised insanity. Any altered state of consciousness was a 
              delusion born out of the illusion of self ... but only
              because of humankind’s ignorance. It is truly dreadful to be trapped in a
               massive delusion for eleven years, unable to find any
              way out and knowing that no other human being can help, for the altered 
              state has been held up for millennia as being the Summum
              Bonum of human existence. All the literature on the subject praised the 
              state of consciousness I was in (Enlightenment,
              Illumination, Moksha, Samadhi, Satori, Nirvana, Sunyata and so on) and 
              yet I just knew it was a mirage that I was living.</p>
              <p style="margin: 5px;">I had no choice but to retire to my bed for a 
              sleepless night of frozen immobility ... which continued
              throughout the morning of the next day. I knew that I would – I must – 
              proceed, but how could I be right and all those ‘great’
              and revered masters be wrong? Who was I, a mere boy from the farm, to 
              set himself up to be the ultimate arbiter of human
              experience? The agonizing doubt was virtually unbearable ... I would not
               wish this upon anyone ... I would want no one to follow
              in my footsteps, for I had to run the full gamut of dread to break 
              through to what lay beyond the deception. I realised, at about
              nine in the morning, that eleven years ago I had inadvertently 
              surrendered my will to a god ... the ‘Absolute’ that I
              cunningly considered to be ‘That Which Lay Beyond’ had turned out to be 
              Divinity in disguise. I took myself up the hill into a
              pine plantation that I particularly favoured as a contemplative place 
              and spent an hour and a half digging deep into my psyche to
              regain my ‘surrender’ ... to get my autonomy back. With a shaky will 
              somewhat in place I returned to my home and, mounting the
              verandah steps, collapsed in a heap on the bare boards. Unable to move, 
              to think or to feel I could but lie there as my very soul
              fell away. It was about midday when the process was over and I came to 
              my senses – both figuratively and literally. For along
              with the dissolution of my soul, my feelings – my emotions and passions –
               disappeared, never to return. My psyche
              disintegrated and the second ‘I’ died ... ‘I’ became extinct.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p style="margin: 5px;">The Altered State needs to be talked about and 
              exposed for what it is so that nobody need venture up that
              blind alley ever again. There is another way and another goal. The main 
              trouble with the Altered State is that whilst the ego
              dissolves, the identity and soul remain intact. No longer identifying as
               a personal ego-bound identity, one then identifies as an
              impersonal soul-bound identity – ‘I am That’, ‘I am God’, ‘I am The 
              Supreme’, ‘I am The Absolute’ and so on.
              This is the delusion, the mirage, the deception ... and it is extremely 
              difficult to see it for oneself, for one is in an august
              state. This second identity – the second ‘I’ of Mr. Venkataraman Ramana 
              fame – is a difficult one to shake, maybe more
              difficult than the first; for who is brave enough to voluntarily give up
               fame and fortune, reverence and worship, status and
              security? One has to be scrupulously honest with oneself to go all the 
              way and no longer be a someone, a somebody of importance.
              One faces extinction; ‘I’ will cease to be, there will be no ‘being’ 
              whatsoever, no ‘presence’ at all. It is
              impossible to imagine, not only the complete and utter cessation of ‘me’
               in ‘my’ entirety, but the end of any ‘Ultimate
              Being’ or ‘Absolute Presence’ in any way, shape or form. It means that 
              no one or no thing is in charge of the universe ...
              that there is no ‘Ultimate Authority’. It means that all values are but 
              human values, with no absolute values at all to fall
              back upon. It is impossible for ‘me’ to conceive that without a wayward 
              ‘me’ there is no need for any values whatsoever
              ... or an ‘Ultimate Authority’.</p>
              <p style="margin: 5px;">Thus I find myself here, in the world as-it-is. A vast stillness lies all around, a perfection that is
              abounding with purity. Beneficence, an active kindness, overflows in all directions, imbuing everything with unimaginable
              fairytale-like quality. For me to be able to be here at all is a blessing that only ‘I’ could grant, because nobody else could
              do it for me. I am full of admiration for the ‘me’ that dared to do such a thing. I owe all that I experience now to ‘me’.
              I salute ‘my’ audacity. And what an adventure it was ... and still is. These are the wondrous workings of the exquisite nature
              of life – who would have it any other way?</p>
              <p>I am this infinite and eternal universe experiencing itself as a reflective, sensate human being.</p>

              I am pasting this article specifically for dawnfirstlight and amitayus48 bcos they link the big self with no self
              
              It is precisely because it is easy to get confused over these two that they must be clarified
              
              If there is still anything you do not understand pls ask and get clarified
              
              In summary ordinary non spiritual persons identify with their ego, which means they think they are this little person inhabiting the body and the mind.
              
              Spiritual persons from all religions can reach a state of enlightenment where they realize they are not this little person but rather they are the Absolute, Big Self, Presence, Being, God, etc. They feel that they are universal ground of being, the God/source of all creation, which temporarily manifests out of this universal consciousness then subsides back to it, while the universal consciousness remains unchanged.
              
              This is not yet enlightenment in buddha's definition. To reach Buddhist enlightenment you have to realize no self, no big Self, no agent, God, Absolute, controller, etc. Seeing is just the seen, no seer. Only the world in its pristine purity. This is what is meant by phrases like, pure land is right in front, pure land is right here.

              This is not very easy, neither is it difficult
              
              It is not just an intellectual concept but something very experiential
              
              And bcos of not understanding no self, most people failed to see the essence of what Buddha teaches

              <p>I think xing yun fashi's articles is better than posting advanced articles.</p>
              <p>Xing Yun Fashi explained dharma in very simple terms in Shing ming ri bao.</p>
              <p>Even dharma centre prints simple books nowadays.</p>
              <p>I have lots of buddhists book and none I read is difficult to understand.</p>
              <p>All are plain and simple.</p>
              <p>You should label your post into groups like begginers, advanced and moderate to prevent confusion.</p>
              <p>Even Maths problem I did in Primary school got star attached to the Problem sums.</p>
              <p>One star two star and three star.</p>

              Your suggestion is good, I have wished that I was able to create categories like in other Buddhist forums: "beginner buddhism", "general buddhism" and so on. however due to technical limitations in sgforums this is not implementable.
              
              That said, beginners should never fear topics like no self and emptiness. When intuitively grasped, such an understanding will lead to long term benefits. That is why rather than shunning such topics, beginners should engage in discussion and find out about it.
              
              As Buddha warned in Ani Sutta:
              
              Staying at Savatthi. "Monks, there once was a time when the Dasarahas had a large drum called 'Summoner.' Whenever Summoner was split, the Dasarahas inserted another peg in it, until the time came when Summoner's original wooden body had disappeared and only a conglomeration of pegs remained. [1]
              
              "In the same way, in the course of the future there will be monks who won't listen when discourses that are words of the Tathagata â€” deep, deep in their meaning, transcendent, connected with emptiness â€” are being recited. They won't lend ear, won't set their hearts on knowing them, won't regard these teachings as worth grasping or mastering. But they will listen when discourses that are literary works â€” the works of poets, elegant in sound, elegant in rhetoric, the work of outsiders, words of disciples â€” are recited. They will lend ear and set their hearts on knowing them. They will regard these teachings as worth grasping &amp; mastering.
              
              "In this way the disappearance of the discourses that are words of the Tathagata â€” deep, deep in their meaning, transcendent, connected with emptiness â€” will come about.
              
              "Thus you should train yourselves: 'We will listen when discourses that are words of the Tathagata â€” deep, deep in their meaning, transcendent, connected with emptiness â€” are being recited. We will lend ear, will set our hearts on knowing them, will regard these teachings as worth grasping &amp; mastering.' That's how you should train yourselves."

              <p>No self and emptiness are important no doubt to even begginers as they are core message of buddhism.</p>
              <p>We should not fear them.</p>
              <p>But meditative experiences and levels of insight /stages of enlightenment might confuse begginer.</p>
              <p>No begginer can understand that.</p>
