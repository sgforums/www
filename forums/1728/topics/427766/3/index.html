              <p><em><span style="font-family: verdana; font-size: normal;"> If we glance through the Jain literature, we again find that no Jain 
                  scholar mentions that the Buddhists believed in an eternal / permanent 
                  non-dual cognition as the ultimate reality. At least, those Jain 
                  scholars after Asanga should have done so, if that was how the Uttara 
                  Tantra had been interpreted in India. </span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-family: verdana; font-size: normal;"> If we analyze both the Hindu Sankaràcàrya’s and the Buddhist 
                  ÅšÄ�ntaraká¹£ita’s, we find that both agree that the view of the Hindu 
                  Advaita Vedànta is that the ultimate reality (âtmà) is an unchanging, 
                  eternal non-dual cognition. The Buddhists as a whole do not agree that 
                  the ultimate reality is an eternal, unchanging non-dual cognition, but 
                  rather a changing eternal non-dual cognition. These statements found in 
                  the 6th century Hindu text and the refutations of the Hindu view found 
                  in the 9th century Buddhist texts (both of which were after the Uttara 
                  Tantra and Asanga), show that the Hindu view of the ultimate reality as 
                  an unchanging, eternal non-dual cognition is non-existent amongst the 
                  Buddhists of India. Not only was such a view non-existent amongst 
                  Buddhists of India, but it was also refuted as a wrong view by scholars 
                  like ÅšÄ�ntaraká¹£ita. He even writes that if and when Buddhists use the 
                  word ‘eternal’ (nitya), it means ‘parinàmi nitya’, i.e., changing 
                  eternal, and not the Hindu kind of eternal, which always remains 
                  unchanged. </span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-family: verdana; font-size: normal;"> The Hindu âtmà 
                  is not only non-dual cognition but is also unchanging, eternal, and 
                  truly existing. Sankaràcàrya defines existence (sat) in his Tattvaboda 
                  as that which remains the same in all the 3 times (past, present, 
                  future). In the commentary by Gaudapàda (who was Sankaràcàrya’s Guru’s 
                  Guru), of the Màndukya Upanishada, in verse number 96, he calls the 
                  eternally really existing non-dual cognition is non-relational, i.e., 
                  free from reference points. In the 37th verse of the same work it is 
                  said that this non-dual, eternal, really existing cognition is free from
                   all sense organs, i.e., free from the dualistic mind (namshe). So the 
                  Upanishadic view is that the really existing, eternal / permanent, 
                  non-dual, non-referential cognition is the âtmà, and this is not 
                  dualistic mind. This Upanishadic view existed even before the Buddha, 
                  and this was what Sankaràcàrya expounded very clearly and most 
                  powerfully around the 6th century. This view, similar to this Sankara 
                  view, was refuted by ÅšÄ�ntaraká¹£ita as a wrong view. </span></em></p>
