              <p>Yes, it is important for beginners to know the purpose of Buddha's teachings. What did Buddha realise ? No self. ç¼˜èµ·æ€§ç©ºï¼Œæœ¬æ€§ç©ºå¯‚. Buddhism should not spread like the olden days which emphasize too much on reincarnation which ends up many people thinking that being a Buddhist is to have a better reincarnation in the 6 paths.</p>
              <p>In fact, my 1st knowledge of no self is from this forum. In the past, I only know how to chant Amitabha. At least when I attend the Zen course, I'm not so lost. I have rough idea of what is no self.</p>
              <p>æ…§å¾‹æ³•å¸ˆonce said that this is the topic that all Buddhists must learn because Amitabha will be teaching this topic in Pureland. So, why wait till going to Pureland if you can learn it here.</p>

              <p>The Zen Master's commentary on Stage 9 of the Ten Oxherding Pictures shows clear insight into Anatta.</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;"><br>       
              Let's now appreciate the verse by Master Kakuan:
              <br> <br> <strong><em>Having come back to the origin and returned to the source,<br> you see that you have expended efforts in vain. </em></strong> <br> <br>        
              You are now back to your starting point.
                    How much effort you needed for that! Occasionally
                    you encouraged yourself washing your face
                    with the ice-chilly basin water, or you sank
                    into desperation listening to frogs croaking
                    in the dusk outside, or you kept sitting
                    in defiance of the pains in the legs or of
                    unbearable fatigue. Many times you have felt,
                    "Now, this time I've come to a true
                    experience!" but soon that experience
                    is covered with anxiety and discontent. How
                    many times you have determined to stop doing zazen altogether!.<br> <br> <strong><em>What could be superior to becoming blind and deaf <br> in this very moment?</em></strong> <br> <br>        
              Come to think of it now, why didn't I become
                    like a blind and deaf person right away?
                    "Blind and deaf" here means a state
                    of mind where there is nothing to see and
                    nothing to hear. When you see, there's only
                    the seeing, and the subject that sees doesn't
                    exist. When you hear, there's only the hearing,
                    and the subject that hears doesn't exist.
                    The objects which are seen or heard are,
                    just as they are, without substance. But
                    understanding the logic of this will not
                    do. When this is realized as a fact, you
                    become like a "blind and deaf" person.
              <br> <br> <em><strong>Inside the hermitage, <br> you do not see what is in front of the hermitage.</strong></em> <br> <br>        
              The late YAMADA Kôun Roshi comments
                    that this line comes from a dialogue between
                    Unmon <em>[864-949]</em> and Master Kempô <em>[dates unknown]</em>: Unmon visited Master Kempô and asked,
                    "Why doesn't a person inside the hermitage
                    know anything outside the hermitage?"
                    To this, Kempô burst out into laughter.
                    The point is why the person inside the hermitage
                    (subject) cannot see the things "in
                    front of the hermitage" (object). That's
                    because there isn't anything in front of
                    the hermitage. You may say that there is
                    only the subject, there being no object at
                    all. Yet, in actual truth, that "subject" doesn't exist either.
              <br> <br> <strong><em>The water flows of itself and the flowers are naturally red.</em></strong> <br> <br>        
              The water runs smoothly, the flowers are
                    colored scarlet. This line seems to imply
                    that there are only the objects and there's
                    no subject at all. However, as a matter of
                    fact, those objects do not exist at all.
                    It's simply that the water is running smoothly,
                    and flowers are scarlet. Everything is just
                    as it is <em>[tada korekore]</em>, and everything is void as it is now <em>[arugamama no aritsubure]</em>. The fact that there is no distinction between self and others simply
                    continues without end - "The water flows of itself and the flowers
                    are naturally red."</span></p>

              <p>Actually, 'interconnectedness' and 'Maha' are related. However, 'non-dual luminosity' is a different thing.</p>
              <p>Non-dual luminosity is discovered even in Stage 4.</p>
              <p>As I wrote to someone recent:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Me: Hi S,<br> <br> You are a sincere and humble practitioner and I truthfully hope
                                      that you will achieve swift spiritual break-through. As I am too in
                                      a learning process, I will try to share with you what I have
                                      learnt.<br> <br> First you should break-through the division between subject and
                                      object. It is OK to experience substantial non-duality first, but
                                      it is good to bear in mind that there are further phases.<br> <br> When we challenge the boundaries and division between subject and
                                      object, we are able to collapse our experience into oneness. This
                                      is the phase of substantial non-dual. By challenging the boundary
                                      where awareness ends and manifestation begin, or the border between
                                      awareness and content, everything reveals itself to be an
                                      expression of a single field of undivided awareness. Such that
                                      things no longer occur 'In' awareness, but 'As' awareness.
                                      Everything is equally an expression of the infinite field of
                                      awareness... and there is no separation whatsoever between
                                      awareness and content, perceiver and perceived, subject and
                                      object.<br> <br> That is the substantial non-dual phase. After which you can try to
                                      contemplate, 'in seeing just the seen', 'in hearing just the heard'
                                      like in Bahiya Sutta. This is not just a matter of substantial
                                      non-dualism. It is not 'everything is Awareness' but that 'there is
                                      no Awareness apart from the sights, sounds, etc'. So effectively,
                                      the term 'Awareness' is just a label, like the word 'weather', for
                                      the myriad of self-luminous experiences... it has no independent,
                                      permanent existence of its own. In seeing, ONLY just the seen.
                                      Apart from that there is no seeing or awareness. Just the seen,
                                      heard, cognized, thought, etc... just manifestation. So we no
                                      longer see a metaphysical essence. We no longer see anything
                                      inherent. Not even an 'Awareness'. Instead, we see a dynamic stream
                                      of luminous activities, without an agent, without a perceiver, a
                                      doer, controller, etc. This is not the inseparability of subject
                                      and object, but seeing how there is no subject to begin with – only
                                      self-luminous processes, activities, dharmas.<br> <br> When a person undergo awareness practice until a certain phase –
                                      non-dual, it is very very important to keep instilling the right
                                      view and keep breaking the 'essence'. At this point you will need
                                      to have clarity on anatta and dependent origination in order to
                                      refine the experience of anatta. Even if one had glimpses and
                                      experiences of no-mind, one will still be unable to realize anatta,
                                      until practitioners realize that it is not necessary to have an
                                      'essence' at all – it is simply a distorted view. So, to penetrate
                                      into Anatta, there must be the willingness to let go of the wrong
                                      'view' entirely – the entire idea of an 'essence' must be gone. So
                                      with the adoption of view, we perfect the experience until all
                                      doubts are gone, and the center is completely gone – just flat,
                                      disjoint, unsupported, dimensionless and pure experience,
                                      manifested as whatever arises.<br> <br> First investigate and clear the bond of duality, then investigate
                                      and clear the bond of inherency.<br> <br> Regards,</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>From a MSN conversation:</p>
              <p><strong>Participant says:</strong><br>before going any further... how should i understand Sheng Yen's use of "everything goes back to truth or Heaven"<br>especially the word Heaven<br><strong>AEN says:</strong><br>i think its a chinese phrase<br>i need to see the chinese words<br>but the 'truth' here is this:<br>... One who has entered Ch’an does not see basic substance and phenomena as two things standing in opposition to each other. They cannot even be illustrated as being the back and palm of a hand. This is because phenomena themselves are basic substance, and apart from phenomena there is no basic substance to be found.

This is the Truth...<br>u can replace the word basic substance<br>with 'awareness'<br>or anything<br>or 'self'<br>in other words there is no self<br><strong>Participant says</strong><br>i see<br><strong>AEN says</strong><br>u can replace the word 'basic substance' with the word 'weather'<br>or the word 'self' with the word 'weather'<br>This is because phenomena themselves are weather, and apart from weatherly phenomena (rain, lightning, wind, etc) there is no weather to be found. The reality of weather exists right in the unreality of weatherly phenomena (rain, lightning, wind, etc), which change ceaseless and have no constant form. This is the Truth...<br>the problem with us is that<br>even if we have a transcendental glimpse... of luminosity, of non-duality etc<br>we make labels and treat them as ultimate, as inherent<br>bcos of our framework of viewing things inherently<br>its like the word 'Weather'... ok, weather is undeniable<br>but is weather a thing? an entity? if yes then can it be located at a fixed position?<br>it cannot be located.... and is not other than these ceaselessly changing phenomenon<br>same goes for 'self', 'awareness', 'luminosity', 'basic substance'</p>

              <p><strong>AEN says</strong><br>No Self is not a state<br>its a fact about existence<br>it means<br>already, there never was a self<br>so its a realization<br>like for example<br>what i said just now regarding 'weather'<br>all along, there is no 'weather' to be found <br>it's just a convenient label for a conglomerate of ceaselessly changing phenomena<br>so how can there be an entity called 'weather' to be found anywhere?<br>so having realized this<br>do u say that suddenly, there is no more weather?<br>No Weather is not a state<br>its simply pointing out a fact about reality... there is no independent, permanent, locatable entity called 'Weather'<br>it is just a convenient label for the everchanging weatherly phenomena<br>same goes for No Self<br>No Self is not a state<br>it is simply pointing out a fact about reality... there is no independent, permanent, locatable self, agent<br>and self is a mere convenient label for the five skandhas<br><strong>Participant says</strong><br>it's realising a fact<br><strong>AEN says</strong><br>yeah.. u simply realize that it has always been so<br>all along<br>in seeing always just the seen, no seer<br>in hearing always just the heard, no hearer<br>so it is not the case that u dissolve the seer or hearer<br>u simply realize this is the case<br>however for those who experience a peak experience<br>aka a NDNCDIMOP or a PCE<br>these people haven't realized anatta as a dharma seal, as a fact about reality<br>so they may be under the impression that suddenly, the self disappeared, and then returned later on<br>bcos the bond of 'self' temporarily goes into abeyance<br>but without the insight, it becomes just a state that comes and goes.. he didnt realize anything<br>so he may think 'i became the sound' or 'i suddenly dissolved for a moment'<br>not realizing that all along, there never was an 'I', a perceiver</p>

              <p>yep, just bringing a reminder to readers that its still important to just practice while reading the posts here. sorry to have digress from topic. you have done all readers here a great service through all the articles posted and i feel it's only good if the readers will put what you share into practice.</p>
              <p>often when i encountered postings that i didn't understand in the past, i will just read through briefly to get an idea first. it's ok to not understand, just maintain an open mind.</p>
              <p>it's with the continuous releasing of the mental grasping to ideas during meditation that along the way some of these will make sense. at the same time the perception of mind will change and open the way for insights to arise.</p>
              <p>looking back now to the time when i first read about Anatta, and other writings here about non-dual, luminosity and emptiness a few years ago, naturally brings an amused smile :) </p>

              <p>but i think both are refering to the same insight but of different terminology. MCK's reference of "true self" IS all self excluding yourself, hence "no" ego. it's all caring of other 'selves'. in <strong>application</strong> for eg, when insulted by others, there's no ego that's retaliating.  the realisation is true self is exactly no self, not the "large" self, which still have a self/ego. it's using of words, but different in meaning.</p>

              <p>First you have to realize emptiness of self, then realize emptiness of phenomena.</p>
              <p>Why?</p>
              <p>For example, if you don't realize emptiness of self, then you think that there is an unchanging substance, in which all phenomena are 'epiphenomena' of that unchanging substance.</p>
              <p>With phenomena already devalued as something illusory (like Hinduism's 'Brahman is Real, The World is Illusory'), you use emptiness to devalue it even more.</p>
              <p>That is why you have to realize emptiness of self first, then you realize that it is not that you are seeking a Brahman and devaluing phenomena.</p>
              <p>Rather, you realize there is ONLY phenomena and nothing apart from that... and it is that, self-luminous manifestation that you are investigating: whether they have independent, permanent, inherent existence anywhere? The answer is no. So this is the Selflessness of Dharmas.</p>
              <p>It is not Hinduism's "The World is Illusory, Brahman is Real", but that phenomena are "like an illusion but not an illusion" and there being nothing Real apart from the ceaselessly changing, 'unreal' phenomena. There is a big difference there.</p>

              <p><em><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica; font-size: 100%;">First
                   of all, to the Buddha and Nagarjuna, Samsara is not an illusion but 
                  like an illusion. There is a quantum leap in the meaning of these two 
                  statements. Secondly, because it is only ‘like an illusion’ i.e. 
                  interdependently arisen like all illusions, it does not and cannot 
                  vanish, so Nirvana is not when Samsara vanishes like mist and the Brahma
                   arises like the sun out of the mist but rather when seeing that the 
                  true nature of Samsara is itself Nirvana. So whereas Brahma and Samsara 
                  are two different entities, one real and the other unreal, one existing 
                  and the other non-existing, Samsara and Nirvana in Buddhism are one and 
                  not two. Nirvana is the nature of Samsara or in Nagarjuna’s words 
                  shunyata is the nature of Samsara. It is the realization of the nature 
                  of Samsara as empty which cuts at the very root of ignorance and results
                   in knowledge not of another thing beyond Samsara but of the way Samsara
                   itself actually exists (Skt. vastusthiti), knowledge of Tathata (as 
                  it-is-ness) the Yathabhuta (as it really is) of Samsara itself. It is 
                  this knowledge that liberates from wrong conceptual experience of 
                  Samsara to the unconditioned experience of Samsara itself. That is what 
                  is meant by the indivisibility of Samsara and Nirvana (Skt. Samsara 
                  nirvana abhinnata, Tib: Khor de yer me). The mind being Samsara in the 
                  context of DzogChen, Mahamudra and Anuttara Tantra. Samsara would be 
                  substituted by dualistic mind. The Hindu paradigm is world denying, 
                  affirming the Brahma. The Buddhist paradigm does not deny the world; it 
                  only rectifies our wrong vision (Skt. mithya drsti) of the world. It 
                  does not give a dream beyond or separate transcendence from Samsara. 
                  Because such a dream is part of the dynamics of ignorance, to present 
                  such a dream would be only to perpetuate ignorance.</span></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lastly, the Large Self stage is precisely the stage of Egolessness (no individual self). It is the stage where you realize yourself to be a universal substance, a great self in which all phenomena and beings are the epiphenomena of.</p>
              <p>No Self is not egolessness in the sense of merely 'no individual, separate self' - this is Large 'I'. If you read carefully Master Sheng Yen's article you should know.</p>
              <p>Perhaps this differentiation by Richard would clarify:</p>
              <p style="margin: 5px;"><strong>Actual freedom: </strong>Both ‘I’ as ego and ‘me’ as soul are extinguished.<br> <strong>Spiritual freedom: </strong>‘I’ as ego surrenders and/or dissolves and ‘me’ as soul expands to be God (by whatever name).</p>

              <p>Generally, when philosophers or religious figures reach the height of the second stage, they feel that their wisdom is unlimited, their power is infinite, and their lives are eternal. When the scope of the ‘I’ enlarges, self-confidence accordingly gets stronger, but this stronger self-confidence is in fact merely the unlimited escalation of a sense of superiority and pride. It is therefore termed large ‘I’, and does not mean that absolute freedom from vexations has been achieved. --SY</p>

              <p>When master Du Shun was asked “Are everything exist?”, he answered “No, everything are empty, do not have their original nature, because everything arise depending on conditions”. Asked “So everything should be empty and not exist?”, answered “Also no, because everything have been existing ever since beginningless time”. Asked, “In this case, everything are exist and also empty?”, answered “No, [the exist] and [the empty] already become ONE, there is no dualistic appearance, just like gold and gold product are the same originally”. Asked, “So everything must be [not exist] and [not empty]?”, answered, “No, not like that, we can say that everything is exist and also empty, because of that, everything can exist simultaneously without interfering with one another”. Asked, “Everything that arise depending on conditions must be empty eventually?”, answered “Also no, because The Exist and The empty are mixed together, and all lose their own appearance, therefore everything do not exist anymore”.<br><br>The point for the above conversation is that master Du Shun always change his standpoint for answering the questions. We can say that master Du Shun does not have any standpoint, or he does not persist in his own opinions, or his answers are from the standpoint of the WHOLE ONE.<br><br>IF we think deeper for those all “NO” answers, the real intention of master Du Shun was trying to help [the questioner] to get rid of persisting in all kinds of passions. Because the “NO” is the sign for all negatives, the “NO” is also close to the “Empty’ too.<br><br>There was an old monk sitting in the room, doing nothing with one of his students standing behind him. Two of his students, student A and B were arguing about something outside the room, after a while, student A rushed into the room, giving the description of the argument to the old monk, and asking “Master, am I right?”, the old monk answering “You are right”, student A rushing to student B who is outside the room, few minutes later, student B also rushing to the room and giving his opinion about the argument to the old monk, and asking the same question “Master, am I right?”, the old monk answering “You are right”, student B so happy and leaving the room, in this moment the student behind the old monk asking the old monk with whispering voice “Master, if A is right, B must be wrong, if B is right, A must be wrong, how come they are all [right]?”, the old monk answering “You are right too”.<br><br>Because the old monk is already the WHOLE ONE, he can accept all kinds of opinions - he can also give negative answers to his students like “You are wrong”.<br><br>~Hank Fu</p>

              <p>eventually, çœŸç©ºé�žç©º å¦™æœ‰é�žæœ‰. as Han Shan stated:-</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>A</strong>ll teachings in the Tripitaka (Buddhist Canon) are tools to induce sentient beings to sever <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/hanglo.htm#attachment"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">attachment</span></span></a>. To those attached to <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/hanglo.htm#emptiness"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Emptiness</span></span></a>, Buddha Sakyamuni taught Existence to break that grasp. To those attached to Existence, He taught Emptiness so as to loosen that grasp. To those grasping at both Emptiness and Existence, He taught "neither Emptiness nor Existence" to break that grasp. Lastly, to those grasping at "neither Emptiness nor Existence," He taught both Emptiness and Existence to break that attachment.<sup><a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/hannote.htm#N_1_"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> (1)</span></span></a></sup> </span></p>
              <p>In short, the purpose is to draw all sentient beings away from attachments. That is the Buddhist teaching of salvation. There is no other way to return to the source [the <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/hanglo.htm#mind"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Mind</span></span></a>], though there are many different <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/hanglo.htm#expedient"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">expedient</span></span></a> methods. We Buddhist students and practitioners should not become attached to these methods. When thoughts arise in our mind discriminating between what method is right and what method is wrong, that is against the purpose of the Buddhas and is a deviation from the Buddhist path.</p>
              <p>For example, when Buddha Sakyamuni taught the Dharma of Emptiness, His message was not that it was the opposite of Existence, but rather that it was Truth and Reality. What are Truth and Reality? Let me quote the T'ien T'ai Patriarch Chih I: <br> </p>
              <span style="font-size: 11pt;">When </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><em>one</em> dharma is empty, then </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><em>all</em> dharmas are empty; there is no separate Non-Emptiness. Without Non-Emptiness to contrast with Emptiness, Emptiness itself is unattainable [i.e., does not exist].</span>
              <p>Similarly, when Buddha Sakyamuni taught Existence, this was not the opposite of Emptiness, but was rather to say: <br> </p>
              <span style="font-size: 11pt;">When </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><em>one</em> dharma exists, then </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><em>all</em> dharmas exist; there is no separate Non-Existence. Without Non-Existence to contrast with Existence, Existence itself is unattainable.</span>
              <p>We should understand the true meaning of Emptiness and Existence. Nothing we say about Emptiness or Existence is <em>attainable</em> (i.e., truly valid). And since this is so, why are we still attached to them?</p>
              <p>The Great Master Han-Shan thoroughly understood the goal of the Buddhas. In tune with the minds of the Patriarchs, he spread the Dharma (teaching), grasping at neither Emptiness nor Existence, neither Non-Emptiness nor Non-Existence -- thereby manifesting the Middle Way. Thus, he promoted the cultivation of both <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/hanglo.htm#zen"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Zen</span></span></a> and <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/hanglo.htm#purels"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Pure Land</span></span></a>, pointing to the non-duality of Emptiness and Existence. That teaching is "<a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/hanglo.htm#wonderful"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Wonderful Enlightenment</span></span></a>" .</p>
              <p>When practicing Zen, at the beginning of cultivation the expedient of Emptiness is used. But Zen does not mean Emptiness, nor does it mean Existence. Pure Land uses the expedient of Existence at the start of practice, but Pure Land does not mean Existence nor does it mean Emptiness. When Sakyamuni Buddha spoke of Emptiness and Existence, it was to reach human beings of different capacities. The Dharma itself transcends Emptiness and Existence. All methods taught by Buddha Sakyamuni are like prescriptions; since people suffer from different diseases, they need many kinds of prescriptions. It does not matter whether the medicine is expensive or cheap. As long as it is effective, it is a good medicine .</p>
              <p>Those who practice Zen or Pure Land should all understand this truth: "all Dharma methods are equal and none is superior or inferior." No one who really understands the deep meaning of the Dharma can have the kind of obstinate prejudice that sees inferiority and superiority between the various Buddhist methods. No one with that kind of obstinate prejudice can gain any real benefit from the Dharma.</p>
