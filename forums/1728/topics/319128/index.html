              <p>Nope... he will not come any time soon, not as soon as we hope.</p>
                  <p>There are alot of Maitreya-themed cults that claim that Maitreya has come and attained Buddhahood... please beware of them, those are unorthodox teachings.</p>
                  <p>In Buddhism it will not be until many millions or billions of years before he will attain Buddhahood here. At that time, humanity and civilisation is very very different from what we see today... see what the Sutras say about it.</p>

                          speed of light in vacuum is 299,792 km per second and when we multiply 
                          this number by the number of seconds in a year, we get a sense of how

                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">'Maitreya Buddha' 
                          is the Bodhisattva whom the people of today address as the 'To-be-born 
                          Honoured Maitreya Buddha'. This Buddha is presently still in the heavens 
                          above us. He resides in Tusita Heaven (å…œ çŽ‡ å¤© ), the fourth level of 
                          the six World of Desire heavens, within the Maitreya Inner Court of the 
                          palace of Tusita. He is the Dharma Master of Tusita Heaven. It is known 
                          to all on heaven and earth that he has not yet attained Buddhahood, but 
                          he is a Bodhisattva who has cultivated to an extremely high level, one 
                          which is almost the same level as that of Buddha. He is a great Bodhisattva 
                          who has attained the 51st stage in the enlightenment of a Bodhisattva. 
                          This level precedes the attainment of Buddhahood. He is currently in Tusita 
                          Heaven waiting to be born into our human world to be the next Buddha, 
                          thereby succeeding the present teacher of Buddhism, Sakyamuni Buddha.  </span></p>
                  <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> </span>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">In the Kalpa of Virtue, 
                          there are 1,000 Buddhas born. The first Buddha was Krakucchanda Buddha, 
                          the second, Kanakamuni Buddha, and the third, Kasyapa Buddha. The fourth 
                          Buddha is our present Sakyamuni Buddha. The fifth Buddha will be Maitreya 
                          Buddha.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">During the time when 
                          Sakyamuni Buddha, the World-Honoured One, attained Buddhahood, Maitreya 
                          was his disciple. Of the many disciples of the World-Honoured One, Maitreya 
                          was a most remarkable and prominent Great Bodhisattva, and was widely 
                          known as 'Maitreya Bodhisattva'. </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Images of reverence 
                          for Maitreya Bodhisattva can be found at every corner of the world in 
                          most Buddhist temples and monasteries, and in the worshipping halls of 
                          Buddhist private homes. Maitreya Bodhisattva, with his ever-laughing expression 
                          and all-accommodating round belly, is a delightful sight to all. He embodies 
                          the virtues of magnanimity and tolerance, and serves as guidance and inspiration 
                          to all of us in the way we deal with people and the way we conduct our 
                          daily affairs. This is one Bodhisattva whom we cannot do without.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">'Maitreya' is his 
                          family name, which translates into 'loving-kindness' in Chinese. Thus, 
                          there are people who know him as the 'Bodhisattva of Loving-Kindness'. 
                          His given name is 'Ajita', which means 'second to none'. And so, there 
                          are also people who call him 'Ajita Bodhisattva' or 'The Unsurpassed Bodhisattva'.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">After Sakyamuni Buddha 
                          was born, this Bodhisattva was born to a Brahmin family in a village called 
                          Kapil located at Varanasin in the southern part of Olden India. Foreigners 
                          to his country take 'Ajita' to be his family name and Maitreya to be his 
                          given name, as is the way in the West, where it is customary to have the 
                          given name before the family name. </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Maitreya Bodhisattva 
                          has been cultivating through aeons of kalpas. Distant kalpas ago, his 
                          name had been the 'Immortal of All Wisdom' (the Immortal Sarvajna). During 
                          the time of the 'Ancient Maitreya Buddha', he had been so deeply moved 
                          when he heard the discourse delivered by the Ancient Maitreya Buddha on 
                          the sutra of 'Compassionate Mind Samadhi', that he immediately vowed to 
                          learn to be like Maitreya, to become Maitreya, to emulate the predecessor 
                          Buddha, to practise the Bodhisattva Way, to enlighten all sentient beings, 
                          and even to become a Buddha in the future. For this reason, he has retained 
                          the name 'Maitreya' through all these aeons of kalpas past.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Just before Sakyamuni 
                          Buddha entered into Nirvana, Maitreya Bodhisattva returned to his own 
                          hometown, sat cross-legged at his birthplace and passed away. At that 
                          moment, his body radiated a splendidly brilliant purple golden aura rarely 
                          ever seen in this world. He was then reborn into Tusita Heaven. 'Tusita' 
                          means 'contented'. Where the five desires of pleasure are concerned, celestial 
                          beings born in this heaven are contented and satisfied. However, Maitreya 
                          Bodhisattva is not there to indulge himself in pleasure; rather, he is 
                          the Dharma Master in the celestial palace, and he guides and enlightens 
                          all the celestial beings living there.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Tusita Heaven is of 
                          a different temporal dimension from that of our world. One day and night 
                          in this heaven is 400 years in our human world on Earth, and one year 
                          in Tusita Heaven is 140,000 Earth years. The celestial life span of Maitreya 
                          Bodhisattva is 4,000 years, which is equivalent to 5.67 billion years 
                          on Earth at that time. This length of time is going to pass before Maitreya 
                          Bodhisattva returns to this world to attain Buddhahood. This is the reason 
                          why all Buddhists now address Maitreya Bodhisattva as the 'To-be-born 
                          Honoured Maitreya Buddha'.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">'To-be' infers 'future'. 
                          It also implies that it will definitely be Maitreya who comes, and no 
                          other Buddha! It refers to a future event. But when exactly in the future 
                          and in which country will this great Maitreya Bodhisattva be born into 
                          this world to attain Buddhahood? Our Earth goes through four main stages 
                          of Formation, Existence, Destruction and Void. These four stages comprise 
                          80 small kalpas which make one great kalpa. Each stage will take the period 
                          of one medium kalpa, which is equivalent to 20 small kalpas. Starting 
                          from an average human life span of 84,000 years, the life expectancy is 
                          reduced at a rate of one year per hundred years until the average human 
                          life span is ten years. The process then reverses: the average human life 
                          span is increased at a rate of one year per hundred years until the average 
                          human life span returns to 84,000 years. This cycle of a decreasing and 
                          then increasing human life span constitutes one small kalpa.</span></p>

                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">On our Earth, during 
                          the 20 small kalpas of the Formation Stage, there were no Buddhas born. 
                          The arrival of Buddhas only started during the eighth small kalpa of the 
                          Existence Stage. Sakyamuni Buddha came to this world during the ninth 
                          small kalpa, and Maitreya will only arrive in the tenth small kalpa when 
                          the human life span commences its descent from 84,000 years. When that 
                          happens, he will be honoured 'Maitreya' and will be the successor to Sakyamuni 
                          Buddha. At that time, the world will be a prosperous, peaceful and happy 
                          place. This is the reason people will address him as the 'Prosperous Buddha' 
                          or 'Happy Buddha'.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Maitreya is a blessed 
                          Buddha. At the time when he arrives to be born, the earth will have gone 
                          through many changes. Mountains, rivers, cliffs and gorges will have disappeared, 
                          and most parts of the Earth will have become flat plains. The seas will 
                          be calm and the soil fertile, so there will be many natural recreational 
                          parks. Favourable weather conditions will prevail throughout the four 
                          seasons. Beautiful flowers will blossom everywhere and everything will 
                          be pleasant. Crops and harvests will be plentiful. Fruits will be beautiful 
                          and sweet. Grains will grow naturally and without husk. They will be extremely 
                          fragrant and tasty. When matured, the grains will be readily edible without 
                          the need for cooking. Feeding on them, people will enjoy longevity and 
                          will be free from sickness. There will be no natural disasters. Everyone 
                          will be kind, good-natured, and free of evil thoughts and behaviour. Greed, 
                          anger, ignorance, arrogance, suspicionï¿½. killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, 
                          false speech, intoxication ï¿½.etc, unwholesome thoughts and bad conduct 
                          all will not exist. Everyone will realise the wonderful practice of cultivating 
                          the three pure karmas of body, speech and mind. They will exhibit equality 
                          in thinking and will not discriminate. They will distance from disputes 
                          and will be amicable and joyous with each another. They will utter good 
                          words of encouragement, perform numerous virtuous deeds and refrain from 
                          all evil deeds. There will be no need to worry about food and drink. As 
                          for clothing, weaving will not be needed, since soft delicate garments 
                          of different styles will grow from celestial garment trees on earth. People 
                          can help themselves to these for clothing. Palaces and houses will miraculously 
                          appear, and the ground filth-free. As for latrines, whenever people need 
                          to relieve themselves, the ground will automatically open up to receive 
                          their waste and then close up afterward. The ground will produce different 
                          kinds of precious gems that can casually be handpicked by anyone. Admiring 
                          and playing with these gems, people will say, "I've heard that in past 
                          kalpas (possibly referring to our present kalpa) people hurt one another 
                          over such gems and precious stones. They were imprisoned and suffered 
                          all sorts of distress. Now these gems and precious stones are like tiles 
                          and stones which no one needs to guard over. This really is a pure and 
                          peaceful world."</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">At that time, even 
                          though the world will consist of many small countries, only one big country 
                          will be the common ruler. On the Earth will be a vast plain, covering 
                          four million Li (é‡Œ ), with four great oceans located in each direction. 
                          There will exist a big city named Ketumati City (é¸¡ å¤´ åŸŽ ), spanning 
                          500 Li from east to west, and 280 Li from north to south. The land is 
                          flat and expansive and well populated with people. The streets are neat 
                          and orderly. In the sky above, there will be a dragon king named 'Water 
                          Radiance', drizzling fragrant water at night and maintaining breezy sunny 
                          weather during the day. In the city, a Yaksa (ç½— æ�€ ä»Ž , Demon) by the 
                          name of 'Leaf-Flower', will appear in the middle of the night to serve 
                          the people; removing the filth from the city, sweeping and cleaning, and 
                          sprinkling the ground with perfumes so that the city will be very clean 
                          and fragrant. Dragons, deities and ghosts will work for the benefit of 
                          human beings. They neither need offerings to be made to them nor do they 
                          need to be worshipped, as such superstitious practices will no longer 
                          exist. The climate and environment will be favourable; the citizens gentle 
                          and amiable; and ghosts and deities will provide their support and protection. 
                          These conditions effect the birth of a 'Turning-Wheel Saint King' (è½¬ 
                          è½®åœ£ çŽ‹ ) named Rang-qu. Ketumati is his capital city. The King will apply 
                          Buddha-dharma to govern and guide his subjects. He has the Golden Wheel 
                          Treasure, Elephant Treasure, Horse Treasure, Pearl Treasure, the Lady 
                          of Virtue and Beauty Treasure, the Minister of Soldiers Treasure, and 
                          the Minister of Treasure. He will secure the city with these treasures, 
                          rather than with conventional swords and batons. The place will be carefree 
                          and joyous, and freedom, peace and equality will prevail.</span></p>
                  <p><img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/8a5.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="280" height="186"></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">During this time, 
                          the treasures of the world are gathered and stored in four small countries 
                          controlled by Saint King Rang-qu: the first location is the Yi-luo-bo 
                          (ä¼Š</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">ç½—é’µ</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">) 
                          great treasury of Qian-tuo-yue Country (ä¹¾é™€ è¶Š å›½ ), the second is the 
                          Ban-chou (èˆ¬ ç»¸ </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">) 
                          great treasury of Mi-ti-luo Country (å¼¥ æ�� ç½— å›½), the third is the great 
                          treasury of Xiang-lai-chi-da Country (é¡¹ èµ– å�± è¾¾ å›½ ), and the fourth 
                          is the Rang-qu great treasury of Bo-luo-na Country (æ³¢ ç½— æ�º å›½ ). The 
                          quantities of precious gems and exquisite items stored in these four treasuries 
                          are too numerous to be counted. All items stored in the Rang-qu Treasury 
                          at Bo-luo-na Country are treasures of tribute that King Rang-qu receives 
                          from all over the world. Hence, the treasury is named after the Saint 
                          King in commemoration. Nonetheless, everything in the four treasuries 
                          still belongs to the humanity of the world. The King does not consider 
                          them his personal possessions. The personnel managing the treasures are 
                          entrusted with the responsibility of helping and aiding others. Whenever 
                          they learn of poor people in the world, they report to the Saint King 
                          and then the treasure is generously used for aid. Any such act of generosity 
                          toward the people brings great joy to the Saint King's heart. At this 
                          time, people in the world have no worry regarding food, clothing, housing, 
                          transport, recreation, bearing and raising children and education. Those 
                          considered 'poor' are only but those living in the outskirts who do not 
                          have precious ornaments to adorn themselves with. ('poor' only to this 
                          extent) Whenever the Saint King sees men and women, young and old, regardless 
                          of racial skin colour, with dignified, healthy bodies, upright, bright 
                          and pleasant countenances, he will be very satisfied.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">This brilliant and 
                          virtuous Saint King has the best Prime Minister by the name of 'Subrahmana' 
                          (ä¿® æ¢µ æ‘© ), a good friend of the Saint King in his youth. He is very 
                          learned and outstanding in his talents, and more knowledgeable than anyone 
                          else. He has a transcending perspective and remarkable wisdom. And he 
                          is compassionate in helping others. Both the Saint King and Subrahmana 
                          possess upright countenance and healthy good-looking physiques. They are 
                          both young and capable. Among the world's women of virtue and beauty, 
                          Subrahmana's wife, Brahmavati (æ¢µ æ‘© è¶Š ), is the most intelligent, wise, 
                          virtuous, moral, knowledgeable and capable. She is deeply compassionate, 
                          dignified, and exquisite, unparalleled anywhere on Earth, just like the 
                          Deva Sakka's (å¤© ä¸Š å¸� é‡Š ) wife in Heaven. Her breath is fragrant as 
                          the 'You-po-luo Flower' (ä¼˜ é’µç½— å�Ž ), and her body exudes the natural 
                          scent of sandalwood. She has not any of the 84 types of pretentiousness 
                          of common womenfolk. In her entire life, she is never sick nor does she 
                          suffer any pain or tragedy. She is always free from any distracting and 
                          wild thoughts, distress and bitter melancholy. All of this is the consequence 
                          of her previous lives' cultivation of pure karma of body, speech and mind. 
                          In their previous lifetimes throughout aeons of past kalpas, everything 
                          of Subrahmana's and Brahmavati's thoughts, deeds and speech, comprise 
                          moral work, cultivating, practising giving and performing charity for 
                          the masses. This has resulted in their now being the prime ministerial 
                          family. Not only are they well honoured and respected by all the people, 
                          but even those living in heaven praise them highly and consider them quite 
                          rare and extraordinary.</span></p>

                                years. Viewing the earth with Buddha-eyes, he deems that the time

                                beings. Choosing Prime Minister Subrahmana and Lady Brahmavati for 
                                his parents, he descends to this world. When the term of pregnancy

                          up, he profoundly senses that all worldly knowledge is really only mundane 
                          and he would be better off renouncing the world to cultivate as a monk. 
                          And so, at the outskirts of Ketumati City, in the exceptionally resplendent 
                          scenery of Hua-lin Garden (å�Ž æž— å›­ ), he renounces his worldly life. 
                          In the garden is a big Dragon-Flower Tree, named for its dragon-like branches 
                          and dragonhead-like flowers. During the midnight of the first day of his 
                          renunciation, Maitreya Bodhisattva enters into deep meditation under the 
                          Dragon-Flower Tree and instantly attains supreme enlightenment. Maitreya's 
                          attainment of Buddhahood quakes the Three Thousand Great Chiliocosm. The 
                          earth deities take off in their separate ways, spreading the news. Everyone

                                City. He brings with him 84,000 followers to listen to the discourse 
                                on the Dharma by the World Honoured Maitreya. The teachings clear 
                                their minds and remove all of their delusions. And so they attain 
                                the Dharma-caksus Purity (first stage of sainthood). All of these 
                                people eventually renounce the world and attain 'Arahathood ' (fourth 
                                stage of sainthood). This is the first assembly.</span></div>

                          reaches Wheel-Turning Saint King Rang-qu, and he is most astonished! He 
                          comes to Maitreya Buddha, requesting to be taught the Dharma. Soon after, 
                          the Saint King passes his reign over to his crown prince, and renounces 
                          to follow the Buddha. He becomes a member of the Sangha community and 
                          attains Arahathood.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">When news of Maitreya 
                          Buddha reaches Maitreya's father, Subrahmana Elder, he too leads a group 
                          of 84,000 cultivating Brahmins to renounce the world, become members of 
                          Sangha and attain Arahathood. Maitreya Buddha's mother, Lady Brahmavati 
                          also leads 84,000 court ladies to renounce the world with the Buddha, 
                          become Bhiksuni (Buddhist nuns), and attain Arahathood. The Buddha's mother's 
                          renunciation has such a great influence on the women that tens of thousands 
                          of other womenfolk come to Maitreya Buddha, requesting to renounce and 
                          practise the Dharma. Most of those who are deeply rooted in virtue gradually 
                          attain enlightenment. And as for the many who are yet to attain enlightenment, 
                          Maitreya Buddha gives them the Teachings of the Three-Vehicles: the Great 
                          Vehicle, Middle Vehicle and Small Vehicle.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Throughout Maitreya 
                          Buddha's entire life of delivering discourses on the Dharma, he guides 
                          and enlightens infinite numbers of sentient beings. Among the various 
                          Dharma discourses, there are 3 great assemblies: The first assembly teaches 
                          and guides 9.6 billion people, the second assembly, 9.4 billion people, 
                          and the third assembly, 9.2 billion people. These assemblies are the highly 
                          renowned 'Dragon-Flower Triple Assemblies' of the future.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Thus during this period, 
                          the Saha world is transformed into the pure land of Maitreya Buddha. All 
                          who have been guided and enlightened attain Arahathood. The numbers of 
                          those who receive guidance and deliverance in assemblies in the heavens, 
                          human realm and elsewhere are infinitely many. It is not by chance that 
                          those who have been guided and delivered by the Buddha attain enlightenment 
                          instantly. Rather it is truly the result of their own cultivation of blessings, 
                          morality and wisdom through aeons of kalpas. During the Period of Pure 
                          Dharma, the Semblance Period, and the End of Dharma Period of the era 
                          of Sakyamuni Buddha, most of them had planted their virtuous roots, established 
                          extensive links with the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha, learned and practised 
                          Buddhism, performed good deeds for many others, observed the precepts 
                          and recited the Buddha's name, and spread the Dharma and benefited sentient 
                          beings.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">When Maitreya Buddha 
                          has lived a full life of 84,000 years, he enters Nirvana. And the legacy 
                          of his Dharma continues for 84,000 years. </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">The above scenario 
                          is an overview of the future, when Maitreya Buddha arrives to be born 
                          in our human world and attains Buddhahood. Sakyamuni Buddha narrated this 
                          at Anathapindika Park in Jetavana Grove of Sravasti, to an assembly of 
                          1,500 disciples. Ananda, with a bare right shoulder, knelt upon his right 
                          knee, and asked with sincerity and deliberation, </span></p>

                          You are well aware of the names and honourable titles of all the past 
                          Buddhas, and the numbers of followers, disciples and Bodhisattvas. Whether 
                          it be one kalpa, or a hundred, or innumerable kalpas, your observation 
                          is complete. Further, you know the kings, ministers and citizens, telling 
                          them apart by their individual names. As for today's world, you have full

                          boundaries. Disciples following you eagerly wish to hear about the distant

                          all the changes that will occur, how bountiful and joyous the state of 
                          the Buddha world will be, and how much more time is to pass before then."</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Time and again, Ananda 
                          humbly requested. And in response to this plea that Ananda made on behalf 
                          of all those present at the assembly, the compassionate Buddha spoke this 
                          prophetic sutra. The 'Sutra of the Coming of Maitreya' has been well documented 
                          and referenced in many other sutras.</span></p>

                          on the right path. We should extensively establish virtuous links with 
                          the Buddha, distance ourselves from evils, and perform virtuous deeds. 
                          Let us all come together to implement Humanity Vehicle Buddhism, build

              will then come a time when the human life span will be about ten years.
              Maidens of five years will be of marriageable age. Among such humans
              the taste of butter, sugar and salt will disappear. Kudrusa grain will
              be the highest kind of food. Among such men the ten moral courses of
              conduct will disappear, and the ten immoral codes of conduct will
              flourish. Just as today homage is paid to the wise, the pious and the
              noble, at this time homage will be paid to the ignoble. Among such
              humans there will be no bar to intermarriage with mother, with mother’s
              sister, etc. Mankind will fall into promiscuity like goats, sheep, fowl

              sportsmen today revel in the hunting of animals. Among such humans will

              <p>Isnt Maitreya Buddha always with us, near and far? Just that we cant seem to point our where he is or know who he is. But when he comes down to preach the dharma, he will not come that soon anyway.</p>
              <p>If you read buddhist or tibetan prophecy, when maitreya buddha comes down, the earth and its continent will be acessible because the water level and geographical landscapes would have changed so greatly by natural disasters and so on. Thus, according to such saying, he is not approaching. We are at the dharma declining age for now, and of course in the Kali Yuga. But buddhism is still right here now. The dharma still exist.</p>
