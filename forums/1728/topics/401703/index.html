              <p><em>An excerpt from a teaching by Jetsunma Ahkon Lhamo called Turning Adversity Into Felicity</em></p>
              <p>How many times have we seen people expect love, kindness, support, financial prosperity, happiness to be their birthright, to be just given to them, that the world owes them a living?  You should give this to me.  Well, but you should, really!  You <strong>should</strong>, you know.  You should give this to me.  That’s how we think. Hopefully, as practitioners with some maturity, we can come to understand that what we are growing here is like a garden.  According to the seeds that we plant, according to the way that we cultivate our garden, so, too, will be our lives. That will be the fruit that comes up in our garden.</p>
              <p>While we live, while we are engaged in Dharma practice, this is not the time to put on blindfolds and pretend that there are no causes and effects, to think that sort of a blissful kind of nonsensical, magical thinking is in order.  We shouldn’t mistake the Guru for a magician.  There’s a difference.  We shouldn’t think that the Lama is simply an idea, a magic formula.  If you smile and are nice to the Guru and make prayers, then you will be happy.  No, that’s not the formula that you were taught in Dharma class.  That’s the one that you made up.  Try to see the difference.  In Dharma, you are taught by the Lama that the ball is in your court, that you must create the conditions by which your suffering will end, that literally no one else can do that for you.  Even if the Lama were to stay by your side and walk with you, hold your hand, spoon feed you, constantly hold arms around you and make sure you’re warm and help you across the intersection so you don’t get hit by a bus, or whatever—even if that were possible—still it would not be possible for your suffering to be terminated by such a ridiculous relationship.  That isn’t how it works.</p>
              <p>We are taught in our Dharma teaching that the ball is in our court, that we and only we can create the causes and circumstances necessary for happiness.  Method is necessary here.  Intelligence is necessary here.  Clearsightedness is necessary here.  Honesty is necessary here.  What is <strong>not</strong> necessary here is idiot thinking, magical thinking, Peter Pan thinking, stupid thinking.  That’s what’s not needed.</p>
              <p>Of course, the first thing we do when our magical thinking doesn’t work out is we blame the Lama.  Isn’t that great?  It’s wonderful to have a religion because you can always blame somebody, but actually in Buddhism that’s not allowed either.  You can’t do that because if you do that, then you give your power away.  What have you got?  If the fault is outside of you, then the cure is outside of you, and you’re in tough shape.</p>
              <div>So in our faith and our religion we take responsibility.  We try to understand that cause and effect arise together.  How do we create the perfect causes by which to bring about happiness?  Well, slowly, slowly, a bit at a time, as we learn.  It’s a growing thing, and the first thing we have to have is confidence and the second thing is patience, and I’m not even sure if they’re separable.  They have to come together.  It takes time to create causes.  It takes time and it takes growth, and like anything that begins as a little seedling and ends up as a beautiful, blossoming tree, it’s not only the ultimate result of the blossoming tree that is a joy; every step along the way is also a joy.  It’s a becoming and growing experience.</div>

              <p><em>An excerpt from a teaching by Jetsunma Ahkon Lhamo called Turning Adversity Into Felicity</em></p>
              <p>The result of poverty and not having enough is due, according to the Buddha’s teachings, to not having been particularly generous or forthcoming in our support or caring for others in the past, perhaps even before this lifetime.  So we might look at our lives now with a sense of honesty.  Is that the case now?  Perhaps it’s also the case now, and we just haven’t thought of it that way.  Or perhaps if we really look in our heart of hearts we might discover that there is a certain dark corner in there somewhere that has a strong element of selfishness and lack of giving.  We might see it sneak out every now and then.  Maybe not all the time, but it’s in there.  Or we might discover that perhaps in our past, in our deep past, we have been less than generous.</p>
              <p>So, in order to create the causes of having plenty, to open the doors and liberate the conditions under which support and wealth and prosperity would come to us, we would create the causes, by transforming our minds through practice into that which is supremely generous.  If we have only $5 to our name, a good idea is to give maybe 50¢ of that, maybe a dollar of that, to somebody who doesn’t have 50¢ or a dollar.   If you have nothing, I’m sure you can get it together to have enough to place a simple candle on the altar and make prayers that the merit generated by offering this light would help all sentient beings see their way through the darkness.  A small offering like that and prayers to benefit sentient beings begins the process of creating the causes by which our suffering or lack begins to change, and as well our minds begin to transform into that which is filled with kindness.  We begin to create the habit of caring for others, of kindness.</p>
              <p>The idea is that we proceed with confidence in the teachings and in the teacher who has given them to us.  That’s how you have faith in the Guru—not by making some bland statement with no depth, not by faking your way through samsara, not by controlling your mind with positive thoughts so that delusion only increases and you have no idea what you are perceiving—but instead by creating the causes through acts of generosity.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, if we have experienced great disappointment in love, let’s say, the first thing that we think is, “Oh, now I’ve lost my boyfriend, or girlfriend or whatever, so I have to do everything I can to get them back.”  Grasp, grasp, grasp!  And when that doesn’t work—it doesn’t, you know—then what you do is you make prayers to the Guru: “Oh please, oh please, oh please!”  And we hope and pray that the lotto will come for us on the romantic level.  And then we even think stupid thoughts like, “Oh, please deliver him or her to me now!  Along with the check, put him in the mailbox.  I’ll pick him up tomorrow.”  You know that’s the kind of thinking that we have.  It’s like magical thinking, but that’s a different religion.  That’s not our religion.</p>
              <p>In our religion, if that had happened, we would look for the causes.  What are the causes of such a loss?  Perhaps I have not been kind and loving.  I’ll tell you how it is, if no love is given, no love will be received.  It’s like that.  If we do not invest in generosity and caring and loving concern and regard for others in an unselfish way, there will not be a great deal of love forthcoming freely into our lives because we have not created the causes.  We have not held up our part of the bargain.  And so we begin, therefore, to create the causes: a real concern, a real interest in the welfare and well being of others.  Not just the one you want back.  That’s easy.  Others, all others, with kindness and love and generosity coming forth from our hearts.  That’s the investment that’s needed here, that we ourselves would be responsible for not abandoning and leaving without comfort, loved ones and friends, not just the one we want, but all our loved ones and friends.  And then take it further than that.  Not only our friends and loved ones, but also our not-so-friendly friends, maybe the people we don’t have much concern for, maybe even our enemies.  A loving concern for them is what’s required here.</p>
