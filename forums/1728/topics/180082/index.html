            <div class='col-md body'>There's this thing which is worth thinking.<br><br>As the title implies, dating usually involves some mind games, at least in the initial stage, to get the one u really love. Sometimes you do get, sometimes you don't.<br><br>My question is this--since dating can sometimes be viewed at using mind games tactics, strategies and even manipulation(if you call it) to gain your partner, what is the Buddhist's philosophy take on this? Will there be bad karma if you use tactics to gain your partner's love?</div>

Evil or good is really subjective. It's how the means(or tactics) used that are viewed. My concern is whether there will be bad karma if mind games are being played.<br><br>Personally, I believe there's a limit on how you can use in courtship.

In the game of love, it's much more complex than that. Even if you do not want to play mind games, the moment you want to date her, the game has begun. Gals sometimes give mixed signals which is hard to understand and this can be linked to some mind games on their part.<br><br>Yes the ideal motivation is to win her affection and of course she must also demonstrate mutual interest in you initially, without having any evil intentions.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dating a ger is to relax and have lots of fun. And no tension and burden involves. If you feel she is playing mind game with you...then u cannot enjoy her company.<br><br>Gers are sensitive and insecure beings. Perhaps they wanna "test water" from you seeing whether you are suitable for her or not..<br><br>Well...she can observed you..U also can do the same. The key point is dating any gers shouldn't be too "chee hong". If the ger detect your chee hong attitude...she will be more defensive or may ran away. Unless this ger also wanna flirt with you lah...then nothing to say lor.<br><br>BGR is give and take lah....even u like the ger...the ger might not like u. She might treat you as a normal friend afterall. Women's mind is hard to guess. Dun add on pain onto yourself. So need not take it too hard. If she have feelings for u..you naturally will know.<br><br>Yes...absolutely agree with you ! Conclusion is Dun ever expect too much from her if just merely dating. keke...<br><br>Anyway, I am a married man now. So these are my tips to u guys here. haha.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
