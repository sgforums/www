              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #2b262a;'>Since
              late last year, members of Myanmar’s radical nationalist Committee for the
              Protection of Nationality and Religion, known as Ma Ba Tha, a collective of
              Buddhist abbots and influential monks, have been calling for cattle abattoirs
              in the country to be shut down. The campaign has forced the closure of dozens
              of Muslim-owned abattoirs and beef-processing facilities across the Ayeyarwady
              Region, where the Muslim population relies heavily on the beef trade.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #2b262a;'>Thousands
              of cows have been seized from their owners, and the Buddhist activists have
              received government permission to transport hundreds of the cows to Rakhine
              State in western Myanmar—the scene of violent unrest between Buddhist residents
              and mostly stateless Rohingya Muslims in 2012—where the animals are donated to
              Buddhist farmers who have resettled from eastern Bangladesh.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #2b262a;'>Myanmar’s
              mainly Buddhist farmers traditionally keep cows and bullocks as draft animals
              and only sell them to slaughterhouses to raise funds for major one-off expenses
              such as a wedding or medical treatment. The Ma Ba Tha-backed campaign has not
              called on farmers to stop selling cattle, but has instead started buying up
              government-issued abattoir licenses to prevent their use by business operators.
              The subsequent shortage of cattle prevented Muslim communities in the delta
              from celebrating last year’s Eid al-Adha festival, during which cows are
              slaughtered in accordance with Islamic tradition.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #2b262a;'>"This
              activity constitutes a direct violation of our fundamental religious
              rights," said Al Haji Aye Lwin, chief convener of Yangon’s Islamic Centre.
              "I estimate (Muslim) businesses in general are losing about 30 percent of
              their profits.” (Myanmar Now)</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #2b262a;'>Ma Ba
              Tha spokesman Kyaw Sein Win observed that saving lives was central to Buddhist
              philosophy. “We are not deliberately targeting [Muslim] businesses. They would
              kill animals as they believe this is how they gain merit. That’s the main
              difference between us and them,” he said. (Myanmar Now)</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #2b262a;'>This is
              not the first time in the country’s history that the issue has been raised as a
              result of a clash of cultures. At the turn of the 20th century, Buddhist abbot
              Ledi Sayardaw called on his compatriots to stop killing cattle as the
              livelihoods of farmers depended on them as beasts of burden, perceiving a
              threat from British colonial administrators.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #2b262a;'>“The
              idea was that <em>nwas</em> (cows), they work in the fields, they
              sustain [farmers] with milk and they are the capital for the Burmese,” said
              Dutch anthropologist Gustaaf Houtman. “The idea was that the British would come
              in and set up abattoirs, and they would kill all the buffaloes in the fields
              [to eat them]. He didn’t target Muslims. On the contrary, because it was the
              British that they were worried about . . . They might kill all the working
              capital of the people.” (Myanmar Now)</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #2b262a;'>Promoted
              by other monks, the movement became very successful and took on particular
              significance for Burmese nationalists seeking independence from Britain. </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #2b262a;'>In
              modern-day Myanmar, many restaurants in the country serve beef and many people,
              including Buddhist monks, eat it, with opinions within Myanmar’s Buddhist
              sangha divided on the subject of abstinence from meat in general. Some monks
              cite the Theravada Buddhist canon, interpreting it to state that one can eat
              anything as long as it is done “with awareness” and “without attachment to the
              taste.” (Myanmar Now)</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #2b262a;'>Even
              within Ma Ba Tha, opinion is not united. At a nationalist monks convention in
              Yangon in June, U Wirathu, a prominent monk and a vocal figure in Ma Ba Tha,
              asked whether the mass slaughter of animals for religious purposes should be
              banned. A Buddhist nun in the audience responded that she was a strict
              vegetarian in accordance with Buddhist principles and asserted that animals
              should not be killed and meat should not be served during religious meetings.
              Her remarks raised eyebrows among the hundreds of Ma Ba Tha monks and abbots
              who had just been served a meal of pork curry. The discussion became heated as
              some monks began to argue that banning a ritual of a different faith would be a
              violation of fundamental human rights.</span></p>

              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #2b262a;'>According
              to the Washington, DC-based Pew Research Center, Buddhists make up about 80 per
              cent of Myanmar’s population, and Muslims just 4 per cent. Religious tensions
              have simmered in Myanmar for almost half a century of military rule, but came
              to a head in 2012, a year after a nominally civilian government came to power.
              Ma Ba Tha, founded in June 2013, asserts that Myanmar’s Buddhist population and
              culture is under threat from Islam. Critics of Ma Ba Tha say the group’s
              policies are not representative of the country’s sangha, which has 250,000
              members according to a government estimate, and that they do not reflect the
              essence of Buddhism.   </span></p>
