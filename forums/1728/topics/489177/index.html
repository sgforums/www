              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231; text-align: justify;">Narrow Burman-Buddhist nationalism remains the country's
                  biggest barrier to sustainable political reform.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The Organization for the
                  Protection of Race and Religion, known by the Burmese acronym <em>Ma Ba Tha</em>,
                  is gaining ground in Myanmar. It has also been receiving increased
                  international attention—last month for its proposal to </span><a style="line-height: 1.231;" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/22/buddhist-monks-seek-to-ban-schoolgirls-from-wearing-headscarves"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  color: black;">ban Muslim
                  headscarves in public schools</span></a><span style="font-size: 13pt;">.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The organization was
                  founded in 2014, when central figures from the more widely known 969 movement
                  started </span><a style="line-height: 1.231;" href="http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2015/03/12/buddhist-nationalism-threatens-myanmars-democratic-transition/"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  color: black;">campaigning for
                  four laws</span></a><span style="font-size: 13pt;"> to ban polygamy, restrict interfaith marriages and religious conversions, and
                  enforce birth control measures among groups with high rates of population
                  growth. All four laws, </span><a style="line-height: 1.231;" href="http://www.tricycle.com/blog/not-playing-nice"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  color: black;">which are aimed at Myanmar’s
                  Muslim population</span></a><span style="font-size: 13pt;">, passed parliament earlier this year. The new initiative to legally ban
                  Muslim headscarves in public schools is the group’s latest.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Buddhism in Myanmar has
                  become increasingly politicized with the rise of the Ma Ba Tha, which has its
                  roots in 2012, when the loosely organized 969 movement of monks and laypeople
                  called for a boycott of Muslim businesses. The numerological symbol <em>969</em>,
                  which represents the triple gems of Buddhism—the noble qualities of the Buddha
                  [9], the dhamma [6], and the sangha [9]—is meant to counter that of Islam, 786
                  (<em>Bismillah al-Rahman al-Rahim</em>). 969 campaigns have coincided with a
                  number of serious violent attacks on Muslim neighborhoods by Buddhist
                  nationalist mobs in </span><a style="line-height: 1.231;" href="http://www.tricycle.com/feature/buddhist-nationalism-burma"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  color: black;">Rakhine State</span></a><span style="font-size: 13pt;"> and several urban areas
                  across Myanmar.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">Ma Ba Tha seeks to protect
                  the “Burman race” and Buddhism against the perceived threat of Islam, a
                  religion that has deep roots in the histories and cultures of Theravada
                  Buddhist countries across South and Southeast Asia. Muslim populations in these
                  countries remains small—officially 9.7 percent in Sri Lanka, 6 percent in
                  Thailand, 4 percent in Myanmar, and 1.6 percent in Cambodia. Nevertheless,
                  Buddhist monks and laypeople have expressed grave concerns about the future of
                  Buddhism amid fears of Muslim expansion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">Buddhists in South and
                  Southeast Asia recognize that few Buddhist states remain. Areas once belonging
                  to the ancient Brahman-Buddhist kingdoms exist today as Muslim states—Malaysia,
                  Indonesia, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and Pakistan—with marginal, if any,
                  remaining Buddhist populations. Many Buddhists fear that the tendency of
                  Buddhists to convert in interfaith marriages, combined with a generally higher
                  birthrate among Muslims (mainly in impoverished families), presents an imminent
                  threat to the future of Buddhism. Fear and skepticism toward Muslim neighbors
                  make Buddhist populations increasingly receptive to anti-Muslim agitation from
                  Buddhist nationalists.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">In Myanmar, as in other
                  Theravada Buddhist countries, Buddhism and nationalism are inextricably linked.
                  This phenomenon can be traced back to the close, reciprocal relationships
                  between the ancient Buddhist kings and the sangha, modeled on Ashoka’s empire
                  in which the king reigned with a moral legitimacy as a righteous </span><em style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">chakravarti</em><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;"> or </span><em style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">dhammaraja</em><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">. In the struggle for independence from the colonial powers
                  across South and South East Asia, from the late 19th century through much of
                  the first half of the 20th, a modern Buddhist nationalism that invoked and
                  reinvented this ideal Buddhist kingdom emerged.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">In Myanmar, the British Raj
                  banned political organizing but permitted religious institutions and
                  organizations, which were quickly politicized. Later, in the formative years of
                  post-independence Burmese nation building, Buddhism would play a prominent
                  role, along with the culture of the ethnic Burman majority, in constructing a
                  national identity. The alienation of Myanmar’s many ethnic and religious
                  minorities continues to this day. Today the Myanmar government juggles peace
                  negotiations with some 17 ethnic armed groups, after about 60 years of armed
                  conflicts and civil wars.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">Following 50 years of
                  military dictatorship, Myanmar’s current struggle to develop sustainable
                  political reform remains hampered by narrow Burman-Buddhist nationalist
                  ideology.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The Ma Ba Tha, a new
                  political expression of this ideology, has been known to threaten and
                  intimidate Burmese who advocate for tolerance of diversity and to </span><a style="line-height: 1.231;" href="https://www.prio.org/Publications/Publication/?x=7506"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  color: black;">use its
                  religious power to exercise political pressure</span></a><span style="font-size: 13pt;">. As November’s general
                  elections quickly approach, existing Buddhist anxieties and skepticism toward
                  Muslims could be exploited by political interests, which could lead to a
                  resurgence of anti-Muslim violence in Myanmar. By framing the widely popular
                  Aung San Suu Kyi, and her National League for Democracy, as “soft on Muslims,”
                  her opponents may succeed in challenging her political and moral authority.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">In the long term, Myanmar
                  will need to reassess its national ideology in order to give space for the
                  emergence of new national identities that respect ethnic and religious minority
                  rights without compromising the country’s Burman and Buddhist heritage.</span></p>
