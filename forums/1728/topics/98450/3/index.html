This festival lasted for seven days and included the winter solstice, which usually occurred around December 25 on the ancient Julian calendar. During Saturnalia the Romans feasted, postponed all business and warfare, exchanged gifts, and temporarily freed their slaves. Many Romans also celebrated the lengthening of daylight following the winter solstice by participating in rituals to glorify Mithra, the ancient Persian god of light (see Mithraism). These and other winter festivities continued through January 1, the festival of Kalends, when Romans marked the day of the new moon and the first day of the month and year.<br><br><strong>Although the Gospels describe JesusÂ’ birth in detail, they never mention the date, so historians do not know on what date he was born. The Roman Catholic Church chose December 25 as the day for the Feast of the Nativity in order to give Christian meaning to existing pagan rituals. For example, the Church replaced festivities honoring the birth of Mithra, the god of light, with festivities to commemorate the birth of Jesus, whom the Bible calls the light of the world. The Catholic Church hoped to draw pagans into its religion by allowing them to continue their revelry while simultaneously honoring the birthday of Jesus. </strong>The Eastern Orthodox Church took a slightly different course. By the end of the 4th century the Eastern Church in Constantinople had also begun to acknowledge December 25 as JesusÂ’ birthday, but it emphasized the celebration of ChristÂ’s baptism on January 6 as the more important holiday.<br><br>Over the next 1000 years, the observance of Christmas followed the expansion of Christianity into the rest of Europe and into Egypt. <strong>Along the way, Christian beliefs combined with existing pagan feasts and winter rituals to create many long-standing traditions of Christmas celebrations.</strong> For example, ancient Europeans believed that the mistletoe plant held magic powers to bestow life and fertility, to bring about peace, and to protect against disease. Northern Europeans associated the plant with the Norse goddess of love, Freya, and developed the custom of kissing underneath mistletoe branches. Christians incorporated this custom into their Christmas celebrations, and kissing under a mistletoe branch eventually became a part of secular Christmas tradition.<br><br>During the Reformation of the 16th century, Protestants challenged the authority of the Catholic Church, including its toleration of surviving pagan traditions during Christmas festivities. For a brief time during the 17th century, Puritans banned Christmas in England and in some English colonies in North America because they felt it had become a season best known for gambling, flamboyant public behavior, and overindulgence in food and drink.<br><br>From: <a href="http://encarta.msn.com/" rel="nofollow">http://encarta.msn.com/</a></div>

Ryuei Michael McCormick</strong><br><br>Here is my yearly tongue-in-cheek holiday rant about Santa Claus. Santa Claus is an amalgamation of Pagan lore and Christian legend. On the Christian side, he is related to Saint Nicholas who was a 4th century bishop in Turkey. He was known for giving anonymous donations of gold coins to those in need and he later became a patron saint of children. Santa Claus later became known for his sack full of toys.<br><br>On the other side of the world, a 10th century vagabond in China named Pu-tai was also known for his jolly demeanor. He in fact became the model for the Laughing Buddha. His name means Hempen Sack, and in fact he was also known to carry around a sack from which he would distribute gifts to children. Pu-tai was known as a Ch'an (Zen) Master and after he died it was believed that he was an appearance of Bodhisattva Maitreya.<br><br>Now, it seems obvious to me that Pu-tai and Santa Claus share many of the same characteristics, and in Buddhism that means that they are likely appearances of the same celestial bodhisattva, in this case Maitreya. Now Maitreya is the future buddha who is waiting in the wings (so to speak) in the Tushita Heaven. It would appear then that Santa Claus is in fact the future Buddha and that the North Pole is actually the earthly manifestation of the Tushita Heaven (which only bodhisattvas and buddhas can see in its true aspect).<br><br>And on that note, I will end this with the supreme mantra of generosity and loving-kindness: Ho Ho Ho! (Which means "Dharma Dharma Dharma!" in Sino-Japanese)<br>Copyright by Ryuei Michael McCormick. 1997. 2001.<br><br>NOTE: Maitreya/Mettaya Bodhisattva literally means "Loving-Kindness Bodhisattva"</div>

You cannot agree with everything when these everything dun agree among themselves. There is no grey areas when it comes to such.  </div></blockquote>Yes, please make a stand. People who want to be Christian fanatics must of course have a firm stand. What claim of exclusiveness do christians have on Dec 25?  Dec 25 is birth date of the Pagan god Mithra (Sun God) and the Sun is worshipped all over the world in ancient time long before Christianity was even conceived.  It is not incident that worldwide there are celebrations during the december period which is near the Winter Solstice .<br><br>The Bible never said that Dec 25 is the birth date of Jesus, in fact, dec 25 contradicts the facts in the Bible itself. See <a href="http://www.ucg.org/booklets/JC/prophecy_jesusborn.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ucg.org/booklets/JC/prophecy_jesusborn.htm </a><br><br>Why did the Son of God become the Sun God?<br><br>In the Old Testament , God is fear-inspiring and his messengers come to kill. In the New Testament, God is loving and his Son comes to be killed.  Then Christians takes the birthdate of the Sun God to celebrate as the birth date of the Son of God , who said his father is a loving God. Somehow this loving father is also the same as the God whom everybody used to fear.  Whew! That  is a lot of grey areas. 3 Gods is 1 God and we are not talking about the Trinity yet.  At least the pagans have gods that specialise in their respective areas. So can you tel me what absolute truth this is? I can only say that this "truth" is absolutely absurd.</div>
