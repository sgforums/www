              <p>What "theory" are you talking about? If it is rebirth, you can refer to Dr. Ian Stevensons and many other research by scientists which provides evidence.</p>
              <p>Also, none of Buddha's teachings are theories but are realizable in your own experience. Buddha only spoke from experience.</p>
              <p>As Buddha said himself:</p>
              <p><em>The Perfect One is free from any theory, for the Perfect One has
                                      understood what the body is, and how it arises, 
              and passes away. He
                                      has understood what feeling is, and how it 
              arises, and passes away.
                                      He has understood what perception is, and how it
               arises, and passes
                                      away. He has understood what the mental 
              formations are, and how
                                      they arise, and pass away. He has understood 
              what consciousness is,
                                      and how it arises, and passes away.<br><br> Therefore, I say, the Perfect One has won 
              complete deliverance
                                      through the extinction, fading away, 
              disappearance, rejection, and
                                      getting rid of all opinions and conjectures, of 
              all inclination to
                                      the vainglory of I and mine.</em> <em><br><br> - Majjhima Nikaya, 72</em></p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>According to Buddhism, three criteria allow a statement to be considered valid: verification by direct experience, irrefutable deduction, and testimony worthy confidence. Here, therefore, we are talking about the third category.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>In everyday life we are continually being impregnated with ideas and beliefs that we take as true because we accept the competence of those who provide the information. They know what they are doing, because it works, so it must be true. That is where confidence becomes a factor. However, most of us would be quite incapable of proving scientific truths by ourselves. Quite often, too, such beliefs - like that of the atom seen as tiny particles orbiting an atomic nucleus - continue to influence people's view of things long after they have been abandoned by the scientists themselves. We're ready to believe anything we are told as long as it corresponds to an accepted view of the world, and to be suspicious of anything that doesn't. In the case of the contemplative approach, the doubt that many of our contemporaries feel about reincarnation/rebirth is due to the lack of contemplative practice.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Lots of things are seen as supernatural, until eventually we discover how they happen, or until the time comes for someone to have that experience for themselves. As the Roman philosopher Marcus Cicero is quoted to have said, "What cannot happen, will never happen, and what can happen, is not a miracle."</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Understand that your doubts regarding reincarnation/rebirth are not shortcomings of intellectual prowess, rather a cautious approach to an ideology that is perhaps new, different and therefore seemingly difficult to conceptualize. However, I present that you are here asking questions and voicing concerns, and for now that is enough as it is within this place that fellowship abounds.</span></p>
