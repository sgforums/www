              <p>It all comes down to narrow mindedness. There can be countless (and there are indeed, a LOT) of evidence and yet you will not accept it due to your narrow mindedness. But actually all it takes is just 1 piece of evidence to proof a thing: this is good science.</p>

When I was doing elementary particle physics there was a theory that required for its proof the existence of what was called the 'W' particle. At the cyclotron in Geneva, CERN funded a huge research project, smashing atoms together with an enormous particle accelerator, to try and find one of these 'W' particles. They spent literally hundreds of millions of pounds on this project. They found one, just one 'W' particle. I don't think they have found another since. But once they found one 'W' particle, the researchers involved in that project were given Nobel prizes for physics. They had proved the theory by just finding the </em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>one</em></span><em> 'W' particle. That's good science.

Anomaly is a word in science for disconcerting evidence that we can put in the back of a filing cabinet and not look at again, because it's threatens our worldview. It undermines what we want to believe. It is threatening to our dogma. However, an essential part of the scientific method is that theories have to be abandoned in favour of the evidence, in respect of the facts. The point is that the evidence for a mind independent of the brain is there. But once we admit that evidence, and follow the scientific method, then many cherished theories, what we call 'sacred cows' will have to be abandoned.</em><br></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; font-size: 13px;">Not only is there scientific evidence to support the Buddhist belief in rebirth, it is the only after-life theory that has any evidence to support it. There is not a scrap of evidence to prove the existence of heaven and of course evidence of annihilation at death must be lacking. But during the last 30 years parapsychologists have been studying reports that some people have vivid memories of their former lives. For example, in England, a 5 year-old girl said she could remember her "other mother and father" and she talked vividly about what sounded like the events in the life of another person. Parapsychologists were called in and they asked her hundreds of questions to which she gave answers. She spoke of living in a particular village in what appeared to be Spain, she gave the name of the village, the name of the street she lived in, her neighbors' names and details about her everyday life there. She also fearfully spoke of how she had been struck by a car and died of her injuries two days later. When these details were checked, they were found to be accurate. There was a village in Spain with the name the five-year-old girl had given. There was a house of the type she had described in the street she had named. What is more, it was found that a 23-year-old woman living in the house had been killed in a car accident five years before. Now how is it possible for a five year- old girl living in England and who had never been to Spain to know all these details? And of course, this is not the only case of this type. Professor Ian Stevenson of the University of Virginia's Department of Psychology has described dozens of cases of this type in his books. He is an accredited scientist whose 25 year study of people who remember former lives is very strong evidence for the Buddhist teaching of rebirth.</span></p>

In Buddhism, the evidence comes from the contemplative experience of people who are certainly not ordinary but who are sufficiently numerous that what they say about it is worth taking seriously into account. Indeed, such testimonies begin with those of the Buddha himself.</span><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><span style="font-size: small; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Nevertheless, it’s important to understand that what’s called reincarnation in Buddhism has nothing to do with the transmigration of some ‘entity’ or other. It’s not a process of metempsychosis because there is no ‘soul’. As long as one thinks in terms of entities rather than function and continuity, it’s impossible to understand the Buddhist concept of rebirth. As it’s said, ‘There is no thread passing through the beads of the necklace of rebirths.’ Over successive rebirths, what is maintained is not the identity of a ‘person’, but the conditioning of a stream of consciousness.</span><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><span style="font-size: small; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Additionally, Buddhism speaks of successive states of existence; in other words, everything isn’t limited to just one lifetime. We’ve experienced other states of existence before our birth in this lifetime, and we’ll experience others after death. This, of course, leads to a fundamental question: is there a nonmaterial consciousness distinct from the body? It would be virtually impossible to talk about reincarnation without first examining the relationship between body and mind. Moreover, since Buddhism denies the existence of any self that could be seen as a separate entity capable of transmigrating from one existence to another by passing from one body to another, one might well wonder what it could be that links those successive states of existence together.</span><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><span style="font-size: small; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">One could possibly understand it better by considering it as a continuum, a stream of consciousness that continues to flow without there being any fixed or autonomous entity running through it… Rather it could be likened to a river without a boat, or to a lamp flame that lights a second lamp, which in-turn lights a third lamp, and so on and so forth; the flame at the end of the process is neither the same flame as at the outset, nor a completely different one…</span></p>

              <p>the realised ones can go all six realms at free will...  piece of cake for them. And also,  i heard Khunu lama can go to bardo in and out at free will, not really need to die.  But delog have to die... their one purpose is to teach about the sufferings of samsara and karma so they go thru all six realms. When they come back and teach, their teaching is backed by actual experience, for eg, when they talk about the hell or preta realms, they will really cry and feel great sadness. and they also carry messages back from the dead ones in hell who request their live relatives to commission/perform prayers to save them from lower realms.  due to the details in the message, they have great credibility, cos no-one else but the deceased cld know such details.</p>

              <p><br>hi geis, i agree with you. I'm not referring to what u r referring. I'm talking about analysis... like for eg. whether reincarnation exists or not...</p>
              <p>IMO, if no realisation of emptiness, can't be carefree, or fearless.  head-level understanding is just pushing to be, but not really.  When death comes, still like ordinary person...</p>

              <p>hmm how i read sinweiy's post is that sinweiy is pointing out the difficulty in reconciling conventional and ultimate knowledge.</p>

              <p><br>yes, you read it right. nobody is mixing (non not mixing) anything. it just depend on the angle one's perspective.</p>
              <p>like the analogy of some blinds people touching an elephant. the one touching the truck would differ from the one touching the ear etc. but actually there's one elephant.</p>

              <p>I think you may be having a bit of conflict between relative truth and ultimate truth.  In ultimate truth, there is no time either so i think it is kind of not possible to make comparison between relative and ultimate truth. Reincarnation exists in relative truth. Dun mix up.</p>

              <p>Nay, not conflicting to me. :)</p>
              <p>didn't say Reincarnation does not exist either.</p>

              <p>Lama Tsongkhapa did say though, once one reaches accurate realisation, ultimate truth (emptiness) and relative truth (interdependent origination) are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">merged</span>, not conflicting in that realisation. </p>

              <p>'merged' as in <em>mixed</em> together, but u said don't mix? :)</p>
              <p>no la, that's what i meant when one sever the è°œ , you get the accurate realisation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i just think if i fix my mind on one concept, then i had fallen away from the actual Dharma. then if i said i enter neither thinking nor not thinking, then i'm yet again fallen away from the actual dharma...if know what i mean...</p>
              <p>All and all, i'm refering to <strong>Middle way</strong> that's all. And That's <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mahayana.</span> Mahayana often say one thing and the second sentence that follow would sort of contradict the first sentence. :)</p>

              <p>the realised ones can go all six realms at free
              will...  piece of cake for them. And also,  i heard Khunu
              lama can go to bardo in and out at free will, not really need to
              die.  But delog have to die... their one purpose is to teach
              about the sufferings of samsara and karma so they go thru all six
              realms. When they come back and teach, their teaching is backed by
              actual experience, for eg, when they talk about the hell or preta
              realms, they will really cry and feel great sadness. and they also
              carry messages back from the dead ones in hell who request their
              live relatives to commission/perform prayers to save them from
              lower realms.  due to the details in the message, they have
              great credibility, cos no-one else but the deceased cld know such
              details.</p>
