              <p>Some people say without belief in karma and rebirth, it is impossible to practice dharma.</p>
              <p>I dun think so.</p>
              <p>I think dharma has a lot of common sense in it.  For instance, if you are kind and constantly help others, naturally people will like you and you will not end up lonely and ignored at the end of your life, as i see some people are.</p>
              <p>I find that when i help others, i become more and more happy. That's why i say i'm having lots of fun with dharma.  When i just enjoy myself and indulge, i get more and more stale and dried up and feel depressed, bored, life is sickening, die faster better... u know that kind of negative mindsets.</p>
              <p>Just live a meaningful life, not just about your own wishes and enjoyment.  Consider others too... there is alot of dharma in that.</p>

              <p>Nobody will be asking you to believe in rebirth and karma, unless you are a Buddhist (and you stated you are Christian) - because as Buddhist we must come to accept these teachings to be considered true Buddhist disciple.</p>

              <p>Nobody will be asking you to believe in rebirth and karma, unless you are a Buddhist (and you stated you are Christian) - because as Buddhist we must come to accept these teachings to be considered true Buddhist disciple.</p>

              <p>Hmm, you don't believe in rebirth and karma, so can you explain why some people are born poor and some are born rich ? Between God's will and karma, which do you think is more logical and more acceptable ?</p>
              <p>By the way, reincarnation is proven except people do not wish to accept it. Read the link below, there are more and more people believe in reincarnation. There are about 20 - 30% of the Americans and Europeans believe in reincarnation. I just want to point out that Buddhists are not the only ones believe in it.</p>
