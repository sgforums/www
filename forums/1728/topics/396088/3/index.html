              <p>Another way  to help your camp prove that your theory is more convincing and more powerful stuff rather than psuedo science.</p>
              <p>Either straits time, or any reputable foerginer country media or any major science body, to get hold of just one freaking people, just one freaking person out of the billions of people in the world, or in history last time, where their past life is someone freaking famous so that more people can related to. Not some ah kao , ah mao, where only a few people knows these past life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SOme one like gandhi, some albert einstein, qin shi huang(chinese emperor), ong teng cheong(our past president), michael jackson, issac newton, princess diana.,,,, i just need one freaking famous name out of the thouands that have passed away so that more people can see and realize.......</p>
              <p>JUST ONE&gt;&gt;&gt;.......!!!!...... i beg... you... just get them on a major media, endorsed by youtube, or facebook CEO,  some Freaking major newspaper.... please.... JUST one will do...</p>

              <p>Even if there are really someone who claim to be the reincarnation of some big guys, the reputable media will also won't publish them because the readers are of mix mindset. They will not want to go to the extent of proving and provide evidence. You may go to the internet and search for the reincarnation of Marilyn Manroe. There are serious talk on the person who claim to to be the reincarnation of Marilyn Manroe. If I am not wrong, there are others who claim to be the reincarnation of some big guys.</p>
              <p>In Tibetan Buddhism, Living Buddha the 16th Karmapa (I believe most of the Buddhists know who he is) left a letter before he passed away. In the letter, he stated clearly his next rebirth, the place, his next life's mother's name and father's name, the year he would be reborn etc. His disciples were instructed to read the letter many years after he passed away. The disciples were supposed to search for him based on the details in the letter.</p>
              <p>The searching process for the 17th Karmapa was recorded in the video from the day the letter was opened till the day they found the 17th Karmapa. When he was found, he was only 4 years old but he knew exactly when his disciples were looking for him as he told his parents that someone would be coming to look for him in few days time and when his disciples found him, he was all ready to go with them.</p>
              <p>I believe all human beings go through the same process, just like all human beings have to die some day, so is reincarnation which is part of the natural process.</p>

              <p>agree with herzog-zwei.</p>
              <p>Reincarnation is just hocus-pocus stuff. Same league as UFO and
              astral travelling.</p>
              <p>Strange evidence they use to justify their theory.</p>
              <p>Just a with weird case studies and people must stubornly claimed
              its link to reincarnation. Gods know the validity of these cases
              studies. So unscientific.</p>
              <p>As what herzog as said, global scientific circle will
              unanimously dismiss such theory as just another psuedoscience.At
              least most of them, cause for some reasons, some scientists can be
              irrational also. Also, if something is scientific, i will surely be
              the first to know, and i can easily check whether certain claims
              has become scientific already with just a simple research.</p>
              <p>Do not link the corpenius theory of spherical earth to justify
              accepting reincarnation. i can also say your science textbook is
              going to become a stack of one thousand dollar for you only because
              you are the chosen one and you just have to believe in it for one
              year. Will u believe me?</p>
              <p>For something to be credile like reincarnation, overwhelming
              evidence must be converging. Nope, it is not happening in this
              issue. Period. 20 years later, there will still be people like you
              posting on the topic of " reincarnation finally accepted"</p>

              <p>What I'd like to say is to keep an open mind.  The research is based on recounts of experiences of subjects.</p>
              <p>To discover anything, we first formulate and or take an existing theory and the proceeds to use existing values and facts to either prove or disprove it.</p>
              <p>Certain belief and "facts" we take for granted will subsequently be found untrue!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Until someone discovers and quantifies  what conciousness is made of or what medium and or receptors related to it, then rebirth may be investigated. Obviously, whatever it is, the conciousness transferred from point of death to point of life must be measured. Currently this out of the scope of established scientific community!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you must, scientifically disprove the methods or the motives of both the subjects and researchers vested.  At the moment, belief in rebirth lies rest on accounts of memories of young subjects, you may speculate that these are" fed" to the subjects. But you have given into speculation without adequate proof of your own! </p>
              <p>What is that you have given is only your opinion!</p>

              <h4 style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><strong><span style="color: purple;"><span style="color: #990000;">When the Body 
                          Disappears.</span></span></strong></h4>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">Remember "con men," 
                          "con 
                          women" as well. These con men can sell you anything! There's one living 
                          in your 
                          mind right now, and you believe every word he says! His name is 
                          Thinking. When 
                          you let go of that inner talk and get silent, you get happy. Then when 
                          you let 
                          go of the movement of the mind and stay with the breath, you experience 
                          even 
                          more delight. Then when you let go of the body ,all these five senses 
                          disappear 
                          and you're really blissing out. This is original Buddhism. Sight, sound,
                           smell, 
                          taste, and touch completely vanish. This is like being in a sensory 
                          deprivation 
                          chamber but much better. But it's not just silence, you just don't hear 
                          anything. It's not just blackness, you just don't see anything. It's not
                           just a 
                          feeling of comfort in the body, there is no body at all.</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">When the body 
                          disappears that 
                          <em>really</em> starts to feel great. You know of all those people who 
                          have out of 
                          the body experiences? When the body dies, every person has that 
                          experience, they 
                          float out of the body. And one of the things they always say is it's so 
                          peaceful, so beautiful, so blissful. It's the same in meditation when 
                          the body 
                          disappears, it's so peaceful, so beautiful, so blissful when you are 
                          free from 
                          this body. What's left? Here there's no sight, sound, smell, taste, 
                          touch. This 
                          is what the Buddha called the mind in deep meditation. <em>When the body 
                          disappears what is left is the mind.</em></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">I gave a simile to a
                           monk the 
                          other night. Imagine an Emperor who is wearing a long pair of trousers 
                          and a big 
                          tunic. He's got shoes on his feet, a scarf around the bottom half of his
                           head 
                          and a hat on the top half of his head. You can't see him at all because 
                          he's 
                          completely covered in five garments. It's the same with the mind. It's 
                          completely covered with sight, sound, smell, taste and touch. So people 
                          don't 
                          know it. They just know the garments. When they see the Emperor, they 
                          just see 
                          the robes and the garments. They don't know who lives inside them. And 
                          so it is 
                          no wonder they're confused about what is life, what is mind, who is this
                           inside 
                          of here, were did I come from? Why? What am I supposed to be doing with 
                          this 
                          life? <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>When the five senses disappear, it's like unclothing the Emperor 
                          and 
                          seeing what is actually in here, what's actually running the show, who's
                           
                          listening to these words, who's seeing, who's feeling life, who this is.
                           When 
                          the five senses disappear, you're coming close to the answer to those 
                          questions. </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">What you're seeing 
                          in such 
                          deep meditation is that which we call "mind," (in Pali it's called 
                          <em>Citta</em>). The Buddha used this beautiful simile. When there is a 
                          full moon 
                          on a cloudy night, even though it's a full moon, you can hardly see it. 
                          Sometimes when the clouds are thin, you can see this hazy shape shining 
                          though. 
                          You know there is something there. This is like the meditation just 
                          before 
                          you've entered into these profound states. You know there is something 
                          there, 
                          but you can't quite make it out. There's still some "clothes" left. 
                          You're still 
                          thinking and doing, feeling the body or hearing sounds. But there does 
                          come a 
                          time, and this is the Buddha's simile, when the moon is released from 
                          the clouds 
                          and there in the clear night sky you can see the beautiful full disc of 
                          the moon 
                          shining brilliantly, and you know that's the moon. The moon is there; 
                          the moon 
                          is real, and it's not just some sort of side effect of the clouds. This 
                          is what 
                          happens in meditation when you see the mind. You see clearly that the 
                          mind is 
                          not some side effect of the brain. <em>You see the mind, and you know the
                           
                          mind.</em> The Buddha said that the mind released is beautiful, is 
                          brilliant, is 
                          radiant. So not only are these blissful experiences, they're meaningful 
                          experiences as well.</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">How many people may 
                          have 
                          heard about rebirth but still don't really believe it? How can rebirth 
                          happen? 
                          Certainly the body doesn't get reborn. That's why when people ask me 
                          where do 
                          you go when you die, "one of two places" I say "Fremantle or Karrakatta"
                           that's 
                          where the body goes!<a href="http://www.dhammaloka.org.au/pubs/bsdha037.html#three"> [3] </a>But
                           is 
                          that where the mind goes? Sometimes people are so stupid in this world, 
                          they 
                          think the body is all there is, that there is no mind. So when you get 
                          cremated 
                          or buried that's it, that's done with, all has ended. The only way you 
                          can argue 
                          with this view is by developing the meditation that the Buddha achieved 
                          under 
                          the Bodhi tree. Then you can see the mind for yourself in clear 
                          awareness - not 
                          in some hypnotic trance, not in dullness - but in the clear awareness. 
                          This is 
                          knowing the mind</p>

              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>When you know that 
                          mind, when 
                          you see it for yourself, one of the results will be an insight that the 
                          mind is 
                          independent of this body. Independence means that when this body breaks 
                          up and 
                          dies, when it's cremated or when it's buried, or however it's destroyed 
                          after 
                          death, it will not affect the mind.</strong><strong> </strong></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>You know this because you see the 
                          nature of 
                          the mind. That mind which you see will transcend bodily death. <em>The 
                          first 
                          thing</em> which you will see for yourself, the insight which is as clear
                           as the 
                          nose on your face, is that <em>there is something more to life than this 
                          physical 
                          body that we take to be me. Secondly you can recognise that that mind, 
                          essentially, is no different than that process of consciousness which is
                           in all 
                          beings.</em> Whether it's human beings or animals or even insects, of any
                           gender, 
                          age or race, you see that that which is in common to all life is this 
                          mind, this 
                          consciousness, the source of doing. </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">Once you see that, 
                          you have 
                          much more respect for your fellow beings. Not just respect for your own 
                          race, 
                          your own tribe or your own religion, not just for human beings, but for 
                          all 
                          beings. It's a wonderfully high-minded idea. "May all beings be happy 
                          and well 
                          and may we respect all nations, all peoples, even all beings." However 
                          this is 
                          how you achieve that! You truly get compassion only when we see that 
                          others are 
                          fundamentally just as ourselves. If you think that a cow is completely 
                          different 
                          from you, that cows don't think like human beings, then it's easy to eat
                           one. 
                          But can you eat your grandmother? She's too much like you. Can you eat 
                          an ant? 
                          Maybe you'd kill an ant because you think that ants aren't like you. But
                           if you 
                          look carefully at ants, they are no different. In a forest monastery 
                          living out 
                          in the bush, close to nature, one of the things you become so convinced 
                          of is 
                          that animals have emotions and , especially, feel pain. You begin to 
                          recognise 
                          the personality of the animals, of the Kookaburras,<em>(Australian bird)</em> of 
                          the mice, the ants, and the spiders. Each one of those spiders has a 
                          mind just 
                          like you have. <em>Once you see that you can understand the Buddha's 
                          compassion 
                          for all beings.</em> You can also understand how rebirth can occur 
                          between all 
                          species - not just human beings to human beings, but animals to humans, 
                          humans 
                          to animals. You can understand also how the mind is the source of all 
                          this.</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">The mind can exist 
                          even 
                          without a body in the realms of ghosts and angels (what we call in 
                          Buddhism 
                          <em>Devas</em>). It becomes very clear to you how they exist, why they 
                          exist, what 
                          they are. These are insights and understandings which come from deep 
                          meditation. 
                          But more than that, when you know the nature of the mind then you know 
                          the 
                          nature of consciousness. You know the nature of stillness. You know the 
                          nature 
                          of life. You understand what makes this mind go round and round and 
                          round, what 
                          makes this mind seek rebirth. You understand the law of <em>Kamma. </em></p>

                          First Knowledge.</span></em> </strong>When the Buddha sat under the Bodhi 
                          tree, 
                          according to tradition he gained three knowledge's. The first knowledge 
                          was the 
                          memory of past lives. When you get close to the mind, there are certain 
                          powers 
                          that come with that experience. The powers are no more than an ability, a
                           
                          dexterity with the use of the mind. It's like the difference between a 
                          dog that 
                          has been running wild and a dog that has been well trained. You can tell
                           the 
                          trained dog to go and pick up the newspaper. It wags its tail and goes 
                          and picks 
                          up the newspaper for you. Some people have got their dogs so well 
                          trained that 
                          they can actually pick up the telephone. Maybe they could answer the 
                          telephone 
                          as well, then that would really save you a lot of time!</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">When you get to 
                          these deep 
                          states of meditation often, the mind becomes well trained. One of the 
                          things 
                          which the Buddha did (and which you can do when you get into deep 
                          meditation) is 
                          tell the mind to go back to the past. What's your earliest memory? Go 
                          back 
                          further and further and further. Monks who do this get early memories of
                           their 
                          childhood. They even get memories of the moment they were born. 
                          Sometimes people 
                          say that when you're born, you have no consciousness because the 
                          neuron's aren't 
                          developed yet, or something like that. But when you re-experience your 
                          birth, 
                          you know that that is just not true. When the memory of your own birth 
                          appears, 
                          it is just like you are there and you experience all feelings of that 
                          birth. 
                          Then you can ask yourself for an even earlier memory, and then you get 
                          back into 
                          your past lives. That's what the Buddha did under the Bodhi tree. 
                          Through 
                          meditation you know rebirth, you know your own past lives. This is just 
                          what 
                          happens with the mind and you know how it happens. That was the first 
                          knowledge 
                          that the Buddha had.</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><strong><em><span style="color: #990000;">The 
                          Second Knowledge.</span></em> </strong>The second knowledge was to know how 
                          you are 
                          reborn. Why you are reborn. Where you are reborn. This is the Law of 
                          <em>Kamma</em>. Someone was showing me a book today which, unfortunately, 
                          we had 
                          for free distribution but which I hadn't seen before. It had some really
                           weird 
                          ideas in it about the Law of <em>Kamma</em>. I think what it said was that
                           if you 
                          read one of the <em>Suttas</em> while you are lying on the ground, you 
                          will be 
                          reborn with a bad back, or something like that. Just stupid ideas! <em>Kamma</em> is much more complex than that and it depends mostly upon the quality of
                           your 
                          intention. The movement of the mind itself is what determines the <em>Kamma</em>,
                           
                          <em>not just the act, but why and where it came from.</em> You can see 
                          this in 
                          meditation, but also you can see just how that mind gets fully 
                          liberated.</p>

                          With understanding of The Four Noble Truths, you realise the Way and 
                          what 
                          enlightenment really means. <em>It means freedom! The mind is liberated, 
                          especially liberated from the body, liberated not just from the 
                          suffering of the 
                          body but liberated from the happiness of the body as well.</em> That 
                          means that 
                          there is no more inclination for sexuality, no fear of pain, no grief 
                          over the 
                          destruction of the body, no ill will and no fear of criticism. Why do 
                          people get 
                          worried about bad words that are said? Only because of ego. They <em>take</em> something to be themselves. Just imagine for a moment being free from 
                          all of 
                          those things. What would that be like, no fear, no craving, no need to 
                          move from 
                          this moment -<em> In other words nothing missing, and nothing left to do,
                           nowhere 
                          to go because you’re completely happy right here no matter what happens!</em> This is what we mean by enlightenment. <em>This meditation is the source 
                          of the 
                          Buddha's enlightenment and the source of every person’s enlightenment.</em></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">There is no 
                          enlightenment 
                          without that meditation. This is why Buddhism is far more than a 
                          psychotherapy. 
                          It's far more than a philosophy. It's far more than a religion. It goes 
                          deep 
                          into the nature of being, and it is accessible to all people. You know 
                          how to 
                          meditate. Teachers are giving all the instructions free without any 
                          charge. Do 
                          you want to do it? Usually the answer is, "Maybe tomorrow but not 
                          today." Never 
                          the less because the seeds have been placed in the mind, because the 
                          meditation 
                          has begun already, there is an interest. Already there is a sense of 
                          this 
                          enlightenment, a fascination for peace, and you will not be able to 
                          resist that 
                          path. You may be able to put it off for a while, maybe for lifetimes, 
                          but it's a 
                          strange thing that, as someone said to me many years ago, <em>"When you 
                          hear 
                          these teachings you can't discard them."</em> You just can't forget them.
                           They 
                          aren't telling you what to believe. They aren't giving you a theory 
                          which is 
                          merely rational. But they are pointing you to something which you can 
                          understand 
                          and experience for yourself, and you get intuitions of this the deeper 
                          you go.</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">The Buddha was a 
                          very 
                          remarkable person, his peacefulness, compassion and wisdom, were 
                          legendary. 
                          There is something about enlightenment that is very attractive. In the 
                          same way 
                          there is something about freedom that you cannot ignore. That is why 
                          little by 
                          little, you will understand what Buddhism is all about. You won't 
                          understand 
                          Buddhism from the books nor will you understand Buddhism from what I 
                          say. 
                          <em>You'll only understand Buddhism in your own experiences of peaceful 
                          meditation.</em> That's where Buddhism is taught. <em>So have fun with 
                          your 
                          meditation and don't be afraid of enlightenment.</em> Get in there, enjoy
                           it, and 
                          you will have no regrets.</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">That's what Buddhism
                           is. 
                          <em>That's it's heart, meditation and enlightenment. That's it's meaning.</em> I 
                          hope you can understand some of this. I can say no more because the time
                           has 
                          gone. I'll complete my talk now.</p>

              <p>yup, i am an atheist. Reincarnation talk has been around for
              centuries already.</p>
              <p>Other than so called these few evidence of people and child
              having those abilities to recall and do certain skills, what else
              have you people found out and develop in this field. See?</p>
              <p>No progress at all. How do i believe in this things when all you
              can show me is this same old recycled information and evidences
              without any progressive information and facts and experiments......
              How?</p>
              <p>I really want to be believe that i have a next life , you know?
              But its just that i do not like to delude myself so easily by all
              these salesman talk. Come on, more obvious things to show me, no
              more examples of miracles children already, i am opening my eyes
              now..</p>
              <p>For example, can you please tell Straits time, or the some
              reputable media , like United nations, or like Nature.com , or
              microsoft, to do a study on this things so that it is more
              convincing for me.</p>
              <p>SGforums + sgforumers telling me that something is true and true
              , and link to some unreputable or bias website, and with same old
              'evidence' ??</p>
              <p>I will be the first to sign up if there is really a afterlife
              for me. really. I hope it true. But you know what? Hoping is
              futile, if you want to have forever life, you must be the miracle
              to achieving it, not by waiting to find out with reincarnation is
              true, because it will never be.</p>

              <p>Another rebirth story is abt a world war two soldier who died in the war. He became a human again in his afterlife.

              <p>Put it this way, "you" are born from a human mother, but you have certain traits of personality and tendencies that is in incongruent with your existence in your mother womb.</p>
              <p>Meaning traits not inherited, do not derive from your parents union, their intelligence, or lack of. Your mother's emotional and physical states affecting the baby. The things that make it an unique "you", inspite of all other suppositions.   </p>
              <p>Rebirth depends on karma, and is not as simplistic as many make out to be.There is a thread on karma, will post it here when I find  it!</p>

              <p>What I am saying here is based on what I have seen on TV shows.</p>
              <p>The man has been reborn into humans multiple times.</p>
              <p>Normally in buddhism , he goes up and down in the 6 realms.</p>
              <p>That man seem to be telling stories that he was reborn everytime as a human, he wont be animal or in other realms.</p>
              <p>This proves that some rebirth stories are not in synch with buddhism theory.</p>
              <p>I dont think that man is virtuous. according to what I have seen , he seems to be a non virtuous man. Yet he can be reborn as a human everytime.</p>
              <p>But nevertheless, I dont believe in karma and rebirth. I am just sharing some interesting stuff i have seen on TV.</p>
              <p>I have some hindu frenz who told me they are human every lifetime too. I ignore them completely. haha lol.</p>

              <p>What I am saying here is based on what I have seen on TV
              shows.</p>
              <p>The man has been reborn into humans multiple times.</p>
              <p>Normally in buddhism , he goes up and down in the 6 realms.</p>
              <p>That man seem to be telling stories that he was reborn everytime
              as a human, he wont be animal or in other realms.</p>
              <p>This proves that some rebirth stories are not in synch with
              buddhism theory.</p>
              <p>I dont think that man is virtuous. according to what I have seen
              , he seems to be a non virtuous man. Yet he can be reborn as a
              human everytime.</p>
              <p>But nevertheless, I dont believe in karma and rebirth. I am just
              sharing some interesting stuff i have seen on TV.</p>
              <p>I have some hindu frenz who told me they are human every
              lifetime too. I ignore them completely. haha lol.</p>

              <p>It is perfectly normal to be reborn consistently as a human. Not everyone has to go to another realm. Lots of people who I know who remember their past lives have also been humans consistently for many lifetimes. In fact I have another friend who remembered a lifetime being a dolphin, however his recent rebirths were all human.</p>

              <p>To understand the concept of rebirth, you have to first understand karma, which is a complex subject to begin with. You version of going up the 6 realms makes me think of anescalator, going up and down! Ha! Ha!(not laughing at you!)</p>
              <p>When we think of cycle of samsara, we are talking of countless lifetimes, for scale, a Arahant will remember up to 500 hundred lifetimes !   </p>

              <p>Often people go to psychiatrist because they are feeling unwell, or unhappy, and very often the problem arises from habitual tendencies. Upon hypnosis, if memories regress to previous life,  then recognizing root cause of habitual tendencies is not a bad thing!</p>

              <p>There are many things which do not need to go through ourselves to know that it is true. Just like do you need to die before you know there is death ? To me, 16th Karmapa was able to foretell his details (parents' name, place and year etc.) for his next rebirth before he passed away is already a solid proof that there is rebirth.</p>
              <p>Below is a video clip from Fox News.  Fox news is a reliable media in U.S. The boy was able to recall details of his past life and proven that what he said were correct. He even caught the attention of the Japanese.</p>
              <p>There are many things which do not need you to believe to happen. Just like death, you believe in it or not or you like it or not, the truth is every human being will die someday.</p>
