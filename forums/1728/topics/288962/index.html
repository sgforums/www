            <div class='col-md body'>It's 5am, I've just awoken out of a nightmare and got up out of bed to post this while it's still fresh in my experience, in my memory.<br><br>In the nightmare I'm walking down some stairs with a female beside me, we start going around the corner, when suddenly, I see the hands and fingers of the female severed from her body and fall to the ground. I don't see what happened or who did it, but instinct has me turning around and going in the opposite direction. I get out of the stairwell and am in the hall when I pass some more stairs and I notice a person coming down those stairs with a large razor-sharp blade in his hand. I don't stop, I keep walking AWAY from this person. But suddenly the dream has turned really intense and this wakes me up.<br><br>This is very much like what happened to me in real life. Life was so difficult, so intense, there was so much suffering from all the thoughts I was having that I was "forced" to wake up. But it was not due to a psycho with a knife, it was due to my own thoughts of growing old, getting sick and dying. This is what forced me out of the dream.<br><br>But I'd like to get back to the exact moment when I woke up out of the dream. Because at that very instant, I had a major insight. I realized fully that the female in the stairwell, the stairwell itself, and myself (in the dream) arose within me, within the dream. I was the consciousness in which all of this dream was taking place.<br><br>Of course it wasn't difficult to "see" that what I was, was also, the consciousness in which all of this so called life is arising also. Even all the gurus and their sites that I frequent on the internet, all are arising from within me. It was also immediately clear that the 3 states, dreaming, waking, sleeping, all arose within me also.<br><br>What is also understood is that you are going to read and take this in at an intellectual level, but what happened upon my "awakening" from the dream was not at the intellectual level. It was much deeper than that. It was at the level of insight, which involves my whole being.<br><br>But the absolute point of this post has to be and remains who or what I am. I am the consciousness in which this post is arising. I am the consciousness that is typing and reading this post.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for sharing <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Was just reminded of this in 'A New Earth' by Eckhart Tolle (though I guess Thusness is going to correct us on the non-duality aspect <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">),<br><br><strong>THE DREAMER AND THE DREAM</strong><br><br>Nonresistance is the key to the greatest power in the universe. Through<br>it, consciousness (spirit) is freed form its imprisonment in form. Inner<br>nonresistance to form Â– whatever is or happens Â– is a denial of the absolute<br>reality of form. Resistance makes the world and the things of the world<br>appear more real, more solid, and more lasting than they are, including your<br>own form identity, the ego. It endows the world and the ego with a heaviness<br>and an absolute importance that makes you take yourself and the world very<br>seriously. The play of form is then misperceived as a struggle for survival,<br>and when that is your perception, it becomes your reality.<br><br>The many things that happen, the many forms that life takes on, are of<br>an ephemeral nature. They are all fleeting. Things, bodies and egos, events,<br>situations, thoughts, emotions, desires, ambitions, fears, drama... they come,<br>pretend to be allimportant, and before you know it they are gone, dissolved<br>into the nothingness out of which they came. Where they ever real? Were<br>they ever more than a dream, the dream of form?<br><br>When we wake up in the morning, the night's dream dissolves, and we<br>say, Â“Oh, it was only a dream. It wasn't real.Â” But something in the dream<br>must have been real otherwise it could not be. When death approaches, we<br>may look back on our life and wonder if it was just another dream. Even now<br>you may look back on last year's vacation or yesterday's drama and see that it<br>is very similar to last night's dream.<br><br>There is the dream, and there is the dreamer of the dream. The dream<br>is a shortlived play of forms. It is the world Â– relatively real but not absolutely real. Then there is the dreamer, the absolute reality in which the forms come and go. The dreamer is not the person. The person is part of the dream. The dreamer is the substratum in which the dream appears, that which makes the dream possible. It is the absolute behind the relative, the timeless behind time, the consciousness in and behind form. The dreamer is consciousness itself Â– who you are.<br><br>To awaken within the dream is our purpose now. When we are awake within the dream, the egocreated earthdrama comes to an end and a more benign and wondrous dream arises. This is the new earth.</div>
