              <p>Namo guru.<br><br>Gurus 
              and yidams, deities of the mandala,<br>Buddhas of the three times and 
              ten directions and your children,<br>Consider me with kindness,<br>Grant
               your blessing that all my wishes be realized.<br><br>Sprung from the 
              snow, mountain of the pure actions and intentions,<br>Mine and those of 
              all sentient beings without limit,<br>May the river of virtue undefiled 
              by the three spheres<br>Flow into the ocean of the four bodies of 
              buddha.<br><br>As long as I have not realized this,<br>Through all my 
              life times, birth after birth,<br>May not even the words for defilement 
              and suffering be heard<br>And may I enjoy the prosperity of oceans of 
              happiness and virtue.<br><br>Having obtained this excellent free and 
              well-favored life<br>Along with faith, energy and intelligence,<br>Having
               attended a worthy master and received the pith of the sacred 
              instructions,<br>May I practice the sacred dharma properly in all my 
              lives without interruption.<br><br>The study of scriptures frees one 
              from the veil of ignorance.<br>The contemplation of oral instructions 
              overcomes the darkness of doubt.<br>Light born of meditation illuminates
               the way things are.<br>May the radiance of the three wisdoms increase.<br><br>The
               significance of the ground is the two truths,<br>free from the extremes
               of eternalism and nihilism.<br>The excellent path, the two 
              accumulations<br>free from the extremes of assumption and denial.<br>The
               result obtained is the two benefits,<br>free from the extremes of 
              existence and peace.<br>May I meet the dharma which is free from error.<br><br>The
               ground of refinement is mind itself, indivisible luminosity and 
              emptiness.<br>The refining, the great vajra composure of mahamudra.<br>What
               is to be refined, the incidental stains of confusion.<br>The result of 
              refining, the unstained dharmakaya, may I realize it.<br><br>Confidence 
              in outlook is cutting assumptions about the ground.<br>The key to 
              meditation is maintaining that without distraction.<br>The supreme 
              activity is to exercise the sense of meditation in everything.<br>May I 
              have confidence in outlook, meditation and activity.<br><br>All dharmas 
              are projections of the mind.<br>As for mind, there is no mind; mind's 
              nature is empty.<br>Empty and immediate, mind appears as everything.<br>Investigating
               it well, may I settle the basic points.<br><br>Appearances, which never
               existed in themselves, have been confused as objects.<br>Awareness 
              itself, because of ignorance, has been confused as a self.<br>Through 
              the power of dualistic fixation I wander in the realm of existence.<br>May
               ignorance and confusion be completely resolved.<br><br>It doesn't 
              exist; even buddhas do not see it.<br>It doesn't not exist; it is the 
              origin of samsara and nirvana.<br>No contradiction; conjunction, the 
              middle way.<br>May I realize the pure being of mind, free of extremes.<br><br>If
               one says "it is this," nothing has been posited.<br>If one says "it is 
              not this," nothing has been denied.<br>Unconditioned pure being 
              transcends intellect.<br>May I gain conviction in the ultimate position.<br><br>Not
               realizing it, one circles in the ocean of samsara.<br>Realizing it, 
              buddha isn't anywhere else.<br>"It is everything." "It isn't anything." 
              None of this.<br>Pure being, the basis of everything, may I see any 
              misunderstanding here.<br><br>Since appearance is mind and emptiness is 
              mind,<br>Since realization is mind and delusion is mind,<br>Since 
              arising is mind and cessation is mind,<br>May all assumptions about mind
               be eliminated.<br><br>Unpolluted by meditation with intellectual 
              efforts,<br>Undisturbed by the winds of everyday affairs,<br>Not 
              manipulating, knowing how to let what is true be itself,<br>May I become
               skilled in this practice of mind and maintain it.<br><br>The waves of 
              subtle and coarse thoughts calm down in their own ground.<br>Motionless,
               the river of mind abides naturally.<br>Free from the contaminations of 
              dullness and torpor,<br>May I establish the still ocean of shamata.<br><br>When
               one looks again and again at the mind which cannot be looked at,<br>And
               sees vividly for what it is, the meaning of not seeing,<br>Doubts about
               the meaning of "is" and "is not" are resolved.<br>Without confusion, 
              may my own face know itself.<br><br>Looking at objects, there is no 
              object, one sees mind.<br>Looking at mind, there is no mind, it is empty
               of nature.<br>Looking at both of these, dualistic clinging subsides on 
              its own.<br>May I realize sheer clarity, the way mind is.<br><br>Free 
              from mental constructions, it is called mahamudra.<br>Free from 
              extremes, it is called madhyamika.<br>Everything complete here, it is 
              also called maha ati.<br>May I attain the confidence that, in 
              understanding one, all are realized.<br><br>The great bliss of 
              non-attachment is continuous.<br>Sheer clarity without fixations is free
               of obscurations.<br>Passing beyond intellect, non-thought is naturally 
              present.<br>May these experiences continually arise without effort.<br><br>Attachment
               to good and fixation on experience subside on their own.<br>Confusion 
              and evil concepts are cleared away in the realm of ultimate nature.<br>In
               the ordinary mind, there is no rejection or acceptance, no separation 
              or attainment.<br>May I realize the truth of pure being, complete 
              simplicity.<br><br>While the nature of beings has always been full 
              enlightenment,<br>Not realizing this, they wander in endless samsara.<br>For
               the boundless suffering of sentient beings<br>May overwhelming 
              compassion be born in my being.<br><br>While such compassion is active 
              and immediate,<br>In the moment of compassion, its essential emptiness 
              is nakedly clear.<br>This conjunction is the undeviating supreme path.<br>Inseparable
               from it, may I meditate day and night.<br><br>From the power of 
              meditation come eyes and actual knowledge,<br>Sentient beings are 
              ripened and domains of enlightenment refined.<br>Aspirations for the 
              realization of all aspects of buddhahood are fulfilled.<br>May I 
              complete these three--fulfillment, ripening and refinement--and become 
              buddha.<br><br>By the compassion of the buddhas and bodhisattvas of the 
              ten directions<br>And the power of whatever pure virtue there may be,<br>May
               my wishes and those of all beings<br>Be fulfilled as we ask in this 
              way.</p>
