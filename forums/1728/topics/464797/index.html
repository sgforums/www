              <p>You digressed.</p>
              <p>The issue is whether reincarnation is a central dogma of Christianity. It would take a lot of Scriptural twisting to make the Bible teach reincarnation as a central dogma.</p>

              <p> I think you have bought the whole Da Vinci Code fiction. With truth there will come falsehoods. You would have to make the case that what is orthodox is actually not. Simply finding so-called lost teachings/gospels does not mean that they are the secret truths. You wouldn't call into question Buddhism if someone says they found texts that are hidden which teach things contrary to what is considered orthodox, right? But it seems that when it comes to Christianity many are happy to just believe anything that might undermine the faith.</p>

              <p>1. I would be frank to say I did not watch. God knows the amount of things and videos I am asked to watch and it would be a long backlog! The OT and NT is the book of the Christians. If you can find any hint of reincarnation it would be in these books, but where? Why appeal to esoteric forms of Judaism? Isn't it because you cannot find it in the main forms? I think this strongly mitigates your position.</p>
              <p>2. It is common to hear that Christianity is all about controlling of people. But is this true? Again such explanations only serve to make truth stronger, that it cannot be denied that there was one faith, one baptism, one God. Since it cannot be denied that the Bible does not teach reincarnation, one has to then appeal to secret texts that teach it!</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><a href="http://www.byomakusuma.org/Teachings/MarshlandFlowersPart2.aspx">http://www.byomakusuma.org/Teachings/MarshlandFlowersPart2.aspx</a><br><br>Issue 38: 15 - 28 October 2007<br><br>…Thousands of meditators around the world have remembered vividly incidents in their past lives.<br><br>So things like rebirth, miracles, the laws of karma may not have been proven yet by 'science'; but that does not warrant throwing them out of the window by calling them unscientific. Science has very little to do with these things and probably never will prove these things as either false or true because, they do not belong to the field of science. And as we have seen, even according to top level scientists it is false to think/ believe that only the narrow and limited field that science deals with is real / actual / true / non – superstitious. This is a kind of fallacious thinking wrought about in the present day due to excessive outdated over-modernistic education which is already getting to be out of date in the western world.<br><br>Since the time of the Buddha till now, for about over 2500 years, reports have come again and again from both Buddhist and non – Buddhist sources of special humans possessing special powers of the mind. Yes there have been fakes who have capitalised on the simple credulous minds; but as the Egyptian Sufi saint of the eleventh century EI Ghazali says, "If there are fake gold that itself is a proof that there is genuine gold. If there were no genuine gold there would be no fake gold."<br><br>In the Indian subcontinent it is not only the Buddhist literature spanning 2500 years of history but also Vedic – Hindu literature and Jain literature which speak of miraculous powers and remembering former lives etc. It is not a matter of one human or twenty humans but virtually unaccountable records when we take into consideration all the Buddhist / Hindu / Jain records. Such a vast array of records even if only anecdotal and not validated by scientific methods just cannot be thrown over-board so easily. And it should not be too, as we have seen that the knowledge based on science is not the only true piece of knowledge we humans should treasure.<br><br>As far as rebirth or re-incarnation goes, Ian Stevenson (MD), the Head of the Department of Parapsychology of Virginia University has done 'scientific research' on this issue, conducting research all over the world from Alaska, Lebanon, India to Sri Lanka. By the so called 'scientific research' it is meant research that is based on double blind methods and such other modus operandi used by science to prove any hypotheses.<br><br>He has come up with a huge four volume work doing research in cases from all around the world, even amongst people who do not have any cultural background regarding reincarnation. Based on his record he says that we can definitely say that science cannot disprove rebirth.<br><br>In the context of Samatha meditation, it is possible to bring back memories of past life, just like memories of this life. This is not easy, but even memories of childhood are not easy. But thousands of meditators around the world have remembered vividly incidents in their past lives. We are not talking about imaginations but memories. There is a qualitative difference in experience between a memory and an imagination. Every mentally healthy person can distinguish whether he is imaging or remembering. After all I remember a past event not a future event while we imagine / fantasise the future.<br><br>Besides the meditators remembering when they go into deep levels of Samatha / Samadhi there are hundreds of cases of young children all around the world who remember, their previous life – their names, family names, city / village / town, the details of their old street / house / rooms and even what was in the cupboard in the room. (To be continued)<br><br><br><br>Issue 39: 29 Oct - 4 November 2007<br><br>Hypnotic trance facilitates revivification of lost memories…<br><br>Reincarnation<br><br>Dr. Ian Stevenson has done a lot of research on such children and he has shifted fraudulent from the genuine. And he has come up with four huge volumes of genuine ones which he says cannot be scientifically disproved in any way. His four volumes are: Cases of reincarnation type: India; Cases of reincarnation type: Sri-Lanka; Cases of reincarnation type: Lebanon and Turkey; and Cases of reincarnation type: Thailand and Burma. He has also written another book - Twenty cases suggestive of reincarnation.<br><br>Then again there is the world famous psychotherapist Helen Wembach, who also used over 20 years of her own clinical work in hypnotherapy. She too claims that even though she herself is a Christian whose beliefs contradict the idea of reincarnation and her training in psychotherapy did not in any way prepare her for this; cases she dealt with for over 20 years, overwhelmingly pointed rather clearly at cases of former lives.<br><br>Hypnotic trance facilitates revivification of lost memories of this life especially those from birth onwards. Everything that the child sees, hears, smells, feels, remembers are stored in the subconscious/unconscious. These memories can be teased out into awareness through various methods like 'free association' in Freudian psychoanalysis, active imagination in Jungian analytical psychotherapy and hypnotherapy etc.<br><br>When Helen Wembach used hypnotherapy, which is a powerful tool to bring out lost memories entrenched stubbornly in the subconscious, she often found that her patients went further than birth into former lives. She also found that if memories and wounds of former lives were healed the effect was seen in this life's mental life. These are records that cannot be easily explained away; as actual mental and physical healings had also taken place.<br><br>I would like to recount the case of a multi-millionaire that Helen had dealt with. One of her patients was a millionaire who had suffered from strong pains in his right ribs. Being a millionaire, he had the best of doctors and his personal physician made him go through all the possible checkups possible at the time in the States. Since no physical cause was found in spite of repeated tests of various kinds, his personal physician finally suggested that it could be of a psychological origin and he should try a psychotherapist as well. Then he met Helen.<br><br>Helen started digging up his subconscious mind to cull out some experience / event in his childhood which could be the cause of his excruciating pain. Many physical pains and pathologies originate in some traumatic experience in childhood. The purpose of all forms of psychotherapy, be it Gestalt psychotherapy, Freudian psychoanalysis, Jungian Analytical psychotherapy, transactional psychotherapy or hypnotherapy or their combinations etc., is to bring the traumatic experiences hidden in the recesses of the subconscious to conscious awareness.<br><br>In both Buddhism and all forms of psychotherapy, awareness is curative. If the root cause (usually traumatic experiences but also sometimes just plain old childhood confusions) is brought clearly in front, to be scanned by awareness, the process of being cured begins. As long as the root causes are hidden in the dark nooks and crannies of the subconscious mind, there is no chance that we can free ourselves from its grasp and all that it entails. That is why Smriti – Samprajanya (mindfulness and comprehension) is of the utmost importance in the Buddhist path be it Sravakayana or Mahayana.<br><br>Even in the loony bin, a person who has flipped out begins to get cured only when he himself becomes aware that he has flipped out. The loony bin is an extreme case where people whose neurotic tendencies have become psychotic; but in society even amongst those who are considered socially acceptable, same neurotic tendencies found in the psychotic to an uncontrollable level, is to be found in a lesser or greater degree. Just like the lunatic we too can get cured or be freed of our neurotic tendencies, only as and when we become aware of them within us.<br><br>Thus awareness is curative and one of the purposes of most therapies is to bring the unconscious into awareness. This is called integrating the unconscious. The unconscious here means all the neurosis and complexes hidden within us. In Buddhist terminology, we can become free of our Klesha (emotional defilements) only if we are fully aware of the workings of the emotional defilements within us. That is why the Shasta (Master) prescribed living ones life in full mindfulness with comprehension - Smriti Samprajanya.<br><br>Going back to the story of the millionaire; while fishing for early memories of childhood, in a hypnotic trance, he suddenly slipped into a dungeon in the Roman period. He started wailing and crying, holding his ribs. When asked what was happening he described that he was in a prison in Rome and a Centaurian was towering over him and kicking him to death. When asked where he was being kicked, he pointed at the same ribs which had been causing him trouble since a long time. Thus he died being kicked on his ribs. When he was brought back to the present, he was commanded that he would remember the incident clearly even after he woke up. After he woke up from the hypnotic trance with full memory of the incident, it was found that he had 'miraculously' become free from the pain that had troubled him for such a long time.

              only serve to make truth stronger, that it cannot be denied that
              there was one faith, one baptism, one God. Since it cannot be
              denied that the Bible does not teach reincarnation, one has to then
              appeal to secret texts that teach it!</p>

              <p>Dear BroInChrist,</p>
              <p>First of all, I didn't say that Christianity believe in reincarnation but I am saying that there is a high possibility that it did because in Judaism, they did believe in reincarnation. We all know that the Christianity came from Judaism. You cannot refute that because the Old Testament and the Torah (jewish bible) are virtually the same. Jesus was a Jew and all the prophets of the Old Testament were Jews as well. The documentary explained that there was a possibility that when the bible was being translated over, it was largely rewritten to suit the needs of the Church. Hence, I am sorry but I cannot believe in most of the things that they say in the bible. In fact, bible scholars who had researched and studied the archaelogical sites in the middle east have come to the conclusion that very little of the bible can be historically verified. Here's a very interesting debate on the topic - 'Is the bible still relevant today' on BBC. It is a forum with bible scholars, Christian, Jewish and Professor Richard Dawkins...</p>

              <p>On the topic of reincarnation, please google 'past life regression'. This is not theological or religious studies anymore, it is documented proof that many people who underwent hypnosis are able to recall their previous lives. Some of these people are able to speak in languages they had never spoken before and some are able to remember details that can be verified to be true and that there's no way they could have known otherwise. If you need proof of that, refer to this site on what some professors and doctors have commented on the research of past lives:-</p>

              <p>I just type reincarnation in Youtube and there's a whole slew of documentaries that showcases people from all over the world with evidence of a previous life.

              <p>1. Not only does Christianit not teach reincarnation remotely (not to say central dogma!), neither does Judaism teach reincarnation remotely. I have read the OT through before and there is nothing therein to suggest reincarnation. Consider Genesis 1 and 2 where God created. If reincarnation was true, it wouldn't make sense there at all.</p>
              <p>2. You cannot believe all the things in the Bible but you can believe all the things that people say about the Bible? Why?</p>
              <p>3. The idea that religion exists to control people is an argument without merit. People who tout this line of argument cannot produce any evidence to support this. Yes, there are instances whereby religious leaders have controlled their flock, but that would be to throw out the baby with the bath water.</p>
              <p>4. The Bible mentions the existence of fallen angels that have been around for a long time and have lived alongside people for thousands of years. I believe the so-called memories of past lives from hypnoticism is a result of diabolical influences from such spirits to mislead mankind. When you undergo hypnoticism you allow yourself to be influenced by man and any spiritual powers. Can you say this is impossible? I would say it is evidence that there is a supernatural realm, but Christians already know this, but this does not prove reincarnation.</p>

              <p>Whether it was mere grammar or not, I don't think it can be verified.</p>
              <p>But compare this with the Bible, written less than 60 years of the events that transpired, with more than 24000 extant manuscripts, and textual criticism shows that the texts are almost 99% similar with the rest being shown to be spelling errors or minor copying errors which do not affect any doctrines. Yet we still hear allegations that the Bible has been being changed and rewritten? Wouldn't you agree that such allegations are spurious and stem from ignorance?</p>

              <p>Dr francesca stavrakopoulou in the video above is a biblical scholar and historian. She tells us that according to archaelogy and scriptural research (meaning they look into the difference between the original Hebrew text and compare it with the modern Christian bible) concludes that much of the bible is fiction. However, majority of scholars still believe that Jesus did exist. </p>

              <p>Got mixed opinions after watching it... i feel it will be good if people choose to believe in God and do good for the society. But, on the other hand, not so good if they insist what they think is the truth and hard-sell to non-believers...</p>

              <p>Yes, I totally agree with you. I think that any of the major religions have a role and purpose in the spiritual development of an individual. Buddhism may work for some of us and it may not work for others. The same thing it would be for Christianity. However, If you ask me, it is a lot easier to embrace Christianity because it is a relatively easy faith to understand and embrace when compared to the philosophy-heavy Buddhism. This does not mean it is better or worse, it is just an observation of mine. </p>

              <p>You can actually read about this in Genesis 1 and 2. It will answer what role God gave to man on earth. Anything but mundane and no death at all.</p>

              <p>Sorry, the book of genesis is a chapter of the bible that I find it the hardest to believe in. The story of our creation cannot be that simplistic. Anyway, here's an interesting documentary I watched recently of a biblical scholar of what she thought of the Garden of Eden:- </p>
