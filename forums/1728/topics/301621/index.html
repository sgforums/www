            <div class='col-md body'>I can't remember what was the exact date of the article, but I remember it was published in Straits Times and it mentioned that more and more people are getting religious in Singapore and provided statistics to give the readers an overall picture.<br><br>I shall be discussing only about Christianity and Buddhism here for the following reasons:<br><br><strong>1) Differences in essential beliefs and approach</strong><br><br>It is common knowledge that Christianity is very proactive in spreading their teachings to the masses. This is assumed to be the common understanding for all who are reading this topic.<br><br>However, most of the other religions in Singapore, some which are monotheistic like Christianity, do not proactively try to convert others to their faith while Buddhism, in essence, is neither monotheistic or pantheistic and its approach towards conversion or spreading the faith is viewed by most as passive and at times indifferent. Hence it is worth learning and discussing about.<br><br><strong>2) Medium of communication</strong><br><br>Most Singaporeans, especially the younger generation now, are readily exposed to different world cultures and thinking, especially Western ones and enjoy speaking, reading and thinking in English. It is a known fact that English is the preferred and commonly used language in the spread of Christianity in Singapore, though not exclusively. Whereas in temples and related Buddhist organisations, the general impression is that there are more materials in Mandarin compared to that in English.<br><br>Yet, I must add that more and more Buddhist organisations are realising the need to reach out to English-educated youths and adults interested in learning about Buddhism and have been proactive in making various English works about Buddhist teachings easily accessible and available to this group and the general public.<br><br><strong>3) Youthful or Elderly image?</strong><br><br>Partly linked to the reason above, it is widely observed that youths and young adults who speak, read and think in English are usually later found out to be either Christians or Catholics. Compare this to that who are later known to be Buddhists (excluding those who still believe in and practise taoist and folk beliefs).<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If a free thinker member of the public is deciding between Christianity and Buddhism, and asks me about what I know about Buddhism, what should I tell him/her?<br><br>My knowledge is pretty limited, but I will not just tell him to go read books and watch any audio-visual materials on his own.<br><br>I will provide him/her a simple summary plus short elaboration on what I know about Buddhism so far at that particular point in time:<br><br>1) Buddhism is neither monotheistic nor pantheistic.<br><br>2) Buddha is not a God and neither is he a creator of living or non-living things.<br><br>3) The relationship between Buddha and us is that of teacher and student whereas for other monotheistic religions, it is primarily that of a master and servant.<br><br>4) Buddhism teaches us that the most important thing is to understand the laws of Cause and Effect for all things in the universe, and the primary goal of practising the Buddha's teachings is not just to do good and earn merits for a good life in the present and thereafter, but to aim for progress in cultivation which helps us to be completely free from endless cycles of birth and death as different form of living beings. And in doing so, we must also help others to be free from future rebirths.<br><br>5) All living beings have the potential to become a Buddha, a completely awakened being, who has achieved perfection in all aspects of human virtues and wisdom through diligent and determined practice of the Truth during countless rebirths. Whereas for other monotheistic religions, the most you can attain while in Heaven with God is to become the best follower or servant of God. You can never become God. There is only One God.<br><br>6) The ultimate aim of a Buddhist practioner is to become a Buddha, be it for one who starts from either Hinayana practice or Mahayana practice. It is mentioned or more or less directly implied by the Buddha himself that eventually all beings will attain Buddhahood in their own time and space.<br><br>When you attain Buddhahood, your status, wisdom and compassion is the same as the Buddhas before you and Buddhas yet to be.<br><br>After telling him/her roughly the above, I will take my leave and not talk further about the differences between Buddhism and other religions, as a mark of respect.<br><br></div>

Indeed it can be a little regrettable if the general view of Buddhism is that of a religion which revolves mainly around joss stick and praying to many deities (which is not true at all) and this view is further reinforced by those who were previously half-taoist and half buddhists but has since converted to other religions.<br><br>It is my concern too on how to reach out to the masses without coming across as being pushy or manipulative.<br><br>As said by justdoit, the only thing we can do is to improve the public's view about Buddhism is to consistently apply the teachings into our lives and let our positive changes in behaviour be our best spokesperson.<br></div>
