Out of empathy and compassion, we should definitely help. Though others created the causes to experience their difficulties, maybe they also created the causes to receive help from us! We are all alike in wanting happiness and trying to avoid pain. It does not matter whose pain or problem it is - we should try to relieve it. For example, to think, "The poor are poor because of their own past lives' miserliness. <span class="large"><span style="color: red;">I would be interfering with their karma if I tried to help," is a cruel misconception. We should never rationalize our own laziness, apathy or smugness by misinterpreting cause and effect. Compassion and universal responsibility are important for our own spiritual development and world peace</span>.</span><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Buddhism is not about accepting the teaching wholeheartedly, and Buddha encourages us to question, investigate and experience it for ourselves.  I'm not saying that you have to commit the sin now to see if you get the kind of karma. Anyway, it's a quote by Venerable Hai Tao, so you may wish to bring this question to him directly when he next visits Singapore.  Alternatively, you can seek also seek the advice of any sanghas around.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Buddhism, therefore, teaches <span class="large"><strong>the individual to take full responsibility for themselves</strong>.</span> For example, if you want to be wealthy then be trustworthy, diligent and frugal, . There is no God to ask favours from, or to put it another way, <strong>there is no corruption possible in the workings of Kamma. </strong><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The nature of samsaric evolution is not such that death is followed by<br>nothingness, nor that humans are always reborn as humans and insects as<br>insects. On the contrary, we all carry within us the karmic potencies of all<br>realms of cyclic existence. Many beings transmigrate from higher to lower<br>realms, others from lower to higher. The selection of a place of rebirth is<br>not directly in our own hands but is conditioned by our karma and delusions.<br>They who possess spiritual understanding can control their destiny at the<br>time of death, but for ordinary beings the process is very much an automatic<br>chain reaction of karmic seeds and habitual psychic response patterns....<br><br>Our repeated experience of frustration, dissatisfaction and misery does not<br>have external conditions as its root cause. The problem is mainly our lack<br>of spiritual development. As a result of this handicap, the mind is<br>controlled principally by afflicted emotions and illusions. Attachment,<br>aversion and ignorance rather than a free spirit, love and wisdom are the<br>guiding forces. Recognizing this simple truth is the beginning of the<br>spiritual path.<br><br>-- by H.H. the Dalai Lama, translated and edited by Glenn Mullin, from "The<br>Path to Enlightenment", published by Snow Lion Publications</div>
