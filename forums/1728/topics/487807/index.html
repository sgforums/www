              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>The Buddhist theory of momentariness
              implies that every duration in time consists of point-instants which following
              on one another. Every extension in space consists of point instants arising in
              very close nearness and in very rapid succession to each other giving the
              impression of stability to things we detect. There is no Time, Space and Motion
              over and above these point instants. Entities that are constructed from these
              point instants are by our imagination.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>The realist considered both Time
              and Space as two all embracing receptacles containing each of them the entire
              universe. They are unique in themselves and the names given to them are proper
              names and not general terms. Different times are parts of the same Time, so are
              divided spaces part of the same Space. It is therefore the objects that are
              situated in them that are divided. Space and Time are two separate realities.
              In early Buddhism, space was considered a real element of the universe. It was
              considered to be unchanging, eternal, an all embracing element.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The Buddhist logician denied the reality of both Time
              and Space. To be real, a thing has to possess separate efficiency of its own.
              Space and Time does not possess such quality. They cannot be separated from
              things existing in them. Hence, they are not separate entities. It is because
              of our productive imagination that we are able to distinguish between the
              things and its receptacle. Every point instant may be viewed as a particle of
              Time or Space and as a quality based on our differing mental attitudes. When a
              point instant, the ultimate real is cut loose from our imagination it is
              without quality, timeless and is not divisible. To the Buddhist logicians, only
              subtle time of the point instants is real. Space and gross time are not
              separate entities. They are a priori intuitions, and not objects of the five
              types of sense experience. Hence it is nothing but an illusion of the intellect.
              Their empirical origin cannot be conceived, but they can be dialectically
              destroyed on the score that duration and extension commonly used in everyday
              life contains contradictions and cannot be accepted as objectively real. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">To the realists, empirical
              things have a limited real extension. They are created by nature, by the will
              of sentient beings or the power of God and are made up of atoms to form real
              entities. This individual entity resides simultaneously in their own multitude
              of atoms, i.e. a reality that is residing at once in many places. To the
              Buddhist, this whole, this extension is a fiction as one real thing cannot
              reside in many places at once. The whole is dependent on the simultaneous
              appearance of its parts for its existence. Only these parts, the point-instants
              are real.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The realist also believes
              that stability and duration can be proven by the fact that things endures and
              produces gradually a series of sensation one after another through our ability
              of Recognition. For example, cognition of the pattern, ‘this is that same
              person I have seen before’. To the Buddhist, there is already </span><span style="font-size: 13pt;">a linguistic fallacy in the judgment. The element
              ‘this’ refer to the present, a sensation and to a real object. The element
              ‘that’ refers to the past, it is produced by our imagination from our memory.
              The element ‘this’ and ‘that’ are two completely different elements which have
              nothing in common. Their unity cannot be reconciled. If such things could be
              identical, there is no reason why the whole Universe should not be composed of
              identical things.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">The function of memory is limited to the past and
              cannot grasp the present moment. So is sensation, whose function is limited to
              the present and cannot apprehend the past. Memory and sensation have their own
              field of actions and results. They cannot work in the field of the other.
              Recognition should not be distinguished from thought constructed memory which
              is not a direct reflex of reality. Thus recognition does not prove the
              existence of duration.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>The
              realists also </span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>argued that
              time exist because it has dimension. It can be measured in terms of moments,
              days, months, and years. Nagarjuna pointed out that it is not possible to
              measure time. He maintained that non-enduring or non-static time cannot be
              measured, because it cannot be manipulated. Enduring or static time, although can
              be manipulated, does not exist. It is a creation of our intellect. To the
              Buddhists, time is composed of
              moments. Two or more things cannot be related unless they are in
              simultaneous coexistent. Hence, if present and future are held to be
              dependently related to the past, then both present and future should exist in
              the past. Otherwise they cannot be contingently related. If a thing can exists
              for more than a moment, than there is no reason why it cannot survive and exist
              for eternity, which is not possible. On the other hand, present and future
              could not exist without being contingent on the past. Hence, according to Nagarjuna,
              there is no justification for the recognition of a present and a future time. If a thing can have real duration through
              several moments, it would represent a real unity existing at once at different
              times. </span></p>

              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>Thus
              to the Buddhist, ultimate reality is timeless, spaceless and also motionless in
              the sense of having no duration, extension and no movement. It is a
              mathematical point-instant, an action of efficiency.</span></p>
