              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>This book’s title conveys its central point—that despite tremendous
              internal diversity, all Buddhist traditions derive from one teacher, the
              Buddha. Because they all revere the same teacher, these various forms of
              Buddhism could respect and learn from each other. Nevertheless, Buddhists often
              conflict sharply over whose texts and teachings represent the “real” teachings
              of the Buddha. These disagreements intensify because Buddhist texts are
              preserved in three rather different canons in three languages: Pali, Chinese,
              and Tibetan. Different schools of Buddhism have been widely separated
              geographically and had little contact with each other until recently. Though
              some Western Buddhists willingly study with teachers from several Buddhist
              schools, such a practice is not usual among Asian Buddhists, or even among many
              Western Buddhists. Some Buddhist teachers working in the West actively
              discourage their students from studying with other teachers. Thus, despite
              Buddhism’s emphases on compassion and right speech, Buddhists indulge in a
              great deal of sectarianism across denominational lines.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>All current forms of Buddhism derive from two different sets of South
              Asian literature written in either Pali or Sanskrit, but there is little
              overlap between those two sets of texts. Sanskrit versions of some Pali texts
              once circulated, but they have been lost. The Chinese canon includes
              translations of many Pali and Sanskrit texts, but Chinese translations of the
              Pali texts often contain material not found in the Pali version. Theravada
              Buddhists accept only the Pali literature as the “word of the Buddha” and
              regard most surviving Sanskrit literature as untrustworthy later innovations.
              By contrast, the Tibetan canon consists mainly of Mahayana texts translated
              from Sanskrit, the same texts that Theravada Buddhists regard as inauthentic.
              When they talk about “what the Buddha taught,” Tibetan and Theravada Buddhists
              refer to completely different sets of texts.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>The potential for mutual disregard between Tibetan and Theravada
              Buddhisms is therefore very high. When we remember that the so-called <em>hinayana</em>,
              or “lower vehicle,” of the Tibetan three-<em>yana </em>system (Hinayana,
              Mahayana, Vajrayana) contains teachings characteristically found in Pali
              literature, this potential is intensified. Tibetan teachers and scholars are
              usually not well acquainted with Pali Buddhist literature and regard their
              Mahayana and Vajrayana teachings as superior. Returning the compliment, some
              Theravadins regard anything Mahayana to not even really be Buddhism. For example,
              some Theravadins reject restoring monastic ordination for women, because that
              practice has survived only among Chinese Mahayana Buddhists. This division is
              common even among Western scholars. Few Western scholars of Buddhism are as
              familiar with Pali literature and Theravada Buddhism as they are with Mahayana
              Buddhisms, whether Chinese or Tibetan, and with Sanskrit literature—and vice
              versa. Most Western Buddhist teachers are very undereducated about Buddhist
              history and with the literature of forms of Buddhism different from the lineage
              in which they teach.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>How very refreshing, in the midst of this sectarianism, for the Dalai
              Lama, the best-known representative of Tibetan Buddhism, and his coauthor, the
              American nun Thubten Chodron, to publish a book proclaiming that the Pali and
              Sanskrit traditions are more similar than different and acknowledging the debts
              of the younger Sanskrit tradition to the older Pali tradition! They encourage
              mutual respect and study between the two traditions. The familiar terms <em>Hinayana</em>,
              <em>Mahayana</em>, and <em>Theravada </em>are not used even once in this
              book, encouraging us to take a fresh look at familiar Buddhist conventions, no
              matter what form of Buddhism we may adhere to. Nor do these authors rank the
              two traditions hierarchically, despite the fact that each has a history of
              denigrating the other.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Throughout the book, the authors suggest that geographical distance and
              different languages previously made it difficult for Buddhists of differing
              orientations to have accurate information about each other. Gossip and
              stereotypes flourish in such an environment. Some claim that most tantric monks
              drink alcohol and engage in sex while others claim that members of older
              Buddhist schools do not value compassion or understand emptiness. The authors
              frequently plead with all Buddhists to give up such mutual stereotyping and
              instead to talk with each other, study each other’s scriptures, and learn from
              each other’s practices—familiar advice in the arena of interreligious
              interchange, but sadly infrequent in Buddhist circles.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>One can learn a great deal about both the Pali and the Sanskrit
              traditions from <em>One Teacher, Many Traditions</em>, which covers all the
              topics found in any standard, more academic survey of Buddhism. The level of
              scholarship informing this book is very high, and the information provided
              about both the Pali and the Sanskrit traditions is accurate and complete. The
              Dalai Lama is, of course, very familiar with the Sanskrit tradition. But
              neither his nor Thubten Chodron’s initial training would have involved
              significant study of the Pali tradition. The Pali suttas, thought by many to be
              our closest approximation to the actual teachings of the historical Buddha, are
              largely unknown to Tibetan Buddhists. Certainly the scholarly Pali commentaries
              frequently cited in this book are not part of the training received by those
              educated in the Sanskrit tradition. Thus, these authors present an admirable
              model for other Buddhists. They suspend conventions previously learned in their
              own tradition and deeply study a different tradition. Most important, they
              study its own texts, rather than relying on polemical comments about that
              tradition in texts of their own tradition.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>We should all be willing to suspend skepticism about unfamiliar forms of
              Buddhism and explore their texts and practices deeply and without
              presuppositions. If we do this hard work, we will find that these unfamiliar
              Buddhisms make sense in their own terms and deserve our respect. Whether they
              turn out to be more similar to or more different from our own Buddhism is
              irrelevant. If we investigate these myriad versions of Buddhism, we will
              understand how all of them are derived from the teachings of the one teacher we
              all revere.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Among this book’s many virtues is its authors’ use of “she” rather than
              “he” as the generic pronoun. Given that many Buddhists are not sensitive to the
              need for gender-inclusive, gender-neutral language, such usage by an important
              leader is noteworthy. Granted, “she” is not neutral either, but its
              consciousness-raising and corrective potential in male-dominated contexts is
              enormous. One hopes that other Buddhist teachers and authors will take note and
              follow suit.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>My praise for the book notwithstanding, I am not without reservations.
              The overarching framework of the book is the claim that the Buddha taught the
              three vehicles: the Hearer Vehicle (<em>Sravakayana</em>), the Solitary
              Realizer Vehicle (<em>Pratyekabuddhayana</em>), and the Bodhisattva Vehicle (<em>Bodhisattvayana</em>).
              (These three vehicles are not the same as those more familiar to students of
              Tibetan Buddhism—Hinayana, Mahayana, and Vajrayana—and throughout this book,
              when they talk about the “three yanas,” the authors always mean the older
              system of Hearer, Solitary Realizer, and Bodhisattva Vehicles, not the much
              later system specific to Tibetan Buddhism.) A few sentences later, we read that
              those training in the Pali tradition primarily practice the Hearer Vehicle
              while those training in the Sanskrit tradition primarily practice the
              Bodhisattva Vehicle.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Two critical questions emerge from these claims. Is this the old
              “Hinayana/ Mahayana” rhetoric reappearing under different names? The authors
              make it clear that readers should not draw that conclusion, but given the
              tendency among contemporary teachers in the Tibetan tradition to denigrate and
              dismiss the Pali texts and tradition, great care must be taken not to slip into
              this old habit. Tibetan teachers frequently refer to these earlier three yanas
              (Hearer, Solitary Realizer, and Bodhisattva), usually ranking them hierarchically.
              The Hearer Vehicle is evaluated as having a “lower view” than the Bodhisattva
              Vehicle, something to which I can attest from listening to oral teachings by
              Tibetan teachers. Did the historical Buddha himself teach these three vehicles?
              Texts from many historical periods are attributed to “the Buddha,” which means
              that one cannot take a claim that something was taught by the Buddha at face
              value. Most scholars of Buddhist history conclude that the hearer, solitary
              realizer, and bodhisattva system post-dates the historical Buddha by centuries.
              It is much more prevalent in the younger Sanskrit tradition than the older Pali
              tradition, though it is also found in Pali texts. Thus, while the authors are
              certainly correct in their claims that the Sanskrit and the Pali traditions
              have much in common, even this early three-yana system might not be the best
              choice for the book’s overarching organizational framework.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 12.0pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>The great strength of <em>One Teacher, Many Traditions</em> is the
              authors’ empathetic and even-handed presentation of both traditions. They claim
              that the Hearer, Solitary Realizer, and Bodhisattva Vehicles are all taught in
              both the Pali and Sanskrit traditions, an accurate claim. They also point out
              that the Bodhisattva Vehicle is not limited to the Sanskrit tradition but is
              practiced in the Pali tradition, both historically and in contemporary times.
              This reality, unknown to most Mahayanists, undercuts Mahayana claims about its
              superiority. Most notably, these authors break with the usual Tibetan
              evaluation of these three yanas by not ranking them hierarchically. One can
              hope that the examples set by these authors becomes the model for Buddhist
              teachers when they discuss the vast diversity within Buddhism.</span></p>
