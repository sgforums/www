              <p>From the last pages of 'True Meditation' by Adyashanti (good book and audio CD! good meditation instructions)</p>
              <p>TS: I've heard you say that you don't believe that awakening - defined as a fundamental shift of identity out of the personality and into awareness itself - is actually that rare. And that in fact this belief that awakening is rare is actually an obstacle to awakening. You don't think that awakening is rare?</p>
              <p>Adya: No.</p>
              <p>TS: Why is this belief an obstacle?</p>
              <p>Adya: Because almost all of us feel like we're not the chosen ones. Most of us feel pretty ordinary when you get right down to it. If you have this unconscious or conscious belief that awakening is only for very extraordinary people, that totally contradicts our sense of ourselves. This idea may be the most powerful impediment to awakening. Our examples of awakening feed this. We have images of the awake being, and they are halo-enshrouded, with long hair, flowing gowns, and if they're doing anything in life they are always teaching, they always have disciples, they always have people following at their feet. These images are out there, and yet it's simply not so. It's very hard for our minds to get that enlightenment can look like your grandmother or your grocer. It doesn't need to look in any way extraordinary. Some enlightened beings are very charismatic. But you know what? Some unenlightened beings are very charismatic. But these images really get in the way. Awakening isn't about becoming extraordinary. If anything, it's about becoming ordinary. It's about becoming who we really, really are.</p>
              <p>TS: I think one of the reasons some people believe awakening is rare is because they have been practicing meditation for twenty or thirty years and they haven't made the kind of breakthrough discoveries that you describe for yourself, and so there is a certain grumpiness or cynicism and a belief that enlightenment must be only for the rare few. Otherwise, they'd have to believe that there was something wrong with them or that they were a failure in some way.</p>
              <p>Adya: That's one place their mind could go.</p>
              <p>TS: Or that the path they're following isn't working.</p>
              <p>Adya: Ah! That's a more threatening idea. Of course that's what I think contributed to my own awakening. I didn't blame it on the path but on my relationship with the path. That's why I encourage people to shake it up, shake it loose, let yourself question, open it up a bit. Don't be afraid to question. Look at yourself and see what hasn't worked. And have the courage to change, to move on if something's not working. Look with innocent eyes, very innocent, very open. That innocence is always there. it's a sense of wonder.</p>

              <p><strong>About the Author</strong></p>
              <p>Adyashanti (whose name means "primordial peace") dares all seekers of peace and freedom to take the possibility of liberation in this life seriously. He began teaching in 1996, at the request of his Zen teacher with whom he had been studying for fourteen years. Since then, many spiritual seekers have awakened to their true nature while spending time with Adyashanti.</p>
              <p>The author of <em>Emptiness Dancing, The Impact of Awakening </em>and <em>My Secret Is Silence, </em>Adyashanti offers spontaneous and direct nondual teachings that have been compared to those of the early Zen masters and Advaita Vedanta sages. However, Adya says, "If you filter my words through any tradition or '-ism,' you will miss altogether what I am saying. The liberating truth is not static; it is alive. It cannot be put into concepts and be understood by the mind. The truth lies beyond all forms of conceptual fundamentalism. What you are is the beyond - awake and present, here and now already. I am simply helping you to realize that."</p>
              <p>A native of Northern California. Adyashanti lives with his wife, Annie, and teaches extensively in the San Francisco Bay Area, offering satsangs, weekend intensives, and silent retreats. he also travels to teach in other areas of the United States and Canada.

                  First Awakening</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;">At his
                  <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">first breakthrough</span></em> he was twenty-five years old. It 
              came after 
                  six to eight months of pushing and intensive striving. He was nearly
               going 
                  crazy. So he sat down to meditate, stuffing five years of effort 
              into one 
                  minute. After muttering, “I can’t do this” several times, everything
               started 
                  to relax. In this relaxation, an inward implosion occurred. It was 
              like 
                  being plugged into a wall socket when the heart was beating louder 
              and the 
                  breathing got more laboured. He felt like dying. At that point, as 
              soon as 
                  he did not mind dying, all the energy disappeared and he was in 
              space. He 
                  became space and there was a fantastic amount of downloading of 
              insights 
                  into his system. The downloading was so fast and furious that he 
              could not 
                  decipher what they were. This downloading of insights went on for a 
              while 
                  and then it stopped. Then he got off his cushion, and he bowed to 
              the Buddha 
                  figure. After that he laughed loud because he realized that he got 
              what he 
                  was chasing. He was chasing what he already was. This was the first 
                  awakening.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;">Once he 
                  stepped outside, a voice kept on informing him that, “There’s more 
              to this. 
                  You haven’t seen the whole thing. Keep going. Don’t stop here.” From
               that 
                  moment onwards, his spiritual seeker energy disappeared and never to
               come 
                  back any more. Why try so hard to become what he already was. He was
               it, but 
                  he must find out what was this? So he continued meditating a lot. In
               the 
                  next five to six years what happened spiritually to him was not when
               he was 
                  meditating. The spiritual improvement was actually happening in his 
              daily 
                  life. He was still training as a competitive racing bicyclist, which
               gives 
                  him a good self-image, as a high-calibre athlete. He was still 
              domineering 
                  toward people in this competitive racing.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;">At 
                  twenty-six years old, he developed an obscure illness. This put him 
              to bed 
                  for six months. He was rather dysfunctional during this period. So 
              at the 
                  end of the illness he gave up the idea of being an athlete, which is
               very 
                  liberating. A year later, he went on the binge by training again. 
              Another 
                  six months of illness came again: sinus infection, lung infection 
              and 
                  mononucleosis. This time the school of hard knocks really make him 
              let go of 
                  this self-image, but not the meditation.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;">During 
                  the same time, he went through an unhealthy and ridiculous 
              relationship. It 
                  gave him an image of being a nice, good person and a helper. It was 
              phoney 
                  and false. So he broke up this relationship. And together with the 
              last 
                  illness, he was free again. It was wonderful to be empty in space 
              again.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;">He got 
                  married at thirty-three years old, and took on a real job 
              apprenticing 
                  himself with his father’s business. Having to put his life on hold 
              until now 
                  because of his chasing for enlightenment, he decided to get on with 
              his 
                  daily life. This is his personal spiritual progress. Two months 
              later, his 
                  second awakening happened. His marriage provided the stability for 
              his 
                  inward journey.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> </span></span><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"><span style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: 700;" lang="EN-GB">Second 
                  Awakening</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;">The 
                  night before the happening he was sitting on the edge of the bed, a 
              thought 
                  came through his mind. It said: “I’m ready”. This started the 
              happening, but 
                  he went to sleep. The next day, when he started to meditate, within 
              thirty 
                  seconds, he heard a bird chirp. And spontaneously a question arose: 
              “Who 
                  hears this sound?” At that moment of this question everything went 
              upside 
                  down: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the bird, the sound and the hearing were one thing.</span> Literally, 
                  they were experienced as exactly the same…the hearing was no more he
               than 
                  the sound and the bird and anything. It was very quick, very sudden,
               and it 
                  was just one.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;">The next 
                  thing that happened was some distant thought. He cannot remember 
              what the 
                  thought was about, but he knew that the thought was not him. He knew
               that 
                  the thought and the awakened self are completely separate. There was
               zero 
                  identity in the thought. After a few minutes he got up to check the 
              rooms 
                  and the contents of the house and his wife sleeping.  They were all 
              part of 
                  him. However there were no joyous emotions in this awakening. After 
              these 
                  movements consciousness woke up, but it was completely separate from
               the 
                  body. Now he realized that all those trapped images were not his 
              previous 
                  incarnations. He was asleep during those incarnations. He is now 
              awake and 
                  all the previous forms including the present one were not real. Now 
              this 
                  awakeness has no form, no shape, no colour, no nothing. No location 
              but 
                  everywhere. This awakeness was everything and yet beyond everything.
               If all 
                  the forms and everything that he saw disappeared, <em>this</em> that 
              he 
                  realized will not diminish one bit. This is the result of his 
              awakening.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;">He now 
                  felt the sense of being bigger and outside the body. He also felt 
              that body 
                  was within this awakeness or spirit. When the awakeness or 
              consciousness 
                  came back into the body, it is also outside: so it is both outside 
              and 
                  inside. He now also realizes that this current incarnation was 
              merely a 
                  clothing to wear this time, and he was to function through this 
              form. He now 
                  felt a great joy with this body/incarnation. Now with this awakening
               the 
                  very first step that he took was like a baby’s first step! This is a
               
                  miracle. This is heaven: this life, this body. The great joke is “he
               was 
                  walking in god’s hand looking for god”. He now knew that there was 
              no 
                  necessity to experience anything extraordinary. This ordinary life 
              is 
                  totally satisfying and is a sort of a miracle.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;">From now 
                  onwards there was nothing to be searched any more and no more 
              question to be 
                  answered. The outcome of this achievement is that there are no words
               like 
                  ‘wisdom’ or ‘love’ to epitomize it. It is as if he had reached the 
              source, 
                  which turned out to be the unknown. The unknown in Buddhism is 
              emptiness or 
                  void or sunnata. So now he knew what he was and he was emptiness, a 
              mystery. 
                  It is like the “ I AM” in the bible, and there is no explanation on 
              what 
                  this “I AM” is.</span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;">When a 
                  book or a phrase sparks something in one, it is at the level of 
              insight, not 
                  the mind. His body then sings with the insight. All words and books 
              can 
                  carry some transmission of the author to the reader. Sometimes the 
                  transmission can be very powerful: it is because of the author’s 
              words, 
                  especially when there is a resonance to what is offered. The 
              resonance 
                  ignites a potential, which then has to be worked out by the 
              recipient, not 
                  the author. We have to become responsible for our own 
              transformation.</span></span></p>
