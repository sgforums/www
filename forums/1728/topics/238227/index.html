Buddhism in general does not encourage dream interpretation.<br><br><blockquote>If you want to continue to be a devoted yogi, generally you should never cling to dreams. If you do, you will eventually expose yourself to the influence of the four maras. If your dreams are positive, do not have any expectations. If we are filled with hopes and expectations, even positive things can turn negative. If your dreams are negative, don't take them too seriously. Learn to see negative dreams as illusion, not real. Then, although a dream seems negative, because we realize that it isn't real, it becomes a positive thing that prepares us for further development and realization in the spiritual path. This is the practice of a yogi.<br><br>-- from The Life of Gampopa by Jampa Mackenzie Stewart, just published by Snow Lion Publications.</blockquote>But anyway if you want to find an expert on this, longchen is indeed the right person <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

It has to resolve what happen during the day. So it goes into your mind and pull out various images that you understand. And play out into small scene that we call dream.<br><br>What is important in interpretating dream is to find out how you feel after you wake up. Remember it is your dream that reflects how you feel when you sleep it is not your dream that create the depress feeling ....Some dreams carried more than 2 meaning. That is to say on the dream that you see...vs what is being said...The entire conversation could be totally irrelevant to what you see in the dream.<br><br>Takes practice to understand these feeling and emotion attached to the dream...tomorrow night when you sleep your.<br><br>So visually what does your dream tells me. Most likely you have a decision to make or making changes. Although the decision or changes does not goes smoothly but u appear to be okay.
