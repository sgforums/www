            <div class='col-md body'><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychic" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychic</a><br>Psychic, from the Greek psychikos meaning "mental, of the soul" (in turn derived from psyche meaning "soul, mind"), is a term used to describe phenomena or abilities that are said to originate from the brain but which transcend its confines. [1][2] [3][4]<br><br>The term Psychic is commonly used in reference to the paranormal in general, but is more accurately applied to phenomena which are said to involve Psi. [1] People who are said to possess psychic abilities are referred to as "psychics".<br><br>The word itself was coined by French astronomer Camille Flammarion (1842 Â– 1925). Edward William Cox has been credited with introducing it into the English language. [5]<br><br>Contents [hide]<br>1 Psychical research<br>2 Skepticism<br>2.1 James Randi<br>3 Popular culture<br>4 Fiction<br>5 See also<br>6 Footnotes<br>7 External links<br><br>[edit] Psychical research<br>Main article: Parapsychology<br>The rise of modern inquiry into reports of psychical phenomena coincided with the introduction of modern Spiritualism in 1848 and the movement's claims of paranormal abilities. Shortly thereafter, the Society for Psychical Research was founded in Britain (1882) and the American Society for Psychical Research was founded in the United States (1885). Spiritualism was so widespread and the reports of its effects so numerous and impressive that it was inevitable that scientists would be attracted to the alleged phenomena. Early psychical researchers concerned themselves with studying mediums and spiritualist claims. In the early 1900s, a dissatisfaction with the results of the research and political disagreements within psychic research organizations led to a new approach and a new term for the study of psychic phenomena: parapsychology.[4]<br><br>Parapsychology began using the experimental approach to psychic phenomena in the 1930s under the direction of J. B. Rhine (1895 Â– 1980).[4] Rhine popularized the now famous methodology of using card-guessing and dice-rolling experiments in the laboratory in an attempt to find a statistical validation of extra-sensory perception.[4]<br><br>In 1957, the Parapsychological Association was formed as the preeminent society for parapsychologists. In 1969, they became affiliated with the American Association for the Advancement of Science. That affiliation, along with a general openness to psychic and occult phenomena in the 1970s, led to a decade of increased parapsychological research.[4] During this time, other notable organizations were also formed, including the Academy of Parapsychology and Medicine (1970), the Institute of Parascience (1971), the Academy of Religion and Psychical Research, the Institute of Noetic Sciences (1973), and the International Kirlian Research Association (1975). Each of these groups performed experiments on paranormal subjects to varying degrees. Parapsychological work was also conducted at the Stanford Research Institute during this time, research which continued till February 2007. [6][4]<br><br>In 1979, survey conducted to assess belief in one specific field associated with psychics (ESP). It covered 1,100 US college professors and indicated that more than 50% of them believed that ESP is either an established fact or a likely possibility". Belief was shown to be highest among those involved in arts and humanities, but lowest among psychologists. [7]<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Erm someone has brought out concerns with Bohiruci's post here, which I think is fine since they are just informative post, not about trying to promote any sort of supernatural powers.<br><br>But nevertheless I'll post something here to clarify Buddhism's stance regarding psychic powers (Which I have already clarified countless times before in this forum that I didn't feel like posting again for Eric Cartman earlier on):<br><br><a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=249012" rel="nofollow">Supernormal Powers and Forms of Direct Knowledge</a><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</div><div class="quote_body">P.S... supernatural powers mostly serves a distraction especially prior to attaining deep insights into our true nature. My dharma teacher forbids his students from cultivating this prior to attaining wisdom. This is because of subtle attachments.. there is an attachment and seeking of the appearances and phenomena caused/created by this supernatural abilities... or perhaps wanting to know more things through psychically... which hinders one from developing true wisdom. My Taiwanese dharma teacher also used to suffer from using supernatural powers for the wrong purpose... almost lost his life.. this is another story, though.. but the moral of the story is without wisdom these powers may even be harmful. However as Thusness said, when one realises Emptiness, supernatural powers are understood directly to be the activities of non-locality. But Thusness also said... (for those who havent attained wisdom) it can even cause more delusions... as u may sunk into deeper illusion into the realm that u have created without knowing.. or some people for example may visit other realms and become attached... many other examples.</div></blockquote><a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=183053" rel="nofollow">http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=183053</a><br><br><blockquote><a href="http://www.angelfire.com/realm/bodhisattva/siddhi.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.angelfire.com/realm/bodhisattva/siddhi.html</a><br><br>One day the Buddha met an ascetic who sat by the bank of a river. This ascetic had practised austerities for 25 years. The Buddha asked him what he had received for all his labor. The ascetic proudly replied that, now at last, he could cross the river by walking on the water. The Buddha pointed out that this gain was insignificant for all the years of labor, since he could cross the river using a ferry for one penny!</blockquote>Oh and Eric Cartman himself said in there.. hehe..<br><br><blockquote><strong>if it is not peculiar to buddhism but yet buddhism has mastery over it, and still say that it is something NOT worthy to be mentioned about, it means that buddhism has found something greater.</strong></blockquote></div>
