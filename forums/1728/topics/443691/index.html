              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span>(Article from the October, 2011 newsletter "Flatbed Sutra Zen News")</span></div>
              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><br></div>
              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span>The Buddhist teaching 
              of emptiness is most comprehensively treated in the scriptures known as the 
              prajna paramita sutras, revered as primary sources of authority by all Mahayana 
              traditions. "Prajna" is a rich term with many potential meanings and 
              connotations depending on the context; in general, it refers to Buddhist wisdom. 
              In the context of "prajna paramita" it refers specifically to "perfect" or 
              "transcendent" wisdom, that is, the wisdom of "emptiness." From at least as 
              early as the Sixth Ancestor of Zen in China, Huineng (638 - 713 C. E.), Zen has 
              been more closely associated with the prajna paramita sutras than any other 
              scriptures. According to Zen lore, the Sixth Ancestor realized enlightenment 
              simply upon <em>hearing</em> a prajna paramita sutra, the <em>Diamond Cutter 
              Sutra</em>, recited by a stranger on the street. Huineng's record, the "Platform 
              Sutra," is the only text revered as a "sutra" (i.e. scripture) other than those 
              attributed to the Buddha. The Platform Sutra expounds on the importance and 
              significance of a number of sutras, but is particularly insistent on the supreme 
              vision of the <em>Diamond Sutra</em>, not only promising enlightenment to those 
              that practice it, but even to those that simply <em>memorize</em> it.</span></div>
              <br> <br>
              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span>While the <em>Diamond 
              Sutra</em> continues to be highly revered in Zen, which remains deeply steeped in 
              its methodology, the marvelously concise <em>Heart Sutra</em> (<em>Prajnaparamita-hrdya-sutra</em>) came to occupy a position as the definitive 
              statement on "emptiness" in Zen, as in many Mahayana traditions. As its title 
              suggests, this succinct scripture presents a remarkably clear image of the 
              profound wisdom at the heart of the vast corpus of prajna paramita literature. 
              In Dogen's day, as in our own, this short scripture was known well enough that 
              Buddhists hearing a single line would recognize it instantly. Dogen's own 
              commentary on the <em>Heart Sutra</em> - the earliest writing included in 
              <em>Shobogenzo</em> - opens by quoting the first line of the sutra. Dogen uses 
              this quote (the only direct reference to the sutra in his commentary) to 
              illumine a profound implication of emptiness by creatively altering the reading 
              (thus significance) of the opening line of the <em>Heart Sutra</em>. The first 
              line of the <em>Heart Sutra</em> actually reads:</span></div>
              <br> <br>
              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva practicing deep 
              prajna paramita clearly saw that all five skandhas are empty transcending 
              anguish and distress.</span></div>
              <br> <br>
              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span>(<strong>Note:</strong> "Avalokitesvara," is an enlightened being (<em>bodhisattva</em>) of Buddhist 
              mythology; the hero of the <em>Heart Sutra</em>.</span><span> "T</span><span>ranscending anguish and distress" is realizing the Buddhist goal, 
              liberation from suffering; nirvana, enlightenment).</span></div>
              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span> </span></div>
              <br>
              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span>Dogen's creative 
              alteration of the line is not achieved by eliminating or substituting words, nor 
              by transposing or changing their order, but through the <em>addition</em> of <em>a 
              single word</em>.</span></div>
              <br> <br>
              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span>This move by Dogen 
              should not be glossed over, dismissed as accidental, or understood as a simple 
              attempt to clarify the original meaning by providing an interpretive element. 
              The <em>Heart Sutra</em> was well known to his audience, and his alteration, while 
              slight, would have been stark in their ears. Upon first sight, the additional 
              word jumps out as if erroneous, but as the implications of it dawn, its 
              intentional placement becomes clear. The added word is, "konshin," which roughly 
              translates as "whole-body," or "complete body-mind." Thus:</span></div>
              <br> <br>
              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva practicing deep 
              prajna paramita <em>whole body-mind</em> clearly saw that all five skandhas are 
              empty transcending anguish and distress.</span></div>
              <br> <br>
              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span>Although only one 
              word, an English rendering conveying the significance of the alteration asks for 
              some interpretive suggestions, perhaps, "Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva practicing 
              deep prajna paramita <em>with his whole-body</em> clearly saw that all five 
              skandhas are empty transcending anguish and distress," or, "<em>The 
              whole-body-Avalokitesvara-Bodhisattva</em> practicing deep prajna paramita 
              clearly saw that all five skandhas are empty transcending anguish and distress." </span></div>
              <br> <br>
              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span>To appreciate the 
              implications of this we should understanding that the "five skandhas" are a 
              traditional classification for the elements constituting the (whole) body-mind 
              of a human being.</span><span> In light of this we see that "five skandhas" is 
              another way of saying "whole-body." Thus, the implication is clear; to say "The 
              whole-body (of Avalokitesvara) sees that all five skandhas are empty," is 
              equivalent to saying, "The whole-body sees that the whole-body is 
              empty."</span></div>
              <br> <br>
              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span>(<strong>Note:</strong> The five 
              skandhas are form, f</span><span>eeling, sensation, mental formulation, and 
              consciousness. In Buddhist literature the term "form" by itself serves as an 
              abbreviation for all five skandhas). </span></div>
              <br> <br>
              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span>Being a crucial 
              element to every aspect of Buddhism, the teachings on emptiness (shunyata) are 
              complex and multi-faceted. However, in order to grasp the main points of the 
              present discussion it is enough to know that emptiness is regarded (at least by 
              Mahayana Buddhists) as the reality, or true nature of all things, beings, and 
              events (i.e. dharmas).</span><span> This is the key point indicated by the 
              pivotal statement of the <em>Heart Sutra</em>, "Form is emptiness; emptiness is 
              form." </span></div>
              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span> </span></div>
              <br>
              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span>With this in mind we 
              can see that Dogen's statement unequivocally identifies the <em>subject</em> (i.e. 
              Avalokitesvara; whole-body) that clearly <em>sees</em> with the <em>object</em> (i.e. Avalokitesvara; all five skandhas) that is clearly <em>seen</em>. The 
              overall effective result of Dogen's alteration, then, is to forceful manner of 
              drawing attention to the actively dynamic, energetically animated nature of 
              "emptiness." Here are two things we know about Avalokitesvara according to 
              Dogen's statement:</span></div>
              <br> <br>
              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span>The whole of 
              Avalokitesvara clearly <em>sees</em> the whole of Avalokitesvara.</span></div>
              <br>
              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span>The whole of 
              Avalokitesvara clearly <em>seen</em> is empty.</span></div>
              <br> <br>
              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span>Two crucial points; 
              emptiness can see, and emptiness can be seen. Thus we know that, whatever else 
              it might be, "practicing prajna paramita" is emptiness clearly seeing 
              (experiencing) its own true nature - in short, practicing prajna paramita is 
              <em>emptiness seeing emptiness</em>.</span></div>
              <br> <br>
              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span>Even after this short 
              foray into his commentary we see that, from Dogen's view, emptiness should never 
              be understood or described </span><span lang="EN">apophatically or in purely 
              negative terms</span><span> like non-existent, absent, undifferentiated, 
              motionless, insentient, unknowable, or incommunicable. This point merits 
              emphasis; the propensity to misunderstand and misrepresent emptiness negatively 
              is pervasive. Judging by the Zen records, this propensity has plagued every era 
              of Zen history. The meticulously detailed refutations of negativistic views of 
              emptiness permeating Dogen's writings testify to the pervasiveness of such 
              distortions in his own era. Dogen view that this issue merited the energy he put 
              into it seems clear; the distorting power of negativistic views of emptiness can 
              obstruct practitioners from accurately understanding every aspect of Buddhism, 
              not to mention putting it into practice and actualizing it. </span></div>
              <br> <br>
              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span>From Dogen's 
              perspective, it is better to have no understanding of emptiness than to adopt a 
              negative understanding. At this point, then, we want to stress that, whatever 
              else might be included in Dogen's view of emptiness, it is inclusive of at least 
              these positive qualities:</span></div>
              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span> </span></div>
              <br>
              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span>Emptiness is present 
              in/as existence-time</span></div>
              <br>
              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span>Emptiness is 
              differentiated</span></div>
              <br>
              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span>Emptiness is active </span></div>
              <br>
              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span>Emptiness is 
              sentient</span></div>
              <br>
              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span>Emptiness is 
              intelligible </span></div>
              <br>
              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span>Emptiness is 
              communicable</span></div>
              <br> <br>
              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span>After opening </span><span><em>Shobogenzo, </em></span><span><em>Maka-hannya-haramitsu,</em></span><span> with the (altered) 
              quote from the <em>Heart Sutra</em>, Dogen presents a series of affirmative 
              expressions on the nature of the self, the world, and the myriad dharmas that 
              reads like a crystallization of the reality illumined by the grand vision of 
              <em>Shobogenzo</em>:</span></div>
              <br> <br>
              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The five skandhas are form, sensation, 
              perception, mental formulation, and consciousness; they are five instances of 
              prajna. Clear seeing is prajna itself. To present this truth for realization it 
              is expounded that "form is exactly emptiness, and emptiness is exactly form." 
              Thus form is form, and emptiness is emptiness. They are the hundred particular 
              things, the myriad dharmas.</span></div>
              <br>
              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><span>Shobogenzo, </span></em></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><span>Maka-hannya-haramitsu</span></em></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><span>,</span></em></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span> Ted Biringer</span></span></div>
              <br> <br>
              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span>By enumerating each of 
              the five skandhas and then affirming them as "five instances of prajna," Dogen 
              immediately emphasizes the differentiated quality of emptiness. This serves to 
              counter the reductionist propensity to misunderstand and misrepresent emptiness </span><span lang="EN">apophatically as</span><span> just discussed. Notice also, 
              that by citing each of the skandhas, Dogen compels us to dwell longer on what is 
              being conveyed than we might if he simply used "form," the common abbreviation 
              for the five skandhas. This reduces the likelihood of missing the point by too 
              hastily moving on. The greatest effect of Dogen's enumeration, however, is its 
              setup for the next phrase, the key point of the whole commentary; "Clear seeing 
              is prajna itself." Each of the five skandhas constituting Avalokitesvara (thus 
              of all human beings) plays a specific role in the "clear seeing" that 
              "transcends anguish and distress." Form "distinguishes" it, sensation "conducts" 
              it, perception "receives" it, mental formulation "fashions" it (produces an 
              intelligible image), and consciousness "realizes" it (understands, or interprets 
              it in its particularity, thus facilitating its manifestation) in context and 
              contrast to what is not-it. </span></div>
              <br> <br>
              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span>Thus, Dogen utilizes 
              the opening line of the <em>Heart Sutra</em> to illumine the heart of Zen; 
              "</span><span>Clear seeing is prajna itself</span><span>." In perfect harmony 
              with his conception of knowledge, existence, and soteriology the activity of 
              clearly <em>seeing</em> the form of prajna (perfect wisdom), the <em>form</em> of 
              prajna that is clearly seen, and the <em>liberation</em> actualized by prajna are 
              not three different things. This dynamic process and its implications are 
              repeatedly brought into relief throughout the whole <em>Shobogenzo</em>. To 
              clearly see (i.e. sense, know, perceive, experience, etc.) is to be (i.e. 
              actually manifest, exist), thus to clearly see liberation is to actualize (make 
              actual, cause to exist) liberation.</span></div>
              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span> </span></div>
              <br>
              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span>Not, "I think, 
              therefore I am," but, "Wherefore I think, I am." Or, to put it in the terms of 
              our present discussion, "I am what I clearly see (sights, sounds, flavors, 
              odors, tactile sensations, and thoughts) therefore what I clearly see I am." </span></div>

              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span>It should go without 
              saying, but since it usually does not, I should clarify that "clear seeing" is 
              not "mere seeing." "Clear seeing" should not be construed as "passively" 
              perceiving via the sense organs (i.e. eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind) 
              as advocated by some so-called Zen teachers. Clear seeing is a skill that must 
              be intentionally developed through sustained effort in accurately directed study 
              and cultivation. It is the "clear" of clear seeing that qualifies it as "prajna 
              itself." Such clear seeing is, of course, inclusive of sense perception, but 
              only if that sense perception is actualized by the healthy mind referred to in 
              Zen as the "normal mind" or "Buddha mind." This distinction is succinctly 
              elucidated by Dogen in <em>Shobogenzo, Genjokoan</em> by the line:</span></div>

              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span>(<strong>Note:</strong> "Ordinary beings" here refers to <em>common</em> or <em>typical</em> (unawakened) 
              beings; thus "ordinary" should not be confused with the "normal" of the "normal 
              mind" of Zen usage which is sometimes rendered into English as "ordinary mind." 
              The "normal" in the Zen sense means "healthy," this normal mind is the awakened 
              mind, also called the Buddha mind.)</span></div>
              <br> <br>
              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span>Dogen affirms the 
              authenticity of his comment by asserting its harmony with the heart of the 
              <em>Heart Sutra</em>, </span><span>"Form is exactly emptiness, emptiness is 
              exactly form" - which he summarizes as, "form is form, emptiness is emptiness." 
              What is going on here? At first glance, this seems to contradict the <em>Heart 
              Sutra's</em> statement, not summarize it. </span></div>
              <br> <br>
              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span>To clarify Dogen's 
              point we can appeal to a method provided by the <em>Diamond Sutra</em> to 
              illustrate t</span><span>hat "form" only exists <em>because</em> of emptiness, and 
              emptiness is only exists <em>because</em> of form. This basic method can be 
              depicted like this (with "A" standing for (any particular) form, and "not" 
              standing for emptiness): A = not-A, <em>therefore</em> A = A. </span></div>
              <br> <br>
              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span>To explain, a dharma 
              (i.e. any real, particular form) is only a dharma insofar as it is 
              <em>differentiated</em> from everything "other than" that dharma. In other words, 
              to experience a dharma is to distinguish something from everything else, 
              everything that <em>is not</em> it. If there was nothing that was <em>not it</em> - 
              <em>it</em> could not be distinguished as <em>it </em>(a particular dharma). From 
              this we see that the existence of "a dharma" is <em>dependent</em> on the 
              existence of something "other than" that dharma; and the existence of "other 
              than" that dharma is <em>dependent</em> on the existence of "that dharma." 
              Therefore, the existence of a dharma necessarily presupposes the existence of 
              "other than" that dharma (and vice versa). In short, the real existence of "A" 
              depends on the real existence of "A" <em>and</em> "not-A," the real existence of 
              "not-A" also depends on the real existence of "A" <em>and</em> "not-A."</span></div>
              <br> <br>
              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span>The <em>Heart Sutra</em> concisely portrays the nature of reality; A is exactly (equals, is coessential 
              with, depends on) not-A, and not-A is exactly A. The <em>Diamond Sutra</em> illumines the dynamic process of reality; the existence of A is <em>essential 
              to</em>, therefore <em>inclusive of</em>, the existence of "other than" A (and vice 
              versa). The significance of this is; if A exists, not-A must also exist (and 
              vice versa), and if A does not exist, not-A cannot exist (and vice versa). Thus, 
              A is not-A, therefore A <em>is</em> A; not-A is A, therefore not-A <em>is</em> not-A. In Dogen's terms, form <em>is</em> form, emptiness <em>is</em> emptiness.</span></div>
              <br> <br>
              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span>As already suggested, 
              Dogen's "clear seeing" (as prajna itself) is inclusive of right-understanding 
              and right-views as well as accurate sense perception. In harmony with all Zen 
              masters, Dogen frequently reminds us that it is not enough to hear, or even to 
              understand the teachings in order to realize Buddhist liberation. The "clear 
              seeing" that is Zen practice-enlightenment is a <em>process</em> not a product, an 
              <em>activity</em> not a resolution. The teachings must, of course, be learned, 
              studied, and accurately understood, however, liberation or realization cannot be 
              actualized unless these teachings are put into actual practice and personally 
              verified (clearly seen). Avalokitesvara was able to accurately "practice prajna 
              paramita" because s/he had come to accurately understand the Buddhist teaching 
              on prajna - but only with the actual experience of clear seeing was liberation 
              actualized. </span></div>
              <br> <br>
              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span>Accurate understanding 
              is not authentic realization. At the same time, authentic realization can hardly 
              be expected to occur without accurate understanding. And while an absence of 
              "right understanding" almost excludes the possibility of authentic realization, 
              the presence of "wrong understanding" excludes even the slimmest hope of 
              success. If we aspire to realize what Zen practice-enlightenment truly is, then, 
              as Dogen says, "We should inquire into it, and we should experience it." </span><span>To follow his guidance here we will need to understand his view of 
              what "it" is that needs to be inquired into, and who the "we" is that is to do 
              the inquiring. </span></div>

              realization of this </span><span><em>prajnÄ�pÄ�ramitÄ� </em></span><span>is the

              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span>We inquire into it 
              through study and training; we experience it through sustained, wholehearted 
              effort in practice (usually after much trial and error). The "it" we need to 
              inquire into and experience is the true nature of ourselves. The process of 
              inquiring into and experiencing the true nature of ourselves is succinctly 
              expressed in a passage from <em>Genjokoan, Shobogenzo</em>.</span></div>

              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">To learn the Buddha's truth is to learn 
              ourselves. To learn ourselves is to forget ourselves. To forget ourselves is to

To be experienced by the myriad </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><span>dharma</span></em></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">s is to let our own body and mind, and the 
              body and mind of the external world, fall away.</span></div>

              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span>The actual experience 
              of this learning begins with coming to an accurate understanding of it. To that 
              end, we need to understand that here "the Buddha's truth" means enlightenment 
              (liberation, nirvana, etc.), and "learning" means study, training, practice, and 
              verification. Understanding this, we can begin to consider the significance of 
              this from the Buddhist perspective of emptiness; hence, if "to learn the 
              Buddha's truth is to learn ourselves" then "to learn ourselves is to learn the 
              Buddha's truth." Similarly, the implications of emptiness apply to "forgetting," 
              "experience," "our body and mind," "the myriad dharmas," etc.</span></div>
              <br> <br>
              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span>In Dogen's Zen, 
              "forms" (dharmas) are the fundamental units constituting reality; they are 
              viewed as "empty" and "mental" in nature - when Avalokitesvara clearly saw all 
              five skandhas were empty, emptiness clearly saw emptiness. With this we were 
              able to see that emptiness is not ineffable, absent, or undifferentiated, but 
              rather, emptiness is intelligible, present, and particularly distinct. 
              Emptiness, being the true nature of all the myriad dharmas, is the very form of 
              all the myriad dharmas.</span></div>
              <br> <br>
              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span>This, then, brings us 
              to the point of our present discussion; "To forget ourselves is to be 
              experienced by the myriad dharmas" describes exactly "emptiness clearly seeing 
              emptiness." Emptiness seeing emptiness is emptiness seeing the myriad dharmas, 
              the myriad dharmas seeing emptiness, the myriad dharmas seeing the myriad 
              dharmas, the myriad dharmas seeing <em>seeing</em>, and seeing <em>seeing</em> seeing. </span></div>

              <p><br>You see a lump of thing over the road. You don't know what the hell is that. This is visual consciousness [pure visual awareness/vinnana], or sensation [feeling tone of pleasant, unpleasant, neutral/vedana]. Those are pre conceptual.
                                  
                                  You recognise 'Oh my god that is Gold!' That recognition is the begining of concepts. This is called perception (sanna).
                                  
                                  The sense of self arise 'I saw it first! This is mine', obsessed with craving, followed by the mental intention and plan to run towards it and acquire it. This is mental formation (sankara), aka Karma.</p>
              <p>Commenting on karma, Buddha says 'What one intends, what one arranges, and what one obsesses about: This 
                      is a support for the stationing of consciousness. There being a support,
                       there is a landing [or: an establishing] of consciousness. When that 
                      consciousness lands and grows, there is the production of renewed 
                      becoming in the future. When there is the production of renewed becoming
                       in the future, there is future birth, aging &amp; death, sorrow, 
                      lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair. Such is the origination of 
                      this entire mass of suffering &amp; stress.'<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa%E1%B9%85kh%C4%81ra#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
