              I had a dream where everyone in a family were having problems - getting into gambling debts, etc. One of the brothers also used to be a criminal but to everyone's surprises he suddenly turned his mind, left his home, and seated in the meditative lotus posture in middle of a pool of mud, attained the final nirvana right there and passed away.
                                                  
              When I woke up I immediately understood: the world is surrounded by beings pursuing the path of the unwholesome and being chained by afflictions - craving, aggression, delusions and all manners of attachments, leading to endless rebirths in the six realms. But no matter how unwholesome and defiled your environment and companions seem to be, and no matter what you have done, or how afflicted you were, there is always the opportunity to repent, turn around, head on a very different direction, strive and be the one who is like a lotus growing out of the mud, be one who is undefiled in a world full of defilements.
                                                  
              Strive on and walk the path against the worldly stream. Enter the stream that leads to Nirvana, and attain Nirvana in this very body, in this very world. Be the light shining through darkness.

              Ji le shi jie is a name for Amitabha Buddha's pure land. Due to Amitabha's compassionate vows, even unenlightened beings can by virtue of amitabha's vows, by chanting his name and fulfilling merits, attain birth in the western pure land after death.
              
              However you do not have to wait until you die to go western pure land. If you realize your true mind, you realize your mind is bright, resplendent, pure, and all-pervasive. You realize your very buddha-nature is already complete and identical to that of Amitabha Buddha's. When you reallize your real nature, this world in front of you is experienced as Pure Land itself. Then Nirvana, Liberation is experienced in the here and now. 
              
              Nirvana simply means the cessation of craving, aggression and delusion... Through great wisdom this is achieved. Sentient beings mind are originally luminous but obscured by adventitious defilements (passion, aggression, delusion). Only our defilements and ignorance obscure us from our innate pure land... We simply have to clear them away and that is by practicing buddhism.

              The Buddha said:
              
              "Just like a red, blue, or white lotus â€” born in the water, grown in the water, rising up above the water â€” stands unsmeared by the water, in the same way I â€” born in the world, grown in the world, having overcome the world â€” live unsmeared by the world. Remember me, brahman, as 'awakened.'"

              <p>In dharma, mud is lotus. Therefore it's so very need of dharma in a mud that does not recognizes its lotus. Study is a need for secular knowledge and acomplishment of parents and nation pursuit of a learned personality. Dharma goes into the source of this secular knowledge serves to disengage one attachment over it so that yr life even though is not supreme lotusly sweet, to the least is allow one to recognize life beyond secularism as affinity/condition in its is emptiness. In study, one needs a calm mind, dharma helps one develop peace and free up more space so that one concentration in study will not be affected but improve its health. For both teachers and student in secular education, one should contemplate that languages relates to grace, compassion, filial piety, friendliness congeniality; Maths is the sum of cooperation to achieve balance and functionality; Science is the quality of ones alchemy; Geography is nature beauty; History is eulogies and beauty of culture; Art is design and presentation for occasions; Home econ is the joys of family meal etc <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"> </p>
              <p>As far as work is concern, in general, it's destiny of the past and dharma is about recognizing this destiny and be naturally &amp; calmly let it move on. One of many very good example was this Germany employer in China.</p>

What in the human realm corresponds to their water? We only see their jeweled ornaments as water. Some beings see water as wondrous blossoms, but they do not use blossoms as water. Hungry ghosts see water as raging fire or pus and blood. Dragons see water as a palace or a pavilion. Some beings see water as the seven treasures or a wish-granting jewel. Some beings see water as a forest or a wall. Some see it as the Dharma nature of pure liberation, the true human body, or as the form of body and essence of mind. Human beings see water as water. Water is seen as dead or alive depending on causes and conditions. Thus the views of all beings are not the same. <br><br>i say if you are sitting next to a Buddha, be it Shakyamuni or Amitabha, what we, ordinary people see is samsaric environment. while what the Buddha see is pure land as described in Amitabha pureland sutra. a defiled mind see a defiled land. a pure mind see a pure land. <br>it is not wrong to say that "Pureland is as real as this defiled world".</p>

              <p>As for <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Samsara is not so very correctly interpreted. Samsara means 'can endure/tolerate', it means that beings other than liberated beings who are living in a condition of suffering but they deemed it as true happiness and subscribed to this false happiness as though it's true happiness, and continue to endure until they see stars on last breath, and still strongly perceive that this is usual way of life. Such as highly educated scientists and common folks who did not attempt or challenge themselves in other perspective like dharma <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"> /\</span></p>

              be a criminal but to everyone’s surprises he suddenly turned his
              mind, left his home, and seated in the meditative lotus posture in

              afflictions – craving, aggression, delusions and all manners of
              attachments, leading to endless rebirths in the six realms. But no

              seem to be, and no matter what you have done, or how afflicted you
              were, there is always the opportunity to repent, turn around, head
              on a very different direction, strive and be the one who is like a
              lotus growing out of the mud, be one who is undefiled in a world

              <p>Strive on and walk the path against the worldly stream. Enter

              The funny thing is that, on the next day after my dream, people around me started gambling some rather big sum of money (for the first time - surprising, I didn't know they brought in those cards)... I rather not break any house rules where I stay and get into trouble in my remaining days serving the nation, so I meditated. LOL
                              
              I had lots of tell-future dreams (even more in the past)... and dreams containing dharma meaning. Sometimes I foretell things to my friends based on dreams because I knew it's going to happen... and it does. Sometimes teachers appear in my dream... including Thusness (was informed by him that his intention for me to know certain things through dream was possible only due to my strong karmic connection to him). ChNNR, another one as I mentioned before. There were others... known and unknown teachers. Or other unknown beings informing of events going to happen next day (turns out to be accurate), also can happen.
                      
              Anyway no need to attach too much to these things... most important is still to practice hard both in waking and sleep. As lucidity increases throughout the cycle of day and night such events become more frequent but are not the main point of practice.
