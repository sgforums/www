              <p>Recently, I came across an article about a monk who complained to MP, Mr Yaw Shin Leong, about unlicensed monks working in Singapore. His main reason for his complaint was how the Foreign Talent monks is charging the rite at a lower rate.<a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STI">http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STI</a><img src="http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STI" alt=""></p>
              <p>Frankly, when I saw the article, I am rather disappointed with his complaint. Firstly, the role of monk is to educate and lead people on the Buddhist path. Secondly, if he desire to conduct religious rite for the dead, he should do it out of compassion for the dead and family instead being hardcore about the money.</p>
              <p>Personally, I had came across monk and nun who will provide the funeral rite with no mentioned of cost. The family of the late will provide transport and offer whatever amount they can afford as Ang Bao to them or the temple. These are the type of monk and nun the Buddhist community should respect and support.</p>
              <p>I hope the Buddhist community will assist the public in such matter. In fact, a lot of family late lost their faith in Buddhism especially young adult due to the money oriented and fake funeral chanting monk.</p>

              <p>In Buddha Sakyamuni era, monks and nuns never will involve the funeral service because they solely on teachings and actualization. However, there is a dire need in present times for monks/nuns who are voluntarily offering (on request for) their compassionate service in funerals, which is in accordance with Earth Store Bodhisavatta Sutra that the decease will receive 1/7 of the merits transferred. On hardcore for money in rite from monk/nun, not only no merits, and according to earthstore sutra is that they need the abbot to chant for them cos is hellish reward :D</p>

              <p>during Buddha time, they just burn the corpse on woods. Still doing it this way in India.</p>
              <p>Then buddhism spread to China, and they added in elements of Taoism, burning gold papers, paper houses etc.  During the Liang Wu Emperor time, he engaged an abbot to chant for his deceased queen who gave him a dream that she had being reborn into a python due to her jealousy and anger in her lifetime. I think this started the engagement of monks for funerals to chant for the deceased.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, when you have made an arrangement with a buddhist temple , the package included the setting up of the funeral altar and the engagement of monks to chant.</p>
              <p>There is no conflict of money as everything is already being arranged by the buddhist temple.</p>
              <p>If the case mentioned above is true, then some foreign monks are asking for more ang pows from the deceased family members.  This may be against the temple's arrangement.   However it is up to the family members to give or not to give the ang pows (red packet).</p>
              <p>When a monk is chanting for a good rebirth of the deceased, the monk/nun maybe taking over the negative karma of the deceased so that the dead can go to a good place, so it is not too much to give ang pows to thank the monk/nun for their trouble.</p>
              <p>But if there are really FT monks (from China, Taiwan for eg ) coming to ask specifically for money to chant at a funeral and is money oriented , then we should publicize such bad behaviours and stop the trend.</p>

              <p><br>Agree, for funerals services, it has to go through the temple, even in packages so that the money can be wisely used to maintain the temple and circulation of DVD, conduct highly subsidised dharma classes, provide free clinic service and other adhoc charitable aid etc. As for monks/nuns expenses, the temple will provide them, and if in the funeral compassionate services, one voluntarily give red packets for blessing (great monks/nuns are obliged to accept red packet from devotee so that the devotees can plant blessings), and also that the monks/nuns can go window shopping ard etc - big vehicle dharma monks/nuns :D</p>

              <p>There
                   was an intriguing article in the Straits Times last Friday on foreign 
                  Buddhist monks in Singapore. Apparently, these foreign monks were 
                  willing to charge less to perform funeral chants at wakes. The 
                  competition was so stiff that a local Singaporean monk had turned to his
                   MP (Member of Parliament) for help (you can’t fault him for trying).</p>
              <p>According to the article, the monk saw his income dropped by as much as 70% in the last 2 years because of foreign competition.</p>
              <p>Informed Buddhists would find the claims by the monk bemusing because
                   we know that monks and nuns are not supposed to charge for any of their
                   services (funeral chants or otherwise).  He would certainly be shocked 
                  to learn that genuine monks and nuns in Singapore can easily give these 
                  foreign monks a run for their money because they charging nothing for 
                  their services! [1]</p>
              <p>But I like to highlight another more serious issue in this post. 
                  While accurate information on Buddhism are readily available on the 
                  Internet, many Singaporeans still associate the religion with geomancy, 
                  amulets[2], fortune telling and… monks charging for chanting at 
                  funerals, none of which has anything to do with Buddhism!</p>
              <p>It is important that we uphold the image of Buddhism. Imagine for a 
                  moment that Apple were to allow other companies to use their brand. We 
                  will soon see iShaver, iWashing Machine, iBlender, iSofa appearing in 
                  the market, all carrying Apple’s logo! People will be totally confused 
                  as to which are real Apple products. Many of these non-Apple products 
                  will surely be of poor quality and design, further damaging Apple’s 
                  brand.</p>
              <p>Yet this is what we are seeing in Buddhism in Singapore. For a very 
                  long time, we have allowed people wearing monks’ robe to read fortunes, 
                  perform geomancy readings and to sell amulets. We, the real 
                  practitioners of the Buddha’s teachings have lost control of the 
                  Buddhist “brand” to these pseudo-Buddhists believes. And many of them 
                  are giving Buddhism a bad name. [3]</p>
              <p>What can we, as informed Buddhists, do about it? I suggest 3 solutions:</p>
              <p>Firstly, we need to speak up. The Internet and social media has 
                  greatly empowered the ordinary folks. We can inform others on social 
                  media and online forums, where discussion has cropped up, as to what is 
                  and isn’t Buddhism.</p>
              <p>Secondly, Buddhist leaders should speak up against practices that go 
                  against Buddhist principles. While ordinary Buddhists can inform at the 
                  grassroots level, only the leaders can presence an official stand on 
                  these issues. Sadly I’ve not seen any official statement coming out the 
                  make a stand on this issue.</p>
              <p>Lastly, we need to reach out to these people who are giving Buddhism a
                   bad name. Some are just opportunists, in for a quick buck. Others have 
                  genuine bread and butter concerns which we as Buddhists should help to 
                  address.</p>
              <p>Incidents like these can be great opportunities for Buddhism to grow 
                  if we address them appropriately. Lets hope we get it right sooner than 
                  later.</p>
              <p>Notes:<br> [1] We need to understand the “Business model” of deaths. Love ones of 
                  the departed usually contact the funeral parlor to help arrange the 
                  funeral. These funeral parlor are businessmen who make a living 
                  from these services they provide. Usually it is these funeral parlor who
                   contact “money charging monks” to chant at funerals.</p>
              <p>[2] I recall about 2 years ago, the Straits Times ran a half page 
                  article on “Thai Buddhism” and amulet business in Singapore.  Again, 
                  while amulets are very popular among Thai Buddhists, they have nothing 
                  to do with Buddhism. In the thousands of suttas recorded in the Buddhist
                   cannon, the making and use of amulets were never recorded.</p>
              <p>[3] A friend once told me of her angry encounter with one of these 
                  “monks”. At the funeral of her relative, the “monk” told her that if she
                   wants him to chant more “powerful” sutras, she would have to pay more 
                  and hinted that she should not mind paying more (a more “powerful chant 
                  could cost a thousand dollar more) if she loved her relative. This 
                  “monk” is clearly a businessman in a monk’s robe.</p>
