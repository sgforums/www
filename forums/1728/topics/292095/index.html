            <div class='col-md body'>Hi D;<br><br>The answers to your questions may be found in the following steps. The Tibetan buddhist teachings taught because we have countless lives, all sentient beings have been our parents. So when u see somebody treating u with disdain, just be patient and remember that person is also suffering from ignorance. Not that just the victim is suffering , the one who inflicted harm upon others is also suffering.<br><br>The '7 Point Mind Training' is based on cultivation in 7 steps:<br><br>1. Equanimity<br>2. All sentient beings have been or, at least, could have been my mother as I have lived innumerable lives.<br>3. Remember the kindness of your mother in this life, all she did for you, the problems she went through to take care of you.<br>4. Would it be great if I could repay her and all previous mothers' kindness.<br>5. Generate great love: may all mother sentient beings have happiness and the causes for happiness.<br>6. Generate great compassion: may all mother sentient beings be free from suffering and the causes for suffering<br>7. I should give up all self-cherishing and egoism, and work to bring them happiness and release them from their suffering: therefore, may I become an omniscient Buddha, as he is the perfect doctor to cure the suffering of all mother sentient beings.<br><br>In the Tibetan tradition, following verses are often recited to direct the mind towards generating Bodhicitta:<br><br>With a wish to free all beings<br>I shall always go for refuge<br>To the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha,<br>Until I reach full enlightenment.<br><br>Enthused by wisdom and compassion,<br>today in the Buddhas' presence<br>I generate the Mind for Full Awakening<br>For the benefit of all sentient beings.<br><br>As long as space remains,<br>As long as sentient beings remain,<br>Until then, may I too remain<br>And dispel the miseries of the world.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think we have to start small we are not going to be able to develop great realisations overnight. First of all I think it really helps to motivate yourself. Realise whats in it for you. Once the ego knows this there is enormous enthusiasm and energy for the practise. See how much happier and content you are when you think of others then start in small ways, putting others first, just any opportunity you get. Meditate also on the benefits of cherishing others and the disadvantages of not doing so and the seven point mind training as another contributor has explained. Also don't have any expectations of successful!<br><br>Good luck<br></div>
