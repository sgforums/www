              <p>Prescribed by Padmasambhava to awaken bardo beings from intense<br>fearful illusions arising from death in war, by weapons, and in<br>accidents....Precious Dharma Family, Trillions of thanks for the love,<br>compassion, and practices you are all doing for the suffering beings<br>in our human family. I am so grateful for sharing this practice of<br>Tsonchei Mijigpai Gyalpo which I think is the right practice for this<br>time. The Vajradhara 8th Khamtul Rinpoche and Vajradhara Dilgo<br>Khyentse Rinpoche stressed the urgency of this practice during these<br>times of violence and war. Tsonchei Mijigpai Gyalpo means the supreme<br>enlightened one who liberates bardo beings from the fear and<br>terrifying illusions arising from death by weapons. I send all you<br>practitioners my deep heartfelt gratitude and prayers for transmission<br>blessings of these teachings directly from the Buddhas and from Gurus.<br>It will surely be of immense benefit for all the dead since we are<br>doing it with very profound and pure loving motivation, free from any<br>partiality. I ask all Buddhists to practice this to help the dead from<br>all sides and to protect the innocent.<br><br>With much love and gratitude,<br><br>Choegyal Rinpoche<br><br><a href="http://www.choegyalrinpoche.org/Tsonchei%20Mijigpai%20Gyalpo.pdf">http://www.choegyalrinpoche.org/Tsonchei%20Mijigpai%20Gyalpo.pdf</a></p>

Arousing bodhicitta, the enlightened attitude (three times):<br>To obtain Buddhahood for the benefit of others,<br>I generate bodhicitta, as aspiration, as action, and in its absolute<br>meaning. Then meditate, further developing supreme compassion and<br>equanimity. Here it is helpful to contemplate the four immeasurables<br>and especially to visualize oneself as Avalokiteshvara and to recite<br>his mantra of compassion, OM MANI PADME HUM, a suitable number of<br>times.<br><br>When you are confident in your generation of profound love and<br>compassion free from partiality, continue with the visualization and<br>prayers below, feeling the dead beings in your mind.<br>Visualization and prayers:<br><br>Visualize the minds of those who have died in accidents and from<br>weapons as blue balls of light, each enclosed by a sphere of violet<br>light. While reciting the prayers and mantras below, the violet<br>spheres disappear and the minds, visualized as blue lights, are freed.<br>Repeat each section below a suitable number of times. Include gaps to<br>develop vows, feelings, visualizations, etc.<br><br>PRAYER TO BUDDHA TSONCHEI MIJIGPAI GYALPO<br><br>CHOMDENDHE DESHINSHEGPA DRACHOMPA YANGDAGPAR DZOGPEI<br>SANGYE TSONCHEI MIJIGPAI GYALPO LA CHAKTSAL LO, KYABSU CHIO.<br>JINGYI LHABTU SOL.<br><br>Translation:<br>Bhagawan, Tathagata, Arhat, Perfect Buddha, The One who liberates<br>bardo beings from all fears and illusions arising from death by<br>weapons, we prostrate to you.
