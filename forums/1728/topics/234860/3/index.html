Finally, your mind is composed of thoughts, ideas and perceptions which are understood through the language you learned, the culture you were raised in and the people you encountered.

However it should be clarified that Buddhists does not practise just for any worldly benefits. The kind of Bliss taught by Buddha is about Nirvanic bliss. This is different from worldly benefits. Yes, all humans seek bliss and should aim for this, not just any worldly happiness which are basically unstable. Emptiness allows us to 'see through' these worldly things. Whatever worldly happiness is empty of inherent existence, dream-like, constantly fluctuating, as a matter of fact when grasped it is a source of Dukkha, it should be seen as such.<br><br>The bliss that comes from emptiness is not dependent upon any conditions or life situation. If it were, it is unstable, impermanent. The bliss of Nirvana, Liberation is through Clarity. It does not depend upon successes in life, or whether your life situation permits you to be happy at that moment. Bliss emanates from clarity is different from these. Highly enlightened people may easily become bankrupt as well. Although the Wisdom of Buddhism will help us become more successful people, these are not the ultimate aim of practising. We do not practise for something impermanent. Our true nature is unmoving, regardless of anything.<br><br>If nothing can be done to attain enlightenment, then Buddha would not have taught anything. There is no need to practise either. Eightfold path leads to enlightenment. Buddha's teachings is very direct. You can't attain enlightenment by lazing.<br><br><blockquote>What you can do is teach people to recognize the illusions that they have.

Why does humanity need a blissful culture?</span></span><br><br><strong>The culture of purifying the human mind is blissful culture</strong><br><br>Humanity is constantly seeking happiness in this world. However, no matter how hard it tries, it is somehow unable to find happiness. Instead, it encounters calamities and more calamities. In fact, all these calamities are the creation of the mind.<br><br>In the beginning of this earth, there were only the heavenly and human realms of existence. The realms of hell, hungry ghost, animal and asura did not exist. But, as humanity progressed through time, the human mind began to change. They developed more and more affinity for evil - greed, anger, ignorance, delusion and foolish thoughts which gave rise to the acts of killing, stealing and sexual misconduct. Happiness gradually diminished and the six realms of cyclic existence evolved out of humanityÂ’s evil mind.<br><br>In todayÂ’s society, the unhappiness of human beings largely results from the countless evil deeds that he has committed. These evil deeds stem mainly from three karma - our bodily action, speech and thought. Thoughts are basically our thinking. If our thoughts are filled with evil thinkings, these will be manifested in our actions. For example, our unkind thoughts of someone may translate into harsh words from our mouth or even into a painful action with our hands. When we do these, we are creating evil karma.<br><br>Our thoughts generate greed, anger and delusions. Through our speech - in the form of telling lies, frivolous talk, slandering and rude or harsh speech; and through our bodily actions by way of killing, stealing and sexual misconduct. This is just a simple explanation. It would be endless to go into details. These three karma bring upon ourselves a lot of sufferings and unhappiness. Therefore, if humanity wants to achieve happiness in life, then he should try to eradicate all these evil deeds which stem from greed, anger, ignorance, killing, stealing and sexual misconduct.<br><br>Many religions teach us to do good and avoid doing bad. Buddhism, in particular, besides teaching us to refrain from all evil deeds and to do all good deeds, also teaches us to purify our minds. Once we have a healthy mental culture, naturally our minds will not be filled with greed, anger, ignorance, and other evil thoughts and actions. We must be aware that the mind controls our speech and actions, it all arises from our minds. Minds are also our thoughts. It is because humanity lacks wisdom and awareness that we are constantly deceived by our minds. We fail to understand the real meaning of karma, or cause and effect. We do not know if our actions will hurt ourselves or others; or if they are beneficial or harmful. Hence, unhappiness and sufferings follow.<br><br>Humanity wants happiness and dislikes sufferings. But, due to the lack of wisdom, we do not know how to free ourselves from our sufferings. However, if we learn from BuddhaÂ’s teachings - practise to purify the three karma of bodily actions, speech and thoughts, our wisdom can be cultivated. Once we have wisdom, whatever we think, speak and do, the actions will be beneficial to ourselves, to others and to the world. These eventually lead to happiness and the world will be filled with brightness and hope.<br><br>Henceforth, we can say that the culture of Buddhism is also Blissful Culture.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is Human Bliss Culture?</span></span><br><br><strong>The Culture of Buddhism is the Voice of Bliss</strong><br><br>What is Human Bliss Culture? We should ask the question in reverse: "What is Human Â‘Un-blissÂ’ Culture?" Since there is bliss culture, therefore there is Â‘un-blissÂ’ culture. The world today has many teachings, including those that teach people to commit evil. Lets think it over. In fact, all humanity originally has bliss, why did it diminish? It is because we human beings destroy our bliss by not observing the rules and the precepts.<br>To use a simple illustration, it is like putting a tea cup at the centre of the table. It is very safe and beyond the reach of small children. If it is put along the edge of the table, then it is very vulnerable to falling and breakage. To replace the broken cup means having to sacrifice twice. If a child places the tea cup at the edge of the table, then the mother will quickly exhort him to move it to the centre. Adults understand the need to put it at the centre of the table, but young children donÂ’t. In fact, this is a precept.<br><br>The regulations about what can or cannot be done are precepts. In fact, everyone needs to observe precepts and be good citizens. Good citizens need to abide by the laws, and that is observing the precepts. Therefore, Jen Chen Buddhism refer to precepts as Â‘means of safeguarding blessingsÂ’. Â‘Safeguarding blessingsÂ’ means safeguarding our own blessings, the blessings which resulted from the virtuous deeds committed in the past. This is analogous to putting the tea cup in the proper place. In fact, all the *Dharma Doors taught by Buddhism is the Voice of Bliss. This Voice of Bliss is spoken by Buddha for all of us. All the teachings of Buddha are meant for we, human beings, to attain the highest order of bliss. If everyone comes to learn Buddhism, cultivate and achieve the pure Nirvana, then, of course, that is the highest, fullest and most complete, and most ultimate bliss. Therefore, the culture of Buddhism is Bliss Culture.<br><br>In many countries, particularly Europe and America, people generally understand what is a Bliss Culture. But, they do not necessarily know what is Buddhism Culture. Therefore, we refer to Â‘Buddhism CultureÂ’ as Â‘Bliss CultureÂ’. The sutras expounded by Sakyamuni Buddha is the standard for Bliss Culture. And, when promoted in this manner, in time to come the entire humanity of the world will be able to pursue the principles that bring bliss as expounded by the Buddha.<br><br>* Dharma doors : The doctrines of Buddha regarded as the door to enlightenment; methods of cultivation.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The title of your Dharma talk is Human Bliss Culture; why then when you answer questions from the audience you did not mention Human Bliss Culture at all? Many of my friends here and I would like to know what is Human Bliss Culture.</span></span><br><br><strong>The culture of Buddhism is Bliss Culture</strong><br><br>It is because the bliss culture that you have in mind and what I have in mind are different. The bliss culture that you have in mind may be how to prosper with great wealth and fortune, or how to have a good wife in order for the family to have bliss. In this manner, the definition of bliss is too narrow! We need to know that the culture of Buddhism is the real bliss culture. If everybody is able to attain the ultimate Nirvana, then this is indeed the real bliss culture.<br><br>The purpose of our learning Buddhism is to distance from suffering and attain happiness. Many people think that to distance from suffering and attain happiness means going to the Western Pure Land. In fact, it is not only this. When we distance from suffering and attain happiness, we have to instantaneously distance from suffering, instantaneously attain happiness and liberation. Some people may be suspicious; how can liberation be attained so easily? In fact, it is very simple. If someone scolds you, and you apologize to him, then that is a small liberation. If someone hits you, and you retaliate; an eye for an eye, then isnÂ’t that very miserable? What happen if that results in loss of life? Even though you are rude to me, I will still apologise very politely to you. IsnÂ’t that being liberated? This is Jen Chen BuddhismÂ’s teaching of liberation. If whilst alive, we cannot even attain small liberationÂ’s like this, then what more to say of liberation after death? In the course of our daily lives, if we are liberated at every moment, then in time to come we will be able to attain the great liberation. Please think it over, isnÂ’t this a very blissful? This is but to use a small matter to illustrate the path of liberation. If we are able to understand more of the Buddha-Dharma and apply them in our life, family, society, country, and to the extent of the entire humanity of the world, then isnÂ’t this a great bliss culture? Therefore, we say that the culture of Buddhism is Bliss Culture.<br><br>(continued in the URL)</blockquote></div>
