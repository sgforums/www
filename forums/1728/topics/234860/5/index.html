The truth is all things are empty of inherent existence, non existence, both and neither. Concepts are also empty of inherent existence, non existence, both and neither. Even emptiness is empty of inherent existence, non existence, both and neither.<br><br>No Emptiness means non existence of emptiness? This is also an illusion, for emptiness is also empty of inherent existence, non existence, both and neither.<br><br>Emptiness is "?" You mean not knowing? I have just explained in the other thread that grasping on not knowing is still a subtle form of knowingness.
