Think about it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Even a moment of thought, or a sound, or the burning sensation leading to your immediate withdrawal of your hands from the kettle, is a pure manifestation of Tathata which is instrinsically aware/luminous, spontaneous self-arising out of conditions, self-so. If it is seen to be that - arising out of conditions, empty in nature, and due to this wisdom we do not impute reality, we do not differentiate and seperate the thought. No self is permitted in this moment of arising. At the level even the will or effort to stop the thought means we have not clearly seen that everything is spontaneous arising including that moment of thought, we become identified with the thought, so we try to find some way to suppress it, etc...<br><br>Even the thought is no different from heart beat... self arise and self liberates in its own accord, it is as natural as walking. Existence will continue to arise, the earth will spin, everything is no diff from this moment of heartbeat. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Oh yes from this perspective of course... there is no question of ignorance or attaining enlightenment... since all is pure spontaneous arising, self-liberating, luminous and blissful. But skillful means are applied to deal with our karmic propensities.</div>

When you start to talk of  relative reality as not reality, then you have a problem don't you? When you say that Ultimate Reality is "luminous" and this reality is not reality, you have a problem.

All relative truths are mental constructs. The world IS reality, ultimately.

They refer to content, <strong>concepts</strong>, not the ultimate reality. So we cannot mix up these two. Of course in regards to all relative truths, their ultimate reality is Emptiness.

Relative reality means dualistic concepts -- this or that, right or wrong, you and me, etc. Precisely because it is dualistic, it is <strong>relative</strong>, meaning this relates to that, etc. The True Self you are talking about encompasses all, is beyond dualistic concepts/relative truths like "self" and "not self", therefore it is ultimate reality.</div>

Like for example we normally think of a keyboard as a permanent, inherent existing entity. Yet the keyboard is actually empty of inherent, permanent reality. And this impermanence, empty of inherent existence is also actually the keyboard?<br><br>Emptiness is not only at ultimate level but also relative level? Is that what you mean?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think ultimate reality is not about the ego, the self, or any concepts whatsoever, although it is not separate from relative realities. Ultimate reality cannot be attained. Neither can it be "known". Recognition is not a "knowing", there is nothing in particular to know, neither is there someone who knows. Insight/enlightenment/awakening is not about attaining or knowing anything, but waking up from a big dream. It has always been said that Ultimate Reality is ungraspable and imageless. To hold on to a "Self" as ultimate reality is already wrong. Ultimate reality is just the arising and ceasing, everything spontaneously self-arises and self-liberates. All along our existence has been non-dual, so oneness cannot be prescribed (or attained), it can only be described. Meaning, there never was a seperation of subject and object (therefore achieving 'union' or 'oneness' does not make sense), all along it is our ignorance fooling ourselves. There is nothing to attain.. and you can't find yourself outside Mind (as in True Mind) means it doesn't help when you are searching for the bull you are riding on in the first place. It does not literally means finding something which you can identify with "IT" and call it "Self".<br><br><blockquote><a href="http://www.nathangill.com/pages/readingroom/going-beyond.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nathangill.com/pages/readingroom/going-beyond.html</a><br><br><strong>Going beyond.</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">So there's an awareness of this room right now, but what about the unmanifest level?</span><br><br>What unmanifest level?

There's simply this as it is: simple presence. This is already that 'realm'. Consciousness (awareness and the presently appearing content of awareness) is already one or whole, and when the story of 'me' - of identification - is seen as just a play, a movie, then all pursuit of oneness, all pursuit of the beyond or whatever, quite naturally becomes obsolete.</blockquote><blockquote><a href="http://www.nathangill.com/pages/readingroom/cosmic-entertainment.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nathangill.com/pages/readingroom/cosmic-entertainment.html</a><br><br><strong>The cosmic entertainment.</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Are you saying that thought doesn't make a difference, that nothing makes a difference in the sense of cause and effect?
