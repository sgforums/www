              Intact 80 Years After Death </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Ivan Pentchoukov, Nataly
              Teplitsky, Epoch Times | June 13, 2017 </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              body of a Russian Buddhist leader who died 80 years ago is not showing any
              signs of decay to this day.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Dashi-Dorzho
              Itigelov passed away in 1927. He left a note for monks to exhume his
              body at a later date. When the Buddhist monks exhumed his body
              48 years later in 1955, they were astonished to find no signs of decay.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">They
              exhumed the body again 22 years later in 1973 and were again stunned to find
              the body in its original state. The monks kept their findings secret, fearing
              that the Soviet communist regime could destroy the body as part of it’s
              massive campaign to wipe out religion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              monks exhumed the body again in 2002, well after the collapse of the soviet
              regime. The body still appeared alive. This time, they made the miracle public
              and called on scientists to examine it. The body appeared preserved as though
              it was mummified, although no mummification was actually performed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“Samples
              taken 75 years after the body had been buried, show that the organics of the
              skin, hair, and nails of the dead man aren’t any different from that of a
              living human,” said Galina Yershova, professor of history at the Russian
              State University for Humanities, according to Pravda.ru.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“His
              joints flex, the soft tissues are elastic just like in a living person, and
              after they opened the box, where the body of the Lama lay for 75 years, there
              was a very pleasant fragrance,” Yershova said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              official statement by scientists and pathologists who examined the body in 2002
              was that the body was “in the condition of someone who had died 36 hours ago”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“In
              my years of practice I have encountered quite a few instances of preserved
              bodies, but those were either the result of mummification or extreme
              environmental conditions,” Professor Viktor Zvyagin of the Federal Center of
              Forensic Medicine told the Buddhist Channel in a telephone interview. “But this
              is something different, and for me, incomprehensible. It’s a phenomenon that
              calls for the most detailed research.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">According
              to the results, the protein structure of the body was not damaged; it was
              identical to the one of a living person.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              miraculous body has become holy for Buddhists in the Russian region of
              Buryatia, where it now rests in the Ivolgin Buddhist Monastery in the regional
              capital of Ulan-Ude.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Itigelov’s
              fame reached far and wide. In 2013, Russian president Vladimir Putin visited
              the monastery. The president spent some time alone with Itigelov at the
              beginning of his visit. Before leaving he went again to say “farewell”,
              according to Putin’s press secretary.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              president noted that Buddhism is one of Russia’s traditional religions. He also
              vowed the government’s support for the monastery.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              Soviet Union, under Stalin, repressed all manifestations of religion,
              executing hundreds of lamas and destroying 46 Buddhist temples and monasteries.
              In the years since the Soviet Union collapse, across Russia the Buddhists have
              begun to thrive again, rebuilding ruined temples and attracting more followers.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The Hambo Lama’s History</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Hambo
              Lama Itigelov studied at the Anninsky Datsan, the Buddhist University in
              Buryatia. Itigelov received degrees in medicine and philosophy (on the nature
              of emptiness). He also created an encyclopedia of pharmacology.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              1911, Itigelov became a Hambo Lama, the head of the Buddhist faith in
              Russia. During the period from 1913 to 1917, he opened the first Buddhist
              temple in St. Petersburg. He also published religious tractates and
              teachings and united many of the religion’s factions.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              Hambo Lama was invited to celebrate the 300th anniversary of the Romanov
              family, and on March 19, 1917, the Russian Tsar Nikolai II gave him the St.
              Stanislav Award.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">During
              the First World War, Itighelov was helping the army with money, clothes and
              medications. He also had built a set of hospitals where lama doctors helped to
              cure wounded militants. For his contributions, Itighelov was awarded with St.
              Anna medal.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              1926, he warned the Buddhist monks about the coming ‘red’ terror and advised
              them to flee to Tibet. But he himself never left Russia. His prediction about
              the red terror came true. The Communist regime killed an estimated 30 million
              Russian people in the decades the followed.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              1927, Itighelov told lamas that he was preparing to leave this world. He
              started a meditation and soon was dead.</span></p>

              <p>Not surprising.  ä¹�å�Žå±± is famous for this.  On record, there are more than 15 monks whose bodies do not decay.  The pity is that China communists destroyed most of it.  </p>
