              <p>GENEVA/NAIROBI (Reuters) - The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) almost doubled its budget for Somali aid Thursday but said it would not be able to help U.N. food supplies get through to starving Somalis.</p>
              <p>ICRC President Jakob Kellenberger said his independent agency was boosting its emergency operation to help 1.1 million people in the famine-stricken country and was asking donors for an extra 67 million Swiss francs ($86 million) in 2011.</p>
              <p>He said the ICRC had good access to southern Somalia, much of which is controlled by Islamist militants, with two supply routes through Somali ports and one overland from Kenya, but the humanitarian organization needed more supplies.</p>
              <p>That contrasts with the U.N. World Food Program (WFP), which has the food but says it cannot reach more than two million Somalis in the worst-hit areas because the militant group al Shabaab has blocked access to most aid agencies.</p>
              <p>"It's crucial that you can ensure access and have capacity to operate big food pipelines," Kellenberger told a news conference in Geneva.</p>
              <p>He said the U.N. food agency normally used partner organizations to distribute its food aid, but it was very difficult for them to get access, and the ICRC would not distribute aid on behalf of other agencies.</p>
              <p>"The ICRC is an independent agency, for reasons you'll understand, for its protection," said Kellenberger, a former senior Swiss diplomat.</p>
              <p>"And I think that's important for its perception, for its personality, especially in delicate contexts like this. I have also to add that there would also be certain logistic problems."</p>
              <p>The ICRC has not given al Shabaab any payment, taxes or concessions to get access, Kellenberger added.</p>
              <p>EXPLORING ALL AVENUES</p>
              <p>David Orr, a WFP spokesman in Nairobi, declined to respond to Kellenberger's comments specifically.</p>
              <p>"WFP is exploring all avenues with all partners and exploring all channels to get access to those in need closest to the epicenter of the famine," Orr said.</p>
              <p>Earlier this week, Washington relaxed the rules imposed on charities operating in al Shabaab-controlled regions in a bid to boost the amount of relief reaching those areas.</p>
              <p>Bruce Wharton, deputy U.S. assistant secretary of state for African affairs, said Thursday it would be a mistake to second-guess whether some aid would inevitably end up in the hands of al Shabaab.</p>
              <p>"What we would like is for all of the food assistance to go to the innocent people who are desperately in need and for none of it to go to al Shabaab. But I think that we all recognize that the imperative right now is to save lives," Wharton told a news conference by telephone from Washington.</p>
              <p>An ICRC spokeswoman said the situation in southern Somalia was worsening, with more than 20 percent of children under five in an emergency condition because of severe acute malnutrition.</p>
              <p>Caught between conflict and famine, hundreds of refugees are flooding into Mogadishu every day -- more than 100,000 people have arrived in the capital in the last two months -- only to stumble into a raging insurgency.</p>
              <p>In the Badbaado camp, a city of makeshift shacks home to almost 30,000 displaced people outside Mogadishu, Kalthuma Hassan mourned her three children, all of whom had succumbed to malnutrition. The last died in her arms early Thursday.</p>
              <p>"All those trucks of food have been parked here for days. They say they cannot distribute for security reasons. We cannot work it out -- maybe they want to sell the food after we die of hunger. I am afraid I will die before Ramadan ends," Hassan said, sobbing quietly.</p>
              <p>"Foreign and local people visit you everyday. They take your photos, officials promise you food, medicine, but in fact we are just dying," she said.</p>
              <p>Jon Brause, an official at the U.S. government's aid agency, said despite the easing of rules, it was still not safe for aid agencies to go into southern Somalia.</p>
              <p>Kellenberger said the ICRC might be willing to accept U.N. food aid if really necessary.</p>
              <p>"In the end the over-riding objective must be to help as many people as possible and whenever certain arrangements have to be made -- in a moment where if they were not made there would be losses in human terms -- I think certainly I would show a certain flexibility."</p>

              <p><strong>US: 29,000 Somali children under 5 dead in famine</strong></p>
              <p>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — The drought and famine in Somalia have killed more than 29,000 children under the age of 5, according to U.S. estimates, the first time such a precise death toll has been released related to the Horn of Africa crisis.</p>
              <p>The United Nations has said previously that tens of thousands of people have died in the drought, the worst in Somalia in 60 years. The U.N. says 640,000 Somali children are acutely malnourished, a statistic that suggests the death toll of small children will rise.</p>
              <p>Nancy Lindborg, an official with the U.S. government aid arm, told a congressional committee in Washington on Wednesday that the U.S. estimates that more than 29,000 children under the age of 5 have died in the last 90 days in southern Somalia. That number is based on nutrition and mortality surveys verified by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
              <p>The U.N. on Wednesday declared three new regions in Somalia famine zones, bringing the total number to five. Out of a population of roughly 7.5 million, the U.N. says 3.2 million Somalis are in need of immediate lifesaving assistance.</p>
              <p>Getting aid to Somalia has been made more difficult because al-Qaida-linked militants control much of the country's most desperate areas. Al-Shabab has denied that a famine is taking place, and won't give access to the World Food Program, the world's biggest provider of food aid.</p>
              <p>Tens of thousands of refugees have fled south-central Somalia in hopes of finding food at camps in Ethiopia, Kenya and in Mogadishu, the Somali capital.</p>
              <p>Hundreds of millions of dollars have been donated to fight the hunger crisis, but the U.N. says it needs hundreds of millions more.</p>

              <p>yes... unfortunately, until al-kebab douchebags are removed, or there is a way to stop them from using famine as a weapon, the people there cannot be helped properly without the aid workers dying and the food aid being stolen or destroyed by the asshole terrorists</p>

              <p>not much.. just like what always happens in most of these famines, lots of donations, food aid goes there, nothing changes...</p>
              <p>this time, the food is already there, just that the situation is hampered by armed maniacs refusing to let the food and aid workers in...</p>
              <p>no amount of donations will help...</p>
              <p>what is needed and is always neglected is the follow-up.. and this is what the bastards causing the trouble is trying their damnest to prevent... because it'll take the power away from them...</p>
              <p>the solution is to educate the people affected and give them enough opportunity to improve their own lives, so that they are empowered to do something about their community and area... and that would mean the warlords and militants would become inconsequential and useless... which is why they are fighting tooth and nail to prevent the people from improving themselves...</p>
              <p>there is evil in the world... most of it is manifested in self-serving, self-importance and sheer greed for power so much so that they will not hesitate to let people suffer and die if they can hang on to their own sense of self-importance and power over other people...</p>
              <p>and it is not about religion even when they profess it to be, it is about power and dominance...</p>

              <p>IMO, the control / deterrent measures seemed to be from US on charity aids. Since Al-Shabab has denied that a famine is taking place, WFP should work together with ICRC for smooth delivery of foods and medical supplies. Helicopters are good transportation. If al Shabaab's agree for payment / taxes to gain access, WFP should not hesitate to pay them, and request for military protection from Somali on the transportation of life saving aids.</p>

              It is so sad to read about this .  Human lives are like ants in that part of the world.  No value.  
              
              Human in other parts of the world trying hard to help these Somalia families but stopped by a small group of terrorists who may want the food to eat or sell.   Why can't some military /army do something about it?  I see so many hero movies about military rescuing hostages from terrorists , why can't they rescue food ?
