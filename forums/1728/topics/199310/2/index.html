Buddhists have been taught the first approach and that is the way we share with others.

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I am interested not in converting other people to Buddhism but in how we Buddhists can contribute to human society, according to our own ideas. I believe that other religious faiths also think in a similar way, seeking to contribute to the common aim....<br><br>Just as Buddha showed an example of contentment, tolerance, and serving others without selfish motivation, so did Jesus Christ. Almost all of the great teachers lived a saintly life - not luxuriously like kings or emperors but as simple human beings. Their inner strength was tremendous, limitless, but the external appearance was of contentment with a simple way of life.<br><br>....the motivation of all religious practice is similar - love, sincerity, honesty. The way of life of practically all religious persons is contentment. The teachings of tolerance, love, and compassion are the same. A basic goal is the benefit of humankind - each type of system seeking in its own unique ways to improve human beings. If we put too much emphasis on our own philosophy, religion, or theory, are too attached to it, and try to impose it on other people, it makes trouble. Basically all the great teachers, such as Gautama Buddha, Jesus Christ, or Mohammed, founded their new teachings with a motivation of helping their fellow humans. They did not mean to gain anything for themselves nor to create more trouble or unrest in the world.<br><br>Most important is that we respect each other and learn from each other those things that will enrich our own practice. Ever if all the systems are separate, since they each have the same goal, the study of each other is helpful.</span></span><br><br><span class="large">- from "The Dalai Lama: A Policy of Kindness" compiled and edited by SidneyPiburn, published by Snow Lion Publications</span></div>

I believe that other religious faiths also think in a similar way, seeking to contribute to the common aim....<br><br>Just as Buddha showed an example of contentment, tolerance, and serving others without selfish motivation, so did Jesus Christ. Almost all of the great teachers lived a saintly life - not luxuriously like kings or emperors but as simple human beings. Their inner strength was tremendous, limitless, but the external appearance was of contentment with a simple way of life.<br><br>....the motivation of all religious practice is similar - love, sincerity, honesty. The way of life of practically all religious persons is contentment. The teachings of tolerance, love, and compassion are the same. A basic goal is the benefit of humankind - each type of system seeking in its own unique ways to improve human beings. If we put too much emphasis on our own philosophy, religion, or theory, are too attached to it, and try to impose it on other people, it makes trouble. Basically all the great teachers, such as Gautama Buddha, Jesus Christ, or Mohammed, founded their new teachings with a motivation of helping their fellow humans. They did not mean to gain anything for themselves nor to create more trouble or unrest in the world.<br><br>Most important is that we respect each other and learn from each other those things that will enrich our own practice. Ever if all the systems are separate, since they each have the same goal, the study of each other is helpful.</span></span><br><br><span class="large">- from "The Dalai Lama: A Policy of Kindness" compiled and edited by SidneyPiburn, published by Snow Lion Publications</span></div></blockquote>This is, in essence, denying Buddhism as much as it accepts it.<br><br>Tell me, do you believe in relieve of suffering as Buddha taught?<br><br>If yes, then automatically Christ's teachings and Muhammad's teachings and other teachers' teachings are nullified, is it not, since they all do not teach the same thing?<br><br>Secondly, I understand your desire to see people be more 'good, compassionate etc' through learning of other religions.

Are those buddhist friends of yours actually into Buddhism? or just registered by birth Buddhist?  If it is later, no wonder they kept mum about their religion, because they do not know what they could share with you.<br><br>Maybe if you have any doubts or questions, you could post your question here, ilke now, so that many dharma brothers and sisters in this forum could share with you their ideas and knowledge.</div>

Due to this Universal attitude to all things, Buddhism also respects all other religions; even acknowledging the founder of each religion a holy deity. The Lord Buddha Himself even proclaimed that Buddhist Dharma is about the Universe and not about Him - He is merely a tool used by the Universe to show how one should behave, speak and think when on the path to liberation</div>
