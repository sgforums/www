Buddhism can be best summarised by the words of Buddha himself:<br><br>Learn to do good,<br><br>Cease to do harm,<br><br>Control the mind,<br><br>And benefit others.<br><br>Buddhism teaches us how to overcome our problems and difficulties by understanding and preventing their causes.  Whereas we usually look to outward circumstances for the causes of our problems, Buddhism teaches us to look inwards. Buddha showed how our feelings of dissatisfaction arise from negative states of mind - primarily anger, attachment, and ignorance - and offered methods to eliminate these by developing generosity, compassion, wisdom and other positive states of mind.<br><br>Buddhism teaches people that the real source of happiness is inner peace. If our mind is peaceful, we shall be happy all the time, regardless of external conditions, but if it is disturbed or troubled in any way, we shall never be happy, no matter how good our external conditions may be. External conditions can only make us happy if our mind is peaceful. We can understand this through our own experience. For instance, even if we are in the most beautiful surroundings and have everything we need, the moment we get angry any happiness we may have disappears. This is because anger has destroyed our inner peace.<br><br><strong>We can see from this that if we want true, lasting happiness we need to develop and maintain a special experience of inner peace</strong>. The only way we can do this is by training our mind through spiritual practice - gradually reducing and eliminating our negative, disturbed states of mind and replacing them with positive, peaceful states.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by SocialOutcast:<br>So many people are suffering now, yet so little people know about Buddhism.[/b]</blockquote>As singapore is considered a young country buddhism is still very new to singapore and it has only become a trend in recent years<br><br><a href="http://www.yayapapayaz.com/comm/20050520_st_buddhism.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.yayapapayaz.com/comm/20050520_st_buddhism.htm </a><br><br><blockquote>Why you so selfish don't tell us??</blockquote>Wat do u think we r doing here.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Btw BuddhaÂ’s <strong>main purpose </strong>in teaching people how they could achieve inner peace was so that they could then go on to share that experience with others. Buddhism teaches that this is the most effective way in which it is possible for them to benefit others.<br><br>Buddhists understand that <strong>without inner peace outer peace is impossible</strong>. <strong>We all wish for world peace, but world peace will never be achieved unless people first establish peace within their own minds</strong>. Only by <strong>creating peace within our own mind and helping others to do the same can we hope to achieve peace in this world.  </strong><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i would agree to a bit of wad the starter of this thread. Many Buddhists I know concentrate too much on their own cultivation that they forgot to reach out. I wont say theya re selfish, but rather 'unmindful' of the need to reach out to people. Cos from personal experiences, they are some of the sweetest and most wonderful people! But unfortunately, a little bit boring.<br><br>Dhamma groups in SG are opening out and doing more reaching out to nominal and non-Buddhists. However, we do it in a peaceful way. So do not generalise by saying 'ALL Buddhists are SELFISH'. That is a real sweeping statement and in fact you will learn more of this essay technique in GP. But I digress.<br><br>I would agree that in SG, many people do not know much about the real principals of Buddhism,, often mixing it with Taoism and other CHinese shamanistic practices. But things are changing.<br><br>I see more and more young people coming to embrace the Buddha's teachings. Just look at the crowd each time Ajahn Brahm comes for a talk in SG! Wow! I didn't know so much youing people can be interested in the Dhamma.<br><br>While in SG, we are still in the infnacy stage. Dhamma propagation in Western countires are at its best. It is a fact that Buddhism is Australia's fasterst growing religion and many people in America and Europe are embracing this faith. Just look at the number of Dhamma centres each Western country has, how could you say Buddhist are 'selfish'?<br><br>But you raised a good point to many of us. There is a need to share the Dhamma in modern ways and very tactfully. But lets not be too agreesive. We use wisdom and compassion. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Without sadness, we do not know what is happiness. Vice versa.The four noble truth is based on 'suffering'. Without tasting or understanding suffering from experience, man could not truly understand tha pains of suffering or be convinced of the validity of the four noble truth.<br><br>In addition, even if we preach the truth, people may not have the wisdom to comprehend yet. It also depends on their affinity with buddhism. The preacher of the truth has to be high in cultivation and ne enlightened to teach the right understanding and view of the teachings which can be so profound at time.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The layman Vimalakirti said, "Because the world is sick, I am sick. Because people suffer, I have to suffer." This statement was also made by the Buddha. Please don't think that because you are unhappy, because there is pain in your heart, that you cannot go to the Buddha. It is exactly because there is pain in your heart that communication is possible. Your suffering and my suffering are the basic condition for us to enter the Buddha's heart, and for the Buddha to enter our hearts.<br><br>For forty-five years, the Buddha said, over and over again, "I teach only suffering and the transformation of suffering." When we recognize and acknowledge our own suffering, the Buddha - which means the Buddha in us - will look at it, discover what has brought it about, and prescribe a course of action that can transform it into peace, joy, and liberation. Suffering is the means the Buddha used to liberate himself, and it is also the means by which we can become free.<br><br>The ocean of suffering is immense, but if you turn around, you can see the land. The seed of suffering in you may be strong, but don't wait until you have no more suffering before allowing yourself to be happy.<br>When one tree in the garden is sick, you have to care for it. But don't overlook all the healthy trees. Even while you have pain in your heart, you can enjoy the many wonders of life - the beautiful sunset, the smile of a child, the many flowers and trees. To suffer is not enough. Please don't be imprisoned by your suffering. If you have experienced hunger, you know that having food is a miracle. If you have suffered from the cold, you know the preciousness of warmth. When you have suffered, you know how to appreciate the elements of paradise that are present.<br>If you dwell only in your suffering, you will miss paradise. Don't ignore your suffering, but don't forget to enjoy the wonders of life, for your sake and for the benefit of many beings.<br><br>- By Thich Nhat<br><br>Some interesting Quotes, meaningful and wise. hope it helps to lighten some burden of sufferings.

And more importantly Buddhists are not over zealous about their beliefs such that they must impose it on others.<br><br>Secondly, it may happen that you have very few friends that are Buddhists, or are surrounded by a social circle of Christians. That is also one of the reason why you do not hear from many Buddhists.<br><br>Thirdly, not all who calls themselves Buddhists are Buddhists. They can be those kind of gods/deities worshippers and in actuality have nothing to do with Buddhism.</div>

That is why it is best to find out yourself. But do remember that there are no lack of teachers out there and Buddhists who do share what they know about Buddhism to their friends. It may happen that you simply do not have a friend who is Buddhist.<br><br>Secondly, la lapine blanche comes from England, and although Buddhism is rapidly growing in England (one of the fastest rising religions there), Buddhists is still a minority in England, unlike Singapore.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Preaching does not guarantee understanding, belief or ultimately, conversion.<br>There is no point having people blindly doing mass marketing and advertising to convert people who may end up embracing a religion before understanding it. I suppose that is why Buddhists do not preach on a wide scale - because Buddhism is a way of life and not hmm.. just a faith issue.<br><br>However, you cannot deny that it is easy for someone to access knowledge for Buddhism to get it. There are many temples, dharma classes, internet and buddhists around who are happy to discuss it. In that case, you perhaps can say Buddhists preach not with words but with their actions - I notice a lot of Buddhists who spend time doing volunteer work, or other charitable acts.</div>
