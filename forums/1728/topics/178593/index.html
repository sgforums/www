            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by NT2:</div><div class="quote_body">how did the first karma cycle starts?</div></blockquote>Karma is formed when there is intentions. It has always been. There are three kinds of karma, Mind, Speech, Action karma.<br><br>When ignorance arises out of cause and conditions, it sets up a 'chain reaction' known as the 12 interdependant origination, and the sentient being keeps on accumulating karma until his liberation and enlightenment.<br><br><blockquote>If karma is not fate or predestination, then what is it? Let us look at the term itself. Karma means action, means "to do". Immediately we have an indication that the real meaning of karma is not fate because <strong>karma is action. It is dynamic.</strong> But it is more than simply action because it is not mechanical action. It is not unconscious or involuntary action. It is intentional, conscious, deliberate, wilful action. How is it that this intentional, wilful action conditions or determines our situation? It is because every action must have a reaction, an effect. This truth has been expressed in regard to the physical universe by the great physicist Newton who formulated the law which states that every action must have an equal and opposite reaction. In the moral sphere of conscious actions, we have a counterpart to the physical law of action and reaction, the law that every intentional, wilful action must have its effect. This is why we sometimes speak either of Karma-Vipaka, intentional action and its ripened effect, or we speak of Karma-Phala, intentional action and its fruit. It is when we speak of intentional action together with its effect or fruit that we speak of the Law of Karma. </blockquote>But if your question is the first-cause question, then perhaps this one shld answer you.<br><br><blockquote>"To those who talked about the first cause of this world, the Buddha responded by saying that it is impossible to find a first cause since everything is changing, interdependent and conditioned by other things. Something that acts as the cause in the present may become the effect in the future. Later that same effect may again become the cause. Such phenomenon continues ad infinitum. It is called the universal law of Anicca or impermanency.</blockquote></div>

But I did tell them that I want to set these animals free, to make them feel guilty perhaps. lol.<br><br>Freeing of animal and save their life is only one of the benefits.<br>Most importantly, you take refuge on their behalf and let them hear buddha name chanting. They not only thank you, but will also thank buddha and 3 gems.<br><br>It also helps to promote compassion within yourself. This morning, when I release some frogs to a secret location, I really feel happy to see them appear so peaceful and happy. Since I save their life and let them hear dharma, I am their bodhisatva.<br>In fact, all living beings are our parents in the past and buddha in the future.<br>This is also why bodhisatva ksitigarba vowed to save all beings in hell, before reaching nirvana.</div>
