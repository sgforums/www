              <p>There is one Great Compassion Repentence Dharma Service at my temple <strong>Fo Guang Shan Singapore</strong> <strong>æ–°åŠ å�¡ä½›å…‰å±±</strong> this coming Sunday 18th September. It's held regularly once a month. My temple is predominantly Mandarin-based and follows Chinese Mahayana traditions (predominantly Zen but also do chanting for Amitabha Pureland), since it's Fo Guang Shan from Taiwan. Buddha Light International Assocation (BLIA) åœ‹éš›ä½›å…‰æœƒ is one of the largest buddhist organizations in the world with about 6 million members and more than 250 temples around the world. I'm a member of BLIA.</p>
              <p>I welcome you to visit and join the dharma service at my temple. There is also a place for Sutra writing æŠ„ç¶“ in my temple and a æ»´æ°´æˆ¿ (teahouse) on top floor of my temple. The dharma service is held every Sunday 10am-12noon at my temple. There are various other activities held at my temple.</p>
              <p>Master Hsin Yun æ˜Ÿé›²å¤§å¸« is the founder of Fo Guang Shan ä½›å…‰å±± and is the 48th lineage holder of Linji Chan è‡¨æ¿Ÿå®— (one of the 5 sects of Zen ç¦ªå®— in China)</p>

              <p>However, in some dharma services, if you want to provide offerings or lamp service é»žç‡ˆ , you need to register and pay a small amount of money for it.</p>

              <p>Breaking precepts is common at a beginner stage. I used to break precepts initially, but as long as you continuously repent and vow never to break it, slowly the bad habits will diminish and you will find that you will be able to hold on to the precepts.</p>
              <p>Participating in repentence service is good because it trains you to be mindful of your daily action, and helps you to repent for your wrong-doings and vows never to commit those bad karma anymore.</p>

              <p>The Buddha Tooth Relic temple at Chinatown has a full schedule on their website. You can read it for their regular chanting sessions.  They hold chanting sessions daily, weekly and monthly for specific sutra.</p>
              <p>I went to Fo guang Shan before and like the modern building very much. The vegetarian buffet meal is a good spread and there is a modern cafe in there too. I like the sutra writing place with their old style wood table like back in ancient China.  It's a pity its very far for me to journey there.  Quite miss the Green and modern temple. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>I've broken that precept ä¸�é‚ªæ·« countless of times. It's one of the hardest precept to hold on to for guys. But I've managed to successfully overcome it. Here are the steps I can offer you to break that viscious bad habits æˆ’é‚ªæ·«.</p>
              <p>1. Do not even watch online porn, nudity at all. Don't even watch it. Your mind will capture those image and store in your consciousness as memory. Once that image is in your mind, you will find it hard to rid yourself of it and you might feel an urge to commit sexual misconduct.</p>
              <p>2. Do not masturbate. If you realize that any sexual thoughts or cravings arrive in your mind, start chanting Buddha's name (such as å�—ç„¡é˜¿å½Œé™€ä½› ) or å�—ç„¡è§€ä¸–éŸ³è�©è–©. Chanting those continuously in your mind until the sexual thoughts disappear. It's extremely effective whenever you find that thought has arrived.</p>
              <p>3. If you try to masturbate, visualize as if there are buddha and deities looking at you. You will not dare to masturbate.</p>
              <p>4. In the Buddhist temple, try to participate in the Medicine Buddha's lamp lighting é»žè—¥å¸«ç‡ˆ for yourself.It will rid yourself of some very evil habits. Of course, do participate in all dharma services esp. repentence service in temples.</p>
              <p>5. Chanting the following sutra everyday (once in the morning, and once at night):</p>
              <p><strong>å…«å��å…«ä½›å¤§æ‡ºæ‚”æ–‡ (88 Buddha Great Repentence Verse)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>è§€ä¸–éŸ³è�©è–©æ™®é–€å“� (Guanyin's Sutra)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>å¤§æ‚²å’’ (Compassion Mantra)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>æ¥žåš´å’’ (Shurangama Mantra)</strong></p>
              <p>They have an effect of subduing your mind. I used to have sex addiction problems, but I've been practising those for 1 year and have managed to hold up to the precepts.</p>
              <p><strong>æ¥žåš´å’’ (Shurangama Mantra)</strong> is a mantra specifically used for dealing with "sex demons" in your mind. It is highly recommended to chant.</p>
              <p>If you find that you cannot control your urge and have serious sex addiction problems, there is also medical help from psychiatrist available to help one deal with it.</p>

              <p>As a general rule, chanting of sutra should not be done inside the bedroom or even in the toilet as this is disrespectful to the Buddha and Bodhisattva. Unless you have no choice such as you're renting a room in a flat (and the living room is occupied), you're allowed to chant in the bedroom. If you have no choice but to chant inside the bedroom, make sure you chant it only in your mind and not chant it out loud.</p>
              <p>It is always recommended that chanting the sutra (out loud) should be done outside the bedroom, preferably in the living room if you're at home and in front of the Buddha statue (if you have one at home). It would even be more respectful if you can burn incense and do offerings to Buddha when chanting.</p>
