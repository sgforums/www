            <div class='col-md body'>Where does your daily practice of patience that brings all this benefit come from? How did you learn to be patient?<br><br>Ask yourself, <span style="font-style: italic;"> <span style="color: red;">Â“Where did I learn this patience that I practice? I learned it from those who have been angry at me. By depending on the angry person I have been able to practice, to realize patience. Therefore, all the peace and happiness that I enjoy in this and future lives as a result of my practice of patience has come from the angry person. It is through the kindness of the angry person, who gave me the opportunity to practice patience, that I am able to offer peace and happiness to all sentient beings as a result. Because of this person I am able to accomplish the perfection of patience, the other perfections, and thereby complete the bodhisattvaÂ’s path and attain full enlightenment. Through this personÂ’s kindness I can eradicate all errors of mind and gain all realizations. It is the angry person who has given me this opportunity. This person is actually giving me enlightenment. Through the kindness of this person I can also offer all peace and happiness to all sentient beings. How kind this person is! How much benefit this person has given me! This is the most precious person in my life! Even if someone were to give me billions and trillions of dollars, I could never buy the peace of mind that I get through the practice of patience. Therefore, the angry person who gives me the opportunity to practice patience is of much greater value than trillions of dollars, mountains of diamonds, acres of gold.Â” </span></span><br><br>The angry person is even more precious than trillions of wish- fulfilling jewels. The most precious material object we can think of in these examples is the wish-fulfilling jewel. Legend has it that by praying to this mythical gem, you get whatever sense enjoyment you desire. Nevertheless, the angry person with whom you practice patience is far more valuable than trillions of these wish-granting gems. No amount of material wealth can bring you the inner peace that you can achieve by practicing patience with an angry person. ThatÂ’s why such people are so precious.<br><br>Anyway, in order to practice patience, you need an angry person. As the great bodhisattva Shantideva pointed out in his teaching, the Bodhicharyavatara, the Buddha isnÂ’t angry with you, so you canÂ’t practice patience with him. And a doctorÂ’s only thought is to help you, so thereÂ’s no opportunity there either. Similarly, your friends arenÂ’t angry with you, so thereÂ’s no chance to practice patience with them. Therefore, if thereÂ’s nobody angry at you, thereÂ’s no opportunity to put into practice the teachings youÂ’ve received from the Buddha and your gurus. ThatÂ’s why the angry person is most kind, precious and indispensable in your life, you can see how much more precious the angry person is. The benefits of practicing patience are infinite.<br><br>We always want in our life someone who loves us. We feel that this is important for our happiness. But you can see now that itÂ’s much more important to have in our life someone who doesnÂ’t love us, whoÂ’s angry at us, so that we can practice training our minds. As I mentioned before, if you donÂ’t have such a person, if you donÂ’t train your mind, then even if you do find a friend, thereÂ’s the danger that through lack of patience, youÂ’ll turn your friend into an enemy.<br><br>Therefore, to maintain harmonious relationships with others, to keep your friends, you have to practice patience. To lead a happy and successful life, you almost have to train yourself like a soldier preparing for battle. Soldiers train before marching off to war. You need to do the same. Training your mind by practicing meditation on patience is the way to prepare yourself for the battles of daily life. Leaving aside the happiness of future lives or that of other sentient beings, even for the happiness of this life, you have to practice patience.<br><br><span class="large"><strong>The happiness and difficulties we experience every day come from our mind.
