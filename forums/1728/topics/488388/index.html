              Buddhist deity Kshitigarbha, or “He who encompasses the Earth,” has a powerful
              and ubiquitous presence in Japan, where figures of him depicted as a
              bald-headed priest and often wearing red bibs or other articles of clothing are
              common not only in Buddhist temples, but also along the sides of roads all over
              the country. Known in India as early as the 4th century, this bodhisattva is
              believed to have vowed to save all beings from the torments of Hell during the
              interim between the passing of the historical Buddha, Shakyamuni (the Buddha of
              our age), and the arrival of the future Buddha, Maitreya. In the Himalayan
              Tantric schools, he is worshipped as one of the Eight Bodhisattvas and is
              represented there as a crowned, bejeweled bodhisattva figure seated on a lotus
              and holding a sacred jewel in his right hand. However, he was never a popular
              figure of worship in either India or the Himalayas. </span><span style='font-size: 15.5pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .95pt; '></span></p>

              East Asia, and in Japan in particular, on the other hand, he has been revered
              from an early date. As the “good” Judge of Hell, he is believed to rule over Yama
              and the nine other Kings or Judges of Hell, and in this capacity, is credited
              with being able to save souls from the punishments issued by these ten infernal
              judges. Because of this power, together with additional abilities that have
              been ascribed to him over the centuries, he has become one of Japan’s most
              widely loved and worshipped deities, and his presence is felt there well beyond
              the grounds of Buddhist temples.</span><span style='font-size: 15.5pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .95pt; '></span></p>

              was introduced to Japan in the 8th century, when a statue of him was brought
              from China and placed in an important Buddhist shrine in the ancient capital of
              Nara. Known in Japan as Jizo, this deity’s early popularity reached a peak
              during the late Heian era (794–1192), when the rise of the Pure Land (J. Jodo)
              Sect intensified fears among the people about Hell in the afterlife. Along with
              the Buddha associated with the Pure Land Sect, Amitabha (J. Amida), who
              promised rebirth in his glorious Western Paradise, Jizo, since he was believed
              to be able to save devotees from the torments of Hell, gained a significant
              following among Japanese Buddhists. It was probably around this time that he
              was first depicted as a priest, with a shaved head and priest’s robes, and
              carrying a staff in his right hand and a sacred jewel in his left. Such a
              representation is unique among bodhisattvas, and may originate from the belief
              that the bodhisattva first appeared to the Buddha in the form of a priest.</span><span style='font-size: 15.5pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .95pt; '></span></p>

              around the 14th or 15th century in Japan, Jizo became associated in particular
              with the souls of dead children, who, according to popular Buddhist belief,
              became stranded in a limbo known as Sai no Kawara, the “River Beach of Sai.”
              There, they were forced to construct towers of pebbles as a way of attaining
              rebirth, only to see them knocked down daily by the Old Hag of Hell, Datsueba,
              who guards the Sanzu Gawa, the Buddhist equivalent of the Greek mythical River
              Styx. Since this time, images of Jizo have been commissioned by bereaved
              parents and placed in temple graveyards in the hope that Jizo will travel to
              Sai no Kawara and relieve the souls of their children from these tortuous
              labors. These small stone figures of Jizo often wear clothing or hold toys
              belonging to the children. Major temples, such as the Hasedera in Kamakura,
              have sections of their graveyards filled with row upon row of such figures,
              smiling sweetly and dressed in children’s clothing, donated by parents as a
              prayer for the repose of their lost children.</span><span style='font-size: 15.5pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .95pt; '></span></p>

              larger figures of Jizo can be found dressed in red bibs and caps, but are not
              necessarily connected with the death of children. In Japan, the color red has
              for many centuries been worn protectively to quell demons and cure illnesses,
              and has also become associated with deities of healing, fertility, and
              childbirth. As well as being associated with saving the souls of children, Jizo
              has been believed to aid women wishing to conceive, and worshipped as a holy
              physician with the power to cure various illnesses. So, images of him are often
              decked in red to signify his protective healing powers and to invoke his powers
              to heal the loved ones of worshippers. At many temples, including the famous
              Zenko-ji in Nagano, a group of Six Jizos (Roku Jizo) carved from stone or cast
              in bronze and adorned with red bibs and caps offers protection to worshippers.
              The number in this group refers to his role as Master of the Six Buddhist
              Realms of Rebirth (namely the realms of humans, gods, animals, the warlike
              beings known as</span><em><span style='font-size: 12.5pt;  font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .95pt; '> ashuras</span></em><span style='font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .95pt; '>,
              hungry ghosts, and Hell) and his ability to penetrate all of these locations to
              relieve suffering. </span><span style='font-size: 15.5pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .95pt; '></span></p>

              because of his ability to cross from one Buddhist realm to another, Jizo has
              also long been associated with travel and regarded as a protector of travelers.
              This function of Jizo merged at some point in Japan with the native Shinto
              belief in gods of borders and transitions called <em>dosojin</em> (“road ancestor
              spirits”). Originally phallic stones symbolizing fertility, these <em>dosojin</em> were erected at the edge of a village or at a crossroads in Japan to protect
              against evil influences. Over time, many of these figures were replaced by
              figures of Jizo, sometimes solitary but often, again, in groups of six. Now,
              throughout the countryside and even in large cities, small Jizo figures can be
              seen lining Japan’s roads and pilgrimage routes as protectors of travelers and
              of anyone living close by.</span><span style='font-size: 15.5pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .95pt; '></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="color: #4b4b4b; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.5pt; letter-spacing: 0.95pt; line-height: 18pt;">Even today, many Japanese believe
              in Jizo’s powers, extending even beyond the protection of travelers, children,
              the sick, and lost souls in Hell. He is prayed to at hundreds of temples
              throughout the country to bring rain, to guarantee long life and good fortune,
              to help farmers and fishermen, and even to provide protection in battle.
              Although typically depicted as a young, bald-headed, sweet-faced priest, he is
              occasionally depicted surrounded by children, wearing armor, or even in female
              form, depending on the particular power he is believed to possess at a
              particular temple. Because of his lovable appearance and function as protector
              of children, it is not surprising that he is also often depicted as a cute,
              cartoon-like figure. There is no disrespect in these representations; rather,
              they demonstrate how beloved the deity Jizo is to the people of Japan.</span></p>
