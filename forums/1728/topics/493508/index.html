              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 16.0pt;">Walk Like a Buddha</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Carlos Estevez, SUMMER 2011
              tricycle</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify;">In
              the Lotus Sutra, the Buddha is described as the most respected and loved
              creature who walked on two feet. He was so loved because he knew how to enjoy a
              good walk. Walking is an important form of Buddhist meditation. It can be a
              very deep spiritual practice. But when the Buddha walked, he walked without
              effort. He just enjoyed walking. He didn’t have to strain, because when you
              walk practice ofin mindfulness, you are in touch with the all the wonders of
              life within you and around you. This is the best way to practice, with the
              appearance of nonpractice. You don’t make any effort, you don’t struggle, you
              just enjoy walking, but it’s very deep. “My practice,” the Buddha said, “is the
              nonpractice, the attainment of nonattainment.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">For
              many of us, the idea of practice without effort, of the relaxed pleasure of
              mindfulness, seems very difficult. That is because we don’t walk with our feet.
              Of course, physically our feet are doing the walking, but because our minds are
              elsewhere, we are not walking with our full body and our full consciousness. We
              see our minds and our bodies as two separate things. While our bodies are
              walking one way, our consciousness is tugging us in a different direction.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">For
              the Buddha, mind and the body are two aspects of the same thing. Walking is as
              simple as putting one foot in front of the other. But we often find it
              difficult or tedious. We drive a few blocks rather than walk in order to “save
              time.” When we understand the interconnectedness of our bodies and our minds,
              the simple act of walking like the Buddha can feel supremely easy and
              pleasurable.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">You
              can take a step and touch the earth in such a way that you establish yourself
              in the present moment; you will arrive in the here and the now. You don’t need
              to make any effort at all. Your foot touches the earth mindfully, and you
              arrive firmly in the here and the now. And suddenly you are free—free from all
              projects, all worries, all expectations. You are fully present, fully alive,
              and you are touching the earth.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">When
              you practice slow walking meditation alone, try this: Breathe in and take one
              step, and focus all your attention on the sole of your foot. If you have not
              arrived fully, one hundred percent in the here and the now, don’t make the next
              step. You have the luxury of doing this. Then when you’re sure that you’ve
              arrived one hundred percent in the here and the now, touching reality deeply,
              then you smile and you make the next step. When you walk like this, you print
              your stability, your solidity, your freedom, your joy on the ground. Your foot
              is like a seal. When you put the seal on a piece of paper, the seal makes an
              impression. Looking in your footstep, you see the mark of freedom, the mark of
              solidity, the mark of happiness, the mark of life. You can make a step like
              that because there is a buddha in you—buddhanature, the capacity of being aware
              of what is going on. There is a buddha in every one of us, and we should allow
              the buddha to walk.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Even
              in the most difficult situation, you can walk like a buddha. Last year I
              visited Korea, and there was one moment when my group was surrounded by
              hundreds of people. Each of them had a camera, and they were closing in. There
              was no path to walk, and everyone was aiming their camera at us. It was a very
              difficult situation in which to do walking meditation, so I said, “Dear Buddha,
              I give up, you walk for me.” And right away the Buddha came, and he walked,
              with complete freedom, and the crowd made room for the Buddha to walk; no
              effort was made. If you find yourself in some difficulty, step aside, and allow
              the Buddha to take your place. The Buddha is in you. This works in all
              situations, I have tried it. It’s like encountering a problem when you’re using
              the computer. You can’t get out of the situation. But then your big brother who
              is very skillful with computers comes along and says, “Move over a little, I’ll
              take over.” And as soon as he sits down, everything is all right. It’s like
              that. When you find it difficult, withdraw and allow the Buddha to take your
              place. You have to have faith in the Buddha within, and allow the Buddha to
              walk, and also allow the people dear to you to walk.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">When
              you walk, who do you walk for? You can walk to get somewhere but you can also
              walk as a kind of meditative offering. It’s nice to walk for your parents or
              for your grandparents who may not have known the practice of walking in
              mindfulness. You ancestors may have spent their whole life without the chance
              to make peaceful, happy steps and establish themselves fully in the present
              moment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It
              is possible for you to walk with the feet of your mother. You can say, “Mother,
              would you like to walk with me?” And then you walk with her, and your heart
              will fill with love. You free yourself and you free her at the same time,
              because your mother is in you, in every cell of your body. Your father is also
              fully present in every cell of your body. You can say, “Dad, would you like to
              join me?” Then suddenly you walk with the feet of your father. It’s a joy. It’s
              very rewarding. You don’t have to fight and struggle in order to do it. Just
              become aware.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">After
              you have been able to walk for your dear ones, you can walk for the people who
              have made your life miserable. You can walk for those who have attacked you,
              who have destroyed your home, your country, and your people. These people
              weren’t happy. They didn’t have enough love for themselves and for other
              people. They have made your life miserable, and the life of your family and
              your people miserable. And there will be a time when you’ll be able to walk for
              them too. Walking like that, you become a buddha, you become a bodhisattva
              filled with love, understanding, and compassion.085</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">WALKING
              MEDITATION PRACTICE</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              mind can go in a thousand directions. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">But
              on this beautiful path, I walk in peace. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">With
              each step, a gentle wind blows. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">With
              each step, a flower blooms. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">During
              walking meditation we walk slowly, in a relaxed way, keeping a light smile on
              our lips. When we practice this way, we feel deeply at ease, and our steps are
              those of the most secure person on Earth. Walking meditation is really to enjoy
              the walking—walking not in order to arrive, just for walking, to be in the
              present moment, and to enjoy each step. Therefore you have to shake off all
              worries and anxieties, not thinking of the future, not thinking of the past,
              just enjoying the present moment. Anyone can do it. It takes only a little
              time, a little mindfulness, and the wish to be happy.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">We
              walk all the time, but usually it is more like running. Our hurried steps print
              anxiety and sorrow on the Earth. If we can take one step in peace, we can take
              two, three, four, and then five steps for the peace and happiness of humankind.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Our
              mind darts from one thing to another, like a monkey swinging from branch to
              branch without stopping to rest. Thoughts have millions of pathways, and we are
              forever pulled along by them into the world of forgetfulness. If we can
              transform our walking path into a field for meditation, our feet will take
              every step in full awareness, our breathing will be in harmony with our steps,
              and our mind will naturally be at ease. Every step we take will reinforce our
              peace and joy and cause a stream of calm energy to flow through us. Then we can
              say, “With each step, a gentle wind blows.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">While
              walking, practice conscious breathing by counting steps. Notice each breath and
              the number of steps you take as you breathe in and as you breathe out. If you
              take three steps during an in-breath, say, silently, “One, two, three,” or “In,
              in, in,” one word with each step. As you breathe out, if you take three steps,
              say, “Out, out, out,” with each step. If you take three steps as you breathe in
              and four steps as you breathe out, you say, “In, in, in. Out, out, out, out,”
              or “One, two, three. One, two, three, four.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Don’t
              try to control your breathing. Allow your lungs as much time and air as they
              need, and simply notice how many steps you take as your lungs fill up and how
              many you take as they empty, mindful of both your breath and your steps. The
              key is mindfulness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">When
              you walk uphill or downhill, the number of steps per breath will change. Always
              follow the needs of your lungs. Do not try to control your breathing or your
              walking. Just observe them deeply.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">When
              you begin to practice, your exhalation may be longer than your inhalation. You
              might find that you take three steps during your in-breath and four steps on
              your out-breath. If this is comfortable for you, enjoy practicing this way.
              After you have been doing walking meditation for some time, your in-breath and
              out-breath will probably become equal: 3-3, or 2-2, or 4-4.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If
              you see something along the way that you want to touch with your
              mindfulness—the blue sky, the hills, a tree, or a bird—just stop, but while you
              do, continue breathing mindfully. You can keep the object of your contemplation
              alive by means of mindful breathing. If you don’t breathe consciously, sooner
              or later your thinking will settle back in, and the bird or the tree will
              disappear. Always stay with your breathing.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">After
              you have been practicing for a few days, try adding one more step to your
              exhalation. For example, if your normal breathing is 2-2, without walking any
              faster, lengthen your exhalation and practice 2-3 for four or five times. Then
              go back to 2-2. In normal breathing, we never expel all the air from our lungs.
              There is always some left. By adding another step to your exhalation, you will
              push out more of this stale air. Don’t overdo it. Four or five times are
              enough. More can make you tired. After breathing this way four or five times,
              let your breath return to norma1. Then, five or ten minutes later, you can
              repeat the process. Remember to add a step to the exhalation, not the inhalation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">After
              practicing for a few more days, your lungs might say to you, “If we could do
              3-3 instead of 2-3, that would be wonderful.” If the message is clear, try it,
              but even then, only do it four or five times. Then go back to 2-2. In five or
              ten minutes, begin 2-3, and then do 3-3 again. After several months, your lungs
              will be healthier and your blood will circulate better. Your way of breathing
              will have been transformed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">When
              we practice walking meditation, we arrive in each moment. When we enter the
              present moment deeply, our regrets and sorrows disappear, and we discover life
              with all its wonders. Breathing in, we say to ourselves, “I have arrived.”
              Breathing out, we say, “I am home.” When we do this, we overcome dispersion and
              dwell peacefully in the present moment, which is the only moment for us to be
              alive.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">You
              can also practice walking meditation using the lines of a poem. In Zen
              Buddhism, poetry and practice always go together.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">I
              have arrived.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I
              am home </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">in
              the here, </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">in
              the now. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I
              am solid. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I
              am free. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              the ultimate</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">I
              dwell.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">As
              you walk, be fully aware of your foot, the ground, and the connection between
              them, which is your conscious breathing. People say that walking on water is a
              miracle, but to me, walking peacefully on the Earth is the real miracle. The
              Earth is a miracle. Each step is a miracle. Taking steps on our beautiful
              planet can bring real happiness.</span></p>
