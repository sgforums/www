              <p class="MsoNormal"><em><span lang="EN-SG">For
                                      the last ten years of his life, Tim’s father had Alzheimer’s disease. Despite
                                      the devoted care of Tim’s mother, he had slowly deteriorated until he had
                                      become a sort of walking vegetable. He was unable to speak and was fed,
                                      clothed, and cared for as if he were a very young child... One Sunday, while
                                      [Tim’s mother] was out doing the shopping, [Tim and his brother], then fifteen
                                      and seventeen, watched football as their father sat nearby in a chair.
                                      Suddenly, he slumped forward and fell to the floor. Both sons realized
                                      immediately that something was terribly wrong. His color was gray and his
                                      breath uneven and rasping. Frightened, Tim’s older brother told him to call
                                      911. Before he could respond, a voice he had not heard in ten years, a voice he
                                      could barely remember, interrupted. “Don’t call 911, son. Tell your mother that
                                      I love her. Tell her that I am all right.” And Tim’s father died...</span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">As a physician and scientist, Tim was
                                      confronted with the mystery of consciousness beyond the brain, beyond the body.
                                      Western science is just beginning to open to questions about the nature and
                                      origin of consciousness, even though Western philosophers have been concerned
                                      with such questions for centuries. Recent scientific studies of near-death and
                                      out-of-body experiences, along with experiments in remote viewing, allow us to
                                      glimpse other dimensions of consciousness. But what are we to make of them?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">Buddhist psychology sends us directly into
                                      this mystery, to see for ourselves how consciousness works, independent of any
                                      object or content. It first describes consciousness as “that which knows,” that
                                      which experiences. To understand this, we can deliberately turn our attention
                                      to examine consciousness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">We can start very simply by looking in the
                                      mirror. When we do so we are often startled to notice that our body looks
                                      older, even though we don’t feel older. This is because the body exists in
                                      time, but the consciousness that perceives it is outside of time, never aging.
                                      We intuitively sense this. Instead of being caught up in spilled groceries, it’s
                                      as if we step back and see our experience with a timeless understanding.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">Ordinarily we take consciousness for
                                      granted, ignoring it as a fish ignores water. And os we focus endlessly on the
                                      contents of experience: what is happening in our body, feelings, and thoughts.
                                      Yet each time we move, listen, think, or perceive, consciousness receives all
                                      that occurs. Unless we grasp the nature and function of consciousness, it is
                                      impossible to live wisely.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">This is a third principle of Buddhist
                                      psychology:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em><span lang="EN-SG">3.
                                      When we shift attention from experience to the spacious consciousness that
                                      knows, wisdom arises.</span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">The capacity to be mindful, to observe
                                      without being caught in our experience, is both remarkable and liberating. “Mindfulness
                                      is all helpful,” taught the Buddha. As we shall see, the transforming power of mindfulness
                                      underlies all of Buddhist psychology. To those who seek self-understanding, the
                                      Buddha teaches, “With the mind, to observe the mind.” The central tool for
                                      investigating consciousness is our own observation. With mindfulness, we can
                                      direct our attention to notice what is going on inside us, and study how our
                                      mind and experience operate.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">What we ordinarily call the mind usually
                                      refers to the “thinking mind,” the ceaseless foundation of ideas, images,
                                      creativity, evaluation, and problem solving that spontaneously streams through
                                      our mind. But when we look closely, we discover that the mind is not just its thoughts,
                                      not just the ever-changing stream of ideas and images. It also includes a wide
                                      range of mind states or qualities around and below the thought process:
                                      feelings, moods, intuition, instincts. Even more important, though usually
                                      unnoticed, is the sheer fact of conscious awareness. This central capacity to
                                      be conscious is the essence of mind.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">Physicists since the time of Isaac Newton
                                      have studied the mysterious operation of gravity. They have described its laws
                                      and characteristics. Consciousness is like gravity, a central part of existence
                                      that can also be described, whose laws can be known, whose power, range, and
                                      function can be studied. But unfortunately, Western psychology has almost
                                      completely neglected the study of consciousness. Perhaps this is because the
                                      Western tradition has so emphasized pathology, or because there are no easy
                                      external ways to measure consciousness. In his later years, Francis crick, the
                                      Nobel Prize-winning co-discoverer of the DNA double helix, turned his attention
                                      to the central question of consciousness. Consciousness, he believed, is as
                                      central to understanding biological life as gravity is to physics, and he rued
                                      the way the scientific community had avoided this elephant in their midst: “For
                                      many years consciousness was taboo in American psychology... and even recently
                                      it has been ignored because it is too elusive to study.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">Western materialistic science describes
                                      consciousness and its contents as a product of the brain. Scientists can indeed
                                      show that when different parts of the brain are stimulated or damaged, they
                                      directly change the mood or content of our conscious experience. But these
                                      experiments give us only a partial picture. What of awareness itself? Is it
                                      merely an evolutionary “product” of the neurons of the brain? Or is our nervous
                                      system more like a television and DVD, the receiver and recorder of events but
                                      not the actual source of consciousness? Buddhist psychology posits that
                                      consciousness is the condition for life, and that the physical body interacts
                                      with consciousness but is not its source.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">If you sit quietly and try to turn your
                                      attention to your own consciousness, it is hard to pinpoint or describe. You
                                      will experience that there is awareness, but it doesn’t have a color or
                                      location. At first this can feel frustrating and difficult to grasp. But the
                                      very transparent, unfixed, yet alive quality of consciousness is its nature, a
                                      bit like air around us. If you relax and allow this experience of unfixed
                                      knowing, you will discover what Buddhist writers call the clear open sky of awareness.
                                      It is empty like space, but unlike space it is sentient; it knows experience.
                                      In its true state, consciousness is simply this knowing – clear, open, awake,
                                      without color or form, containing all things, yet not limited by them. This
                                      open quality of consciousness is described as unconditioned. As with the sky,
                                      all kinds of clouds and weather conditions can appear in its, but they have no
                                      effect on the sky itself. Storms may appear or disappear, but the sky remains
                                      open, limitless, unaffected by all that arises. Consciousness is unaffected by experience,
                                      just like the sky.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">Consciousness is also compared to a mirror.
                                      A mirror reflects all things, yet remains bright and shining, unchanged by whatever
                                      images, beautiful or terrible, may appear within it. A brief meditation can
                                      help you to understand. After you read the next three sentences, look up from
                                      the book. Sit quietly and try to <em>stop
                                      being aware.</em> Don’t be conscious of any sounds, any sights, any sensations,
                                      or any thoughts. Try it. Immediately you will discovery that you can’t do it.
                                      Sights, sounds, feelings, and thoughts continue to be known by consciousness. Sense
                                      how you cannot stop this conscious awareness. Notice how consciousness knows
                                      the whole variety of experiences without closing off to one in favour of
                                      another. This is the mirror-like nature of consciousness: reflective, luminous,
                                      untarnished, and peaceful.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">But the mirror and the open sky represent
                                      only one aspect of consciousness. Through Buddhist analysis, consciousness,
                                      like light, is found to have two dimensions. Just as light can be described as
                                      both a wave and a particle, consciousness has an unbound wave or sky-like
                                      nature and it has particular particle-like aspects. In its sky-like function, consciousness
                                      is unchanging, like the sky or the mirror. In its particle-like function,
                                      consciousness is momentary. A single state of consciousness arises together
                                      with each moment of experience and is flavoured by that experience. With
                                      precise mindfulness training, meditators can experience this particle-like
                                      nature of consciousness arising and passing away like bubbles or grains of
                                      sand.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">When the momentary aspect of consciousness
                                      receives an experience, it is colored by the experience, carried by it. In one
                                      Buddhist text, the particle-like quality of consciousness is described with 121
                                      different flavours or states. There are joyful states of consciousness, fearful
                                      states, expanded and contracted ones, regretful states and loving ones. These states
                                      come with stories, feelings, perceptions, with beliefs and intentions. Zen
                                      master Thich Nhat Hanh describes it this way: “The mind is like a television
                                      set with hundreds of channels. Which channel will you turn on?” Usually we are
                                      so focused on the dramatic story being told that we don’t notice that there is
                                      always consciousness that receives it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">Through mindfulness, we can learn to
                                      acknowledge which channel is playing. We can learn to change the channels, the
                                      stories and states, by recognizing that all states are simply appearances in
                                      consciousness. Most importantly, we can begin to understand the underlying
                                      nature of consciousness itself.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">While studying Buddhism in college, I tried
                                      a little meditation on my own. But I was unsuccessful because I didn’t know
                                      what I was doing. It wasn’t that I was afraid of silence or of some terrible
                                      darkness that I would find inside, though these are common misunderstandings of
                                      meditation. It was that my body would get uncomfortable and my mind would spin
                                      out in a million directions. When I heard Ajahn Chah’s teaching, the practice became
                                      gradually clearer. He taught me to relax and feel my breath carefully, which
                                      helped focus and quiet my mind. Then he taught me just to mindfully notice the
                                      stream of thoughts and sensations without reacting to them as a problem. This
                                      took some practice.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">Finally he taught the most important
                                      lesson, to rest in consciousness itself. As his own teacher Ajahn Mun explains,
                                      “We can notice the distinction between consciousness and all the transient
                                      states and experiences that arise and pass away within it. When we do not
                                      understand this point, we take each of the passing states to be real. But when
                                      changing conditions such as happiness and unhappiness are seen for what they
                                      are, we find the way to peace. If we can rest in the knowing, the pure consciousness,
                                      there’s not much more to do.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">Does resting in consciousness mean we are
                                      simply checking out of the world or withdrawing into navel gazing? Not at all.
                                      Resting in the knowing is not the same as detachment. When I look back at my
                                      own life I can see my own struggles to discover this truth. Because of the
                                      conflict and unpredictable violence in my family, there were many times I
                                      wanted to run away but couldn’t. To cope with the trauma, at times I became
                                      depressed, angry, or cynical. But as a primary protection, I developed the
                                      capacity to detach myself from what was happening. Detachment came naturally to
                                      me. I used it to become peaceful within myself and to try to calm those around
                                      me. Of course, these patterns persist, and I do it for a living.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">So when I first tried to meditate, I
                                      confused it with my familiar strategy of detachment. Gradually I discovered how
                                      wrong I was. My detachment had been a withdrawal from the pain and conflict
                                      into a protective shell. It was more like indifference. In Buddhist psychology
                                      indifference is called the “near enemy” of true openness and equanimity, a
                                      misguided imitation. To rest in consciousness, I had to unlearn this defensive
                                      detachment and learn to feel everything. I had to allow myself to recognize and
                                      experience the feelings and thoughts, the conflicts, the unpredictability of
                                      life in order to learn that I could trust the openness of consciousness itself.
                                      To rest in consciousness we become unafraid of the changing conditions of life.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">In the monastery Ajahn Chah would often
                                      notice when we were caught up in a state of worry, anger, doubt, or sorrow. He
                                      would smile with amusement and urge us to inquire, “Who is doubting? Who is
                                      angry? Can you rest in the consciousness that is aware of these states?”
                                      Sometimes he would instruct us to sit at the side of a person who was dying, to
                                      be particularly aware of the mysterious moment when consciousness leaves and a
                                      person full of life turns into a lifeless corpse. Sometimes he would say, “If
                                      you are lost in the forest, that is not really being lost. You are really lost
                                      if you forget who you are.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">This knowing or pure consciousness is
                                      called by many names, all of which points to our timeless essence. Ajahn Chah
                                      and the forest monks of Thailand speak of it as the “Original Mind” or the “One
                                      Who Knows.”In Tibetan Buddhism it is referred to as <em>rigpa,</em> silent and intelligent. In Zen it is called the “mind ground”
                                      or “mind essence”. Hindu yogis speak of the “timeless witness”. While these
                                      teachings may sound abstract, they are quite practical. To understand them we
                                      can simply notice the two distinct dimensions to our life: the ever-changing
                                      flow of experiences, and that which knows the experiences.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">Perhaps we can better understand this
                                      through a story of a Palestinian named Salam, one of my good friends. I met
                                      Salam when I was doing some teaching for the hospices of the Bay Area. He was
                                      able to sit with the dying because he had no fear of death. In the late 1960s
                                      and 1970s Salam had lived in Jerusalem as an activist and a journalist. Because
                                      he was writing about creating a Palestinian capital in East Jerusalem and the
                                      establishment of a Palestinian state, he was regularly arrested. He spent
                                      nearly six years in Israeli prisons. He was frequently interrogated and
                                      periodically beaten and tortured. This happens on every side in war.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">One afternoon after he had been badly
                                      beaten, his body was lying on the floor of the prison and he was being kicked
                                      by a particularly cruel guard. Blood poured out of his mouth, and as the police
                                      report later stated, the authorities believed he had died.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">He remembers the pain of being beaten.
                                      Then, as if often reported by accident and torture victims, he felt his consciousness
                                      leave his body and float up to the ceiling. At first it was peaceful and still,
                                      like in a silent movie, as he watched his own body lying below being kicked. It
                                      was so peaceful he didn’t know what all the fuss was about. And when Salam
                                      described how, in a remarkable way, his consciousness expanded further. He knew
                                      it was his body lying below, but now he felt he was also the boot kicking the
                                      body. He was also the peeling green paint on the prison walls, the goat whose
                                      bleat could be heard outside, the dirt under the guard’s fingernails – he was
                                      life, all of it and the eternal consciousness of it all, with no separation.
                                      Being everything, he could never die. All his fears vanished. He realized that
                                      death was an illusion. A well-being and joy beyond description opened in him.
                                      And then a spontaneous compassion arose for the astonishing folly of humans, believing
                                      we are separate, clinging to nations and making war.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">Two days later, as Salam describes it, he
                                      came back to consciousness in a bruise and beaten body on the floor of a cell,
                                      without fear or remorse, just amazement. His experience changed his whole sense
                                      of life and death. He refused to continue to participate in any form of
                                      conflict. When he was released, he married a Jewish woman and had
                                      Palestinian-Jewish children. That, he said, was his answer to the misguided
                                      madness of the world.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">“Who are we, really?” the Zen koans demand.
                                      “Who is dragging this body around?” or “What was your original face before your
                                      parents were born?” These questions force us to look directly at the consciousness
                                      that inhabits our body. Ajahn Chah asked us to “be the Knowing.” Tibetan
                                      teachers instruct their students to direct their gaze inside to see who or what
                                      is doing the looking. Ajahn Jumnian, a Thai forest master, tells his students
                                      to witness all experience as if from the “Third eye” in the center of the
                                      forehead. In each of these practices we turn toward and rest in consciousness itself. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">It is as if we were in a movie theatre,
                                      completely lost in whatever film – romance, adventure, comedy ,or tragedy – is
                                      currently starring ourselves. Then we are told to look behind us, to find the
                                      source. Turning our heads, we recognize for the first time that the entire
                                      drama arises from a series of changing images projected by a beam of light onto
                                      the screen. The light, clear and shining, is colored by the various forms on
                                      the film, yet its essential nature is pure and unchanging.</span></p>

                                      the show gets a bit slow, even boring. We might shift in our seats, notice the
                                      people eating popcorn around us, remember we’re in a movie. In the same way we
                                      can notice that there are gaps between our thoughts, gaps in the whole sense of
                                      our self. Instead of being lost in ideas and the problems in front of us,
                                      creating the whole drama of ourself, there are moments when we sense the space
                                      around our experience, let go, and relax. “These gaps,” says the meditation
                                      master Chogyam Trungpa, “are extremely good news.” They remind us that we can
                                      always rest in awareness, that freedom is always possible.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">We do not require special meditative
                                      circumstances or a near death experience like Salam’s to return to awareness. A
                                      boy in school suddenly notices a sunbeam illuminating the dust and he is no
                                      longer the earnest fifth grader struggling with math. He smiles as he senses
                                      the ever-present mystery and his whole building and schoolboy drama are held in
                                      a silent, free awareness. A woman walking down the street thinks of a distant
                                      friend and for a moment forgets her errands, feeling eternity and her own small
                                      life passing through it. In an argument we stop, laugh, let go, and become
                                      silent. Each of these moments offers a taste of freedom.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">As we have seen, when we first turn to
                                      investigate who is being aware, we may feel confused, like a fish looking for
                                      water. We discover that there’s nothing solid, no one who is perceiving. This
                                      is a wonderful discovery. Awareness has no shape or color. It is beyond
                                      presence or absence, coming or going. Instead there is only a clear space of
                                      knowing, of consciousness, which is empty and yet cognizant at the same time. As
                                      you hold this book, consciousness is reading the words and reflecting about the
                                      nature of consciousness. Turn and ask who is reading. Your first answer may be “I
                                      can’t sense anything there, it’s just empty.” Stay with this knowing, this
                                      empty openness. Learn to trust it. It is consciousness without limitation,
                                      reflecting all that appears, yet untouched y it all. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">As you work with this inquiry regularly,
                                      you can gradually develop the capacity to distinguish between the events and
                                      experiences of life and the consciousness that is knowing. You learn to rest in
                                      the knowing, unperturbed, to settle back in the midst of any circumstance, even
                                      those that are difficult or confusing.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">This resting, settling, is quite different
                                      from the sort of pathological detachment that I learned as a child. Out of
                                      fear, I split my experience, protecting myself through the subtle distance of
                                      my role as witness. When we truly rest in awareness, our experience is spacious
                                      and intimate, without defences. With it arises compassion; we feel our heart’s
                                      natural connection with life.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">One meditation practitioner, Maria, works
                                      as a nurse in the emergency room of al local hospital. She describes how she
                                      has learned to use the art of resting in awareness: “Sometimes it’s not too
                                      busy and I can work on automatic, heck on a patient or do the paperwork while
                                      my mind drifts off to think about a million other things. Then we might get a
                                      whole crowd of incoming patients: accidents, heart attacks, asthma emergencies.
                                      I do my part, but I’m also tuned in to the whole of what’s going on. I’ve
                                      learned to open the awareness. It’s as if my mind gets spacious and still,
                                      present, sensitive to what is needed and yet kind of detached at the same time.
                                      I guess it’s like the flow state that athletes talk about. I’m in the middle,
                                      doing all the right things, yet some part of me is just watching it all,
                                      silent.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">“It happens more these days, not just at
                                      work. When I do my meditation practice it gets stronger. I had a big fight with
                                      my son and in the middle of it I could feel my body tightening, how right I
                                      thought my view was. Just feeling that, I relaxed and shift to the space of
                                      awareness, and things opened up. I was saying no, but I could also feel all the
                                      love underneath and how these were just our roles and we had to play them well
                                      and behind it, it was all spacious, all OK.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">When we learn to rest in awareness, there’s
                                      both caring and silence. There is listening for what’s the next thing to do and
                                      awareness of all that’s happening, a big space and a connected feeling of love.
                                      When there is enough space, our whole being can both apprehend the situation
                                      and be at ease. We can see the dance of life, we dance beautifully, yet we’re not
                                      caught in it. In any situation, we can open up, relax, and return to the
                                      sky-like nature of consciousness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG">Practice:
                                      The River of Sound</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">Sit comfortably and at ease. Close your
                                      eyes. Let your body be at rest and your breathing be natural. Begin to listen
                                      to the play of sounds around you. Notice those that are loud or soft, far and
                                      near. Notice how sounds arise and vanish on their own, leaving no trace. After
                                      you have listened for a few minutes, let yourself sense, feel or imagine that
                                      your mind is not limited to your head. Sense that your mind is expanding to be
                                      open like the sky – clear, vast like space. Feel that your mind extends outward
                                      beyond the most distant sounds. Imagine there are no boundaries to your mind,
                                      no inside or outside. Let the awareness of your mind extend in every direction
                                      like the open sky.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">Relax in this openness and just listen. Now
                                      every sound you hear – people, cars, wind, soft sounds – will arise and pass
                                      away like a cloud in the open space of your own mind. Let the sounds come and
                                      go, whether loud or soft, far or near, let them be clouds in the vast sky of your
                                      own awareness, appearing and disappearing without resistance. As you rest in
                                      this open awareness for a time, notice how thoughts and feelings also arise and
                                      vanish alike sounds in the open space of mind. Let the thoughts and feelings
                                      come and go without struggle or resistance. Pleasant and unpleasant thoughts,
                                      pictures, words, joys, and sorrows – let them all come and go like clouds in
                                      the clear sky of mind.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">Then, in this spacious awareness also
                                      notice how you experience the body. The mind is not in the body . the body
                                      sensations float and change in the open sky of mind. The breath breathes
                                      itself; it moves like a breeze. If you observe carefully, the body is not
                                      solid. It reveals itself as areas of hardness and softness, pressure and tingling,
                                      warm and cool sensation, all floating in the space of awareness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">Relax. Rest in this openness. Let
                                      sensations float and change. Allow thoughts and images, feelings and sounds to
                                      come and go like clouds in the clear, open space of awareness. As you do, pay
                                      attention to the consciousness itself. Notice how the open space of awareness
                                      is clear, transparent, timeless, and without conflict – allowing for all things
                                      but not limited by them .This is your own true nature. Rest in it. Trust it. It
