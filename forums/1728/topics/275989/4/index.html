            <div class='col-md body'>With the complete death of the notion of the separate self, the separate individual... there is just everything arising spontaneously, <span style="font-style: italic;">to no one</span>. It is a complete DEATH... after which life is lifeless... as what Steven Norquist said:<br><br><strong>You see, with enlightenment comes the knowledge that even though there is much activity in the world, there are no doers. The universe is in a sense, lifeless. There is no one, only happenings and the experience of happenings. Enlightenment reveals that the universe emerges spontaneously.</strong><br><br>With such insights, whatever happens, happens to no one... how can self-centered suffering arise? There is simply arising, thoughts, physical pain, or any sensations, but to no one. Self-arisen, self-liberated, simultaneously.. As Jeff Foster said, "This is breathing, this is the heart beating, this is an entire world arising out of nothing and falling back into nothing, ceaselessly, playfully, like waves in the ocean, like icy breath on a winterÂ’s day, like the memory of a loved one, long since departed."<br><br>Here's a great article:<br><br><a href="http://www.lifewithoutacentre.com/10.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lifewithoutacentre.com/10.html</a><br><br><strong>What is Nonduality?  - Reflections on the utterly obvious....<br>by Jeff Foster</strong><br><br>This is the end of all hope, because it is the end of a future, and what is the future but a hope?<br><br>And with the end of hope comes the death of the <span style="font-style: italic;">one who hopes</span>. But this death is not something a person could ever bring about, for what is the attempt to bring this about but the Hope of all Hopes?<br><br>And so, the end of all hope is death, death of the individual, death of the one who hopes. And death looks like this:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Breathing, the heart beating, sounds in the room, sensations in the body.....</span><br><br>In fact, death looks a lot like life, except now there is nobody there living that life, just life itself playing out spontaneously, of its own accord, in its own time. This is a life lived by nobody, and yet there are still faces, places, feelings, ups and downs. Although now the ups are <span style="font-style: italic;">equal</span> to the downs, pain is <span style="font-style: italic;">equal</span> to pleasure, the most excruciating suffering is <span style="font-style: italic;">equal</span> to the greatest joy. Because with the death of the person comes the death of all opposites, all opposition, all duality, which is to say that everything now exists in perfect balance (as it always has done).  And yet, there is nobody to know that balance, nobody who could name it, nobody who could even speak of it even if they wanted to.<br><br><img src="http://www.lifewithoutacentre.com/images/ger.jpg"><br><br>And of course, what is being written here cannot capture it at all. How to use dualistic concepts to describe that which is beyond duality? And anyway, isnÂ’t Â“beyond dualityÂ” just another concept, perhaps the biggest concept of them all?<br><br>Perhaps. But no matter. What is being said here has nothing to do with words. Once we get lost in words and concepts and meanings weÂ’ve missed the point entirely. Because this message is about what is presently happening Â– present sights, sounds and smells. ItÂ’s about the utterly obvious present appearance of life, an appearance which appears to nobody, an appearance which dances and swirls and pretends to be solid but actually has no solidity at all, an appearance which cannot be grasped in any way (and the attempt to grasp it would only lead to sufferingÂ…)<br><br>ItÂ’s an appearance which cannot be escaped, cannot be denied, cannot be transcended, because the person who would try and do any of these things in the first place does not even exist. He is an apparition, a ghost, a mirage, a thought. And what power does thought have?<br><br>And so this is the end of choice, the end of control.<br><br>This is the absolute freedom which cannot be reached through any sort of effort or non-effort.<br><br>This is the end of duality because it is the wide open space, the vastness in which duality appears to arise in the first place.<br><br>This is totally extraordinary, and yet it is nothing special.<br><br>This is the miracle of all miracles, and yet it is as simple as breathing.<br><br>This is death, and yet it is also the source of all life.<br><br>This is not something a mind could ever hope to grasp. This is not a concept to be understood, not a new belief to be believed.<br><br>This is breathing, this is the heart beating, this is an entire world arising out of nothing and falling back into nothing, ceaselessly, playfully, like waves in the ocean, like icy breath on a winterÂ’s day, like the memory of a loved one, long since departed.<br><br>This is not a state to be reached; it is not something that some people have and others donÂ’t.<br><br>This is just a description of the utterly obvious.<br><br>ItÂ’s so simple a newborn baby could see it: <strong>life already has no centre.</strong></div>
