It all depends on each individual karma. There are also those who have very good karma, and life after life he is reborn in heaven... for a very very long time (though of course that is impermanent and maybe one day he/she still might be reborn back in human realm). I remember Buddha did described a few types of people's 'rebirth patterns' and this is one of them.<br><br><blockquote>if it is true, then in order to let her stay up we have to keep doing merits for her?</blockquote>If you continue dedicating merits, it will certainly help.<br><br><blockquote>if it is not true.. then do u think it is possible for me to know whr she is? maybe via meditation or anything?</blockquote>I do not have such powers, for this you have to find some masters who have such powers.</div>

Never shall I attain the level of my spiritual Master. Juggled between hope and doubt, our mind is never at peace.<br><br>According to our mood, one day we will practice intensely, and the next day, not at all. We are attached to the agreeable experiences, which emerge from the state of mental calm, and we wish to abandon meditation when we fail to slow down the flow of thoughts. That is not the right way to practice.<br><br>Whatever the state of our thoughts may be we must apply ourselves steadfastly to regular practice, day after day; observing the movement of our thoughts and tracing them back to their source. We should not count on being immediately capable of maintaining the flow of our concentration day and night.<br><br>When we begin to meditate on the nature of mind, it is preferable to make short sessions of meditation, several times per day. With perseverance, we will progressively realize the nature of our mind, and that realization will become more stable. At this stage, thoughts will have lost their power to disturb<br>and subdue us.<br><br>Emptiness, the ultimate nature of Dharmakaya, the Absolute Body, is not a simple nothingness. It possesses intrinsically the faculty of knowing all phenomena. This faculty is the luminous or cognitive aspect of the Dharmakaya, whose expression is spontaneous. The Dharmakaya is not the product of causes and conditions; it is the original nature of mind.<br><br>Recognition of this primordial nature resembles the rising of the sun of wisdom in the night of ignorance: the darkness is instantly dispelled. The clarity of the Dharmakaya does not wax and wane, like the moon; it is like the immutable light which shines at the center of the sun.<br><br>Whenever clouds gather, the nature of the sky is not corrupted, and when they disperse, it is not ameliorated. The sky does not become less or more vast. It does not change. It is the same with the nature of mind: it is not spoiled by the arrival of thoughts; nor improved by their disappearance. The nature of the mind is emptiness; its expression is clarity. These two aspects are essentially one's simple images designed to indicate the diverse modalities of the mind. It would be useless to attach oneself in turn to the notion of emptiness, and then to that of Ã‡ clarity, Ãˆ as if they were independent entities. The ultimate nature<br>of mind is beyond all concepts, all definition and all fragmentation.<br><br>"I could walk on the clouds," says a child. But if he reached the clouds, he would find nowhere to place his foot. Likewise, if one does not examine thoughts, they present a solid appearance; but if one examines them, there is nothing there. That is what is called being at the same time empty and apparent. Emptiness of mind is not nothingness, nor a state of torpor, for it possesses by its very nature a luminous faculty of knowledge, which is called Awareness. These two aspects, emptiness and Awareness, cannot be separated. They are essentially one, like the surface of the mirror and the image, which is reflected in it.<br><br>Thoughts manifest themselves within emptiness and are reabsorbed into it like a face appears and disappears in a mirror; the face has never been in the mirror, and when it ceases to be reflected in it, it has not really ceased to exist. The mirror itself has never changed. So, before departing on the spiritual path, we remain in the so-called "impure" state of samsÃ¡ra, which is, in appearance, governed by ignorance. When we commit ourselves to that path, we cross a state where ignorance and wisdom are mixed. At the end, at the moment of Enlightenment, only pure wisdom exists. But all the way along this spiritual journey, although there is an appearance of transformation, the nature of the mind has never changed: it was not corrupted on entry onto the path, and it was not improved at the time of realization.<br><br>The infinite and inexpressible qualities of primordial wisdom "the true nirvana" are inherent in our mind. It is not necessary to create them, to fabricate something new. Spiritual realization only serves to reveal them through purification, which is the path. Finally, if one considers them from an ultimate point of view, these qualities are themselves only emptiness.<br><br>Thus samsÃ¡ra is emptiness, nirvana is emptiness - and so consequently, one is not "bad" nor the other "good." The person who has realized the nature of mind is freed from the impulsion to reject samsÃ¡ra and obtain nirvana. He is like a young child, who contemplates the world with an innocent simplicity, without concepts of beauty or ugliness, good or evil. He is no longer the prey of conflicting tendencies, the source of desires or aversions.<br><br>It serves no purpose to worry about the disruptions of daily life, like another child, who rejoices on building a sand castle, and cries when it collapses. See how puerile beings rush into difficulties, like a butterfly, which plunges into the flame of a lamp, so as to appropriate what they covet, and get rid of what they hate. It is better to put down the burden, which all these imaginary attachments bring to bear down upon one.<br><br>The state of Buddha contains in itself five "bodies" or aspects of Buddhahood: the Manifested Body, the Body of Perfect Enjoyment, the Absolute Body, the Essential Body and the Immutable Diamond Body. These are not to be sought outside us: they are inseparable from our being, from our mind. As soon as we have recognized this presence, there is an end to confusion. We have no further need to seek Enlightenment outside. The navigator, who lands on an island made entirely of fine gold, will not find a single nugget, no matter how hard he searches. We must understand that all the qualities of Buddha have always existed inherently in our being.</div>

This is not true, as the true nature of reality is Emptiness, without increase nor decrease, because all things are empty of inherent existence -- no fixed 'Entity' can be found.<br><br>In reality there is NO 'Self' as a fixed entity! But a process! And each moment, each conditioned arising is a Reality, is an expression of our True Nature, an expression of the luminosity of our true nature.<br><br>As Thusness wrote:<br><br>Life (Self) is nothing other than the continuous flow of the Now Moment.<br>The Now Moment ceases as it arises. This moment must completely ceased<br>and serves as the CAUSE for the next moment to arise.<br>Therefore Self is a process of series Self1, Self2, Self3, Self4, Self5, Self6...etc<br>A fixed entity 'Self' does not exist, what really exists is a momentary Self.<br>Under deep meditation, one is able to observe and sense the karmic and mental factors from moment to moment,<br>it is these factors that are succeeded from moment to moment and life and life but not a fixed entity.<br>When the karmic and mental factors subsides, it is known as "The True and Only (and Inherently egoless) Conscious Light (Itself)".<br><br>---------------<br><br>And so, there is no fixed self, no 'true nature of a person' as in there is a fixed self.<br><br>Only <strong>SPONTANEOUS EXPRESSIONS of our luminosity, AS the conditioned arising of that moment</strong>. That is the 'true nature' -- luminous-emptiness. Appearances that are dream-like and empty.</div>

Only when we become enlightened that our true nature becomes completely apparent, because there is insight. We might also use the analogy of the sun to describe something like our mental afflictions/defilements obscuring the brightness/luminosity of the sun, though all these are spoken relatively and <strong>NOT</strong> to be taken as ultimate truth.<br><br>HOWEVER, in ultimate reality, our true nature is ALWAYS here, just as the sun is always shining. Luminosity is NEVER lost, it is our true nature all the while.<br><br>Whether there is character changes, whatever, the true nature of reality is still Luminous-Emptiness. And every moment of arising IS the Spontaneous Expression of our true nature, whatever his mental conditioning or physical conditioning or whatever conditioning -- every conditioning <strong>is the spontaneous expression of our True Nature at that very moment</strong>.<br><br>And also please read thoroughly my previous post about No Fixed Self -- there is <strong>NO fixed Self, only momentary, Spontaneous expressions of our true nature that is conditioned arising. And therefore if there is ONLY spontaneous expression that are Self-Arisen and Self-Liberated simultaneously, and there is NO Fixed Self to be found, whatever changes that occurs is merely 'Change' -- NOT a 'Changing Thing', and therefore NO movement can be found.</strong><br><br>Like I wrote in the other topic, <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=277038" rel="nofollow">Do you believe in Reincarnation ?</a>:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>There is no fixed entity 'Self' at all -- there is no self to be found, apart from Self1, Self2, Self3, Self4, Self5, etc, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">arising in a spontaneous and disconnected way.</span> There is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no movement in changes -- movement implies that Self exists in a connected way</span>. No. No such Self can be found -- all things including your Self is empty of inherent existence.</strong></span></div>
