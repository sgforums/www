In between the 49 days, if he has not been reborn yet, and he is still feeling attached to his family or things like that, he might come back and visit. But it has nothing to do with which days. If he comes back, he comes back due to his attachment. It is best that you tell the deceased to leave peacefully, and that all is fine so that he can let go of his attachments.<br><br>And what do you mean by 'escorted back'? Back to where?</div>

That is why some people keep seeing visions of the deceased... in that case one should dedicate merits to him in hope he be reborn in higher or human realms quickly.<br><br>So it is not that only particular days that the deceased may come back. If he is attached, he can stay very long.<br><br>Some people however are reborn very quickly, or even reborn immediately after death upon ripening of various wholesome or unwholesome karma.<br><br>So each individual's case of rebirth is different, though we can safely say that a person should be reborn within 49 days (unless due to strong attachments, etc).<br><br>The best however, is that you practise the Dharma, and at the time of death your consciousness immediately 'merges' or rather, recognises the Clear Light of your own true nature/Buddha nature and abides there. Such a person thereby attains liberation from the 6 realms and attains nirvana, and may return to samsara again not due to ripening of karma, but rather due to the vows of the Bodhisattva, much like Guan Yin Pu Sa returns to samsara to lead sentient beings to Enlightenment. So practise the Buddhadharma, until you are able to transcend the cycles of samsara and the influences of your karma. It is truly possible.<br><br>Regarding this...

(Chung-ying-shen: It is an intermediate existence between death and rebirth to the next life. When ordinary people die, they are not immediately reborn. Between death and their next birth, there is a short period of one to 49 days, during which the soul is of a dank gaseous form. It is invisible to the ordinary people at large, and is a mind-consciousness without a physical body.) There is a 49-day period for rebirth. Although it is stated to be 49 days, it is not necessary that rebirth takes place only on the 49th day. A person who has great virtuous roots and has performed great virtuous deeds ascends immediately to the heavens as soon as he dies. If he had been a great sinner in his lifetime, he immediately descends to hell. During the 49-day period, the conditions for rebirth are not predetermined for the average person who neither was virtuous nor evil in his lifetime. Such a person will search for the condition for his rebirth within the 49 days. The 49-day period is divided into terms of 7 days. If the condition for rebirth arises during any of these 7-day terms, he can be reborn. Which realm is he reborn to? That is determined by his conduct during his lifetime. If all seven 7-day terms expire but he still finds no condition for rebirth, then he naturally enters into the realm of ghosts.<br><br><strong>2) During this 49-day period, how can we help the deceased to be reborn in a virtuous realm?</strong><br><br>After human beings die, they have a Zhong Yin Shen. This is the soul. Upon death, doers of great virtuous deeds, ascend immediately to heaven, while doers of great evil deeds, descend immediately to hell. But average people who have neither been virtuous nor evil will go in search of conditions for rebirth during the 49-day period.<br><br>You can seek the help of a cultivated monk (or nun) to perform merits for such a person to lessen his negative karma so as to help him to be reborn to a virtuous realm. In this way, no matter which realm he is reborn in, his negative karma will be reduced. If you perform merits on his behalf, he will be able to receive the effects even if he should descend into hell. And performing merits for him would add to his heavenly blessings if he should ascend into heaven.<br><br>(continued in the URL)</div>

And best to chant as much as possible. <blockquote><br>If according to tibetan buddhism, shouldn't anyhow touch their body when they just pass away.</blockquote> Yes and according to mahayana as well <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Therefore, rather than wanting her to stay around, you should practise chanting and wish for her to be reborn in pure land or the higher realms.<br><br><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol8no4c.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol8no4c.htm</a><br><br><strong>5. When a person dies, why do we chant "Amitabha Buddha"?</strong><br><br>When a person passes away, at the instant of his death he experiences extreme suffering. Chanting "Amitabha Buddha" provides him with a spiritual reliance, thus relieving some of his suffering. Helping him chant in this way reinforces his faith and his wishes to be reborn in the Western Pure Land. Thus, chanting at his moment of death is very important and helpful for the dying person.</div>
