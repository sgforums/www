As long as you are did not do evil deeds in your lives, and doesn't break the 5 precepts (no killing, no stealing, no lying, no sexual misconduct, no intoxicants) its likely you will be reborn in the human realm or the other higher realms. So I think your mom should be reborn in one of the higher realms. Nevertheless continue dedicating merits to her as it will continue to be beneficial, as stated in the article I pasted previously.. and continue chanting and hope she will seek birth at Amitabha's Pure Land (which is even higher than heaven, and is beyond the six realms of samsara).<br><br>As for enlightenment... if one has cultivated the dharma in our everyday lives it is possible to attain liberation from all realms of rebirth altogether and return to our original state which is the clear light of our Buddha Nature... but we must practise hard.. unless we practise, it is generally almost impossible to attain nirvana at the time of death.. to attain liberation at death, we must be liberated and awakened in our living first.<br><br><blockquote>will be going over to thailand soon to donate medication/ coffin to the temple in her name.. as for diet wise i m sticking to more vegetable but not 100% vegetarian as i tried and get hungry very fast. i can understand the term fa hui.. but wad is <strong>pujas</strong>?</blockquote>Puja = fa hui</div>
