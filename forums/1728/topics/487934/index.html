              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; color: #444444;">Tricycle</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; color: #444444;"> Kevin Griffin March 20, 2015 </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><em><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">Metta</span></em><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  "> (lovingkindness) is that sense
              of openness when we feel connected to everyone and everything in the world. In
              some ways, it's a natural outgrowth of mindfulness practice and just the
              general cultivation of happiness in our lives. When the Buddha talks about
              lovingkindness, he's clearly pointing to something different from what we
              usually call "love." In fact, his teachings point to the problems
              with selective love, and how that leads to clinging and ultimately suffering as
              things change. The <em>Metta Sutta</em> tells us to spread love over the entire
              world to everyone, no matter what we think or feel about them. This is
              unconditional love, love that doesn't expect or need a return, love that sees
              past the petty differences and disputes in life to the universal longings for
              happiness that we all share. In practicing lovingkindness, we are faced with
              our clinging, our judgments, and our selective caring. We see that what we
              usually call love may have a lot of conditions tied up with it: "I'll love
              you as long as you love me" or " as long as you give me what I
              want." And, further, we see that the love we have for our dear ones makes
              us vulnerable to grief and loss. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">Traditionally, metta practice focuses on three categories: those we
              love, those we are neutral or have no strong feelings about, and those we have
              difficulties with. Before we work with these categories, the practice suggests
              we first focus on a benefactor or beloved person (or even a pet). When we spend
              time sending lovingkindness to this beloved, we accomplish a couple of things:
              first, we soften ourselves up a bit, so that we are ready to send love to
              others; and second, we get a clear sense of what love feels like so that we
              establish that kind of baseline.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">After connecting with the beloved, we then try to send love to
              ourselves. Many people find this to be one of the most difficult aspects of the
              metta practice. At least in our culture, many of us have complicated, and often
              negative, feelings about ourselves. To see ourselves as just another person
              deserving love is a valuable exercise. Here we start to disidentify with
              ourselves, see ourselves in more objective terms. When we can see ourselves as
              just another imperfect human, equally deserving of love as anyone else, it
              becomes easier to offer love to ourselves.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">Moving from focus on ourselves to focus on all the rest of the people we
              care about—family, friends, intimates, and partner—the heart tends to open more
              easily. Now we might feel ourselves getting into the flow of lovingkindness.
              Without obstruction, and using the phrases, feelings, and visualizations of the
              practice, the mind can become quite focused and concentrated, so that, not only
              do we enjoy the pleasant feeling of love, but also the powerful feeling of
              concentration, called <em>samadhi</em>, that comes with deeper meditation
              practices.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">We then try to carry these two qualities, the openheartedness and the
              focus, into giving metta to a neutral person or persons. For many people, this
              seems to be an awkward practice at first, but I think it has great potential in
              terms of growing a broad sense of lovingkindness for all beings. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">A neutral person is someone we don't have strong feelings about, either
              positive or negative. I've used people like the clerk in the video store and
              the security guard at the bank. These are people I can visualize pretty easily
              because I've seen them many times, but I certainly don't like or dislike them
              in any meaningful way. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">At first, and naturally enough, it might be hard to feel much about
              these people, but the practice gives us a form we can simply follow without
              worrying about the results. You see the person in your mind, you say the
              lovingkindness phrases to yourself, and you try to connect in your heart. What
              helps me in doing this practice is contemplating the universal desire for
              happiness and freedom from suffering. Even though I don't really know this
              neutral person, I know that, just like me, they want happiness. So, in a sense,
              I'm connecting with my own wish for happiness and just projecting it onto them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">As we work with the neutral person, we have the opportunity to see what
              the Buddha was getting at. It might be easy to wish happiness for your loved
              ones, but as you wish that, it's still very personal for you. You have some
              investment in their happiness, so it's difficult to disidentify with their
              happiness. However, with the neutral person, you have no investment, so you
              have to connect with something else, this universal longing that is impersonal.
              That moves you away from your self-identification into a more authentic metta.
              As long as there is identification or longing or investment in someone else's
              happiness, we aren't experiencing unconditional love. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">I think that many people can get caught up in the idea that metta is
              about feeling good and praying for people you care about. This is something of
              a distortion of the teachings. Yes, being immersed in metta is a pleasant
              experience, but that experience isn't the goal of the practice. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">Working with the difficult person makes this fact clear. If we were just
              trying to feel good, we certainly wouldn't spend time thinking about someone we
              don't like. The difficult person can be someone you've had conflict with or
              toward whom you have a resentment. Sometimes when no one in my life comes up, I
              just use a political figure that I disagree with. In any case, this is a place
              where we have to apply a strong mindfulness to our practice so that we don't
              lapse into aversion, anger, judgment, or resentment. As we follow through on
              the practice, visualizing the person and saying the phrases, it's very likely
              that we will not feel much that's positive, at least in our initial efforts. We
              need to be careful that the mind doesn't wander into negative thoughts and that
              we just keep with the simple task of the practice, staying with the words and
              the breath in the heart. Here, you may be able to get some insight into the
              limits of your own capacity for love. That's a valuable thing to see. It can
              give us some goals as well as show us where some of our own suffering comes
              from.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">Clearly, the great spiritual masters believe that the capacity to love
              our enemies is one of the vital tasks of human evolution. Jesus spoke of this
              and exemplified it when he forgave those who crucified him; the Buddha explains
              this in the "Simile of the Saw," in which he says that even if
              someone were sawing off our limbs one by one, no thought of hatred should
              arise. If we want to be truly loving people, unconditionally and for all
              beings, we have to work with some form of this practice. It's certainly not
              something that I've come anywhere close to mastering, but I have found that
              with compassion practice, I can get some sense of this. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">After working with the difficult person, we can move to the expansive
              part of metta practice. This is actually a complete shift because no longer are
              we thinking about any individuals, but working instead with a sense of space.
              This space is what the Buddha is talking about in the <em>Metta Sutta</em> when
              he says that we are "radiating kindness over the entire world, spreading
              [it] upwards to the skies and downwards to the depths, outwards and unbounded,
              free from hatred and ill will." </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">This is a somewhat more difficult area of practice to describe because
              it doesn't have the same cognitive elements of the earlier pieces. Instead, we
              are working more with a feeling, a feeling of expansiveness and connection.
              Hopefully when we arrive at this part of the practice, we've developed
              something of an internal sense of lovingkindness. While focusing on that
              feeling, that authentic wish for all beings to be free from <em>dukkha</em>, or
              suffering, we being a process of imaginative expansion. We can use a
              visualization if that works, while we stay connected to the feeling in the
              heart and imagine that the love is growing.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">First we see/feel that love filling and enveloping the room we are in.
              Then we let that feeling expand out through the whole building, the
              neighborhood, outward in all directions until it touches everything on earth.
              This can be done slowly or quickly, depending upon how much time you have and
              how into it you are. You can think of specific groups of people you want to
              send love to: the sick and dying, the oppressed, or whatever comes up for you.
              You can also send love to animals, plants, and the earth itself. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">At this point, you may lose the sense of boundaries with your body, and
              experience a sort of floating or fluid sensation. I'm not trying to tell you
              how you should feel—just know that anything in this realm is normal and helps
              to support this part of the practice. When we've spread lovingkindness over the
              entire planet, we then expand into space, vast and limitless. We try to
              permeate the universe with lovingkindness. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">Once we've sat in this place of boundless love for a little while, we
              can bring ourselves gradually back into the body and heart, and close the
              period of meditation.<br> <br> <strong>Practice—Metta Phrases</strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">I've more or less outlined the practice above. Always start by
              connecting with the breath, so you have some attention in your body, preferably
              at the heart. As I've said, we first send metta to a beloved person or
              benefactor, then ourselves, our dear ones, a netural person, a difficult
              person, then radiating to all beings. A big part of this, then, is the felt
              sense of lovingkindness; however, this feeling may be stronger, weaker, or even
              absent at times. Nonetheless, we continue the practice by visualizing the
              people we are sending metta to, maybe naming them, and repeating phrases. You
              should use phrases that resonate for you and are simple and direct. Not more
              than four phrases. Here are some typical ones:</span></p>

Looking and listening deeply, surveying our territory, is <br><br>the beginning of love meditation.<br>Looking Deeply Into the Body<br><br>We begin by asking, How is my body in this moment? How was it in the past? How will it be <br><br>in the future? Later, when we meditate on someone we like, someone neutral to us, someone <br><br>we love and someone we hate, we also begin by looking at her physical aspects. Breathing <br><br>in and out, we visualize her face; her way of walking, sitting and talking; her heart, <br><br>lungs kidneys and all the organs in her body, taking as much time as we need to bring <br><br>these details into awareness. But we always start with ourselves. When we see our own <br><br>five skandhas clearly, understanding and love arise naturally, and we know what to do and <br><br>what not to do to take better care of ourselves.<br><br>We look into our body to see whether it is at peace or suffering from illness. We look at <br><br>the condition of our lungs, our heart our intestines, our kidneys, our liver, to see what <br><br>the real needs of our body are. When we do, we will eat, drink and act in ways that <br><br>demonstrate our love and our compassion for our body. Usually we just follow ingrained <br><br>habits. But when we look deeply, we see that many of these habits harm our body and mind, <br><br>so we work to transform these habits into ways conducive to good health and vitality.<br>Looking Deeply into Feelings<br><br>Next we observe our feelings whether they are pleasant, unpleasant or neutral. Feelings <br><br>flow in us like a river, and each feeling is a drop in that river. We look into the river <br><br>of our feelings and see how each feeling came to be. We see what has been preventing us <br><br>from being happy, and we do our best to prevent those things. We practice the wondrous, <br><br>refreshing and healing elements that are within us and in the world. Doing so, we become <br><br>stronger and better able to love ourselves and others.<br>Looking Deeply into Perceptions—Are You Sure?<br><br>Then we meditate on our perceptions. The Buddha observed, The person who suffers most in <br><br>this world is the person with many wrong perceptions…. And most of our perceptions are <br><br>erroneous. We see a snake in the dark and we panic, but when our friend shines a light on <br><br>it, we see that it is only a rope. We have to know which wrong perceptions cause us to <br><br>suffer. Please calligraph the sentence, “Are you sure?” on a piece of paper and tape it <br><br>to your wall. Love meditation helps us to learn to look with clarity and serenity in <br><br>order to improve the way we perceive.<br>Looking Deeply into Mental Formations<br><br>Next we observe our mental formations, the ideas and tendencies within us that lead us to <br><br>speak and act as we do. We practice looking deeply to discover the true nature of our <br><br>mental formations how we are influenced by our individual consciousness and also by the <br><br>collective consciousness of our family, ancestors and society. Unwholesome mental <br><br>formations cause so much disturbance; wholesome mental formations bring about love, <br><br>happiness and liberation.<br>Looking Deeply Into Consciousness<br><br>Finally we look at our consciousness. According to Buddhism, consciousness is like a <br><br>field with every possible seed in it seeds of love, compassion, joy and equanimity; seeds <br><br>of anger, fear, and anxiety; and seeds of mindfulness. Consciousness is the storehouse <br><br>that contains all these seeds, all possibilities that might arise in our mind. When our <br><br>mind is not at peace, it may be because of the desires and feelings in our store <br><br>consciousness. To live in peace we have to be aware of our tendencies our habit energies <br><br>so we can exercise some self-control.<br><br>This is the practice of preventative health care. We look deeply into the nature of our <br><br>feelings to find their roots, to see which feelings need to be transformed, and we <br><br>nourish those feelings that bring about peace joy and well-being.</p></div>
