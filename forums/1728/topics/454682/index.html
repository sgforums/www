              <p>Hi all -</p>
              <p>Some concepts in Buddhism are so so so difficult to understand eg No-self and Emptiness.  Is it possible to end one's suffering simply by following the 5 precepts and eightfold path without actually understanding these concepts?</p>
              <p>In this aspect, theistic religions are much "easier to follow" as one simply needs to believe and one would be "saved":)</p>
              <p>Kindly advise or comment.  Thank you.</p>

              Start with suffering or unsatisfactoriness with self, what is self, why we are unhappy, why our clinging to the relating everything to the notion of self causes unsatisfactoriness?!
              The notion of I, me,  mind, soul as a permanent entity and suffering arising from that!
              Breakdown the components that we define self, the you will get no self?

              <p>here's one sutta to boost your confidence <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Sarakaani Sutta: Sarakaani (Who Took to Drink)</p>
              <p>[<em>At Kapilavasthu</em>] Now at that time Sarakaani the Sakyan, who had died, was proclaimed by the Blessed One to be a Stream-Winner, not subject to rebirth in states of woe, assured of enlightenment. At this, a number of the Sakyans, whenever they met each other or came together in company, were indignant and angry, and said scornfully: "A fine thing, a marvelous thing! Nowadays anyone can become a Stream-Winner, if the Blessed One has proclaimed Sarakaani who died to be Stream-Winner... assured of enlightenment! Why, Sarakaani failed in his training and took to drink!"</p>
              <p>[<em>Mahaanaama the Sakyan reported this to the Buddha who said</em>:] "Mahaanaama, a lay-follower who has for a long time taken refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha — how could he go to states of woe? [<em>And this can be truly said of Sarakaani the Sakyan.</em>] How could he go to states of woe?</p>

              <p>"Take the case of another man. He is not even endowed with unwavering devotion to the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha. He is not joyous and swift in wisdom and has not gained release. But perhaps he has these things: the faculty of faith, of energy, of mindfulness, of concentration, of wisdom. And the things proclaimed by the Tathaagata are moderately approved by him with insight. That man does not go to the realm of hungry ghosts, to the downfall, to the evil way, to states of woe.</p>

              <p>In my opinion, dont ponder too much in the teaching of emptiness if you find it too difficult to understand. As emptiness teaching is not meant for student that not ready.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The teaching of emptiness is due to the kindness of the teacher, they teach, planting the seed for the understanding for us now or maybe for our future life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>start from the basis and slowly work your way up... eventually you will understand emptiness, might not in this life but in one of the life.. hahaha</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>even just practising kidness is a fantastic start..</p>

              <p>It is not too difficult to understand no self and emptiness but it is not easy to realise it. Just observe ourselves and things around us, you will notice that nothing exists without the combination of components. Thus, nothing actually exists by itself, we are just the combination of components. Any one of the main organs fail to function or lack of food or air etc. is enough to kill a person.</p>
              <p>A seed will not grow into anything without sunlight, water and air. We are unable to control our body from aging and sickness. This just got to show that this body is not ours.</p>
              <p>Anyway, there are many dharma doors. I chose the easiest to understand which is Pureland.</p>
              <p>I understand that all Buddhists must learn and realise about "no self" and "emptiness" . Either you learn and realise them in samsara (if you have the ability) or you learn them in Pureland. It is a must subject for all Buddhists, learn them now or later.</p>
              <p>"No self" or "emptiness" is the ultimate truth. Believe and you will be saved is nice but to me, it's not the ultimate truth.</p>

              <p>good explanation Dawn...indeed Truth has many doors...the moment one enters, there is another swung open..leading to another seemingly interconnected door..illusions are indeed naughty perceptions...</p>

              <p>Hi all -</p>
              <p>Some concepts in Buddhism are so so so difficult to understand
              eg No-self and Emptiness.  Is it possible to end one's
              suffering simply by following the 5 precepts and eightfold path
              without actually understanding these concepts?</p>
              <p>In this aspect, theistic religions are much "easier to follow"
              as one simply needs to believe and one would be "saved":)</p>
              <p>Kindly advise or comment.  Thank you.</p>

              <p>Hi, i feel you must have the patience to explore.  There is no way that our deeply embedded wrong views and habitual tendencies will suddenly disappear.  We have to work with the momentum.  For eg. a train that is travelling fast, in order to go in the opposite direction, has to first slow down its momentum, come to a stop, then accelerate in the other direction.  Similarly, we are working with the momentum of our habits now, so it takes time to dissolve our conceptual frameworks and see things as they are.</p>
              <p>Non-self and emptiness is the condition of things as they are.  It is not beyond us, not somewhere else. It is the true characteristic of our everyday experience and therefore it is definitely possible to discover our true condition.  </p>
              <p>Over-eagerness, too much hope and fear, and also lack of patience can be a huge obstacle to discovering our true condition.  It is better to be consistent, have a regular sitting practice, read helpful books and articles etc.  </p>
              <p>Try not to rely on an intellectual way to try to figure out the meaning of emptiness etc although it is helpful at certain times. It is more important to trust your direct experience.  Especially during your meditation.  Investigation in meditation actually means using your direct non-conceptual experience to investigate, not in an intellectual way.</p>
              <p>This is my opinion only</p>

              <p>Patience is something I lack, especially when faced with the knowledge that I am living with deeply ingrained wrong views, ignorance and delusion every single day.  Moreover, the thought of having to go through another X number of lifetimes before being liberated is scary!  Hence, this not-getting-anywhere makes me want to search for the answer in other directions sometimes.</p>
              <p>I suppose everything has its time and place.  I should stick with the investigation and not have any expectations.</p>
