              <p>Q: By 
              what means can the gateway of our school be entered?</p>
              <p>A: By means of the dana paran-iita.</p>
              <p>Q: According to the Buddha, the Bodhisattva path com-prises six paramitas. 
              Why, then, have you mentioned only the one? Please explain why this one alone 
              provides a sufficient means for us to enter.</p>
              <p>A: Deluded people fail to understand that the other five all proceed from the 
              dana paramita and that by its practice all the others are fulfilled.</p>
              <p>Q: Why is it called the dana paramita?</p>
              <p>A: ‘Dana’ means ‘relinquishment’.</p>
              <p>Q: Relinquishment of what?</p>
              <p>A: Relinquishment of the dualism of opposites.</p>
              <p>Q: Which means?</p>
              <p>A: It means total relinquishment of ideas as to the dual nature of good and 
              bad, being and nonbeing, love and aversion, void and nonvoid, concentration and 
              distraction, pure and impure. By giving all of them up, we attain to a state in 
              which all opposites are seen as void. The real practice of the dana paramita 
              entails achieving this state without any thought of ‘now I see that opposites 
              are void’, or’now I have relinquished all of them’. We may also call it ‘the 
              simultaneous cutting off of the myriad types of con-current causes’; for it is 
              when these are cut off that the whole Dharma-nature becomes void; and this 
              voidness of the Dharma-nature means the nondwelling of the mind upon anything 
              whatsoever. Once that state is achieved, not a single form can be discerned. 
              Why? Because our self-nature is immaterial and does not contain a single thing 
              (foreign to itself). That which contains no single thing is true reality, the 
              marvelous form of the Tathagata-it is said in the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090213063910/http://hjem.get2net.dk/civet-cat/zen-writings/diamond-sutra.htm">Diamond 
              Sutra</a>: ‘Those who relinquish all forms are called "Buddhas" (enlightened 
              ones).’ Q: However, the Buddha did speak of six paramitas, so why do you now say 
              they can all be fulfilled in that one? Please give your reason for this.</p>
              <p>A: The Sutra of the Questions of Brabma says: ‘Jala-vidya, the elder, spoke 
              unto Brahma and said, Bodhi sattvas by relinquishing all defilement’s (klesha) 
              may be said to have fulfilled the dana paramita, also known as ‘total 
              relinquishment’; being beguiled by nothing, they may be said to have fulfilled 
              the sila paramita, also known as ,observing the precepts’; being hurt by 
              nothing, they may be said to have fulfilled the kshanti paramita, also known as 
              ‘exercising forbearance’; clinging to nothing, they may be said to have 
              fulfilled the virya paramita, also known as ‘exercising zeal’; dwelling on 
              nothing, they may be said to have fulfilled the dhyana paramita, also known as 
              ‘prac-tising dhyana and samadhi’; speaking lightly of nothing, they may be said 
              to have fulfilled the praina paramita, also known as ‘exercising wisdom’. 
              Together, they are named’the six methods’."’ Now I am going to speak about those 
              six methods in a way which means precisely the same - the first entails 
              relinquishment; the second, no arising (of perception, sensation, etc); the 
              third, no thinking; the fourth, remaining apart from forms; the fifth, 
              non-abiding (of the mind); and the sixth, no indulgence in light speech. We give 
              different names to these six methods only for convenience in dealing with 
              passing needs; for, when we come to the marvellous principle involved in them 
              all, we find no differences at all. So you have only to understand that, by a 
              single act of relinquishment, everything is relinquished; and that no arising 
              means no arising of anything whatsoever. Those who have lost their way have no 
              intuitive understanding of this; that is why they speak of the methods as though 
              they differed from one another. Fools bogged down in a multiplicity of methods 
              revolve endlessly from life span to life span. I exhort you students to practise 
              the way of relinquishment and nothing else, for it brings to perfection not only 
              the other five paramitas, but also myriads of dharmas (methods).</p>
              <p>II. Q: What are the ‘three methods of training (to be performed) at the same 
              level’ and what is meant by per-forming them on the same level?</p>
              <p>A: They are discipline (vinaya), concentration (dhyana) and wisdom 
              (prajna)."</p>
              <p>Q: Please explain them one by one.</p>
              <p>A: Discipline involves stainless purity. Concentration involves the stilling 
              of your minds so that you remain wholly unmoved by surrounding phenomena. Wisdom 
              means that your stillness of mind is not disturbed by your giving any thought to 
              that stillness, that your purity is unmarred by your entertaining any thought of 
              purity and that, in the midst of all such pairs of opposites as good and evil, 
              you are able to distinguish between them without being stained by them and, in 
              this way, to reach the state of being perfectly at ease and free of all 
              dependence. Furthermore, if you realize that discipline, concentration and 
              wisdom are all alike in that their substance is intangible and that, hcnce, they 
              are undivided and therefore one - that is what is meant by three methods of 
              training performed at the same level.</p>
              <p>12. Q: When the mind rests in a state of purity, will that not give rise to 
              some attachment to purity?</p>
              <p>A: If, on reaching the state of purity, you refrain from thinking ‘now my 
              mind is resting in purity’, there will be no such attachment.</p>
              <p>Q: When the mind rests in a state of void, will that not entail some 
              attachment to void?</p>
              <p>A: if you think of your mind as resting in a state of void, then there will 
              be such an attachment.</p>
              <p>Q: When the mind reaches this state of not dwelling upon anything, and 
              continues in that state, will there not be some attachment to its not dwelling 
              upon anything? A: So long as your mind is fixed solely on void, there is nothing 
              to which you can attach yourself. if you want to understand the nondwelling mind 
              very clearly, while you are actually sitting in meditation, you must be 
              cognizant only of the mind and not permit yourself to make judge-ments - that 
              is, you must avoid evaluations in terms of good, evil, or anything else. 
              Whatever is past is past, so do not sit in judgment upon it; for, when minding 
              about the past ceases of itself, it can be said that there is no longer any 
              past. Whatever is in the future is not here yet, so do not direct your hopes and 
              longings towards it; for, when n-iinding about the future ceases of itself, it 
              can be said that there is no future. 18 Whatever is present is now at hand; just 
              be conscious of your nonattachment to every-thing - nonattachment in the sense 
              of not allowing any love or aversion for anything to enter your mind; for, when 
              miinding the present ceases of itself, we may say that there is no present. When 
              there is no clinging to any of those three periods, they may be said not to 
              exist. Should your mind wander away, do not follow it, whereupon your wandering 
              mind will stop wandering of its own accord. Should your mind desire to linger 
              somewhere, do not follow it and do not dwell there, whereupon your mind’s 
              questing for a dwelling place will cease of its own accord. Thereby, you will 
              come to possess a nondwelling mind - a mind which remains in the state of 
              nondwelling. If you are fully aware in yourself of a nondwelling mind, you will 
              discover that there is just the fact of dwelling, with nothing to dwell upon or 
              not to dwell upon. This full awareness in yourself of a mind dwelling upon 
              nothing is known as having a clear perception of your own mind, or, in other 
              words, as having a clear perception of your own nature. A mind which dwells upon 
              nothing is the Buddha-mind, the mind of one already delivered, bodhi-mind, 
              uncreate mind; it is also called ‘realization that the nature of all appearances 
              is unreal’. It is this which the sutras call ‘patient realization of the 
              uncreate’.19 If you have not realized it yet, you must strive and strive, you 
              must increase your exertions. Then, when your efforts are crowned with success, 
              you will have attained to understanding from within yourself - an understanding 
              stemming from a mind that abides nowhere, by which we mean a mind free from 
              delusion and reality alike. A mind disturbed by love and aversion is deluded; a 
              mind free from both of them is real; and a mind thus freed reaches the state in 
              which opposites are seen as void, whereby freedom and deliverance are 
              obtained.</p>
              <p>13. Q: Are we to make this effort only when we are sitting in meditation, or 
              also when we are walking about? A: When I spoke just now of making an effort, I 
              did not mean only when you are sitting in meditation; for, whether you are 
              walking, standing, sitting, lying, or what-ever you are doing, you must 
              uninterruptedly exert your-selves all the time. This is what we call ‘constantly 
              abiding’ (in that state).</p>
