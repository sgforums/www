              <p>the temple doesnt have monks. only Master (Shifu)</p>
              <p>They chant sutras and teach abt buddhism. But Im skeptical about the involuntary hand movements during the xue fa. </p>
              <p>Or is it some other form of buddhism? They have give out flowers for "cleansing" baths too.</p>

              <p>Everyone can say they 'teach Buddhism', but what exactly do they teach? How long have your family been frequenting the temple, how did they know about it? What is the Master's lineage? i.e. Who is the master's master? What tradition do they follow?</p>
              <p>From your first description, I am very doubtful about their teachings. Many who emphasize on supernatural powers are in fact cults at worst, non-Buddhist teachings at best. But again I am not so sure about the emphasis of their teachings.</p>

              <p>His family heard abt the temple from words of mouth. One of their relatives attended it some time back.</p>
              <p>He didnt ask about the Master's lineage or background. During each session, they will chant sutras and mantras first, followed by "xue fa" (the meditation with the involuntary hand movements)</p>
              <p>They have a big urn outside the temple for Tee Gong and Four Faced Buddha. Inside the temple, there's Shakyamuni, Ji Gong, Medicine Buddha, GuanYin, Laughing Buddha, a small idol of Kwan Yu and also the Monkey God.</p>

              <p>Hi </p>
              <p>My husband and his family has been regularly attending this
              temple in Geylang. It is a Buddhist temple and they practice
              "meditation" which they call pinyin xue2 fa3. I suppose its
              meditation since Im not sure how to rightly translate xue fa into
              english.</p>
              <p>The thing is, during this meditation, their hands will move
              subconsciously. The shifu does not teach them how to meditate, he
              said that all students will have a personal Buddha teacher, coming
              down from "heaven" to teach them.</p>
              <p>They also have mantra water and stuff like that. </p>
              <p>My question is, is it an orthodox kind of meditation? They
              believe this "fa" has powers to create an invisible "shield" to
              protect them from evil. And also, if you learn long enough, you are
              able to heal others.</p>
              <p>Anyone heard of this?</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>This is a Chi practice, with one exception, when the mind is singularly focused, the  chi flows all over, and initially , one is not aware of one,s movement, rather like spiritual kung fu or "shen ta". The movement are rhythmical and circular in motion. Usually upon practice, the body develop "wei chi" which is like and energy aura protecting the against the weather. This has a very Taoist element in theory and explanation.</p>
              <p>Comment on the Sifu's lineage is important as suggested by the moderator, also whether is this a preliminary practice, which eventually leads to more indepth  Buddhist principles and practice proper, is also important!</p>
              <p>Without  these two considerations in mind, one cannot place judgement! </p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The thing is, are these typical Buddhist rituals, folk religion or a mixture of both?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Another important thing to note is that the Master will "communicate" with the Buddha to answer disciples' questions. Something like what a medium does.</p>

              <p>There is always something learn, and it also depends on whether one comes across the specific knowledge. Anyway, if they have something which you can learn from them, gain from it!</p>
              <p>For you information, the Buddha did perform miracles, but he never wanted to convert anyone due to his miracles. that's why the miracles !he performed are very low key!</p>

              <p>Sounds very like Taoist in practice, essentially practice immortalityhood or"chen hsien" .</p>
              <p>But this branch does'nt practice mediumship, the "shenist school" or folk religon does that! if one sees the "black command banner or flag", it practices mediumship. It uses the flag to summons spirits! </p>

              <p>Oh so is Yi Kuan Dao is it?</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.buddhismaustralia.org/cults.htm">http://www.buddhismaustralia.org/cults.htm</a></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff6633; font-size: large;">I Kuan Tao (Tian Tao) - Yi Guan Dao</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;">The followers of I Kuan Tao claimed that it 
                is a distinguished lineage back over 2000 years when it begins from the ancient 
                Chinese astrolgers, emperors, Confucius, and so forth. From 18th Ancient Patriarch 
                Mencius, the lineage travels to the west, the lineage began from Shakyamuni 
                Buddha, Mahakashyapa to 28th Indian Patriarch Bodhidharma. But the modern practice 
                of Tian Tao, as we know it today, was established about 70 years ago. In the 
                1930, Shi Zueng Zhang Tian Ran and Shi Mu Sun Hui Ming, became the 18th Patriarch 
                and started theirpractice I Kuan Tao in Chi Nan City, Shang Dong Province of 
                China. Their work spread by word of mouth, andby 1946 I Kuan Tao became prevalent 
                among 36 provinces of China. At the end of the Civil War in 1949, many followers 
                in China found their beliefs incompatible with Communist doctrines. This and 
                other reasons compelled large numbers of them to emigrate to Taiwan, Hong Kong, 
                Korea,Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines. Tian Tao quickly 
                took root in these new lands, spreading with its teachings Chinese culture and 
                traditional family values. By increasing the number of I Kuan Tao temples, they 
                believed that they are bringing the Buddhist "Western Paradise" to 
                earth and creating a world of brotherhood and universal love as envisioned by 
                Confucian <br> teachings.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><img src="http://www.buddhismaustralia.org/shizueng.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="190"></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;">Presently, they claimed that the founder, 17th 
                Patriarch Lu Zhong Yi, was an incarnation of Maitreya. He has major influence 
                and impact on the present form of I Kuan Tao. The central teaching of Tian Tao, 
                is based on the initiation ceremony - a new formula on the Triple Gem, namely: </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;">1. Opening of Heavenly Eye (Dian Xuan Dao), </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;">2. Oral Transmission of the Maitreya prayer 
                (Chuan Ko Jue), <br> and </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;">3. Hand Gestures (Jie He Tong). </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;">They believe that the recipient has obtained 
                the Tao and that his name has been reserved in the heaven and erased from the 
                lists in hell. Upon death, the recipient will ascend straight to heaven without 
                having to endure the cycles of rebirth. <br> Graeme Lyall (Australia), 1999, wrote:<br> <strong><em>"</em></strong><em>The group is known 
                as Ee Kwang Tao (Yi Guan Dao). I was invited to attend the opening of one of their 'Holy Houses'. 
                It was one of the strangest rituals that I have ever witnessed. Following the 
                ritual we were invited to go before the 'Master' to receive initiation. I declined 
                on the grounds that I had been invited to attend the opening but not to join 
                anything. After a while they approached me again and they said that the 'Master' 
                was waiting for me and I MUST go before the 'Master'. I replied that I <strong>must</strong> not do anything of the sort as I am atraditional Buddhist and had no wish to 
                join their organisation. I thanked them for their hospitality and said that 
                I was leaving. As each person arrived they took their name. As I left they asked 
                me for my name as they said that the names were being sent to heaven and, as 
                I refused initiation, my name would have to be struck off the list. I consulted 
                a Chinese friend about my experience and he<br> immediately identified it as the Ee Kwang Tao cult which, as was said, is proliferating 
                in Australia. The initiates are sworn to secrecy with the threat of harm to 
                themselves and their family if the secrets are revealed. This dangerous cult 
                bears no relation to Buddhism so beware of them</em>.<em>"</em></span></p>
