              <p>thank you all for all the information. this is really a very informative forum regarding buddhism. it certainly helped clear some doubts.</p>
              <p>my husband asked one of the Seniors there regarding the xuefa. He said it was a Buddha name Yi Wan Guang Fo who taught the Master (hence the temple's name)</p>
              <p>The senior clarified that the temple is no making any money out of the donations, hence its not possible that shifu is running the temple out of greed.The senior also told my husband to ask himself, whether the temple is doing him more harm then good. He said the more my husband try to search for an answer, the more frustrated he will be. Because in religion, there is never a right answer that is a confirmed answer.</p>
              <p>To summarize, its to think simple and follow your heart. </p>
              <p>Im sorry if it sounds confusing because im directly translating what the senior told my husband. hehe</p>

              <p>people are misled by these cults or new age sects professing to teach the Buddha's teaching. if you know your stuff well, you wont be misled isnt it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>just like if you have knowledge on investments, you wont be misled by the RM or wealth managers trying to invests in a fund that guarantee you 20% per annum. think about it, is that possible to achieve 20% per annum. thats when you start questioning the RM/WM on the strategies on achieving the returns.</p>

              <p>no wonder a lot of people are hoodwinked and misled. first they are ignorant of what Buddhism is about. misconception/myths about Buddhism doesnt help either.</p>

              <p>no wonder fake monks and cults can easily attract followers and then exploit and cheat/swindle them of their money and most importantly the malfeasance of spirituality.</p>

              <p>Example:</p>
              <p><strong><br> Further, as the person uses his mind to intently investigate inside 
              and outside, 
                his physical and spiritual souls, intellect, will, essence, and spirit
               will 
                be able to interact with one another without affecting his body. They 
              will take 
                turns as host and guests. Then he may suddenly hear the Dharma being 
              spoken 
                in space, or perhaps he will hear esoteric truths being pronounced 
              simultaneously 
                throughout the ten directions. This state is called "the essence and 
              souls 
                alternately separating and uniting, and the planting of good seeds." 
              It 
                is a temporary state and does not indicate sagehood. If he does not 
              think he 
                has become a sage, then this will be a good state. But if he considers
               himself 
                a sage, then he will be vulnerable to the demons' influence.</strong></p>
              <p><strong> Further, when the person's mind becomes clear, unveiled, bright, and 
              penetrating, 
                an internal light will shine forth and turn everything in the ten 
              directions 
                into the color of Jambu-river gold. All the various species of beings 
              will be 
                transformed into Tathagatas. Suddenly he will see Vairochana Buddha 
              seated upon 
                a platform of celestial light, surrounded by a thousand Buddhas, who 
              simultaneously 
                appear upon lotus blossoms in a hundred million lands. This state is 
              called 
                "the mind and soul being instilled with spiritual awareness." When 
                he has investigated to the point of clarity, the light of his mind 
              will shine 
                upon all worlds. This is a temporary state and does not indicate 
              sagehood. If 
                he does not think he has become a sage, then this will be a good 
              state. But 
                if he considers himself a sage, then he will be vulnerable to the 
              demons' influence.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Further, as the person uses his mind to intently investigate that 
              wondrous light, 
                he will contemplate without pause, restraining and subduing his mind 
              so that 
                it does not go to extremes. Suddenly the space in the ten directions 
              may take 
                on the colors of the seven precious things or the colors of a hundred 
              precious 
                things, which simultaneously pervade everywhere without hindering one 
              another. 
                The blues, yellows, reds, and whites will each be clearly apparent. 
              This state 
                is called "excessively subduing the mind." It is a temporary state 
                and does not indicate sagehood. If he does not think he has become a 
              sage, then 
                this will be a good state. But if he considers himself a sage, then he
               will 
                be vulnerable to the demons' influence.</strong></p>
              <p><strong><br> Further, as the person uses his mind to investigate with clear 
              discernment until 
                the pure light no longer disperses, he will suddenly be able to see 
              various 
                things appear in a dark room at night, just as if it were daytime, 
              while the 
                objects that were already in the room do not disappear. This state is 
              called 
                "refining the mind and purifying the vision until one is able to see 
              in 
                the dark." It is a temporary state and does not indicate sagehood. If 
              he 
                does not think he has become a sage, then this will be a good state. 
              But if 
                he considers himself a sage, then he will be vulnerable to the demons'
               influence.</strong></p>
              <p><strong><br> Further, when his mind completely merges with emptiness, his four 
              limbs will 
                suddenly become like grass or wood, devoid of sensation even when 
              burned by 
                fire or cut with a knife. The burning of fire will not make his limbs 
              hot, and 
                even when his flesh is cut, it will be like wood being whittled. This 
              state 
                is called "the merging of external states and the blending of the four
               
                elements into a uniform substance." It is a temporary state and does 
              not 
                indicate sagehood. If he does not think he has become a sage, then 
              this will 
                be a good state. But if he considers himself a sage, then he will be 
              vulnerable 
                to the demon's influence.</strong></p>
              <p><strong><br> Further, when his mind accomplishes such purity that his skill in 
              purifying 
                the mind has reached its ultimate, he will suddenly see the earth, the
               mountains, 
                and the rivers in the ten directions turn into Buddhalands replete 
              with the 
                seven precious things, their light shining everywhere. He will also 
              see Buddhas, 
                Tathagatas, as many as the sands of the Ganges, filling all of space. 
              He will 
                also see pavilions and palaces that are resplendent and beautiful. He 
              will see 
                the hells below and the celestial palaces above, all without 
              obstruction. This 
                state is called "the gradual transformation of concentrated thoughts 
              of 
                fondness and loathing." It does not indicate sagehood. If he does not 
              think 
                he has become a sage, then this will be a good state. But if he 
              considers himself 
                a sage, then he will be vulnerable to the demons' influence.</strong></p>
              <p><strong><br> Further, as the person uses his mind to investigate what is profound 
              and far 
                away, he will suddenly be able to see distant places in the middle of 
              the night. 
                He will see city markets and community wells, streets and alleys, and 
              relatives 
                and friends, and he may hear their conversations. This state is called
               "having 
                been suppressed to the utmost, the mind flies out and sees much that 
              had been 
                blocked from view." It does not indicate sagehood. If he does not 
              think 
                he has become a sage, then this will be a good state. But if he 
              considers himself 
                a sage, then he will be vulnerable to the demons' influence.</strong></p>
              <p><strong><br> Further, as the person uses his mind to investigate to the utmost 
              point, he 
                may see a Good and Wise Advisor whose body undergoes changes. Within a
               brief 
                interval, various transformations will occur which cannot be 
              explained. This 
                state is called "having an improper mind which is possessed by a 
              Li-ghost, 
                a Mei-ghost, or a celestial demon, and without reason speaking Dharma 
              that fathoms 
                wondrous truths." It does not indicate sagehood. If he does not think 
              he 
                has become a sage, then the demonic formations will subside. But if he
               considers 
                himself a sage, then he will be vulnerable to the demons' influence.<br> Ananda, these ten states may occur in Dhyana as one's mental effort 
              interacts 
                with the form Skandha.</strong></p>
              <p><strong><br> Dull and confused living beings do not evaluate themselves. 
              Encountering such 
                situations, in their confusion they fail to recognize them and say 
              that they 
                have become sages, thereby uttering a great lie. They will fall into

              <p><strong><br> In the Dharma-ending Age, after the Tathagata enters Nirvana, all of

              <p>thank you all for all the information. this is really a very informative forum regarding buddhism. it certainly helped clear some doubts.</p>
              <p>my husband asked one of the Seniors there regarding the xuefa. He said it was a Buddha name Yi Wan Guang Fo who taught the Master (hence the temple's name)</p>
              <p>The senior clarified that the temple is no making any money out of the donations, hence its not possible that shifu is running the temple out of greed.The senior also told my husband to ask himself, whether the temple is doing him more harm then good. <strong>He said the more my husband try to search for an answer, the more frustrated he will be. Because in religion, there is never a right answer that is a confirmed answer.</strong></p>
              <p>To summarize, its to think simple and follow your heart. </p>
              <p>Im sorry if it sounds confusing because im directly translating what the senior told my husband. hehe</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-SG"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Can I ask how the senior knows how the donation is spent on?

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-SG"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Secondly, why will there be frustration? I think it is perfectly appropriate for one to find out more about what one is spending his time on and what exactly is he learning on. <span> I d</span>on't think one will want to learn something blindly, without knowing what one is getting oneself into in the first place?</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-SG"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The Buddha had spoken about discerning religious teaching. Actually, Buddha has invited us to inquire on his teachings, investigate whether what he taught is true or not and also to clarify any doubts. If the teaching is authentic and spoke the truth about life, then one should be able to verify it because it is the truth. There is no fear of questioning the teachings in Buddhism. There will be gradual clarity as one clear their misconception while progressing on the path.</span></span></p>

The Buddha tells the Kalamas to not just believe religious teachings because they are claimed to be true by various sources or through the application of various methods and techniques. He urges that direct knowledge from one's own experience should be called upon. He counsels that the words of the wise should be heeded and taken into account when deciding upon the value of a teaching. This is not a dogmatic acceptance but rather a constantly questioning and testing acceptance of those teachings which can be proven to reduce suffering.</span></p>

              <p>Actually Guan Gong is considered as a dharma protector, I believe he is respected as a worldly protector in Buddhism. Some people consider him a Bodhisattva, but I don't know who actually said that. To be a Bodhisattva you must be enlightened. From the story, it seems he is a worldly spirit who then took a vow to protect Buddhism.</p>

              <p>--------------</p>
              <p>In <a class="mw-redirect" title="Chinese Buddhism" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Buddhism">Chinese Buddhism</a>, Guan 
                  Yu is revered by most practicing Buddhists as Sangharama <a title="Bodhisattva" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhisattva">Bodhisattva</a> (<a title="Simplified Chinese characters" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters">simplified Chinese</a>: <span lang="zh-Hans">ä¼½è“�è�©è�¨</span>; <a title="Traditional Chinese characters" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters">traditional Chinese</a>: <span lang="zh-Hant">ä¼½è—�è�©è–©,</span>; <a title="Pinyin" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin">pinyin</a>: <em>Qíelán
                   Púsà</em>) a protector of the Buddhist <a title="Dharma" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharma">dharma</a>. <em><a title="Sangharama" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangharama">Sangharama</a></em> in <a title="Sanskrit" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> means 'community garden' (<em>sangha</em>, community + <em>arama</em>, 
                  garden) and thus 'monastery'. The sangharama refer to a group of devas 
                  and spirits who guard Buddhist monasteries, the dharma, and the faith 
                  itself. Over time and as an act of syncreticism, Guan Yu was seen as a 
                  representative <em>sangharama</em> guardian of the temple and the garden 
                  in which it stands. His statue is usually located on the far left of the
                   main shrine, opposite his counterpart, <a title="Skanda 
                  (Buddhism)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skanda_%28Buddhism%29">Skanda</a>.</p>
              <p>According to Buddhist legends, in 592, Guan Yu manifested himself one
                   night before Ch'an Master <a title="Zhiyi" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhiyi">Zhiyi</a>, the founder of the <a class="mw-redirect" title="Tientai" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tientai">Tientai</a> school of Buddhism, along with a retinue
                   of spiritual beings. Zhiyi was then in deep meditation on <a class="new" title="Yuquan Hill (Hubei) (page does not exist)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yuquan_Hill_%28Hubei%29&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Yuquan 
                  Hill</a> (çŽ‰æ³‰å±±) when he was distracted by Guan Yu's presence. Guan Yu 
                  then requested the master to teach him about the dharma. After receiving
                   Buddhist teachings from the master, Guan Yu took refuge in the triple 
                  gems and also requested the <a title="Five Precepts" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Precepts">Five
                   Precepts</a>. Henceforth, it is said that Guan Yu made a vow to become a
                   guardian of temples and the Dharma. Legends also claim that Guan Yu 
                  assisted Zhiyi in the construction of the <a class="new" title="Yuquan Temple (page does not exist)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yuquan_Temple&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Yuquan Temple</a> (çŽ‰æ³‰å¯º), which still stands today.</p>
              <p>In the <a title="Historical novel" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_novel">historical novel</a> <em><a title="Romance of the Three Kingdoms" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_of_the_Three_Kingdoms">Romance of the Three Kingdoms</a></em>,
                   <a title="Luo 
                  Guanzhong" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luo_Guanzhong">Luo Guanzhong</a> wrote that Guan Yu manifested himself to a 
                  monk named Pujing (æ™®æ·¨) on Yuquan Hill on the night of his death, with 
                  his spirit shouting "Return my head!" From Pujing, Guan Yu sought the 
                  Buddhist teachings and entered the faith after being told by Pujing 
                  "Where should Yan Liang, Wen Chou, and the guardians of the five passes 
                  whom you have slain seek their heads?" While this being a modification 
                  of the "true" account, Pujing did exist in history. The location at 
                  which Pujing built a grass hut for himself was where the Yuquan Temple 
                  was later built on.</p>

              <p>Oh but the 'Kwan Gong had been bestowed the
                                          Boddhisattva title when in Heaven.' is confirm wrong even if kwan gong is a bodhisattva, which I doubt.</p>
              <p>A Bodhisattva isn't bestowed the title. A Bodhisattva becomes a bodhisattva when he becomes enlightened. There is no 'bestowal'. You cannot be bestowed enlightenment. You must realise it yourself.</p>
              <p>And btw, what's up with the heaven part anyway, it's not like heaven is the home base of Buddhas. Buddhas don't belong to worldly states of existence, though they may appear to help us, they don't live in heaven.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>from what i know after studying chinese history and buddhism,</p>
              <p>i thot that guan gong is the jie lan pu sa which protects the dharma and temples. however, i thot that it is because of the chinese history and culture then chinese buddhist decided that jie lan pu sa should take the form of guan yu due to his so called title in chinese history æˆ˜ç¥žor so called war god. i think is just different explanation of how the buddhas became immortals.</p>
              <p>buddhism is actually from India, so...IMO, i think some of the chinese cultural god or bodhisattva in buddhism are actually added in by the chinese themselves...no doubt, there are high chances of a chinese getting enlightened actually and i believe greatly that there are many chinese getting enlightened as buddhism, only in china, then did it gained greater popularity.</p>
