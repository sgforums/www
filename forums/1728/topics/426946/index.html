              <p>Mahabodhi Monastery is one of the temple I frequently visit. The old building was very old and run down. They had just demolished and is in the progress of building a new one. The new building will be equipped with 21st century technologies and architecture outlook (see the link below for the outlook of the new building).</p>
              <p>They need our financial support for the new building. Support them if we can.</p>
              <p>Click onto the below link and if you wish to donate, click on "Support Us" on the left hand side for the form to fill in.</p>
              <p>There are 2 young well educated local monks in their 30s and a few nuns in this temple. It is Mahayana tradition. It is located at Bukit Timah Road, opposite Beauty World Shopping Centre. There will be a MRT station near the temple in the near future.</p>

              <p>Marvellously sweet 21st century technologies and architecture outlook ! Splendid achievement. earnestly hope that the modern outlook is not perceived to be too private like condo that unintentionally ward off potential zen masterssss the first step of walking into the temple for realization of Mahabodhi. As usually in the great old days, people just walked into the temple due to outlook when they happen to pass by, benefitted and also many become great dharma masters as well.</p>

              <p>If it is true, do you know the reason why? May be you can pm me as I'm curious to know. This temple is one of the few which is not located in Geylang (red light district), thus we Buddhists must support. Besides, these local young monks need our moral support. How many local young monks do you see nowadays ? There are so many Buddhists in Singapore, I believe we can make the project a successful one with our collective effort.</p>

              <p>The supporters had actually resigned from their posts.  They are no longer on the Board, thus are asking abbot to return them the funds that had been donated towards the project, a huge sum.  What I understand is abbot is having a difficult time now.  I believe Lord Buddha will bless this project.</p>

              <p>If these main supporters are true Buddhists, they should not put a young abbot in a difficult position. The old temple had already demolished, what do they want a young monk to do ? I believe Lord Buddha will bless this project as I've heard many stories of Buddhist temples went through hard time to build but in the end, all things end up well.</p>
