Numbers are also empty.<br><br><a href="http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism/emptiness.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism/emptiness.html</a><br><br><blockquote><strong>Emptiness in mathematics.</strong><br><br>In mathematics the notion of emptiness finds expression in the number zero, as well as in contemporary set theory. The concept of zero was discovered in India prior to the sixth century A.D. The "Arabic" number system we use today is neither Arabic nor Greek in origin. In fact, the digits 0123456789 go back to India where they were first created. The ancient Indian number system distinguished itself from other positional systems by virtue of allowing the use of zero as a legitimate number. Interestingly, the number zero did not exist in Greek mathematics, because the Greeks were essentially geometricians and had no use for the mathematical concept of a non-entity, neither did it exist in Egyptian mathematics. The Arabs, who encountered the Indian number system during their early conquests in India, found it superior to their own traditional system which used letters, and thus adapted it to develop Islamic mathematics. The Arabic word for zero is "sifr", meaning "empty." In the 12th century, the Italian mathematician Leonardo Pisano Fibonacci studied Arabian algebra and introduced the Hindu-Arabic numerals to Europe. The word "sifr" thus became "zephirum" in Latin and "zero" in English.<br><br>In the ancient Indian context, the number zero did not originally refer to nothingness or nullity. The Sanskrit word for zero is shunya, which means "puffed up, hollow, empty." The zero stands for emptiness suggestive of potentiality. The discovery of the mathematical zero concurred with the emptiness of prajna-intuition in India around 200 BC. Both signify polar opposition between being and nonbeing. Zero is that which contains all possible polarised pairs such as (+1, -1), (+2, -2), etc. It is the collection of all mutually cancelling pairs of forward and backward movements. Put it another way, zero is fundamental to all existence. Because of it, everything is possible. Zero is the additive identity, the focal point of all numbers; without it, numbers cannot be created. India alone, among the great civilisations of antiquity, was able to fathom the depth of emptiness and willing to accept its consequences in mathematics.<br><br>Following the introduction of the Hindu-Arabic numerals into Western culture, zero became a number that was used in calculations like any other number. Consequently, it lost some part of its original meaning, namely the part that suggests potentiality. Today, most mathematicians do not associate the notion of emptiness with zero, but with the empty set, which is a construct of set theory. A set is a collection of objects or numbers.<br><br>For example, the set { 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 } is a set of numbers containing five elements; it is therefore said to have the "cardinality" of 5. The empty set { } is a collection that contains nothing and has the cardinality 0. The mathematician John von Neumann (1923) invented a method, known as von Neumann hierarchy, which can be employed to generate the natural numbers from the empty set as follows:<br>Step 0:   	{ } 	(empty set)<br>Step 1:  	{ { } } 	(set containing the empty set)<br>Step 2:  	{ { }, { { } } } 	(set containing previous two sets)<br>Step 3:  	{ { }, { { } } , { { }, { { } } } } 	(set containing previous three sets)<br>Step 4:  	{ { }, { { } } , { { }, { { } } }, { { }, { { } } , { { }, { { } } } } } 	(etc.)<br><br>This sequence is obtained by iterating a functor that creates a new set from the union of the preceding two sets, thus generating sets with the cardinalities 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ad infinitum. In less mathematical terms, the principle can be described as follows: Beginning with emptiness (step 0), we observe emptiness. Through the act of observing we create an entity containing emptiness (step 1). Now we perceive emptiness, as well as an entity. From the combination of the former two we create another entity by observation, which is different from the first entity (step 2). This process is repeated again and again. Interestingly, if we define suitable operations on the obtained sets based on union and intersection, the cardinalities of the resulting sets behave just like natural numbers being added and subtracted. The sequence is therefore isomorphic to the natural numbers - a stunningly beautiful example of something from nothing.</blockquote></div>

Understanding is only perception, and any perception, even perception of Emptiness if attached to, is also a hindrance. Emptiness only 'points'... like the Lankavatara sutra says, you have to go beyond the words, the pointers.<br><br>Lankavatara Sutra stated very clearly that Transcendental Intelligence is not attained through conceptual mind, it is through Intuitive mind, our 'link' to seeing Noble Wisdom. And of course it requires dharma practise and clearance of our conceptual inclinations, to go beyond the symbolic realm before we can know the transcendental. Mindfulness is very important.</div>

There is just 'give up'. Not 'giving up'(which is a wish)... but a deep 'give-up'... which drops all conceptualisation, striving and reasoning.<br><br>Someone ask what is the difference between intuition and psychosis. In a sense, all are knowingness..However, intuition has a relationship to truth. That is, it reflects a truth. And very often, what is intuited turns out to be true when it is verified.<br><br>Our fundamental false assumption is that there is a 'self' or person that knows. However, knowingness doesn't need a 'self' to know at all.  Strong identification to a 'self' in fact blocks intuition. This is because the mind tends to be focussed on the 'sense of self'  and thus miss the intuitive knowingness.<br><br>I dunno... perhaps... it could be that the the total collapse of the barrier of 'self-identification' is what that allows for omniscience.... a knowing beyond the self. Perhaps with the 'sense of self' out of the way, consciousness can attune with more freedom beyond the usual mode of thinking.<br><br>just my opinion.</div>
