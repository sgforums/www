              <div class="entry"><blockquote>
              <p>“If we consider the knower independently of the 
                  known, it reveals itself as pure witness. When knower and known are 
                  not-two, there is no place even for a witness.” – Jean Klein</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><strong>Kenneth Folk:</strong> If we want to go to the next level 
                  (and we do), we are going to go to <a href="http://kennethfolkdharma.wetpaint.com/page/2nd+Gear">2nd Gear</a>.
                   We are going to turn the light of attention back on itself, and we are 
                  going to ask this question: “Who am I?” Or “Who is looking?”</p>
              <p>So, look at how smug we have been so far. It is as though we have 
                  been looking down from on high at this odd creature, saying “Ha ha. See 
                  how it does this? See how it does that?”</p>
              <p>We are looking down on it, but what we have not done is to wonder, 
                  “Wait a minute. But who is looking?” At that moment where you turn the 
                  light around and you bust this supposed watcher, that is 2nd Gear. It is
                   a completely different category of practice, and this needs to be 
                  explicitly understood. This is not vipassana as I learned it in Burma.  
                  They never told me to do this. They do not talk about this, so you can 
                  do vipassana until the cows come home, but unless you understand that 
                  the idea with 2nd Gear is to turn the light around and look at the 
                  supposed knower, you are not making the leap to the next level.</p>
              <p>So let’s do that. Let’s say “Who am I?” Now with this, it is very 
                  likely that the yogi will be embedded at this level, the level of the 
                  Witness. And in fact they are so likely to be embedded that they will 
                  convince themselves that they are looking at the Witness when in fact 
                  they are not.</p>
              <p>So I like to make the point that when you really get this Witness, it
                   is very clear. It is a very distinct experience where the knowing mind 
                  is clearly looking back at itself in a kind of mirroring way.</p>
              <p>There are various ways to get in touch with this. The simplest and 
                  most practical and consistently effective way is to ask the question 
                  “Who am I?” When you do that, you keep inquiring even though it appears 
                  at first that you are not getting anything out of it. At first you might
                   feel that there is this hall of mirrors phenomenon where it just keeps 
                  rocketing back into your head: “Who am I?” “Yeah, but who is watching I?
                   … but who is watching I? … but who is watching I?” Each one of those is
                   seen, and you’re just going from one to the next in this apparent 
                  infinite regress.</p>
              <p>Well, what I’ve just described is actually at the level of the 
                  bystander, which is still <a href="http://kennethfolkdharma.wetpaint.com/page/1st+Gear">1st Gear</a>.
                   The “hall of mirrors” effect is not yet the Witness. There is a way, 
                  though, to turn the light around and to see “I.” <a href="http://www.sriramanamaharshi.org/">Ramana Maharshi</a> talked 
                  about this.  He said “dwell as the ‘I am’” as in “I…I.” So this is what 
                  it feels like: You are asking this question “who am I?” and at some 
                  point the answer actually comes back, “Well…I.” “What do you mean ‘who 
                  am I?’ … !”</p>
              <p>Okay, that is the Witness. It is possible to become absorbed in that 
                  Witness or that witnessing consciousness.  It is a good idea to become 
                  absorbed in that witnessing consciousness because you are objectifying 
                  this very subtle sense of the watcher. It might take a long time. It 
                  might take years.</p>
              <p><strong>Joel Groover:</strong> Are we talking about a felt sense of 
                  ‘I amness’ that is in the body? In other words, not just in the head.</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> There are body sensations that accompany this 
                  particular perspective.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> When I ask the question, I seem to feel it—I 
                  almost take the awareness into the body or something.</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> Well, when I do the Witness I feel a lot of 
                  subtle tension around the eyes and third eye area. My eyes are doing 
                  something. The way your eyes focus physically is intimately related to 
                  the way your mind focuses. One of the ways to recognize various mind 
                  states is to notice what your eyes are doing. In this particular 
                  perspective of the Witness, the eyes are locking in to a particular 
                  position. They’re looking straight ahead. They are not rolled up into my
                   head at the moment. I’m looking at the back of my eyelids and what I’m 
                  seeing looks a little bit like a mirror. [Kenneth is describing the 
                  Witness with his eyes closed. The Witness is equally accessible with 
                  eyes open.]</p>
              <p>So it is not entirely clear as I look at this kind of bright 
                  mirroresque quality of the back of my eyelids—it is not clear whether I 
                  am the one in this head looking at this bright, mirror-like quality or 
                  if this bright, mirror-like quality is looking back at me. That’s why it
                   has this mirror-like quality.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> That is helpful because I think I was embedded 
                  in body sensation. But what you’re describing, more is being objectified
                   there.</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> As you become absorbed in this, you get this 
                  sense that there is this “I”, which is not the little self; this is not 
                  Kenneth as I am used to thinking of it. It includes Kenneth and it 
                  includes everything else. So basically this is not “no-self,” this is 
                  “big self,” where everything is experienced as an aspect of this Self, 
                  with a capital “S.”</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> OK. And you can see the bystander there as being
                   part of…?</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> This is a different situation in that it feels 
                  very different from the bystander. The bystander is transcended and 
                  included, in integral-speak, but the only thing that is interesting to 
                  the Witness is the Witness. All the Witness wants to do is make love to 
                  itself. Everything else that comes up—and things do come up, so seeing 
                  and hearing, tasting, touching, smelling and thinking and going through 
                  your day and doing your business—all of this happens, but the Witness 
                  has no stake in any of it.</p>
              <p>It just wants to be absorbed in itself and feel aloof from and 
                  dissociated from those other things, which are just unimportant aspects 
                  of itself. So this is a big subject [as opposed to object]. This is a 
                  big <em>subject</em> here. Nothing is really perceived as object; it is 
                  just a lot of subject.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> I’m not going to pretend to get it. I have got 
                  the 1,000 hours [of practice] to do [first]. Conceptually I believe I 
                  understand what you’re saying.</p>
              <p>KF: Now in my experience, after having been absorbed in the witness 
                  for several years, it began to soften. And a more subtle sense of 
                  knowing became apparent. This is where <a href="http://www.shambhala.org/teachers/chogyam-trungpa.php">Trungpa 
                  Rinpoche</a> said, “Who is watching the watcher?” Well, that is a 
                  helluva question. Who knows the Witness?</p>
              <p>There is a subtle sense of knowing that transcends and includes the 
                  Witness. That subtle sense of knowing comes up—it arises with the 
                  objects that are known. Now this is still consciousness. We are talking 
                  about compounded phenomena that arise according to conditions; it just 
                  so happens that whenever an object of consciousness comes up, the 
                  knowing consciousness comes up at the same time. The knowing 
                  consciousness knows the object, from this perspective. They arise 
                  together, and can’t be separated. This is a very high perspective and 
                  this is one of the fruits of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advaita_Vedanta">Advaita</a> practice. When you do “who am I?” and become absorbed as the Self you 
                  eventually transcend the Witness and get to this place where the 
                  kundalini energy comes back down from the head: it actually goes out the
                   top of the head—you can actually feel this and see this—and circles 
                  back down to the body and comes to rest primarily at the heart center 
                  but also at all of the chakras along the way. It forms this kind of 
                  circuit, this kind of cocoon of energy, kundalini energy.</p>
              <p>At this point you are no longer dissociated from your experience the 
                  way you were when you were dwelling as the Witness. I tell people when 
                  they are dwelling as the Witness, you have to let that down when you are
                   dealing with people. Whenever you are talking with your loved ones, for
                   example, you have to let the Witness down because they can see that you
                   are aloof and dissociated from them. They can see that you have no 
                  stake in your own life, let alone theirs. This is toxic to interpersonal
                   relationships. But once you transcend and include the witness with this
                   next level, which I call the transcendent, this is the opening of the 
                  heart. [Kenneth is describing one of the highest attainments of 
                  enlightenment, which is not to be confused with what we would normally 
                  think of as “heart” or compassion.]</p>
              <p>So from this perspective it is again possible to be with your loved 
                  ones and it is obvious to them that you do care about them. You are with
                   them in an intimate way. There is no aloofness or dissociation 
                  whatsoever; this is the full-circle perspective of enlightened living.</p>
              <p>Now what happens when you dis-embed even from the subtle sense of 
                  knowing?</p>
              <p>You go beyond these compounded phenomena to the unconditioned, where 
                  there is just absolute awareness. In order for that to happen, I just 
                  have to go away. I have to surrender entirely. I cannot objectify the 
                  Absolute. Because that is where all of this awareness is coming from in 
                  the first place.</p>
              <p>All of this awareness, by the way, it is not anything separate from 
                  or other than all of the phenomena that arise within awareness; this is 
                  all a package. Now if I were to say to you that there is some facile way
                   in which to conceive of this without actually looking at it in 
                  real-time, I would be lying. And if anyone says to you that there is 
                  some way to conceive this—“Oh, don’t you just understand…?”—that is 
                  baloney.</p>
              <p>It is not a concept and can never be conceived, which is why 
                  throughout the ages sages have insisted that you cannot think your way 
                  through this. But there is this remarkable experience of the integration
                   of the absolute and the relative. So to be enlightened is to objectify 
                  everything that is arising and passing in the mind and to let awareness 
                  recognize itself.</p>
              <p>And while we are talking about this in this very stratified way, in 
                  this very picked-apart way, the truth is it is a seamless whole, and the
                   only reason we are doing it in this systematic way is to make it 
                  accessible so that it is possible to learn step-by-step how to dis-embed
                   from each stratum of mind and how finally to surrender to things as 
                  they are.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> And so the last part of that, the 3rd Gear, you 
                  have mentioned that people have access to that [even before 
                  Theravada-style enlightenment], people like your wife?</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> Yes.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> Could you talk a little bit about that?</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> Because awareness is always operating … I should
                   say “because in any moment awareness is operating.” You cannot even say
                   “always” because awareness is prior to the arising of time. Awareness 
                  Is, with a capital “I”, in this moment. But to say that awareness goes 
                  on from moment to moment, that is meaningless because awareness is not 
                  about time. So what I call 3rd Gear is this Awareness, when Awareness 
                  recognizes itself. Because awareness Is, in this moment, anybody can see
                   it. Or anybody can surrender and let it recognize itself. That is not 
                  attainment.</p>
              <p>It is happening all the time anyway to everyone. Now the reason it 
                  often isn’t recognized is because we are distracted, and we are 
                  distracted by being embedded in the contents of our mind.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> So I think I’m understanding this better and I 
                  apologize if I keep beating a dead horse.</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> No, no. Beat that horse. I’m the one who wants 
                  to hear the questions.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> But you know, I think this is why the “chronic 
                  yogi” thing <a name="foot_src_1" href="http://www.buddhistgeeks.com/2010/04/the-witness-turning-the-light-around-2/#foot_1">[1]</a> can happen also to people who are not 
                  strivers. I think they can sit down and they can access this. I don’t 
                  think they access it at the level that you might call fruitional or 
                  something, but they can sit and they can be with whatever is and they 
                  can have this equanimity where they aren’t doing anything, but then they
                   get up and they are just totally embedded in everything else because 
                  when they are off the cushion they have not made it a—they haven’t 
                  really, really looked at pleasant, unpleasant—just in the 
                  moment—pressure. They have really not objectified phenomena to the level
                   and extent you talk about.</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> Right.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> And so you have a chronic yogi because you have 
                  hooks, hooks, hooks everywhere, right? Pulling them back down into 
                  embedded consciousness or an embedded way of being?</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> That is right, and that is precisely why I 
                  believe <a href="http://www.adyashanti.org/index.php?file=aboutus">Adyashanti</a>,
                   after teaching yogis to recognize the Absolute, then teaches what he 
                  calls advanced practice. He says, “now find out what is pulling you back
                   into ignorance.” In my terminology, that would be “now do the 
                  developmental practice that we have been invalidating the whole time.”</p>
              <p>Now there is a reason why he has been invalidating it the whole time 
                  and that is because you cannot simultaneously worry about your 
                  development and surrender to the absolute.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> Yes. If you’re going to start from 3rd Gear, you
                   cannot do that.</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> That’s right. So if you are going to start from <a href="http://kennethfolkdharma.wetpaint.com/page/3rd+Gear">3rd Gear</a>,
                   people really have to buy in. They’ve got to understand that there 
                  really isn’t any other moment than this. If it does not seem good 
                  enough, nonetheless, this is it. And so there is kind of a “fake it ’til
                   you make it” phenomenon to pure 3rd Gear teachings, where the teacher 
                  will keep insisting that this is it and the yogi will get a hint—“OK. I 
                  feel a little bit of a … something.” And then this understanding grows 
                  over time. As they learn to surrender more and more, as you say, maybe 
                  they are not really getting it at first. But maybe eventually they will.
                   So if you’re going to be a ruthless 3rd Gear teacher you have to accept
                   this ”fake it ’til you make it” understanding and encourage 
                  people—“Yeah, you are getting it”—-\when maybe they really are not 
                  getting it.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> Yes. Or the whole thing falls apart.</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> Yeah. Or you have to teach people to make the 
                  clear switch in their mind between developmental practice and 
                  realization, which is what I do. I like to have people be able to turn 
                  on a dime. “Okay, a minute ago we were talking about development, but 
                  right now we are going to acknowledge that there is no development; 
                  there is no time. There’s just this.”</p>
              <p>And so you completely give up all hope of development and notice what
                   is always already the case. Most 3rd Gear teachers don’t do that. They 
                  just continue to invalidate development, and that also works. But then 
                  you are in a situation where you have to come back later if you want to 
                  be a good teacher—and I think Adyashanti is a good teacher—and say, 
                  “Alright, now we are going to do this work that some people call 
                  development. I’m not going to call it that, but hmmm…”</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> Or even in just Zen. What is it, “carry water, 
                  chop wood”?</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> I don’t think of that as being quite the same. I
                   think of that as just being the understanding that life goes on after 
                  enlightenment. Because there is a tendency to want to romanticize this 
                  and say “OK, as soon as I get enlightened, my life is going to be a 
                  cosmic bliss-out and I’ll be good to go forever.” Well, actually what 
                  happens is that after enlightenment you do your life.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> I hope this is not too academic a question, but I
                   have been wondering where subtle objects fit in here. So for example in
                   the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visuddhimagga">Visuddhimagga</a> there are situations where people are taking very subtle objects like 
                  different consciousnesses or, like, “the base of boundless space” is 
                  listed. It makes me wonder if there are not some approaches in the 
                  Visuddhimagga anyway, if not all of Theravada Buddhism, that are getting
                   a little bit closer to 2nd Gear than we might think?</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> In fact, the base of boundless space—the jhana 
                  of boundless space—is the fifth of the jhanas. It is the first of the 
                  immaterial jhanas and corresponds directly in my system to “the 
                  bystander.” Now the next jhana, the sixth, which is the “jhana of 
                  infinite consciousness,” corresponds to the Witness. This is one of the 
                  things that I find so interesting, being able to marry the Theravada and
                   Advaita. That point of sixth jhana is a crossroads because at the sixth
                   jhana of infinite consciousness, the most important thing, the most 
                  relevant thing that is going on there when you experience that jhana is 
                  the sense of the watcher.</p>
              <p>So this is how I teach people who can do jhana but who can’t yet do 
                  2nd Gear practice. They don’t understand what the Witness is. I have 
                  them go to the sixth jhana, notice that the predominant sensation there 
                  is this sense of the watcher or Witness and then find that they can also
                   identify that sense of Witness in other jhanas, and they can identify 
                  that sense of the Witness in their daily lives and all day long. From 
                  there, they can learn to cultivate this Witness all the time. That is 
                  the place where Theravada and Advaita come together. Then beyond that, 
                  Advaita is mainly about 2nd Gear but it goes also all the way to 3rd 
                  Gear, which I want to say is as important to the Advatists as 2nd Gear.</p>
              <p>Because as Ramana Maharshi says, this dwelling as the “I am” is the 
                  stick that stirs the fire and is eventually consumed by it. So you are 
                  dwelling as the Witness and it eventually just kind of burns away and at
                   that point you recognize this subtle sense of knowing, which is the 
                  transcendent. Even that eventually goes away, leaving just the Absolute.
                   So this is the Grand Unified Field Theory of Dharma.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> We all know on some level that these 
                  distinctions that we draw from tradition to tradition ultimately are BS.</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> Yes. Everybody is holding onto one part of the 
                  elephant thinking that they have the whole beast. If we put all of it 
                  together and see where they intersect, the elephant is there for us in 
                  all of the various traditions, as long as we don’t become attached. 
                  “Well, I am a Tibetan guy and the Tibetans say this and therefore I am 
                  going to be sectarian about that.” That is a self-limiting approach. You
                   want to look at everything that is out there and see the whole beast.</p>

                   of years and never understand what vipassana practice is all about. He

                  Enlightenment. In these interviews, Kenneth has merged the two terms and
                   is using the phrase “chronic yogi” to describe yogis both pre and post

              <p> Tibetan Buddhism talks about it.</p>
              <h2>The Tibetan Buddhist Theory of Chakras</h2>
              <p>Tantric Buddhism (or <a href="http://www.kheper.net/topics/Buddhism/Vajrayana.htm">Vajrayana</a>)
               broke off from the Indian Tantric one at a very early stage.  Hence 
              they developed a rather different version of the <a href="http://www.kheper.net/topics/chakras/chakras.htm">chakras</a>.  
              Tibetan Buddhism acknowledges four (navel, heart, throat, and head), 
              five, seven, or even ten chakras or "channel wheels"; each with a 
              different number of "spokes" to its Indian Tantric counterpart.  The 
              navel chakra for example has sixty-four spokes, the heart chakra eight, 
              the throat sixteen (the only one to agree with the Hindu scheme), and 
              the head or crown chakra thirty-two.  There is also, as in <a href="http://www.kheper.net/topics/chakras/Layayoga.html">Laya-yoga</a>,
               an elaborate system of correspondences.  Note that in this system it is
               the head-centre, and not, as in many Western interpretations of Hindu 
              Tantra, the <a href="http://www.kheper.net/topics/chakras/Perineum.htm">Perineal</a> or the <a href="http://www.kheper.net/topics/chakras/chakra1.html">base</a>,
               that is associated with the body and physical consciousness.  The 
              throat centre represents a more subtle state of consciousness, the dream
               state; and the heart centre the refined of all, deep meditataion, 
              dreamless sleep, the peaceful deities and the Clear Light.</p>

              reference is made to the red and white subtle "drops" in the navel and 
              head chakras respectively, although sometimes other drops are mentioned 
              as well.  Through the dissolution of these
              drops, and of the various subtle winds, in the central channel, one 
              attains transcendent awareness.  This happens not only during advanced 
              yoga, but also <a href="http://www.kheper.net/topics/bardo/tibetan.html">at
               the time of death</a>; and constitutes the phenomenon known as

              <p><br> thanks for the info, AEN. So do local Buddhists generally
              believe in Tibetan Buddhism, as I notice even within this forum,
              different people believe in different 'types' of Buddhism.</p>

              <p>It depends on which place you're talking about.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, we have the best of all worlds, not only in terms of the different religions, but also the different traditions of religions... we have all 3 main types of Buddhism in Singapore, i.e. Theravada, Mahayana and Tibetan/Vajrayana Buddhism.</p>
              <p>Vajrayana Buddhism does have a large following (so do the other 2 traditions) in Singapore. It is also gaining large following in the West.</p>
