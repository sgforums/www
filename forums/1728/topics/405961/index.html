              <p>i've not seen the movie but after reading about the storyline, i was just thinking if it's somewhat linked to Buddhist views..........</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the Buddha said that the world is just an illusion so could it be that our so-called reality is just a dream of some entity or maybe even a computer program ?</p>
              <p>then we people are just dreamed-up or computer characters...............would that be why the Buddha said there's no such a thing as a permanent self then ?</p>
              <p>if that's the case then the Buddha would be a dream character that realized what he really was ?</p>
              <p>sort of like suddenly the characters in our own computer games start becoming ''self-aware'' ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i've been thinking along these lines for a number of years and only recently this movie seemed to sort of make me think a bit deeper.......</p>

              <p>The ancients have described what we perceived as dream-like.</p>
              <p>But what is utterly undeniable is our very Consciousness.</p>
              <p>Realising our true nature, we stop identifying with our dream stories of an illusory self.</p>

              <div class="text-head">Excerpt from <em>The Simple Feeling of Being</em></div>
              <div class="text-body">
              <p><strong><em>From</em></strong><strong> Chapter 1: The Witness</strong></p>
              <p>There
                   are many things that I can doubt, but I cannot believably doubt my own 
                  consciousness in this moment. My consciousness IS, and even if I tried 
                  to doubt it, it would be my consciousness doing the doubting. I can 
                  imagine that my senses are being presented with a fake reality—say, a 
                  completely virtual reality or digital reality, which looks real but is 
                  merely a series of extremely realistic images. But even then, I cannot 
                  doubt the consciousness that is doing the watching . . . .</p>
              <p>The 
                  very undeniability of my present awareness, the undeniability of my 
                  consciousness, immediately delivers to me a certainty of existence in 
                  this moment, a certainty of Being in the now-ness of this moment. I 
                  cannot doubt consciousness and Being in this moment, for it is the 
                  ground of all knowing, all seeing, all existing.</p>
              <p>Who am I? Ask that question over and over again, deeply. Who am I? What is it in me that is conscious of everything?</p>
              <p>If
                   you think that you know Spirit, or if you think you don't, Spirit is 
                  actually that which is thinking both of those thoughts. So you can doubt
                   the objects of consciousness, but you can never believably doubt the 
                  doubter, never really doubt the Witness of the entire display. 
                  Therefore, rest in the Witness, whether it is thinking that it knows God
                   or not, and that witnessing, that undeniable immediacy of 
                  now-consciousness, is itself God, Spirit, Buddha-mind. The certainty 
                  lies in the pure self-felt Consciousness to which objects appear, not in
                   the objects themselves. You will never, never, never see God, because 
                  God is the Seer, not any finite, mortal, bounded object that can be 
                  seen.</p>
              <p>This pure I AM state is not hard to achieve but impossible
                   to escape, because it is ever present and can never really be doubted. 
                  You can never run from Spirit, because Spirit is the Runner. To put it 
                  very bluntly, Spirit is not hard to find but impossible to avoid: it is 
                  that which is looking at this page right now. Can't you feel That One? 
                  Why on earth do you keep looking for God when God is actually the 
                  Looker?</p>
              <p>Simply ask, Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?</p>
              <p>I am 
                  aware of my feelings, so I am not my feelings—Who am I? I am aware of my
                   thoughts, so I am not my thoughts—Who am I? Clouds float by in the sky,
                   thoughts float by in the mind, feelings float by in the body—and I am 
                  none of those because I can Witness them all.</p>
              <p>Moreover, I can 
                  doubt that clouds exist, I can doubt that feelings exist, I can doubt 
                  that objects of thought exist—but I cannot doubt that the Witness exists
                   in this moment, because the Witness would still be there to witness the
                   doubt.</p>
              <p>I am not objects in nature, not feelings in the body, 
                  not thoughts in the mind, for I can Witness them all. I am that 
                  Witness—a vast, spacious, empty, clear, pure, transparent Openness that 
                  impartially notices all that arises, as a mirror spontaneously reflects 
                  all its objects. . . .</p>
              <p>You can already feel some of this Great 
                  Liberation in that, as you rest in the ease of witnessing this moment, 
                  you already feel that you are free from the suffocating constriction of 
                  mere objects, mere feelings, mere thoughts—they all come and go, but you
                   are the vast, free, empty, open Witness of them all, untouched by their
                   torments and tortures.</p>
              <p>This is actually the profound discovery 
                  of . . . the pure divine Self, the formless Witness, causal nothingness,
                   the vast Emptiness in which the entire world arises, stays a bit, and 
                  passes. And you are That. You are not the body, not the ego, not nature,
                   not thoughts, not this, not that—you are a vast Emptiness, Freedom, 
                  Release, and Liberation.</p>
              <p>With this discovery . . . you are 
                  halfway home. You have disidentified from any and all finite objects; 
                  you rest as infinite Consciousness. You are free, open, empty, clear, 
                  radiant, released, liberated, exalted, drenched in a blissful emptiness 
                  that exists prior to space, prior to time, prior to tears and terror, 
                  prior to pain and mortality and suffering and death. You have found the 
                  great Unborn, the vast Abyss, the unqualifiable Ground of all that is, 
                  and all that was, and all that ever shall be.</p>
              <p>But why is that 
                  only halfway home? Because as you rest in the infinite ease of 
                  consciousness, spontaneously aware of all that is arising, there will 
                  soon enough come the great catastrophe of final Freedom and Fullness: 
                  the Witness itself will disappear entirely, and instead of witnessing 
                  the sky, you are the sky; instead of touching the earth, you are the 
                  earth; instead of hearing the thunder, you are the thunder. You and the 
                  entire Kosmos become One Taste—you can drink the Pacific Ocean in a 
                  single gulp, hold Mt. Everest in the palm of your hand; supernovas swirl
                   in your heart and the solar system replaces your head.</p>
              <p>You are
                   One Taste, the empty mirror that is one with any and all objects that 
                  arise in its embrace, a mindlessly vast translucent expanse: infinite, 
                  eternal, radiant beyond release. And you . . . are . . . That . . .</p>
              <p>So
                   the primary Cartesian dualism—which is simply the dualism between . . .
                   in here and out there, subject and object, the empty Witness and all 
                  things witnessed—is finally undone and overcome in nondual One Taste. 
                  Once you actually and fully contact the Witness, then—and only then—can 
                  it be transcended into radical Nonduality, and halfway home becomes 
                  fully home, here in the ever-present wonder of what is. . . .</p>
              <p>And
                   so how do you know that you have finally and really overcome the 
                  Cartesian dualism? Very simple: if you have really overcome the 
                  Cartesian dualism, then you no longer feel that you are on this side of 
                  your face looking at the world out there. There is only the world, and 
                  you are all of that; you actually feel that you are one with everything 
                  that is arising moment to moment. You are not merely on this side of 
                  your face looking out there. "In here" and "out there" have become One 
                  Taste with a shuddering obviousness and certainty so profound it feels 
                  like a five-ton rock just dropped on your head. It is, shall we say, a 
                  feeling hard to miss.</p>
              <p>At that point, which is actually your 
                  ever-present condition, there is no exclusive identity with this 
                  particular organism, no constriction of consciousness to the head, a 
                  constriction that makes it seem that "you" are in the head looking at 
                  the rest of the world out there; there is no binding of attention to the
                   personal bodymind: instead, consciousness is one with all that is 
                  arising—a vast, open, transparent, radiant, infinitely Free and 
                  infinitely Full expanse that embraces the entire Kosmos, so that every 
                  single subject and every single object are erotically united in the 
                  Great Embrace of One Taste. You disappear from merely being behind your 
                  eyes, and you become the All, you directly and actually feel that your 
                  basic identity is everything that is arising moment to moment (just as 
                  previously you felt that your identity was with this finite, partial, 
                  separate, mortal coil of flesh you call a body). Inside and outside have
                   become One Taste. I tell you, it can happen just like that!</p>
