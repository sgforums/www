            <div class='col-md body'>The Sutra of BuddhaÂ’s Bequeath Teachings (Ch. I-chiao-ching Sutra) states, Â“When we eat, <strong>we should regard our food as medicine</strong>, for consuming too much or too little is not healthy.  A regular and proper dose can support our bodies, cure our hunger, relieve our thirst, and prevent us from becoming ill.  Like bees gathering honey, they take what they need, but they donÂ’t consume the whole flower.Â”<br><br>----------<br><br>Be mindful of eating, do not indulge in it. It's either Mindfulness 'takes control' or our Six Senses take control... beware. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Constantly be mindful of our six senses, when eating is happening, just be aware of the eating, just as it is. Realise that it is only the sensation of eating. When craving arise, remain mindful of the thought, if we disregard them and not be attached, then the thoughts have nothing to do with us and will pass quickly. This is also what is meant by 'non-self'. This is the practise of applying mindfulness/awareness. Do find out more about this teaching... mindfulness/awareness practise is perculiar to Buddhism <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>only from more study/insight can one practice while renoucing and from practice/renoucing, one increase insight. like a loop.<br><br>or u can try scienctific approach. reduce the sugar level while increase ur protein intake(not of meat protein btw, but of tofu, nuts etc).<br><br><blockquote>True Hunger<br>Hunger is a good signal; it keeps our species alive. Hunger feels like a discontentment in the stomach area. If you are not eating enough, you will feel hungry. A good strategy to manage hunger is to eat 3 meals and 2 snacks at regular times each and every day, no matter what. Some people might think that is a lot of food. However, when you get used to not being hungry, you can easily stop eating when full, and cut back on volume naturally. Skipping the next meal when you overate at the last meal is a bad strategy. It just throws the body back into the cycle of inappropriate hunger pangs again. So make a plan, get food available, and eat 3 meals and 2 snacks at regular times every day.<br><br>Blood Sugar Crash This kind of craving feels like a desperate anxiety in your head.. Your body operates best when everything is steady and regular. Every time you eat a meal or snack that is predominantly sweet or starchy, the body is thrown into a "spike &amp; crash" cycle. Sugar or starches cause the blood sugar level to "spike" or rise sharply. It creates a feeling of euphoria and energy. However, everything that goes up must come down, and the blood sugar level always "crashes" after a "spike". The feelings are frightening and this craving truly interrupts your life. Another sweet or starch will "spike" the blood sugar level again, but this is only a temporary solution. A better long-term solution is to eat some protein with every meal and snack. The protein steadies the blood sugar level, and stops the "spike &amp; crash" cycle. The feelings of desperation are replaced by a strong steady energy.<br><br>Cells Crying for Micronutrients In my opinion this situation is the most chronic of the food cravings. The cells in our bodies need vitamins and minerals to operate. We are supposed to get them from the food we eat but unfortunately, food is not a great source of micronutrients anymore. Cells crying for micronutrients feels like a vague and endless yearning for something. We "graze" different foods trying to satisfy this mysterious yearning but very little seems to satisfy. Craving for sugar and sweets is very typical. The solution to this craving is simple and powerfulÂ… just give the cells what they want in the way they want to get it. How do we know what the body specifically needs? You and I don't have the education and technology to determine the specific micronutrients required. The best strategy is to take a good base program of micronutrients, somewhat like a little buffet, so that the cells can get what they want when they need it. With a good vitamin and mineral program, this kind of craving can be "cured" within a week.</blockquote>and<br><br><a href="http://www.realizationcenter.net/fdaddct.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.realizationcenter.net/fdaddct.htm</a><br><br>/\</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If I may suggest, I think some ppl  can't stop their craving for food bec somehow, they have lost the internal 'thermostat' that tells them that they're full.<br><br>To restart this thermostat, one needs to exercise, bec. doing aerobic exercises (which works your heart, e.g. jogging, brisk walking, cycling) helps to make one feel less hungry afterwards, and when you eat your meal, you'll feel full sooner after eating a moderate amount of food. <span class="small">(Sorry, there is really no short cut, but exercise does have some extra side-benefit, except for swimming which doesn't work for me.... makes me eat more!).</span><br><br>Also, stop eating when you're about 70-80% full (I'm referring to the main meals, not snacking), and finish with a drink/beverage. The reason is that when one overeats, one will over extend your stomach muscles and overtime, you'll feel the need to fill it up fully before you'll feel satiated.<br><br>The other usual tip is to eat slowly to give your brain time (20mins) to register that you are full.<br><br>I'm sharing my experience. I used to have a weight problem and also liked to eat a lot. Hope it helps.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Indeed.. my dharma teacher warned several times that the new/younger generation in Singapore will suffer diseases by their 30s only affected by those in their 50s and above in the current generation. One of the many reasons and an important one would be our very unhealthy diet as compared to the past.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>An article to remind people who love snacking (including me):<br><br><strong>The Most Dangerous Potato Chips to Eat</strong><br><br>Potato Chips<br><br>Public knowledge of the serious dangers found in potato chips may finally be surfacing. The California-based Environmental Law Foundation (ELF) has filed notices with the state's attorney general against potato chip manufacturers:<br><br>* Lay's potato chip maker PepsiCo Inc.<br>* Pringles maker Proctor &amp; Gamble Co.<br>* Cape Cod potato chip parent Lance Inc.<br>* Kettle Chips maker Kettle Foods Inc.<br><br>... that would require them to place labels on their products warning consumers about the high levels of acrylamide found inside. Acrylamide is formed when starchy foods are baked or fried at high temperatures and is considered a cancer-causing chemical by the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment.<br><br>Manufacturers who sell their products without such warnings are in violation of California law, California Proposition 65.<br><br>The attorney general's office has 60 days to decide to pursue the case; if the state declines, the ELF will file lawsuits against the companies.<br><br>What Do the Chip Makers Have to Say?<br><br>The reaction from the chip makers was on the defensive ... though the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) wavering position on the dangers of acrylamide certainly doesn't help.<br><br>Perhaps the FDA should review the report developed by the ELF that listed just how far various chip brands exceeded the state's required warning levels for acrylamide. The offenders include:<br><br><strong>* Cape Cod Robust Russet: 910 times<br>* Kettle Chips (lightly salted): 505 times<br>* Kettle Chips (honey dijon): 495 times<br>* Pringles Snack Stacks (pizza-flavored): 170 times<br>* Lay's Baked: 150 times</strong><br><br>Chew on that ...<br><br>Reuters June 17, 2005<br><br>Environmental Law Foundation June 16, 2005<br><br>Another good article: <a href="http://www.drmcdougall.com/misc/2005nl/june/050600acrylamide.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.drmcdougall.com/misc/2005nl/june/050600acrylamide.htm</a></div>
