              <p><span style="font-size: medium;">(Following article written by Jaime, a follower of Shridhar Rana Rinpoche)<br><br>TRI RATNA SHARANAM, NAMO AMITABHAYA BUDDHAYA.</span><br> <br><span style="font-size: medium;">Dear Guru,</span><br> <br><span style="font-size: medium;">I hope this message finds Your Holiness in good 
              health, I pray for Your long life.</span><br> <br><span style="font-size: medium;">I was reading the text of the Russian Nicholas Notovich, the man who came 
              up for the very first time with the idea that Jesus visited the Indian 
              subcontinent and studied Buddhism and other philosphies there( then his ideas 
              were latter adopted by other charlatans like the muslim  founder of the 
              Ahmadiyya sect, a man called Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, who claimed to be the 
              reincarnation of Jesus and the awaited messiah of all religions,this man is the 
              originator of the myht of the so called Jesus tomb in Kashmir, and during the 
              last years this idea was widely promoted by New Age "teachers" sush as Elizabeth 
              Claire Propeht and other "aquarians"), and I found the work and the thesis 
              itself laughable, the whole thing is too stupid and gross to be taken seriously 
              by the learned and was rightly exposed and refuted by western scholars such as 
              the Indologist Muller and the professor Archibald Douglas, the work of Notovich 
              which started this fraudulent trend is called "<em>The life of Saint Issa, best 
              of the sons of men", </em>just by reading some excerpts from the text one 
              can gain certainty about the fraudulent nature of the whole thing because the 
              supposed "Buddhism" learned by Jesus in India and Nepal  as described by 
              Notovich is nothing but Hebrew monotheism and actually is quite opposite to the 
              authentic teachings of the Buddha:</span><br> <br><span style="font-size: medium;">"<em>After having perfected himself in the Pali language, the just Issa 
              applied himself to the study of the sacred writings of the Sutras. </em></span><br><em><span style="font-size: medium;">4 Six years after, Issa, whom the Buddha had 
              elected to spread his holy word, had become a perfect expositor of the sacred 
              writings. </span></em><em><span style="font-size: medium;">5 Then he left Nepal and the Himalayan 
              mountains, descended into the valley of Rajputana, and went towards the west, 
              preaching to diverse peoples the supreme perfection of man, </span></em><br><em><span style="font-size: medium;">6 Which is-to do good to one's neighbor, being 
              the sure means of merging oneself rapidly in the Eternal Spirit: "He who shall 
              have regained his original purity," said Issa, "will die having obtained 
              remission for his sins, and he will have the right to contemplate the majesty of 
              God." </span></em><br><em><span style="font-size: medium;">7 In crossing pagan territories, the divine 
              Issa taught that the worship of visible gods was contrary to the law of nature. </span></em><br><em><span style="font-size: medium;">8 "For man," said he, "has not been permitted to 
              see the image of God, and yet he has made a host of deities in the likeness of 
              the Eternal. </span></em><br><em><span style="font-size: medium;">9 "Moreover, it is incompatible with 
              the human conscience to make less matter of the grandeur of divine purity than 
              of animals and objects executed by the hand of man in stone or metal. </span></em><br><em><span style="font-size: medium;">10 "The Eternal Lawgiver is one; there is no 
              other God but he. He has not shared the world with anyone, neither has he 
              informed anyone of his intentions. </span></em><br><span style="font-size: medium;"><em>11 "Even as a 
              father would act towards his children, so will God judge men after their deaths 
              according to the laws of his mercy. Never would he so humiliate his child as to 
              transmigrate his soul, as in a purgatory, into the body of an animal</em>." </span><br> <br><span style="font-size: medium;">What utter non sense to call 
              this Buddhism learned from the "sutras" as Notovich did!!!, so according to 
              Notovich, Jesus learned in the Buddhist Pali sutras that there is one true god 
              that is the eternal lawgiver, that is not permitted to make images of this god 
              from stone or metal, that the idea tha humans can be reborn as animals is wrong, 
              in short that Shakyamuni taught the same thing than Moses, and I ask to myself: 
              am I supposed to believe that such religion described by Notovich is 
              "Buddhism"?, besides the whole structure of the work of Notovich seems to me 
              quite stupid because in order to learn such monotheist doctrines Jesus had no 
              need whatsoever to travel to India or Nepal, because such beliefs were taught by 
              any local Rabbi in ancient Israel, so the story is not reliable not even at a 
              basic logical level, the whole things is deeply flawed and it is astonishing to 
              see how many people gives an air of respectability to this crap and new age 
              myths, I have seen some Buddhist here in Mexico who easily buy this utter non 
              sense of Jesus in India. Also, the story of Notovich about how he got this so 
              called testimony of the missing years of the life of Jesus, is intself full of 
              absurdities and errors, for example he claims that the translator of the Lama 
              who suposedly gave him this teachings said that the tex was part of the Tibetan 
              canon and that it was translated into Tibetan from Pali, which shows a gross 
              ignorance about Tibetan Buddhism since the Kangyur and the Tengyur were 
              translated from Sanskrit and not from Pali, so no genuine Tibetan Lama could 
              have said such thing, besides Notovich even went to the extreme to put this 
              words in the mouth of the Lama who supposedly taught him the story of the 
              missing years of Jesus:</span><br> <br><em><span style="font-size: medium;">“Issa 
              [Jesus] is a great prophet, one of the first after the twenty-two Buddhas. He is 
              greater than any one of all the Dalai Lamas, for he constitutes part of the 
              spirituality of our Lord. It is he who has enlightened you, who has brought back 
              within the pale of religion the souls of the frivolous, and who has allowed each 
              human being to distinguish between good and evil. His name and his acts are 
              recorded in our sacred writings. And in reading of his wondrous existence, 
              passed in the midst of an erring and wayward people, we weep at the horrible sin 
              of the pagans who, after having tortured him, put him to death.” 
              …</span></em><br> <br><span style="font-size: medium;">No wonder that when 
              the Abbot of the monastery of Hemis was asked about this he denied the whole 
              thing saying: " Lies, lies and more lies!!!", actually, as far as I know, the 
              only text of the Tibetan canon which mentions Jesus is the Kalachakra Tantra and 
              that within the context of the non buddhist teachers of the dharma of the 
              asuras, nowhere Jesus is called an enlightened being or higher than the Dalai 
              Lamas as Notovich claims.</span><br> <br><span style="font-size: medium;">I 
              think that there is no solid proof of any direct contact of Jesus with Buddhism 
              and much less about the presence of Jesus in India, this are new age myths. I do 
              realize that there are some common ethical values between Christianity and 
              Buddhism, despite of the obvious philosophical differences, but I think that 
              those are product of Indian spiritual influence in the Hellenestic mediterranean 
              world which was the cultural environment of Jesus, that is the historically 
              validated fact by the pillars of Ashoka writtten in both greek and aramaic and 
              many ancient greek scholars such as Plutarch, Megasthenes, Diogenes Laertius and 
              Clement of Alexandria which assert that the greeks learned form Indian 
              philosophies, thus this shared common values and virtuous elements are also 
              present in other Hellenistic systems such as Stoicism and Epicureanism for 
              example, and not only in Christianity, in that case it could be argued that the 
              influence on this systems was indirect and not an actual Dharma transmission as 
              Notovich wants us to believe. Besides there is a dangerous trend nowadays to 
              exagerate the similarities between different systems of beliefs or to try to 
              read other religions scriptures in such a way to claim that all are just saying 
              the same but with different words, but I think that acknowledging that there are 
              similiraties between two systems does not imply that they are the same, for 
              example there are many similarities between Buddhism and Jainism and yet they 
              are not the same thing, what to speak about Buddhism and Christianity!!!; the 
              case of Notovich monstruos and fraudulent distortion of Buddhism to make it fit 
              within his preconceived christian beliefs is a clear example of 
              this dishonest trend which has generated a lot of confusion about this issue and 
              there are many who are exploting this new age myths to dupe the gullible and 
              to make money at the cost of distorting Buddhism and selling lies to people, it 
              seems that the book of Notovich still sells pretty well in new age bookstores. I 
              just wanted to share my analysis about this topic with Your Holiness to seek 
              Your guidance and to know Your view about this Notovich 
              laughable hoax.</span><br> <br><span style="font-size: medium;">Alway at Your

For those who were cultivating good deeds and had been <span style="text-decoration: underline;">staying away as hermits,</span> they survived. For those who had survived the disasters and calamities, they realised their past mistakes and repented. Each began to cultivate good deeds and promoted to the society to carry out good deeds.

              <p>Nyorai, as it happens, I have spoken to Jaime before and he is someone who has some real meditative experience and realization.<br><br>The article that is written by Jaime was not originally intended to be posted in the discussion group. But he did it under the instructions of the guru to post it - the guru being Archaya Mahayogi Shridhar Rinpoche, who is obviously not just an intellectual scholar but a deeply enlightened master who had more than a decade long of retreat experience.<br><br>I think this sort of information and discussion is quite useful for reasons the guru said:<br><br><span style="font-family: arial black,sans-serif;"><em><strong>This kind of debate is as pratistha 
                      put it an alchemical melting pot from which we can all come out stronger and 
                      better off than before the debate if we learn from it. That is the purpose of 
                      debates in Buddhism - not to lambast others or become insensitive to others or 
                      criticize other religious systems ( which is a Tantric samaya breakage ) but 
                      1)to be aware of the fact that others feel differently about the same issue 2) 
                      to learn to clarify what one means by seeing how easily others don't see what 
                      you mean thus clarifying one's own view 3) to see how easily oneself or others 
                      can get confused by the misuse of one single word or sentence 4) to watch one's 
                      own ego in the whole process 5) and to make mistakes so that one can learn from 
                      it 6) to learn how others react when you put the same statement in different 
                      ways because as a bodhisatva one needs to know how to help open the eyes of 
                      others as far as one can  and many other things. But such debates should remain 
                      within an understanding and supportive group where people are allowed to make 
                      mistakes so that they can learn . Everybody who participated in this debate said 
                      something we can learn , which would have taken many many books and many more 
                      years of experience to learn and if each of you were mindful , you probably 
                      learned a lot about your own ego mechanism and sankaras/conditioning. In 
                      psychotherapy we say if it hurts , there's a shadow behind it you need to deal 
                      with. And debates expose a lot of shadows to to each person themselves. Never 
                      forget that a debate within a sangha is an alchemical process. We have no 
                      business otherwise to debate with non sangha members unless invited too. </strong></em></span></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Btw there's nothing wrong with pursuing intellectual understanding. It would be pure stupidity to reject the intellect - that would be throwing away a very useful tool that sets human apart from animals. Buddha never downplayed intellect in his teaching. Intellectual understanding is not the be-all and end-all of Buddhism but it would be silly to reject it.<br><br>Just like it would be silly to reject all the knowledge we gained on medicine, science, technology, etc that made the world advanced as it is today, with so much improvement to our quality of life, lifespan, etc. All these are products of the wonderful intellectual endeavors of humanity and even though intellect is limited it does not mean it should be tossed aside. Dissing the intellect would be akin to throwing out the tens of thousands of years of humanity's advancement in knowledge - we would be thrown back to the stone ages and become cavemen then. Without information, without intellect, we would still be living in the dark ages.<br><br>It would be even greater stupidity to remain "ignorant" in the guise of "being beyond intellect". We should always seek to learn and gain knowledge - be it intellectual or non-intellectual, to understand ourselves, others, and the world and for the benefit of everyone. And this is precisely why we go to school, to universities, and send our children to universities as well, and even after graduation we must continue to keep ourselves up to date with the advancement in human knowledge.<br><br>If this article is not posted, I'm sure there will still be future threads in this forum that talk about Jesus being a student of Buddha or any of such ignorant statements... this is disrespectful to Christians to say the least, and makes Buddhist look foolish, ignorant and making statements without basis or facts. Who would take Buddhism seriously then? How can Buddhism benefit people if people think our knowledge is false and superficial? In order not to make us look like fools and dummies in the eyes of others, it would be good that we keep ourselves in the know.<br><br>And anyway, I'm writing as someone who usually talks about his non-conceptual realization and experience (as written in my journal: <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2010/12/my-e-booke-journal.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2010/12/my-e-booke-journal.html</a>)... so it is not that I see intellectual understanding as most important in Buddhism, but it would simply be extreme and inappropriate to negate or reject intellect.</p></div>

              <p>yea, J learn from Buddha directly is too much, the most i heard is learn from his followers' follower or something. as 500(?) year later after Buddha, is still right dharma periodæ­£æ³•.  even if it were to came into likeness of dharma periodç›¸æ³•, the teaching are still alright compare to dharma endingæœ«æ³•. hmm, the "global knowledge energy" also arises the PL teaching during that period. sort of like the <em>Hundredth Monkey Theory</em>. ?</p>
