            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;">Templo Mision Budista: Taiwanese pride in Ecuador</span><br><span style="color: darkred;">By Erika Wang, The China Post, Feb 26, 2007</span><br><br><strong>Guayaquil, Ecuador</strong> -- Twelve years ago, the first Buddhist masters to visit the Catholic nation of Ecuador planned a short one-week stay. Fast forward to the present, and not only are they still living there, but will soon move into one of the largest Buddhist temples in South America.<br><br>Taiwanese Buddhist nuns Kuan-ting and Yi-ting had little idea they would ever take up residence in the Spanish-speaking country when they accepted the invitation to visit the small community of Taiwanese expatriates living there.<br><br>Neither had ever been to South America before they embarked on their two-day journey from Yuan Heng Temple in Kaohsiung City to Ecuador's coastal city of Guayaquil.<br><br>On the day before the end of their trip, their master Pu-miao asked them to stay, because "he felt there was a need to bring Buddhism to the country," explained Yi-ting. "My reaction was: 'how can expatriates live in this foreign environment?' I was very curious to find out. Could I be able to stay as well?'<br><br>Suddenly transplanted halfway around the world to an environment vastly different from their own, they found themselves in the same situation as many other expatriates before them, struggling to overcome the language barrier.<br><br>"We didn't know any Spanish. We didn't even know where to begin... One expatriate suggested we drink more Ecuadorian water, so that our tongues would become more flexible (to roll the Spanish 'r's) and speak the language," joked Kuan-ting.<br><br>Now they possess more than a good grasp of the language, though they are the last ones to admit it. "We are still learning Spanish every day," humbly added Yi-ting, who just moments before held a conversation with a couple of local vegetable vendors and even managed to haggle for a good price.<br><br>But unlike any expatriate to move to Ecuador before, their peculiar appearance -- shaved heads and Buddhist robes -- only added to the challenges in making their transition to a place where, to this day, just about any foreigner stands out.<br><br>As expected, many locals were taken aback by their presence at first, but in time, a growing number of them have grown accustomed to them, and have even joined their weekly prayer sessions. "Our neighbor used to come every day for about a month to pray with us when he was in between jobs," Yi-ting offered as an example.<br><br>Finding a suitable new home was no easy task either, but thanks to the help of the expatriate community, they were able to settle in a few months' time in a simple three-story residential house, which they renovated to accommodate an altar and prayer room on the top floor. Although their current home is regarded as a Buddhist temple, neither its facade nor the interiors have any of the architectural features typical of a Buddhist temple.<br><br>Soon that will change as they move into one of the largest Buddhist temples in all of Central and South America, comparable in size only to temples in Costa Rica, Argentina and Brazil, according to master Hsin-ting, who is temporarily living in Guayaquil to help oversee the project.<br><br>Perhaps their greatest endeavor yet, the Templo Mision Budista (Buddhist Mission Temple), is a 3,600-square-meter complex designed as a smaller version of the Yuan Heng Temple. The temple took over four and a half years to build --almost double the originally-expected construction time -- and cost between NT$100-200 million, which was entirely donated by locals, expatriates, and the Yuan Heng Temple in Taiwan.<br><br>"The main problems with the temple's construction were the lack of a unified design and the lack of available materials that had to be shipped in from Taiwan instead," according to Liu An-li, a Chinese expatriate and chief construction supervisor.<br><br>The main building, which has six floors with high ceilings, is the equivalent of 10 stories. The main hall alone is 30 meters tall. Side buildings have four floors with 18 rooms and can accommodate up to 300 people.<br><br>Its most noticeable feature, an arched red roof typical of Buddhist temples in Taiwan, can be seen from a distance, resting atop a sea of two-story buildings and making it a rare sight in Guayaquil's urban skyline.<br><br>Once completed, the new temple will offer a variety of classes and activities, including Chinese, etiquette, Buddhist prayers, vegetarian cooking, drawing, and morning exercises, among others. There is already much interest to sign up for the classes from locals and expatriates alike, explains Yi-ting.<br><br>When asked about the reason for building the temple in Ecuador, Kuan-ting candidly replied that it is merely a reflection of the support from the community, both local and expatriate, that feels the need to connect through Buddhism. "We do not actively preach the religion. We have grown in Ecuador solely through word-of-mouth."<br><br>Yi-ting agreed, and explained, surprisingly, that "a lot of Taiwanese expatriates start learning about the teachings of Buddhism and practicing the religion only after having migrated to another country."<br><br>Chen Tzu-cheng, who has lived in Ecuador for the past six years, is one such case. "I've only been learning about Buddhism and practicing the religion for the past four years."<br><br>"Buddhism has changed my view of life. It has made me more humble and more compassionate," he says.<br><br>The Buddhist Mission Temple of Guayaquil stands today as a symbol of the indefatigable spirit that has driven expatriates the world over not only to survive in the most inhospitable and foreign environments, but to thrive in them.<br><br>As for whether Yi-ting has been, in her earlier words, "able to stay," not only has her doubt been cleared, but she has now lived in Ecuador for the longest time of all the places she has lived in, even including her own childhood home, where she lived for only five and a half years.<br><br>For Lin Hsiu-chih, a temple committee member and native of Taiwan's southern county of Chiayi who has lived in Ecuador for the past 25 years, the temple is home.<br><br>"The temple is our pride and joy. To be able to have a piece of home in our adopted home of Ecuador is very comforting. It makes us feel less distant from our relatives back in Taiwan," Lin said.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;">Gangaramaya is Sri Lanka's pride</span><br><span style="color: darkred;">Asian Pacific Post, February 27 2007</span><br><strong>Colombo, Sri Lanka</strong> -- ColomboÂ’s biggest Buddhist temple, Gangaramaya, is a major tourist attraction due to its stunning interiors and history. One of its main draws is a relic bone said to belong to the Buddha.<br><br><img src="http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/picture/upload/gangaramaya1.jpg"><br><strong>Statue at Gangaramaya</strong><br><br>On the way to Gangaramaya, all tours stop at Beira Lake, ColomboÂ’s largest freshwater lake, which has on its shore a little temple that looks out of place in Sri Lanka. The beautifully proportioned temple with rows of Buddhist statues reflected in the calm water looks typically Thai. And so it is, for the building is a gift from BangkokÂ’s Buddhists.<br><br>This shrine is part of the famous Gangaramaya temple complex, which is just around the corner. Though it has a sprawling museum opened to the public, Gangaramaya is a functioning temple, so entering the premises requires the removal of shoes.<br><br>From the diverse architectural styles on display, it is at once obvious to the visitor that Gangaramaya has gone through various transformations over the years .<br><br>Many of the buildings look disconnected and different from each other, sharing only their common location.<br><br>There is a blue-roofed building that looks immaculately new while its stone edifice looks ancient. It turns out the blue temple is dedicated to Hindu deities andwas built with aid from Japan.<br><br>This may explain its faint resemblance to Shinto shrines. You will also recognise the Chinese and Thai influences in the other buildings, which readily indicate where the donations that go into building them come from. Gangaramaya started as a small hermitage on marshy land in 1890 before growing into a famous vihara (temple). Today, Gangaramaya is both a place of worship and a centre of learning.<br><br>Inside the complex, you will find several pagodas, classrooms, a huge bodhi tree planted from a sapling said to be from the tree that shielded Gautama Buddha during his epic meditation, museum, library, residential hall, and alms hall.  The star attraction, though, is the celebrated Relic Chamber where a crystal lotus holds what is said to be one of the BuddhaÂ’s bones.<br><br>Over the years, angaramayaÂ’s influence has spread so that it had a role in establishing many Buddhist temples overseas, including the Buddhist temple in Staten Island, the Buddhist Centre in New York, the Birmingham Buddhist Vihara in England, and the Buddhist Centre in Tanzania, Africa. Gangaramaya came to be in the 19th century when the Venerable Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Nayaka Thera (1827-1911) begun a Buddhist resurgence at a time when the religion was on the decline. He managed to establish a Buddhist school with just seven students.<br><br>From this humble beginning, Gangaramaya grew to what it has become today. Entering the main temple, one is astounded by the colour, artistry and craftsmanship of the myriad statues, which rise from the floor and appear at every level up to the ceiling.  Every available space is given over to sculptural depictions of the Buddha, his disciples and various deities in the Buddhist pantheon.<br><br>A golden, sitting Buddha occupies the middle of the hall, while a standing Buddha stares down benevolently from the right. Newborn babies are taken here and placed on a silver platter to be blessed by the Buddha and the monks. A huge mural depicts the Attaloka Dharma, or the Eight Vicissitudes of Life Â— gain and loss, good and bad repute, praise and censure, pain and pleasure.<br><br>February is now ColomboÂ’s biggest cultural event and attracts thousands of tourists. The Perahera in the hill resort of Kandy is more famous but that one happens in August. Just outside the main temple is Rajah, the chief elephant, which takes the lead during the Perahera procession. Tourists can have their photos taken with Rajah, as the mahout is on hand to handle the pachyderm and accept your cash contribution.<br><br>Nearby are the alms hall, education centre and library with its collection of scriptures handwritten on palm leaves. A little further away is the majestic Bodhi tree with sprawling branches, whose tips nearly touch the pagoda.<br><br>There is also, incongruously, a small car museum. The early 20th century printing presses within the temple complex also seem out of place, but they all form a part of the templeÂ’s history.<br><br>The Gangaramaya Museum, a must-see while here, is renowned for its valuable works of art, gigantic tusks, carvings, statues and gifts from penitents and those whose prayers were answered. Next door is the Relic Chamber. It is filled with Jataka paintings and golden statues donated from China, Thailand, Malaysia, Japan, Singapore and elsewhere. At the furthest end is a wondrously carved wooden cabinet in which you will find the holy of holies: a small bone from the historical Buddha.<br><br>Miraculously, this relic is said to occasionally reproduce itself so it can be taken elsewhere to help strengthen the faith! The relic is kept inside a crystal lotus. Fresh white jasmine flowers are sprinkled about to form a circle round the glass globe encasing the precious relic. Surrounding this precious relic are miniature stupas and Buddha statuettes studded with diamonds and rubies donated by worshippers.<br><br>Across the road from Gangaramaya are semi open-air shrines with various seated, multiarmed Kwan Yin statues. Alas, crows disrespectfully perch on the arms and, worse, soil them. For some inexplicable reason, there seems to be no attempt to clean the statues of the droppings.<br></div>

Laxman Mane, a nomadic tribal whose autobiography Upara (Outsider) is a celebrated work of Marathi Dalit literature, will preside as lakhs of his supporters from 42 nomadic tribes convert to Buddhism. Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama will perform the rites.<br><br>The Bombay High Court on Tuesday allowed the Royal Western India Turf Club to let the organisers hold the rally. A citizensÂ’ group, Public Concern for Governance Trust, had filed a petition in 2005 requesting the court to disallow such public functions at the racecourse.<br><br>The mass conversion, expected to be a social and political landmark, comes 51 years after Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar called on lower castes to abandon Hinduism and become Buddhists at a function to be held at the racecourse.<br><br>But he passed away before the event could be held.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s a small effort to realise AmbedkarÂ’s dream,Â” said Mane, who converted to Buddhism in Nagpur on October 2, 2006.<br><br>On May 27, Mane said, 1,000-odd nomadic families will be brought before the gathering Â— organisers say about 5 lakh people will attend in all Â— to lead the conversions. Over one lakh others will embrace the religion simultaneously.<br><br>Asked why he chose Buddhism, Mane (56) said tribals had been following Lord BuddhaÂ’s teachings without knowing it. Â“But now weÂ’ve realised that our practices are similar to BuddhismÂ’s,Â” he told HT. Mane refused to term the rally as an exercise in conversions. Â“We tribals never followed Hinduism, so thereÂ’s no question of relinquishing it,Â” he said.<br><br>Mane said the conversions were a protest against Â“government apathyÂ”. Â“Forget a decent standard of living, most of us donÂ’t even get shelter and food. Our literacy level is just 0.06 per cent,Â” he pointed out.<br><br></div>

She collects the water she uses for washing up and reuses it to flush the toilet, mop the floor or clean the bathroom.<br><br><img src="http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/picture/upload/m_4tsuzhi.jpg"><br><br><strong>Devoted: The Tzu Chi Buddhist Merit Society collects recyclable items at some 100 collection points around the Klang Valley on the third Sunday of every month.</strong><br><br>At her stall in Taman Megah, the vegetarian food seller reuses the water used to wash rice grains to clean utensils and cutleries. She gives larger portions to customers if they bring their own containers. She also collects rainwater for other purposes.<br><br>That has been 53-year-old Tang Shook LinÂ’s way of life for more than 10 years.<br><br>However, she said she is only one of the many thousands of Tzu Chi Buddhist Merit Society members who are practising that every day. They do not just do that among themselves and their families. They spread the word aggressively through workshops and seminars, in a bid to rescue the Â“aged and ailingÂ” planet earth.<br><br>Collecting recyclable items has become a custom since the society first preached and practised environmental conservation in 1992 in Malaysia.<br><br>Day in and day out, they salvage recyclable items from their households and surrounding areas. They include the aged, ill and disabled, who were helped by members of the society and now want to be Â“someone who gives rather than takesÂ”.<br><br>This group of people includes former leprosy patients in Sungai Buloh. Moved by Tzu Chi membersÂ’ compassion and perseverance, they started recycling so that they, too, could help the needy and contribute to environmental conservation.<br><br>The number of ex-patients has dropped from 400 about a decade ago to about 100 now, but the amount of their collection is now so much that it takes two lorries to ferry the items every month.<br><br>The society collects recyclable items at some 100 collection points around the Klang Valley on the third Sunday of every month.<br><br>About 1,500 volunteers are involved in the task, which requires them to separate the items according to various categories and send them to specific destinations to be sold. Money collected is channelled to charity.<br><br>Â“I remember once I sorted out more than 10 bags of waste papers into the seven paper categories. I bent my back from 10am to 3pm to do that, it hurt so much. The papers were then sold and we received quite a good sum. I was so happy! We could use the money to help needy persons; my backache was not an issue anymore,Â” recalled Tang.<br><br>On top of all that, Tzu Chi members practise the Â“five approaches to recyclingÂ” suggested by society founder Rev Cheng Yen, who is a Taiwan-based Buddhist nun.<br><br>Â“Reverend encourages us to infuse recycling into daily life, family, soul, the younger groups, and at the same time gain knowledge pertaining environmental conservation,Â” said another recycling volunteer, businessman Chong Wei Seng, 41.<br><br>Chong said Tzu Chi members use what they call the Â“Three Treasures of RecyclingÂ”, which is a cloth bag containing chopsticks, a bowl with cover and a water container, to cut down on the use of plastic bags and Styrofoam containers.<br><br>They car pool or take public transport to minimise the production of carbon monoxide. They bring handkerchief so that they do not need tissue paper, which Â“killsÂ” trees.<br><br>He added: Â“One should also recycle spiritually by cutting down yearnings, don't take too much when you can't use them all, don't just seek convenience at the expense of wasting natural resources.Â”<br><br>Talks and workshops on the subject have been held regularly at housing estates.<br></div>
