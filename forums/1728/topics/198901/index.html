Auspicious, excellent and pure, this powerful divine Mantra is able to eradicate sufferings of all evil paths.<br><br>During the Tang dynasty in the years of Yi Feng (676-678 AD), the edition of this Dharani translated by Buddhapala was circulated to all Buddhist monasteries in China. Cultivators who upheld It were numerous.<br><br>From a very young age, I had already been upholding and reciting It. In the first year of Yong Tai (765 AD), after the death of my wife, I became even more sincere and vigorous in my cultivation and practice, seeking the Way to transcend the world of Samsara. Then there was a palace official called Jiang Xing, who also constantly upheld and chanted this divine Mantra. One day, he came to visit me in my private quarters and told me very happily, "I have now found the ultimate Way (Supreme Way) which is extremely difficult to encounter!"<br><br>I sincerely and respectfully asked how this was so, and it turned out that he had obtained a complete version of the Usnisa Vijaya Dharani Mantra.

If we made a point of praising Akshobhya's Pure Land in the east, you would wonder why we were emphasizing the eastern direction, and go on and on with your specious reasoning.<br><br>* Question: Why not make the whole universe the focal point instead of Amitabha's Pure Land?<br><br>Answer: There are three reasons. We focus on Amitabha's Pure Land because this makes it easy for beginners to develop the Bodhi Mind, because Amitabha's fundamental vows are most powerful, and because Amitabha has a special affinity with the sentient beings in our world....</strong><br><br></div>
