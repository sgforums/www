              Very briefly:
              
              The naturally clear mind is much better than the unclear mind, the semi-clear mind and the intermittently clear mind.
              The awake mind is much better than the less awake mind.
              The timeless mind is much better than the mind caught in the illusion of time.
              The mind without any artificial boundary is much better than the artificially bound mind.
              The mind that knows there is no mind is much better than the mind that believes there is one.
              The directly perceiving mind is much better than the mind that filters things through though and the sense that there is attention.
              The mind that knows there is no perceiver is much better than the mind that believes it is perceiving.
              The mind that is stainless is much better than the mind that is stained.
              The mind that is the same as bare phenomena much better than the mind that is the same as bare phenomena but doesn't know it.
              The mind that is without extraneous noise is better than the noisy mind.
              The mind for which all the world arises effortlessly, naturally, lawfully, causally, this is much better than the mind that pretends it is creating effort, creating thought, creating anything.
              That fluxing, shimmering field of bare experience that occurs on its own, knows itself directly where it is, as it is, is totally ephemeral, totally fresh, totally natural: this is so much better than the world perceived some other way.
              In that mode: there is nothing to want anything.
              In that mode: there is nothing to know anything.
              In that mode: there is nothing to do anything.
              And yet, wanting occurs, as there is an animal that has needs from an ordinary point of view, which is still a valid point of view, but this wanting is just a natural part of the field.
              There are preferences, but they are just causality functioning, shimmering, fluxing, doing what it does and always has done.
              There is knowledge, but nothing that knows it beyond the shimmering, dancing, flickering little tingling bursts that make up knowledge.
              
              This is vastly, immeasurably better than the other ways of perceiving reality. To prefer something less is madness. ;)
