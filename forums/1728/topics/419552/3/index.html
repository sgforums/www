              <p>One of the more difficult to grasp, is the concept of illusory
              self. Even you don't seem to get it, even though you've labelled
              yourself as a Buddhist.  The moment you've drawn a line,
              you've created a division between you and others.</p>
              <p>Everyone is slightly different from each other, we pick and
              become aware at a different point. Even if both of us study the
              same sutra, under the same teacher, our awareness and perception
              comes out differently.</p>
              <p>I've read from somewhere that Mahayana teachings is like a
              spider(?)web, it is cast very wide in order to "catch"  us
               in the fold of Buddhism. Such is the wisdom!</p>

But the least, we shouldn't use wai dao books as entry and foundation to Buddhism! We should use conventional entry level Buddhist books and sutra. Is that too much to ask? Isn't it MCK out of line when he introduce wai dao books as entry to Buddhism? No? No rule, no line to be drawn, anyhow humtum also can? How about using Enid Blyton children books, or African folklore books as entry to Buddhism?? He is out of line! I am pretty open minded myself. Its just that I find that introducing wai dao books as entry and foundation to Buddhism baffling and mindboggling to me.</p>

              <p>At certain point recently, I find MCK sect and MCK, find them something's wrong. So I go think about it, research on those criticism on MCK, and I come up with my conclusion that something is in fact wrong, off with MCK. And I voice out my concern here.

              authority to be good. when they are good, the peasants welfare will
              also be good. like the case of Mr Hu Xiao Lin, studing under MCK,
              as a boss, he take good care of his employee. His first
              prority is the welfare and happiness of his employee, productivity
              is last. this kind of boss, i also want to work under him. there
              are also many benevolent Kings in the past.</p>
              <p>the more people did not practice the way their teachings are
              suppose to represent the more MCK and us want to help make them
              understand the teachings better.</p>

              <p>Different religion has got different morality. Caste system is moral for the Hindu. But is it moral from Buddhism point of view? Killing people of different faith is okay, said the Koran. Its moral. Its good conduct. But is it moral and good conduct from Buddhism point of view? God punish people by flooding killing people in the Old Testament. Is that good, is that moral? I think MCK and MCK sect is not being straight thinking in this aspect.</p>
              <p>The example u gave, its when the authority, the boss, also believe in taking care of the people, and that works. But what if the authority doesn't believe in taking care of people, but abusing them?? Under Confucianism, how would one deal? If I totally buy into Confucianism, and obey a abusive boss, who only believe in exploit the employee and abusing them, then how? In Confucianism world view, it didn't say, screw the boss, just resign. Confucianism stress on being loyal. So I die die must stick to that abusive boss? U see the problem with confucianism? Its a flaw set of philosophy and teaching. So why advocate a flaw set of teaching as entry and foundation to Buddhism??</p>

              <p>think there are proper channel or procedure if one really think a Buddhist is wrong. perhaps one can approach the Buddhist authority or something, see if they approve of one's view.  or talk to the person personally in private. but i don't think it's right to put up a bashing website with vulgarity and sarcasm like that of the messager. what happen to our own Buddhist's foundation of 10 wholesome deeds å��å–„ä¸š of avoiding slandering, harsh language, frivolous speech?</p>

              <p>hmm..did the messager himself practice what the Foundation of Buddhism him/herself? i wouldn't listen to such a hypocritical person preaching "good" stuff? his/her own conduct no good, u think what come out can be good? somemore want us to be like him/her? something not rational de.</p>
              <p>that say not until u reached the state of an Arhat, don't even trust ur own view. Buddha did mentioned of view that can be upside-down. what's right, they think wrong, what's wrong, they think is right.</p>

              <p>i shared a story in the past regarding this whole, almost exactly similar issue. think even now, people still have the issue and disbelieve, due to the level of understanding.</p>
              <p>the story is about the origin of the nodding rock <strong>ç‚¹å¤´çŸ³’. </strong></p>
              <p class="MsoPlainText" style="text-indent: 24pt;"><a href="http://www.shijian.org/wenku/books2/1079.htm"></a></p>
              <p>During the time when the Mahaparinarvana sutra was only been translated first half of the potion, Ven Zhu Dao Sheng, presented a Buddhist saying that not only does sentient beings have Buddha nature, plants and minerals also have such nature. Ven Zhu Dao Sheng understanding is actually in the advance state. This is his idea of Oneness. All is One and One is all. However all the buddhists of the world said he is Waidao(Externatism), like here. As long as they are not said by Buddha or just leave a word away from sutra, they are all "Waidao" and that one's saying is mara saying. really just relying on words to see the meaning, Buddha of the three period of time also felt grievance.</p>
              <p>Zhu Dao Sheng felt unjustify and no way to vent his grievance. so he went to a mountain site in Su Zhou province, and start presenting to a rock. After the presentation, he asked the rock if he's right. Suddenly the rock nodded. Zhu Dao Sheng is right.</p>
              <p>if one have a chance, one can go to Su Zhou province to see the nodding rock. this story is for us to show respect not just to sentient beings but also to non sentient beings.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">"Confucianism stresses the need for mental and
                  physical cultivation. Above all, it is concerned with a great political ideal. It is
                  common, down to earth, takes human affairs seriously and pays honour to rationality. All
                  these are principal elements in the culture of China. I agreed with their philosophies and
                  even praised them, but <strong>they were unable to fill in the emptiness in my unsettled heart</strong>.
                  Others thought that I had become more pragmatic, but the fact is that I experienced an
                  increasing emptiness.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span><span style="font-size: x-small;">Now that I reflect on it, <strong>I find that this
                  experience was due to the fact that Confucianism gives little emphasis to religion. </strong>To the
                  ordinary people, the practices of Confucianism seem common, and down to earth. <strong>The
                  establishment of one’s virtue, merit, and teachings solely for this life cannot be
                  constructed into an imposing and glorious blueprint for living. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Such a plan is lacking in
                  foresight. It cannot bring people into a state where their minds and hearts are at
                  peace</span></strong>(i.e. a state in which they are unmoved by gain or loss, suffering or joy, life or
                  death) and in this state stride forward along the path of glory." ---- from Selected Translation of Miao Yun by Venerable Yin Shun </span></p>

              <p>Er... actually what is the exact definition of wai dao...?</p>
              <p>Usually buddhist temples have variety of wholesome activities
                  like taiji, classical music, etc etc</p>
              <p>A buddhist library i went have many -zi books, like meng zi,
                  zhuang zi, etc</p>
              <p>3 Kingdoms also have (lol)</p>
              <p>so many "wai dao" thingy</p>
              <p>I think it shows the humble and flexible part of Buddhism, isn't
                  it?</p>

              <p>There's a difference. Those Buddhist temple have taiji, classical music course, but they didn't say, one
                   gotta learn taiji and classical music before practice Buddhist meditation, or 
                  learning Buddhism. Nor the library advocate people to go read romance of
                   three kingdom, Zhuang Zi as entry level material to Buddhism. In the case of MJK issue, he is proposing Di Zi Gui as <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ENTRY AND FOUNDATION TO BUDDHISM</strong></span>. That is a great difference.</p>
