              <p>I suggest that if you don't like Master Chin Kong's talk, you
                                                      can always listen to other master's talk but don't defame any Ven.
                                                      I know many people take refuge after listening to his talks, so he
                                                      is not an ordinary person.  He is someone with great credits
                                                      because many people take refuge because of him. So, don't discredit
                                                      yourself by criticizing him. I agree that there are many bogus
                                                      monks nowadays but Master Chin Kong is definitely not one of
                                                      them.</p>
              <p>Whether his talk is right or wrong, let the listeners decide. We
                                                      Buddhists must stay united, don't defame any one of us
                                                      unless that person is doing harm to Buddhism. I don't
                                                      see people stay away from Buddhism after listening to his
                                                      talks, instead many people take 3 refuges after listening to his

              <p>Its not about whether I like his message or not. To be frank, I really like his message initially. Hey, I am a Chinese, and I do feel sense of pride in Chinese culture too. He talk about how the Chinese cutlure has got so much wisdom and all the good stuff, which modern people especially the Westerners dont know about it. I like that kind of message too. I really do. I have Dao De Jing, Zhuang Zi, ç¬‘å‚²æ±Ÿæ¹–, etc, on my bookshelf too. But the thing is, his position, he's a Dharma Master. His duty is not Chinese culture, his duty is not ambassador for Chinese history and culture. His duty is towards Buddhism, and mankind ä¼—ç”Ÿ. He should be ambassador, teacher of BuddhaDharma, not Christianity, not Taoism, not Islam, not Confucism, not the wai dao. 'cause wai dao are imperfect, 'cause he's a Buddhist and a Dharma Master.</p>
              <p>Given a choice, I rather not doing this. Because my energy and strength is limited. But I bor bian! I chance upon it, its karma, and I have to play it out, follow my conscience and karma. I cant just walk away and pretend all is well when I realize the misleading, and danger of Jing Kong Dharma Master teachings.</p>
              <p>People take refuge because him Jing Kong Dharma Master, thats another matter. If people go take refuge, and believe in every word Jing Kong Dharma Master said, thats not good news, thats really really bad news. 'cause some of Jing Kong Dharma Master message are really dangerous. And those teachings, those messages (e.g. Dun go see doc or take medicine when fall sick, just chant AMTFï¼ŒBible is also part of Buddhist Canon, etc) could hurt one's æ³•èº«æ…§å‘½ã€‚I feel oblige to sound off the alarm, thats all.</p>

              <p>If I didn't understand wrongly, this is what the passage is actually trying to say.</p>
              <p>"Many of Chin Kung's followers like to say that his contradictory statements were often said due to particular needs of the audience at a particular point in time.  But in fact, Chin Kung himself acknowledges and espouses the use of modern recording and broadcasting technology to preserve Dharma talks.  He further states that, "what is said today, can still be heard at least some 200 years later; hence the need to be responsible with what one says and does today." Herein, according to Chin Kung's detractors, lies the inherent contradiction in his ideas and actions."</p>

              <p>yea, i read them, they still look like "external" stuff, plain bashing, and upsidedown. doesn't concur with the real essence of Dharma to me. the message only see the external stuff of Buddhism than the essence of dharma. external stuff in other word mean waidao; å¿ƒå¤–æ±‚æ³• or they called it upsidedowné¢ å€’æ˜¯é�ž. Dharma should stress more on actualityé‡�å®žè´¨ than on appearance/label ä¸�é‡�å½¢å¼�. only a person who's <strong>é‚ª</strong> see things as <strong>é‚ª</strong> <strong>.</strong> <br>        <br>        they are still pretty much taking words out of context. if MCK is wrong then many other masters (like Zen master <span style="color: #5d5ebc;">Hyon Gak Sunim</span> ) also wrong for saying bible stuff. <br>        <br>        btw many people/spirits are rebirth in pureland because of him, and u say the teaching dangerous?  the messager got such credit in helping people rebirth into pureland? to me the messager is the one that is misleading with it's limited understanding. the messager to me is the one that's a mara in disguise. he/she is the one using subjective potion and blowing it out big. <br>        <br>        and strangely, what's reading Dao De Jing, Zhuang Zi, ç¬‘å‚²æ±Ÿæ¹– got to do with his teaching of rebirth in pureland by reciting Amituofo and other pureland teachings. i listen so many years, and i read them, but my faith in pureland and Amitabha is not a tiny bit affected. as they are also taught nicely by MCK. to me, i won't be bother with the "messager" allegations, since they are incomplete anyway. æ³•æ— å®šæ³•ã€�å®šæ³•é�žæ³•ã€‚</p>

              <p>If I didn't understand wrongly, this is what the passage is
                  actually trying to say.</p>
              <p>"Many of Chin Kung's followers like to say that his
                  contradictory statements were often said due to particular needs of
                  the audience at a particular point in time.  But in fact, Chin
                  Kung himself acknowledges and espouses the use of modern recording
                  and broadcasting technology to preserve Dharma talks.  He
                  further states that, "what is said today, can still be heard at
                  least some 200 years later; hence the need to be responsible with
                  what one says and does today." Herein, according to Chin Kung's
                  detractors, lies the inherent contradiction in his ideas and
                  actions."</p>

              <p>Thanks for your translation,  it really helps when one is able to put into context!</p>
              <p> <span style="font-family: arial; line-height: normal; font-size: small;">That said, unfortunately, one still have address different people with different outlook and world views differently.  Those that could learn and benefit would agree, and be at peace,while those with tunnel  vision will see differently.  </span></p>

You have been duped by the person behind the scene who is out to slander MCK. This guy is taking everything out of context just to achieve his motive.</p>
              <p>I had watched a video on youtube which I believe was filmed by the same person to slander MCK. Give me sometime to search for it again and I shall pm you. I was almost duped by him till I found out that he took things out of context.</p>

I am saying he had mixed up his position as a Dharma Master with ambassador for Chinese culture too. But Dao De Jing, Zhuang Zi, Di Zi Gui, and wat not Chinese books are not part of Buddhism! He got confuse with his role! Di Zi Gui and Tai Shang Gan Yin Pian are not Buddhism! And yet, he introduce it as entry and foundation to Buddhism! Which shows his mind is muddled as a Dharma Master!</p>

              <p>There was one part which showed MCK praised Jesus and said we are all God's children. This guy behind the scene questioned why MCK praised Jesus instead of Goddess of Mercy. I was a bit disppointed too.</p>
              <p>Later, I found out that MCK's talk was in a church as he was invited to a church. MCK said we are all children of God.

              <p>Its not about whether I like his message or not. To be frank, I really like his message initially. Hey, I am a Chinese, and I do feel sense of pride in Chinese culture too. He talk about how the Chinese cutlure has got so much wisdom and all the good stuff, which modern people especially the Westerners dont know about it. I like that kind of message too. I really do. I have Dao De Jing, Zhuang Zi, ç¬‘å‚²æ±Ÿæ¹–, etc, on my bookshelf too. But the thing is, his position, he's a Dharma Master. His duty is not Chinese culture, his duty is not ambassador for Chinese history and culture. His duty is towards Buddhism, and mankind ä¼—ç”Ÿ. He should be ambassador, teacher of BuddhaDharma, not Christianity, not Taoism, not Islam, not Confucism, not the wai dao. 'cause wai dao are imperfect, 'cause he's a Buddhist and a Dharma Master.</p>

              <p>MCK once said the reason why Buddhism was so widespread compared to Christianity which was spread to China at almost the same time was because Buddhism was able to relate to Chinese value (Confucius values etc).</p>
              <p>MCK also said inorder for Buddhism to spread to western countries, temples in western countries need to be built like western buildings and Buddha must have the look of "angmo" . Just like in Thailand, Buddhas look like Thai and in China, Buddhas look like Chinese. Sounds logical to me, I understand that the mosques in China look like Chinese temples though I've not seen.</p>

              <p>last night, i see u as a bodhisattva. recently been beseeching Buddha/bodhisattvas to help solve the bad habit. they use some other "technique" plus this debate make the mind occupied instead of wandering about. sort of remind me of Tibetan/Varjayana practice where 2 person debating each other while clapping the hand. i'll be taking note on this skillful technique in future, to help others.

              <p>that mean if a person, previously is a Christian, for example, live a good moral life, than later on, he want to rebirth in pureland or learn Mahayana teaching. then his progress will be much faster than normal people that lack morality.  foundation, does not stand for no more higher Mahayana learning afterward per se. they still need to learn somemore. not just stop there.</p>
              <p>moreover, as the <a href="/users/90144">bohiruci</a> mentioned these are below 10% of his vast teaching. more than 90% are detail explaination of many Buddha sutras in detail, stanza by stanza. slowly as one learn, the realisation will get to his highest state of Onenessæ³•æ³•åœ†èž�. like Amitayus48 is trying to say.</p>

              <p>When MCK advocates on Di Zhi Gui for example, he is advocating the importance of being morally upright, being virtuous; to do good and avoid evil.  These teachings bring harmony and goodness to the society. How can this be against Buddhism? Furthermore, If you read and listen more of his talks, you will see that he teaches about the Dharma - just as Law of Karma, Four Noble Truth, Noble Eightfold Path, Great Compassion etc and many many more. When he said Bible is Tripitaka. Did he teaches that there is a creator ? Did he teach that there is a self and we exist independently? Did he teach that we must believe in a creator ? No he didn't. So he is not saying that Bible is Tripitaka................. so he is not teaching wrong stuffs.....</p>

              <p>Morality in Confucianism, Daoism, Christianity, is not the same as morality in Buddhism.</p>
              <p>For example. George Bush. He's a Christian. But he had caused lots of lives taken by waging war with Iraq. From some Christians point of view, he's a good guy. But from Buddhism point of view... Whats morally upright and good for wai dao such as Christian and Muslim, might not be consider morally upright and good for Buddhism.</p>
              <p>Same with Confucianism. It's morality is different from morality in Buddhism. Confucianism, there's a underlying emphasis in respecting and obeying the authority. Like I said before, there are times we have to challenge the authority, such as some corrupt government or political leader, or some inhuman government such as Nazi government, or abusive parents, husband, boss, etc. Respecting and obeying the authority shouldn't be the emphasis. Emphasis should be on goodness, such as having compassionate heart and behavior.</p>
              <p>By using wai dao books as entry and foundation to Buddhism, MCK he's creating unnecessary problem from my point of view. 'cause those wai dao morality has got some problem, and flaws in it. Why not go straight and use Buddhist books/ sutras as entry and foundation to Buddhism instead since wai dao books and teachings are flawed? Is it because of attachment to some wai dao teachings and books?</p>
              <p>I had pretty much state my piece. If u guys still dun get it, then, its beyond my capacity for now. My priority is to practice Buddhism. I can only spend so much time on telling u guys, something's wrong with MCK.</p>

              <p>George Bush has done the wrong things because he has the wrong views, views of self righteousness, clinging to dogma, thinking he is doing god's word. He is not a good christian , he only think he is. </p>
              <p>The most important  lesson a christian can learn is love and forgiveness, how many vocally visible christians you've seen practising that?!! Not much, because if one have the expansiveness of love, and generosity of forgiveness, there is really nothing much to say; just practising what one preaches!   </p>
              <p>The problem in any beliefs or religion is clinging to dogma, only able to see one views as correct and other's false without investigation. </p>
              <p>Your outlook reminds me of the monk Fa Hai(?) in the story Madam White Snake .</p>
              <p>Practising Buddhism is about letting go........ </p>
              <p>What is morality,who or what does morality pertains to? What is an universally acceptable upright conduct?</p>
              <p>Maybe someone would post something on it!</p>
              <p>All teachings, at sometime or another, have been abused, used as mandate to rule and abused over others. When interpretation of doctrine becomes rigid, it becomes dogma, blind faith and enforcement, it happens.</p>
              <p>Do you know, when the son of heaven loses that mandate to rule, he can be removed according to confucianism!</p>

              <p>One of the more difficult to grasp, is the concept of illusory self. Even you don't seem to get it, even though you've labelled yourself as a Buddhist.  The moment you've drawn a line, you've created a division between you and others.</p>
              <p>Everyone is slightly different from each other, we pick and become aware at a different point. Even if both of us study the same sutra, under the same teacher, our awareness and perception comes out differently.</p>
              <p>I've read from somewhere that Mahayana teachings is like a spider(?)web, it is cast very wide in order to "catch"  us  in the fold of Buddhism. Such is the wisdom!</p>
