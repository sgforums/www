Awareness, on the other hand, cuts through the illusion of a separate identity. It exposes the lie of ego: that it exists as a reality. Love melts ego away, while awareness is like turning on the light and seeing that there is nobody there.</span> The outcome is the same in both cases, but the flavor of the path is different. One is more emotional, the other more insightful. The vocabularies of the two paths differ as a result. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The path of love seeks union with the Beloved, while the path of awareness seeks the seeing of naked Reality.</span> Just as prayer is the central practice in the path of love, meditation is the central practice in the path of awareness...

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Note: this is Ironside's own writings in the Christian forum (Eternal Hope), I pasted here for sharing purposes regarding Christianity's practise for readers' better understanding</strong><br><br>It is my prayer that this will be a blessing to Christians here in this forum. Those people who have Christ indwelling them through His Holy Spirit by trusting in Christ alone for salvation.<br><br><strong>  Living the Christ Life </strong><br><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br><br>About five hundred years ago, the doctrine of justification by faith alone was recovered. Thanks to a man named Martin Luther. We are much indebted to the ReformerÂ’s recovery of this essential truth of the Bible.<br><br>However, no one man or one group of people for that matter in the Church of God has cornered all the truth. Many preachers and teachers after the Reformation rightly taught that justification is by faith alone and not through the Law. What is sad and lamentable however, is that these same preachers taught that sanctification is through the Law. They would have us go to Mt. Calvary for justification and Mt. Sinai for sanctification.<br><br>They say: Justification is by faith alone in Christ alone but sanctification is through the Law. This teaching never gets beyond Romans chapter 4 to the identification truths of Romans chapter six and the Liberty of the Spirit in Romans chapter 8, thereby causing many a Christian to flounder and live under a frustrating Romans 7 life.<br><br>However, the Bible clearly delineates that a Christian is not under Law but under grace, that a Christian died to the Law and is married now to a higher Â“LawÂ”: Christ Himself. So, actually, Christ is not only the ChristianÂ’s justification, He is also the ChristianÂ’s sanctification.<br><strong><br><br>Today, we are going to learn from the Apostle Paul as to how to live the Christian life:</strong><br><br><strong>Our text is Galatians 2:20:</strong><br><br>Ga 2:20 "I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.Â”<br><br>In this text of Scripture, we see three things; we see here that Paul always reckons his <strong>a)</strong> position with Christ, he was always conscious of the <strong>b)</strong> presence of the indwelling Christ in him and lastly we see PaulÂ’s <strong>c)</strong> heart posture Â– he always relied on Christ.<br><br><strong>I. The ChristianÂ’s position with Christ: </strong> Â“I have been crucified with Christ; It is no longer I who liveÂ”<br><br>In the Bible, there are positional truths and there are also truths that pertain to our condition. Truths that refer to our Standing and truths that refer to our State. Positional truths refer to our standing in the eyes of God. Truths that refer to the ChristianÂ’s condition on the other hand refers to our State, our condition as we see ourselves here on earth. Positional truths are unchangeable, they are permanent, they are static. However, our condition or state fluctuates, at least in this side of glory. God would have us match our condition with what we are in position.<br><br>Before any single Israelite reached the Promise Land, God had already declared victory and ownership of that Land in advance to the Israelites. The Promise Land was theirs by position before any of them arrived there. Their unbelief did not change that fact. Positionally, the Promise Land was theirs already. In actual condition, they were still in the desert. What they must do is make that position real in their actual experience by going into the Land and possess it. God commanded them to drive the inhabitants of that land. God commanded them to make their condition match their position.<br><br>Paul, here in verse 20a was stating a positional truth: Â“I have been crucified with Christ, it is no longer I who live.Â” The old unsaved Paul with its old corrupt habits and ways was crucified with Christ. The cross ended the reign of PaulÂ’s old self positionally. It was the end of what he was in Adam. And as far as Paul was concerned, Paul reckons that old self as dead positionally.<br><br>God did not transform our old unsaved selves. No, He crucified it. He nailed it to the cross with Christ. God does not expect anything from our old unsaved selves. We donÂ’t expect anything from a dead man.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Note: this is Ironside's own writings in the Christian forum (Eternal Hope), I pasted here for sharing purposes regarding Christianity's practise for readers' better understanding</strong><br><br><strong>II. </strong> After Paul, stated his position with Christ, Paul then proceeds to state the secret of living the Christian life; <strong>Christ Himself---His indwelling presence in us:</strong><br><br>Ga 2:20 "I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, <strong>but Christ lives in me;</strong>.....Â”<br><br>The Â“meÂ” here is the new man in the risen Christ. When Christ was crucified, everything we are connected with the old creation, everything we are connected with Adam was crucified with Him and all these things have passed away positionally. When Christ resurrected we also resurrected with Him positionally to a new creation. The Â“meÂ” here and the Â“IÂ” in verse 20d refers to who we are in the risen Christ. However, the dynamic of the new man is the indwelling Christ.<br><br>It is a noticeable fact that in the area of salvation God has been setting us aside from the start. Instead of us dying for our sins, Christ died in our stead. In the same way, in the area of living the Christian life, instead of us living the Christ life, Christ lives His life through us. And that is just right because only Christ can live His life. None of us can live the Christ life in the same way I cannot live your life and you cannot live mine. The only one who can live your life is you. The only one who can live my life is me. The only one who can live Christ's life is CHRIST. Now that is a problem for we are not Christ and we have to live the Christ life, but that problem is solved when we realize that Christ lives <strong>IN</strong> us. What we must do then is to let Christ live His life in and through us. Yield!!!!<br><br>Yes, Christ is our life. He is not only our Lord, He is also our Life. Colossians 3:4 clearly states it:<br><br>Col 3:4 When Christ who is <strong>our Life </strong> is revealed, then you also will be revealed with Him in glory<br><br>Philippians 1:21: For to me to live is ChristÂ…..<br><br>In the original, there is no linking verb Â“isÂ” here. So Paul was actually saying: Â“For to me to live, Christ, and to die, gain.<br><br>What we are to do is let Christ live His life through us. Just like what Paul did. Second Corinthians 4:11 :Â”For we who live are always being delivered to death for Jesus' sake, <strong>so that the life of Jesus might also be manifested in our body. Â“</strong><br><br>God took care of my sins by Christ dying for me on the cross. He also took care of what I am in Adam by crucifying me with Christ. And now God will deliver me from the power of sin by Christ living in me. Romans chapter 5 verse 10 says:<br><br>Ro 5:10 For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be <strong>saved by His life.</strong> &lt;----that is His life IN us.<br><br>You have trouble loving someone? Let Christ love him through you. You have trouble with your temper? You are going to fail every time if you let your old self control it for you. Our old self just canÂ’t do it. It is incorrigibly bad and wicked. God does not expect anything good from it. He nailed it to the cross. And we are to reckon it as such. It was not changed. The secret is an exchanged life. <strong>Â“I am crucified with Christ, it is no longer I who live but Christ.Â”</strong><br><br><strong>III.</strong> Now, lest we think that we are not going to do anything and just sit back in sinful passivity, Paul proceeds to tell us the only logical thing to do after stating that his old self was crucified with Christ on the cross positionally and that Christ now lives in him: <strong>The only logical thing to do is to Rely on the indwelling Christ.</strong><br><br>Ga 2:20 "I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; <strong>and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God</strong>, who loved me and gave Himself for me.Â”<br><br>Our old sinful self has been positionally taken out of the way by God crucifying us with Christ and now Christ lives in us. Nevertheless, we are not going to be passive about it, rather we are to depend on Christ continually. Faith is always active never passive. In my Bible I have it written in the front page as to how to depend on the indwelling Christ. This is a quote from Major Ian Thomas:<br><br>Â“Relate everything, moment by moment, as it arises to the adequacy of what He is in you, and assume that His adequacy will be operative.Â”<br><br><strong>To recap:</strong> to live the Christian life We are to reckon our position that we have been crucified with Christ and raised up with Him, recognize that the indwelling Christ is our life and that relying on Him is our portion. These are the platform truths on which the injunctions and directives of the New Testament stand.</div>

Jesus answered him, <strong>"Very truly, I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God without being born again."</strong> Nicodemus said to him, "How can anyone be born after having grown old? Can one enter a second time into the mother's womb and be born?"
