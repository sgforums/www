              <p style="margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>Bangkok,
                  Thailand</span></strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '> -- Many in
                  the Thai state, clergy, and mainstream population are in a tizzy over one woman
                  named Dhammananda. As a Bhikkuni, a Theravada Buddhist nun, she’s raised
                  hackles for much of the past decade by attempting to reestablish the Bhikkuni
                  lineage in Thailand.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Although these nuns exist elsewhere in the world, Thai
                  Buddhists have denied women’s ability to take the same monastic vows as men for
                  ages. This spiritual embargo is just one egregious example of the ways in which
                  Buddhism, theoretically an egalitarian faith, gets bogged down in a mire of
                  misogyny and cultural mores from region to region, failing to live up to its
                  noblest values. But Dhammananda, who was ordained in Sri Lanka by more
                  woman-positive Theravada monks in 2003, now operates an all-nun temple a couple
                  of hours outside of Bangkok and helps to ordain other women. She is, in
                  Thailand, the avatar of an emergent Buddhist feminism, using the logic and
                  tools of her faith to push for equal spiritual rights and access for women in
                  her nation and beyond.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">While Buddhist history is full of Bhikkunis and other prominent
                  women, and Buddhist theology can even be used to break down gender as a
                  construct, it’s worth acknowledging that there’s plenty in the faith’s
                  scriptures that can be weaponized in the name of patriarchal control. Stories
                  abound of the Buddha urging women to be doting wives and Buddhist nuns exist
                  separate from and under very different rules than monks. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Apologists explain
                  away these disturbing blips as pragmatic artifacts of the Buddha’s era - a
                  radical religious ideology making accommodations for its own existence within a
                  rigid social structure. Some just see these old stories as irrelevant. They say
                  Buddhism is a means by which women and other marginalized peoples can
                  potentially construct a new identity or gain a new status defined by faith and
                  spiritual merit rather than gender or birth. But regardless of the theoretical
                  potential of abstract Buddhism, the fact remains that it’s pretty easy to use
                  the faith as a tool in the perpetuation of a misogynistic society.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">Thai society is a particularly egregious example of hijacking
                  religion in the name of a pro-male status quo. Becoming a Bhikku (a male monk)
                  brings great social status and material rewards for men, but in Thai Buddhism,
                  women are limited to the role of Mae Chi—essentially the spiritually, socially,
                  and materially inferior handmaidens of monks. The Thai Buddhist clergy have
                  gone so far as to suggest that Bhikkunis never truly existed, that women cannot
                  attain equal spiritual status as men, and that, as good Buddhists, women in
                  abusive relationships should accept their fate as karma. And variations on this
                  unfortunate dynamic play out all over the world, as in Western Buddhist circles
                  where a trickle of sex scandals continually reminds people of the potential
                  abuse and coercion male spiritual leaders of any faith can wield over devotees.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">But rather than turn away from Buddhism, many women have embraced
                  the egalitarian ideals of the faith as tools to undermine patriarchic
                  societies. Thai Bhikkunis write beautifully about taking their vows because
                  they saw faith as a source of progress rather than traditionalism. This kind of
                  Buddhist feminism has taken root far beyond Thailand as well, especially in
                  places like America and Europe where many of the early disciples of Buddhist
                  teachers and leaders were women. Unsettled by misogynistic undertones and
                  passages in Buddhist history, society, and literature, these young Buddhist
                  communities have sought to gender-neutralize liturgies, recover female Buddhist
                  history and icons from the mists of time, and set up collaborative
                  organizations, helping other women across the world gain religious access and
                  education traditionally denied to them. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Bhikkunis like Dhammananda and their allies have inspired a flowering
                  of female leadership and engagement in Buddhism the world over. These Buddhist
                  feminists, whether by bucking norms or by engaging in meaningful theological
                  dialogue with their male peers, are opening up ever more space for women to
                  participate in and enjoy the social and spiritual fruits of Buddhism.
                  Hopefully, if they continue on their current track, they may be able to finally
                  align Buddhism’s rough reality with its idealistic egalitarian promise.</span></p>
