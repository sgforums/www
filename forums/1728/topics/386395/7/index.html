              <p>gravity still works even if you are an actor, right?. So
                      shouldn't Karma be present even in a dream? Karma is not created,
                      influenced or limited by human thoughts and feelings, time and
                      space right?</p>
              <p>What is a dream? What defines a dream? We can be talking about
                      dreams we have while we are asleep or the abstract sense of the
                      word.</p>
              <p>So if I killed someone, do I tell myself I'm merely dreaming and
                      I can 'wake up' without having to bear any negative
                      consequences?</p>
              <p>I feel the fear of having killed someone, I also feel the
                      excitement. So do I tell myself that the feelings of fear and
                      excitement aren't 'real' as I further remind myself I'm merely
                      having a dream of feeling fearful and excited after killing someone
                      in a dream?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>i'll just take the definition of a dream as in our dreaming in
                      normal sleep. during the dreaming, our experience tells us that the
                      dream "I" believes 100% in "my" own dream existence and the environment
                      in the dream. the dream "I" behave as if "I" am living a normal life
                      doing whatever activities that "I'm" supposed to do depending on the
                      dream content.  the dream "I" do not question a single bit about
                      whether that experience itself is a dream or real.  only upon waking up
                      and in retrospect of reviewing the dream, is it possible to realize
                      that the dream "I" is not really existent in waking moments, but yet
                      not non-existent either since it is experienced as 100% real during the
                      dream.  spiritual liberation may be somewhat like that kind of
                      realization, but obviously not exactly the same.  if you don't
                      understand what i'm blabbering about its ok, coz its just my own
                      conceptual interpretation.  may be total gibberish for someone else.</p>
              <p>karma is a profoundly big topic, i'll leave it to the more
                      learned ones to explain it more completely. but my humble opinion is
                      that one aspect of karma is in its manifestation of our instinctive
                      tendency or propensity.  so yes, the dream itself is the manifestation
                      of our karmic propensity.  usually, how you behave in your dream (as in
                      your character traits, emotions, instincts..etc) would not be very
                      different from your behavior in real life. but since dreaming happens
                      only in our mind consciousness, with all our physical senses(eyes, ear, nose, tongue, body) in dormant during sleep, law of physics obviously works different in our dream (able to fly, no sense of concreteness.. etc).</p>
              <p>if
                      "I" kill someone, obviously "I" have to bear all karmic consequences. 
                      from buddhist liberation perspective, "I" cannot wake up from the dream
                      because "I" created the dream. "I" cannot achieve enlightenment because
                      "I" is the source of all sufferings.  the karmic mechanism fulfills the
                      wishes of "I" by creating this human existence and all those baggages
                      that comes with it. </p>
              <p>reading up on the following teachings will
                      help you a long way to better appreciate buddhist teachings and
                      philosophy.</p>

              <p>Can you give me real-life examples, as current as possible, on
              "misdirected compassion"?</p>
              <p>If we were to follow the above guideline, some would learn
              something different. Some kill people and get away with it by doing
              things to cover up or give a twisted interpretation of whatever
              evidence unearthed by the authorities.</p>
              <p>The first time I kill, I get away with it. The second time too.
              When I do get caught, the most is just decades of jail, death or
              life imprisonment. What consequences do I need to fear for myself
              or consider for everyone?</p>
              <p>How do we know when we have become obsessive in the above
              practice to examine the consequences of our actions?</p>

              <p>Any kind of crime is misdirected compassion. Finding happiness by robbing, killing, having affairs, using drugs, all kinds of stuff.</p>
              <p>There is no need to go into specifics of the karmic cause and effect, except to know what is right and wrong and avoid doing unwholesome things that could harm ourselves and others, being aware that there is wholesome and unwholesome karmic consequences as a result.</p>

              <p>If Nirvana cannot be characterised, how do we know it is a
                  reality? Wouldn't samsara be the more real reality? What do you
                  mean by samsara being a relative world? The above is quite deep for
                  me.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Just realised you had more questions in the 'Show' section which I didn't see earlier.</p>
              <p>Samsara means the relative world of experience. Nirvana isn't something you experience separate from yourself, therefore it is the opposite of a dualistic experience which is to split up our experience into a 'me' experiencing a world made up of a collection of objects interacting in time and space. In non-dual experience there is just the pure experience of whatever is appearing without separating into a perceiver and perceived, subject and object. You do not objectivize what you experienced.</p>
              <p>As for Madhyamika, the reason why say Nirvana cannot be charactized is because all things are empty. Madhyamika teachings emphasize on emptiness. Everything is already empty without characteristic. (see Heart Sutra) And Nirvana is the realisation of this.</p>
              <p>For example, if we were to observe a red flower that is so vivid, clear and right
                   in front us, the “redness” only appears to “belong” to the flower, it 
                  is in actuality not so. Vision of red does not arise in all animal 
                  species (dogs cannot perceive colours) nor is the “redness” an inherent 
                  attribute of the mind. If given a “quantum eyesight” to look into the 
                  atomic structure, there is similarly no attribute “redness” anywhere 
                  found, only almost complete space/void with no perceivable shapes and 
                  forms. Whatever appearances are dependently arisen, and hence is empty 
                  of any inherent existence or fixed attributes, shapes, form, or 
                  “redness” -- merely luminous yet empty, mere appearances without 
                  inherent/objective existence.</p>

              <p>The tough part is in knowing clearing when to accept that one's
              bad karma is really strong. For some, paralysis within 1-2 weeks
              can be considered strong bad karma. But if one gets cured like your
              Taiwanese teachr, then you would think you might be foolish for
              thinking it is strong bad karma.</p>
              <p>So the paradox or irony (correct my vocaubulary if you like) is,
              if it's really bad, you can't avoid suffering. And you can never
              know whether this unavoidable certain amount of suffering is
              actually the original, full amount of suffering that ripens for
              your bad karma.</p>
              <p>So you can console yourself either foolishly that my karma has
              been reduced, but without insight knowledge of the actual, full
              impact of your bad karma, how do you compare and know whether your
              effects and duration of your strong bad karma has been reduced?</p>
              <p>Only the Buddha and his Arhat disciples can make an accurate and
              non-biased comparison as to the extent of their suffering for any
              ripened or soon-to-ripen strong bad karma.</p>
              <p>Then it is quite sad that this sutta is not widely published and
              distributed enough to beginner Buddhists through temples or
              affliliated organisations. Since this sutta is so precise, detailed
              and clearly beneficial even within short time span, then more talks
              should be held not only to promote awareness, but to clear doubts
              and help plant seeds of motivation for serious practice among
              Buddhists. I mean such a good sutta should not only be confined to
              meditation classes in temples or any Buddhist organisation.</p>

              <p>In Buddhism, there is the saying that practitioners can avert bad karma by having bad karmic consequences become only small karmic consequences, and there are many examples in the Buddhist scriptures. They are able to dissolve the karma easily. For example he often gets sick or goes to the hospital because he is always taking up the karma of his students (and he has thousands of students), and was able to heal many of them even of terminal illnesses. But he will have some effects as a result, though he is able to dissolve them through his practice. However the healing can only take place if the other party is also sincerely practicing the dharma. Otherwise he will not help them.</p>

              <p>In Buddhism, there is the saying that practitioners can avert bad karma by having bad karmic consequences become only small karmic consequences, and there are many examples in the Buddhist scriptures. They are able to dissolve the karma easily. For example he often gets sick or goes to the hospital because he is always taking up the karma of his students (and he has thousands of students), and was able to heal many of them even of terminal illnesses. But he will have some effects as a result, though he is able to dissolve them through his practice. However the healing can only take place if the other party is also sincerely practicing the dharma. Otherwise he will not help them.</p>

              <p>You will not be able to eliminate all bad karma, only lighten them. Even the Buddha experience the effects of his bad karma though to a lesser extent.</p>
              <p>As for healing, even though Buddha certainly has the powers to heal people, he may have chosen not to use them. These kind of healing is not exactly rare, I heard other masters do it. BTW my Taiwanese teacher is not my master. My master passed away over a decade ago. My Taiwanese teacher is his dharma successor. Both of them healed many people before including terminal illness people.</p>
              <p>BTW, Master Sheng Yen (who also happens to be my Master's dharma brother) said the reason Jesus had to die such a terrible death is precisely because he was using his powers to heal people (as shown in many of his stories). My Taiwanese teacher was well aware of the possibility that his death will not be so good because of his taking up the bad karma of others, but he always said, I will only die once in this life, so whatever happens that's fine.</p>

              <p>everything that a person say and do are brought about by the intepretation of all conditions surrounding the person as well as the perception of the conditions with relation to 'me', bringing about a neverending interplay of conditions which are again perceived by the person with relation to 'me'. this creates an ongoing sequence of events which may or may not be linked directly.</p>
              <p>the conditions that arises with birth (karma) then sets off a new chain reaction which is interconnected with those conditions that arise from the surroundings. reflecting deeper its just one big vibration thats going on and on.</p>
              <p>miracles do happen, and its systematic, never by chance.</p>
              <p>of cos dun take it from me, its probably some delusions that im having :D</p>

This is sort of like a dog’s tail chasing itself. Pain and pleasure, suffering and satisfaction always seem to be “over there.” Thus, when pleasant sensations arise, there is a constant, compassionate, deluded attempt to get over there to the other side of the imagined split. This is fundamental attraction. You would think that we would just stop imagining there is a split, but somehow that is not what happens. We keep perpetuating the sense of a split even as we try to bridge it, and so we suffer. When unpleasant sensations arise, there is an attempt to get away from over there, to widen the imagined split. This will never work, because it doesn’t actually exist, but the way we hold our minds as we try to get away from that side is painful. When boring or unpleasant sensations arise, there is the attempt to tune out all together and forget the whole thing, to try to pretend that the sensations on the other side of the split are not there. This is fundamental ignorance and it perpetuates the process, as it is by ignoring aspects of our sensate reality that the illusion of a split is created in the first place.</em></div>

              <p>The compassion to end suffering is misdirected when we imagine a split between the subject and the object, in which the object must either be get hold of by the subject or gotten rid of by the subject. This gap between subject and object is what is painful. But somehow the person imagines that to remove the gap one must 'get over there' or 'away from over there', in other words the subject must manipulate the objective pole in order to end suffering. But this dualistic relationship is merely fabricated and is what is causing the suffering in the first place. This is the meaning of the 'three poisons'.</p>
              <p>Stabbing someone is also a result of a subject and object split, the compassion is in trying to end the suffering he is experiencing (for example he thinks that the other person is the cause of his suffering), but misdirected because he is creating suffering for himself by imagining there is this subject and object split, and that the subjective pole must manipulate the objective pole.</p>

              <p>Perhaps, but the good karma comes in the form of meeting someone wise and experienced. Otherwise, absent of an enlightened master who can heal and guide the person on the right path, there is no way diseases such as those can 'miraculously heal'. The practitioner must also sincerely practice the dharma himself, of course.</p>

                  <p>Misdisdirected compassion, has two components, original intent and course of action:-</p>
                  <p>Few examples:-</p>
                  <p>Small boy sees fish in fishtank, see fishfood, says fish is hungry, proceeds to empty the contents into fishtank.</p>
                  <p>Proponent argues for pro life, good, abortion, bad,kills life. Put up protest, escalates to killings abortion doctor!</p>
                  <p>The lost generation of Australia, forcible schooling Native Americans, denial to speak native language, customs, forced to learn the "western ways and gods" as they are godless savages. Bad in modern context, acceptable,back then, acceptable, maybe noble.</p>
                  <p>Democracy and western values(Christianity?) is good, proceeds to send troops to a sovereign country in a"crusade".</p>
                  <p>Allah, Creator of the world is good,Islam is good, the rest is infidels, immoral, decadent. Proceeds to send suicide bombers, in a"Holy jihad", proceeds to up everybody to bits, being a Muslim is no immunity either!</p>
                  <p>Everybody starts with the noblest intentions!  </p>
              
              So if a person choose to practise compassion, it should from the point of selflessness, in chanting and visualisation practice, one would visualise uponthe breath intake, drawing all the bad karma, with emanation of rays of good karma to all illuminate and liberate all sentients beings.

              <p>The compassion to end suffering is misdirected when we imagine a
              split between the subject and the object, in which the object must
              either be get hold of by the subject or gotten rid of by the
              subject. This gap between subject and object is what is painful.
              But somehow the person imagines that to remove the gap one must
              'get over there' or 'away from over there', in other words the
              subject must manipulate the objective pole in order to end
              suffering. But this dualistic relationship is merely fabricated and
              is what is causing the suffering in the first place. This is the
              meaning of the 'three poisons'.</p>
              <p>Stabbing someone is also a result of a subject and object split,
              the compassion is in trying to end the suffering he is experiencing
              (for example he thinks that the other person is the cause of his
              suffering), but misdirected because he is creating suffering for
              himself by imagining there is this subject and object split, and
              that the subjective pole must manipulate the objective pole.</p>

              <p>The explanation you gave for the stabbing example assumes that the doer is suffering. But he could be enjoying the act of killing, without thinking that the other person is the cause of his suffering.</p>

              <p>Misdisdirected compassion, has two components, original intent
              and course of action:-</p>
              <p>Few examples:-</p>
              <p>Small boy sees fish in fishtank, see fishfood, says fish is
              hungry, proceeds to empty the contents into fishtank.</p>
              <p>Proponent argues for pro life, good, abortion, bad,kills life.
              Put up protest, escalates to killings abortion doctor!</p>
              <p>The lost generation of Australia, forcible schooling Native
              Americans, denial to speak native language, customs, forced to
              learn the "western ways and gods" as they are godless savages. Bad
              in modern context, acceptable,back then, acceptable, maybe
              noble.</p>
              <p>Democracy and western values(Christianity?) is good, proceeds to
              send troops to a sovereign country in a"crusade".</p>
              <p>Allah, Creator of the world is good,Islam is good, the rest is
              infidels, immoral, decadent. Proceeds to send suicide bombers, in
              a"Holy jihad", proceeds to up everybody to bits, being a Muslim is
              no immunity either!</p>
              <p>Everybody starts with the noblest intentions!  </p>
              <p>So if a person choose to practise compassion, it should from the
              point of selflessness, in chanting and visualisation practice, one
              would visualise uponthe breath intake, drawing all the bad karma,
              with emanation of rays of good karma to all illuminate and liberate
              all sentients beings.</p>

              <p>I beg to differ that everybody starts with the noblest intentions. But I thank you for giving those examples.</p>
              <p>The problem is that everybody would want to think they have started from the point of selflessness, and is therefore practising compassion.</p>

              <p>There a sensation of pain registered by the mind and mental
                      anguish</p>
              <p>Also physical pain can be blocked, by the adrenalin rush in
                      times of danger, also a person goes into shock with extreme
                      trauma,eg. broken bones.</p>
              <p>A martial artist can block pain using chi, the blood withdraws
                      from peripheral into the core, leaving the skin with a cold clammy
                      sensation. The pain will  return later, unfortunately, same
                      with spiritual possessions with mediums and "shen da" spiritual
                      kungfu. Chi can also be to speed up healing.</p>
              <p>Illnessis also called dis-ease, manifested as discomfort. The
                      difference is how one react to discomfort, some will moan and
                      groan"I want to die already". We instinctively give words of
                      comfort although it will not cure the ailment, we comfort to make
                      the person feel and deal with the discomfort better.</p>
              <p>The physical pain never goes, but mental agitation is
                      lessen.</p>
              <p>Ever missed or skipped a meal even though you are hungry, if
                      preoccupied, hunger pangs usually goes away after a while. In an
                      affluent world, we are usually not starving, yes, we feel do
                      hungry, but is usually the overreaction to hunger, the gorging
                       of food. Constant craving is usually symptomatic of something
                      else!</p>

              <p>If we are preoccupied, hunger pangs do usually go away after a while. However how long can we continue to keep ourselves preoccupied without having to feel hungry again?</p>
              <p>Example, people who are usually preoccupied will find that after some time, hunger does not trouble them, but in the long term they may develop gastric pains.</p>
              <p>So using mental training to suppress hunger or pain isn't practical?</p>
