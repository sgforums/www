              <p><strong>The human mind is delusional in nature. You need to verify and validate your assumptions.</strong></p>

              <p>Hi Friend, I invite you to my other posting  "Incredible Sightings" to see whether chanting is for real. These sightings usually happen after big chanting events. I take it as response to our chanting from Buddha. No debate please, just invite you to have a look.</p>
              <p>Just to share with you these phrases about chanting :</p>
              <p>ä½›æ³•æ˜¯å¿ƒæ³•ï¼Œå¦‚æžœä¸€ä¸ªä½›å¼Ÿå­�ä¸�ä¿®å¿ƒï¼Œå–Šç ´å–‰å’™é¢‚ç»�ä¹Ÿæž‰ç„¶ã€‚</p>
              <p>Buddhism is about practising. It is pointless for a Buddhist to chant without putting into practice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>é¢‚ç»�æ˜¯é¢‚ç»™è‡ªå·±å�¬çš„ï¼Œä¸�æ˜¯é¢‚ç»™ä½›è�©è�¨å�¬çš„ã€‚ç»�æ˜¯ä½›è�©è�¨è®²çš„ï¼Œä¸�éœ€è¦�æˆ‘ä»¬é¢‚ç»�ç»™ä½›è�©è�¨å�¬ã€‚</p>
              <p>Chanting is for one to listen and learn. Not for Buddha to listen because the sutra are the words from Buddha. There is no need to chant for Buddha to listen.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Pardon me if my actions do not tally with what I quoted above because I have just heard these phrases. According to the venerable  who told me these, it takes years to put into practice.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>Well, I am not the recipient any chanting as I am not dead, for that matter, neither are you.</p>
              <p>Therefore, in order to  have conclusive proof that "Chanting benefits the dead", I have to be both dead and receiving chanting, which assuredly,I am not. However, you also cannot conclusively substantiate your disbelief without first being dead, secondly receiving chants.</p>

              <p>Chanting to the dead, benefit ourself, arousing kindness. Why do we bother to chant for our relatives, because we have deep attachment and love for them, I am speaking about ordinary people now, and by chanting, the kindness is very easily aroused . Once  familiarised, development loving kindness and compassion for others can be easier developed.</p>
              <p>We must not only develop loving kindness and compassion, but also helpful ability. </p>

              <p>Hi Friend, I invite you to my other posting  "Incredible
              Sightings" to see whether chanting is for real. These
              sightings usually happen after big chanting events. I take it as
              response to our chanting from Buddha. No debate please, just invite
              you to have a look.</p>
              <p>Just to share with you these phrases about chanting :</p>
              <p>ä½›æ³•æ˜¯å¿ƒæ³•ï¼Œå¦‚æžœä¸€ä¸ªä½›å¼Ÿå­�ä¸�ä¿®å¿ƒï¼Œå–Šç ´å–‰å’™é¢‚ç»�ä¹Ÿæž‰ç„¶ã€‚</p>
              <p>Buddhism is about practising. It is pointless for a Buddhist to
              chant without putting into practice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>é¢‚ç»�æ˜¯é¢‚ç»™è‡ªå·±å�¬çš„ï¼Œä¸�æ˜¯é¢‚ç»™ä½›è�©è�¨å�¬çš„ã€‚ç»�æ˜¯ä½›è�©è�¨è®²çš„ï¼Œä¸�éœ€è¦�æˆ‘ä»¬é¢‚ç»�ç»™ä½›è�©è�¨å�¬ã€‚</p>
              <p>Chanting is for one to listen and learn. Not for Buddha to
              listen because the sutra are the words from Buddha. There is no
              need to chant for Buddha to listen.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Pardon me if my actions do not tally with what I quoted above
              because I have just heard these phrases. According to the
              venerable  who told me these, it takes years to put into
              practice.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p><strong>1. It must be objective</strong></p>
              <p><strong>That is to say it must be verified independently. That means it must be verified outside your mind, outside what you think, outside of the subject matter.</strong></p>

              <p><strong>3. It must be logical.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Logic is hard to explain in a few lines and most people have wrong ideas what logic is.</strong></p>
              <p><strong><br></strong></p>

              <p><strong>If you believe in buddhist doctrine of karma, you really think you can escape the consequences selling delusions to other people even if you strongly believe in the delusions you are selling?</strong></p>

              <p>I am too shallow, so no need to take my words seriously.</p>
              <p>Yes.  I think some Buddhists entertains the idea that their superstitious ways and rules is the correct way of buddhism.</p>
              <p>But most of us have to cling to a certain routine or a certain aspect of buddhism (the buddhism they think is true, real or the correct way), since we all are not maybe as enlightened as Buddha.</p>
              <p>And yes.....I think most of us is delusional.  Because in the eyes of people who are skeptical. </p>
              <p>I think all of us is delusional to certain aspect.  And it will take Buddhha or God's power of the will to be englightened and 'saved' as they are, which is obvious that us mortal men here discussing this topic, have not achieved.</p>
              <p>I believe in honour, self discipline and giving oneself.  Respect for those who give theirs....be it for life, meat or whatever reason.</p>
              <p>Without those disciplines..... we do not respect the world that God, Buddha is hoping to achieve for us.</p>
