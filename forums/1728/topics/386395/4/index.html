              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Although I'm technically a Buddhist (gone through the 3 refuges
              ceremony), I still ask questions like the above, both towards
              myself and others.  I have no clear and irrefutable answers to
              offer to any fellow human asking similar questions. I can only
              share my thoughts and feelings from periodic self-reflections, with
              anyone who are sincere and open-minded about listening to such kind
              of sharing.</p>
              <p>So far only what the Kalama Sutta has taught is able to help me
              to move on with the clear sense of direction and understanding that
              anything we hear or see, we should take them as reference sources,
              never definitive. To remind myself constantly to develop a
              discerning, not discriminating mind to investigate and understand
              as thoroughly as possible, any concept or truths within us and
              around us.</p>
              <p>I treat the guidelines recorded in the Kalama Sutta as sayings
              by a wise human; which means whether anyone accords the title of
              Buddha or the label of sutta to those sayings is quite immaterial
              to me.</p>
              <p> And from the above replies so far, it seems probably you
              have realised something. Only you can convince and understand for
              yourself what is real and what is delusional in the ways in which
              some or maybe most people practise or understand Buddhist
              teachings.</p>
              <p>Keep on investigating and analysing with an open mind and heart.
              At the same time, reflect on the feelings of frustration caused to
              yourself and to others (as observed from the replies), knowingly or
              not, that comes in from asking such questions to the Buddhist
              community at large.</p>
              <p>I now refrain from asking such questions online or towards
              fellow Buddhists. They will merely answer you with answers that
              point to one word 'Practice'.  Is chanting  or meditation
              'practice'? One really has to so-called trial and error, be willing
              to conduct countless life-long experiments, observations on various
              known approaches and think about new ones by using established
              viewpoints and concepts as good reference materials, with utmost
              perseverance and open-mindedness.</p>
              <p>The historical Buddha is no longer with us. It is widely
              recognised as an irrefutable fact that only a sammasamBuddha (our
              historial Buddha, Sakyamuni Buddha) can teach difficult to grasp
              concepts or any kind of universal truth <strong>perfectly</strong>,
              by taking into full account the subtle and innate intellectual and
              spiritual capacities of each living being, and their karmic
              affinities with certain Dharma teachings - cultivated or have not
              yet been cultivated throughout countless rebirths.</p>
              <p>Not even an Arahant (<a title="wiki on Arahant" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arahant_%28Buddhism%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arahant_%28Buddhism%29</a>)
              can be considered a perfect teacher.</p>
              <p>So take heart in the above. You are not alone in asking such
              questions. People like us can only continue to search for our own
              answers, with guidelines from the Kalama Sutta as our lamp, our
              light.</p>

You have realised that everyone practises religion according to their understanding, most adhere to the moral code of their belief as a matter social coherence. Do no wrong, and for most part, you can carry on with your life. You must realised that you carry a different awareness, to people whom you asked questions.</p>
              <p>Questions are contextual, in order for you to answer, you must relate in order make sense of it. </p>

              <p>Actually it is not that the world is literally an illusion, but LIKE an illusion... there's an important difference between these two and although it might be a little off topic, I thought it is important to clarify the Buddhist view, and distinguish it from other non-Buddhist teachings.</p>
              <p>The following excerpts is from a very enlightened yogi and teacher (he had attended more than a decade of meditation retreat and was given the titled 'Mahayogi Rinpoche' by his guru) and I have posted it in my blog on Thusness's suggestion.

              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica; font-size: 100%;"><br>...So
                                   in the Buddhist paradigm, it is not only not necessary to have an 
                                  eternal ground for liberation, but in fact the belief in such a ground 
                                  itself is part of the dynamics of ignorance. We move here to another to 
                                  major difference within the two paradigms. In Hinduism liberation occurs
                                   when this illusory Samsara is completely relinquished and it vanishes; 
                                  what remains is the eternal Brahma, which is the same as liberation. 
                                  Since the thesis is that Samsara is merely an illusion, when it vanishes
                                   through knowledge, if there were no eternal Brahma remaining, it would 
                                  be a disaster. So in the Hindu paradigm (or according to Buddhism all 
                                  paradigms based on ignorance), an eternal unchanging, independent, 
                                  really existing substratum (Skt. mahavastu) is a necessity for 
                                  liberation, else one would fall into nihilism. But since the Buddhist 
                                  paradigm is totally different, the question posed by Hindu scholars: 
                                  “How can there be liberation if a Brahma does not remain after the 
                                  illusory Samsara vanishes in Gyana?” is a non question with no relevance
                                   in the Buddhist paradigm and its Enlightenment or Nirvana.<br><br>First
                                   of all, to the Buddha and Nagarjuna, Samsara is not an illusion but 
                                  like an illusion. There is a quantum leap in the meaning of these two 
                                  statements. Secondly, because it is only ‘like an illusion’ i.e. 
                                  interdependently arisen like all illusions, it does not and cannot 
                                  vanish, so Nirvana is not when Samsara vanishes like mist and the Brahma
                                   arises like the sun out of the mist but rather when seeing that the 
                                  true nature of Samsara is itself Nirvana. So whereas Brahma and Samsara 
                                  are two different entities, one real and the other unreal, one existing 
                                  and the other non-existing, Samsara and Nirvana in Buddhism are one and 
                                  not two. Nirvana is the nature of Samsara or in Nagarjuna’s words 
                                  shunyata is the nature of Samsara. It is the realization of the nature 
                                  of Samsara as empty which cuts at the very root of ignorance and results
                                   in knowledge not of another thing beyond Samsara but of the way Samsara
                                   itself actually exists (Skt. vastusthiti), knowledge of Tathata (as 
                                  it-is-ness) the Yathabhuta (as it really is) of Samsara itself. It is 
                                  this knowledge that liberates from wrong conceptual experience of 
                                  Samsara to the unconditioned experience of Samsara itself. That is what 
                                  is meant by the indivisibility of Samsara and Nirvana (Skt. Samsara 
                                  nirvana abhinnata, Tib: Khor de yer me). The mind being Samsara in the 
                                  context of DzogChen, Mahamudra and Anuttara Tantra. Samsara would be 
                                  substituted by dualistic mind. The Hindu paradigm is world denying, 
                                  affirming the Brahma. The Buddhist paradigm does not deny the world; it 
                                  only rectifies our wrong vision (Skt. mithya drsti) of the world. It 
                                  does not give a dream beyond or separate transcendence from Samsara. 
                                  Because such a dream is part of the dynamics of ignorance, to present 
                                  such a dream would be only to perpetuate ignorance.<br><br>To Buddhism, 
                                  any system or paradigm which propagates such an unproven and improvable 
                                  dream as an eternal substance or ultimate reality, be it Hinduism or any
                                   other ‘ism’, is propagating spiritual materialism and not true 
                                  spirituality. To Hinduism such a Brahma is the summum bonum of its 
                                  search goal, the peak of the Hindu thesis. The Hindu paradigm would 
                                  collapse without it. Since Buddhism denies thus, it cannot be said 
                                  honestly that the Buddha merely meant to reform Hinduism. As I have 
                                  said, it is a totally different paradigm. Hinduism, Christianity, Islam,
                                   Jainism are all variations of the same paradigm. So truly speaking, you
                                   could speak of them as reformations of each other. But Buddhism has a 
                                  totally different paradigm from any of these, not merely from Vedic- 
                                  Hinduism...</span></p>

              <p><br>I do not want you to have
                   knowledge regarding who is right or wrong and all those comments and 
                  challenges made to other religions and traditions. I never want you to 
                  get into that. I am only interested in opening up your wisdom of what is
                   the truth of Awareness and directly point to it. Read stage 6 and my 
                  comments. All the points are inside but it is difficult to see. Reality 
                  is like an illusion, but not an illusion. It is like a dream, but not a 
                  dream. Everything is a magical display. And everything is mind. :)<br><br>What
                   does that mean? The mind is always wrongly understood, from "I AM" to 
                  non-dual experience. We cannot understand the truth of this mind 
                  therefore we can't see mind. Just like u can't see the essence of the 
                  article. We have a pre-conception.<br><br>Everything is mind. And 
                  Everything is like a magical display. That is why I said there is no 
                  mirror, there is only reflection. The key is to know the nature of mind.
                   To see that everything is reflection, transcience. Everything is Mind 
                  is what that must be derived from anatta (the truth of no-self) and 
                  emptiness (dependent origination). But we do not know what "everything" 
                  is and what mind is. Therefore we cannot 'see' and cannot experience. We
                   cannot see the essence of it. So anatta and emptiness are taught.<br><br>What
                   is Everything? It is like magical display, like an illusion. But it is 
                  not an illusion. Like a dream but not a dream, which many misunderstood.
                   Therefore when we experience sounds, thoughts, see colors, forms, 
                  dimension and shapes... all is empty. Like an illusion. Like dreams. 
                  Like the 'redness' of a flower. Like the 'selfness'. Like the 
                  'hereness'. Like the 'nowness'. Yet empty, nothing real.<br><br>If you 
                  can't totally see that pristineness, that non-dual, that luminosity, and
                   see only emptiness, you are mistaken. The 'redness', the 'nowness', the
                   'hardness', the coldness, all are as luminous, as clear, as vivid, we 
                  must fully experience it. Yet they are not real, nothing concrete, no 
                  solidity, nothing substantial, nothing graspable, no findable, empty, 
                  thus non-dual luminosity and emptiness. We see this union, in all 
                  transcience, passing phenomena. In emotions, in feelings, in thoughts, 
                  in sounds, in sight, in color, in dimension, in shapes, in taste, in 
                  hardness, coldness, in sweetness, in sky, in the sound of chirping bird,
                   all experience are like that, empty yet luminous. Then we realise that 
                  it is the same as mind. It is mind. If we don't see these 2 nature of 
                  mind thoroughly, we can't see, we distant, we seek, we find. Because of 
                  its emptiness nature, the manifold, we cannot know what mind is. 
                  Therefore the ground is taught, the view is taught - empty yet non-dual 
                  luminosity, so that you can see and experience directly that the 
                  transience are mind, yet there is no self nature. Then you experience 
                  what is one taste. We do not know what mind is, we cannot experience 
                  mind. We do not know. That is why insight is important. However if you 
                  do not know what is non-dual luminosity and emptiness, how is a 
                  practitioner going to experience mind everywhere and know that whatever 
                  arises is mind? Therefore first anatta (non-dual luminosity), then 
                  emptiness, then spontaneous arising.</p>

              which is the same as liberation. Since the thesis is that Samsara
              is merely an illusion, when it vanishes through knowledge, if there
              were no eternal Brahma remaining, it would be a disaster. So in the
              Hindu paradigm (or according to Buddhism all paradigms based on
              ignorance), an eternal unchanging, independent, really existing
              substratum (Skt. mahavastu) is a necessity for liberation, else one
              would fall into nihilism. But since the Buddhist paradigm is
              totally different, the question posed by Hindu scholars: “How can
              there be liberation if a Brahma does not remain after the illusory
              Samsara vanishes in Gyana?” is a non question with no relevance in
              the Buddhist paradigm and its Enlightenment or Nirvana.<br> <br> First of all, to the Buddha and Nagarjuna, Samsara is not an
              illusion but like an illusion. There is a quantum leap in the
              meaning of these two statements. Secondly, because it is only ‘like
              an illusion’ i.e. interdependently arisen like all illusions, it
              does not and cannot vanish, so Nirvana is not when Samsara vanishes
              like mist and the Brahma arises like the sun out of the mist but
              rather when seeing that the true nature of Samsara is itself
              Nirvana. So whereas Brahma and Samsara are two different entities,
              one real and the other unreal, one existing and the other
              non-existing, Samsara and Nirvana in Buddhism are one and not two.
              Nirvana is the nature of Samsara or in Nagarjuna’s words shunyata
              is the nature of Samsara. It is the realization of the nature of
              Samsara as empty which cuts at the very root of ignorance and
              results in knowledge not of another thing beyond Samsara but of the
              way Samsara itself actually exists (Skt. vastusthiti), knowledge of
              Tathata (as it-is-ness) the Yathabhuta (as it really is) of Samsara
              itself. It is this knowledge that liberates from wrong conceptual
              experience of Samsara to the unconditioned experience of Samsara
              itself. That is what is meant by the indivisibility of Samsara and
              Nirvana (Skt. Samsara nirvana abhinnata, Tib: Khor de yer me). The
              mind being Samsara in the context of DzogChen, Mahamudra and
              Anuttara Tantra. Samsara would be substituted by dualistic mind.
              The Hindu paradigm is world denying, affirming the Brahma. The
              Buddhist paradigm does not deny the world; it only rectifies our
              wrong vision (Skt. mithya drsti) of the world. It does not give a
              dream beyond or separate transcendence from Samsara. Because such a
              dream is part of the dynamics of ignorance, to present such a dream
              would be only to perpetuate ignorance.<br> <br> To Buddhism, any system or paradigm which propagates such an
              unproven and improvable dream as an eternal substance or ultimate
              reality, be it Hinduism or any other ‘ism’, is propagating
              spiritual materialism and not true spirituality. To Hinduism such a
              Brahma is the summum bonum of its search goal, the peak of the
              Hindu thesis. The Hindu paradigm would collapse without it. Since
              Buddhism denies thus, it cannot be said honestly that the Buddha
              merely meant to reform Hinduism. As I have said, it is a totally
              different paradigm. Hinduism, Christianity, Islam, Jainism are all
              variations of the same paradigm. So truly speaking, you could speak
              of them as reformations of each other. But Buddhism has a totally
              different paradigm from any of these, not merely from Vedic-
              Hinduism...</span></p>

              <p>IMOHO.. i think
              the issue with religious tension primarily stems from the general
              attitude people have towards their religion.  when a person decides to
              be a christian/buddhist..etc, we treat it like acquiring another
              worldly possession in life, like buying a new car, upgrading to bigger
              house, joining a prestigious country club. </p>
              <p>when others say
              that your car is crap, your house is like a slum and your country
              club's status is going down the drain, you get angry and retaliate,
              refute, defend against the so-called insult, all in the name of setting
              the record straight and establishing the truth.  but the actual problem
              really is that the ego is bruised by the so-called insult. because the
              ego feels that it "owns" the object of possession that was being
              insulted, the "how dare you" anger arises and resulting retaliation
              occurs.  same with religion.  you attack "MY religion" so i retaliate
              and attack "YOUR religion".  self-righteousness taken to extreme can be a stimulating
              drug to the ego being mistaken as justice.</p>
              <p>i can imagine if jesus christ and buddha were to see these petty
              exchanges today, they will be feeling a tad amused and dissapointed. 
              since when have they operated these "VIP-member-only country clubs" for
              petty humans to fight over?</p>
              <p>religious tension will persists so
              long as spiritual practice is not integrated into one's daily life and
              people still treat their religion at a superficial level like any of
              their worldly possessions - something to be acquired, polished and
              displayed at the shelf for showing off to the neighbours and friends.</p>
              <p>just
              a thought.  people may treat it as pure nonsense when you say that the
              earth is round before the actual scientific discovery is made.  but the
              earth do not need this belief or proof to be round since it has always
              been so.  the only one that needs the belief and the proof is the ego.  spiritual practice is something like that.</p>

I never want you to get into that. I am only interested in opening up your wisdom of what is the truth of Awareness and directly point to it. Read stage 6 and my comments. All the points are inside but it is difficult to see. Reality is like an illusion, but not an illusion. It is like a dream, but not a dream. Everything is a magical display. And everything is mind. :)<br><br>What does that mean? The mind is always wrongly understood, from "I AM" to non-dual experience. We cannot understand the truth of this mind therefore we can't see mind. Just like u can't see the essence of the article. We have a pre-conception.<br><br>Everything is mind. And Everything is like a magical display. That is why I said there is no mirror, there is only reflection. The key is to know the nature of mind. To see that everything is reflection, transcience. Everything is Mind is what that must be derived from anatta (the truth of no-self) and emptiness (dependent origination). But we do not know what "everything" is and what mind is. Therefore we cannot 'see' and cannot experience. We cannot see the essence of it. So anatta and emptiness are taught.<br><br>What is Everything? It is like magical display, like an illusion. But it is not an illusion. Like a dream but not a dream, which many misunderstood. Therefore when we experience sounds, thoughts, see colors, forms, dimension and shapes... all is empty. Like an illusion. Like dreams. Like the 'redness' of a flower. Like the 'selfness'. Like the 'hereness'. Like the 'nowness'. Yet empty, nothing real.<br><br>If you can't totally see that pristineness, that non-dual, that luminosity, and see only emptiness, you are mistaken. The 'redness', the 'nowness', the 'hardness', the coldness, all are as luminous, as clear, as vivid, we must fully experience it. Yet they are not real, nothing concrete, no solidity, nothing substantial, nothing graspable, no findable, empty, thus non-dual luminosity and emptiness. We see this union, in all transcience, passing phenomena. In emotions, in feelings, in thoughts, in sounds, in sight, in color, in dimension, in shapes, in taste, in hardness, coldness, in sweetness, in sky, in the sound of chirping bird, all experience are like that, empty yet luminous. Then we realise that it is the same as mind. It is mind. If we don't see these 2 nature of mind thoroughly, we can't see, we distant, we seek, we find. Because of its emptiness nature, the manifold, we cannot know what mind is. Therefore the ground is taught, the view is taught - empty yet non-dual luminosity, so that you can see and experience directly that the transience are mind, yet there is no self nature. Then you experience what is one taste. We do not know what mind is, we cannot experience mind. We do not know. That is why insight is important. However if you do not know what is non-dual luminosity and emptiness, how is a practitioner going to experience mind everywhere and know that whatever arises is mind? Therefore first anatta (non-dual luminosity), then emptiness, then spontaneous arising.</p>
