              <p>Why do we need scientific evidence or explanation for everything
              to prove that it exists? Can scientists explain the soul and mind
              that exist in all living things? If there is no evidence or not
              enough evidence to prove that certain things exist, it doesn't mean
              they don't exist.</p>

              <p><strong>You have to prove that the soul exists first.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>As for the mind on the other hand, all the evidence points to the fact that the mind is a function of the brain.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>If you take certain drugs, you can alter your mind. What does that tell you? The drugs affect the brain, the brain affects the mind.</strong></p>

              <p><br>I agree.</p>
              <p>Though, in Buddhist teachings, same as in the bibles.  The teachings of Buddhism should be conducted in classes, with friendly debates instead of shoving ideas into people's throat.</p>
              <p>Too many times, be it Christians, Buddhist or Islamic practioner, been encountering zealots or some fanatics sellingthe delusions to other people.</p>
              <p>But as practising Christians, Buddhist or Islamic practioner.  One need the discipline to find his/her/its own path to acknowledge the peace, love and calm with the teachings.</p>

              <p>I am too shallow, so no need to take my words seriously.</p>
              <p>Yes.  I think some Buddhists entertains the idea that their
              superstitious ways and rules is the correct way of buddhism.</p>
              <p>But most of us have to cling to a certain routine or a certain
              aspect of buddhism (the buddhism they think is true, real or the
              correct way), since we all are not maybe as enlightened as
              Buddha.</p>
              <p>And yes.....I think most of us is delusional.  Because
              in the eyes of people who are skeptical. </p>
              <p>I think all of us is delusional to certain aspect.  And it
              will take Buddhha or God's power of the will to be
              englightened and 'saved' as they are, which is obvious that us
              mortal men here discussing this topic, have not achieved.</p>
              <p>I believe in honour, self discipline and giving oneself. 
              Respect for those who give theirs....be it for life, meat or
              whatever reason.</p>
              <p>Without those disciplines..... we do not respect the world
              that God, Buddha is hoping to achieve for us.</p>

              <p><strong>That is because you have not lived the life of greater REALITY with less delusions and baseless beliefs.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>That is why you cannot appreciate the beauty of living life in greater REALITY.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>I have tried both ways and I find that the REAL way is better than the delusional way.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The christians and the buddhists (and members of other faiths) make many fantastic claims and preach love and compassion. Love and compassion is well and good. </strong></p>

              <p>Although I'm technically a Buddhist (gone through the 3 refuges ceremony), I still ask questions like the above, both towards myself and others.  I have no clear and irrefutable answers to offer to any fellow human asking similar questions. I can only share my thoughts and feelings from periodic self-reflections, with anyone who are sincere and open-minded about listening to such kind of sharing.</p>
              <p>So far only what the Kalama Sutta has taught is able to help me to move on with the clear sense of direction and understanding that anything we hear or see, we should take them as reference sources, never definitive. To remind myself constantly to develop a discerning, not discriminating mind to investigate and understand as thoroughly as possible, any concept or truths within us and around us.</p>
              <p>I treat the guidelines recorded in the Kalama Sutta as sayings by a wise human; which means whether anyone accords the title of Buddha or the label of sutta to those sayings is quite immaterial to me.</p>
              <p> And from the above replies so far, it seems probably you have realised something. Only you can convince and understand for yourself what is real and what is delusional in the ways in which some or maybe most people practise or understand Buddhist teachings.</p>
              <p>Keep on investigating and analysing with an open mind and heart. At the same time, reflect on the feelings of frustration caused to yourself and to others (as observed from the replies), knowingly or not, that comes in from asking such questions to the Buddhist community at large.</p>
              <p>I now refrain from asking such questions online or towards fellow Buddhists. They will merely answer you with answers that point to one word 'Practice'.  Is chanting  or meditation 'practice'? One really has to so-called trial and error, be willing to conduct countless life-long experiments, observations on various known approaches and think about new ones by using established viewpoints and concepts as good reference materials, with utmost perseverance and open-mindedness.</p>
              <p>The historical Buddha is no longer with us. It is widely recognised as an irrefutable fact that only a sammasamBuddha (our historial Buddha, Sakyamuni Buddha) can teach difficult to grasp concepts or any kind of universal truth <strong>perfectly</strong>, by taking into full account the subtle and innate intellectual and spiritual capacities of each living being, and their karmic affinities with certain Dharma teachings - cultivated or have not yet been cultivated throughout countless rebirths.</p>
              <p>Not even an Arahant (<a title="wiki on Arahant" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arahant_%28Buddhism%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arahant_%28Buddhism%29</a>) can be considered a perfect teacher.</p>
              <p>So take heart in the above. You are not alone in asking such questions. People like us can only continue to search for our own answers, with guidelines from the Kalama Sutta as our lamp, our light.</p>

              <p>Shamatha meditation (one pointedness, concentration practices) exists in other religions. They are important but only Buddhism teaches insight meditation.</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br> <strong>Chapter 3</strong><br> <strong><br> What Meditation Is</strong><br> <br> Meditation is a word, and words are used in different 
              ways by 
                                    different speakers. This may seem like a trivial 
              point, but 
                                    it is not. It is quite important to distinguish 
              exactly what 
                                    a particular speaker means by the words he uses. 
              Every culture 
                                    on earth, for example, has produced some sort of 
              mental practice 
                                    which might be termed meditation. It all depends 
              on how loose 
                                    a definition you give to that word. Everybody does
               it, from 
                                    Africans to Eskimos. The techniques are enormously
               varied, and 
                                    we will make no attempt to survey them. There are 
              other books 
                                    for that. For the purpose of this volume, we will 
              restrict our 
                                    discussion to those practices best known to 
              Western audiences 
                                    and most likely associated with the term 
              meditation.<br> <strong><br> Within the Judeo-Christian tradition we find two 
              overlapping 
                                    practices called prayer and contemplation. Prayer 
              is a direct 
                                    address to some spiritual entity. Contemplation in
               a prolonged 
                                    period of conscious thought about some specific 
              topic, usually 
                                    a religious ideal or scriptural passage. From the 
              standpoint 
                                    of mental culture, both of these activities are 
              exercises in 
                                    concentration. The normal deluge of conscious 
              thought is restricted, 
                                    and the mind is brought to one conscious area of 
              operation. 
                                    The results are those you find in any 
              concentrative practice: 
                                    deep calm, a physiological slowing of the 
              metabolism and a sense 
                                    of peace and well-being.<br><br> Out of the Hindu tradition comes Yogic meditation, 
              which is 
                                    also purely concentrative. The traditional basic 
              exercises consist 
                                    of focusing the mind on a single object a stone, a
               candle flame, 
                                    a syllable or whatever, and not allowing it to 
              wander. Having 
                                    acquired the basic skill, the Yogi proceeds to 
              expand his practice 
                                    by taking on more complex objects of meditation 
              chants, colorful 
                                    religious images, energy channels in the body and 
              so forth. 
                                    Still, no matter how complex the object of 
              meditation, the meditation 
                                    itself remains purely an exercise in 
              concentration.<br><br> Within the Buddhist tradition, concentration is also 
              highly 
                                    valued. But a new element is added and more highly
               stressed. 
                                    That element is awareness. All Buddhist meditation
               aims at the 
                                    development of awareness, using concentration as a
               tool. </strong> The 
                                    Buddhist tradition is very wide, however, and 
              there are several 
                                    diverse routes to this goal. Zen meditation uses 
              two separate 
                                    tacks. The first is the direct plunge into 
              awareness by sheer 
                                    force of will. You sit down and you just sit, 
              meaning that you 
                                    toss out of your mind everything except pure 
              awareness of sitting. 
                                    This sounds very simple. It is not. A brief trial 
              will demonstrate 
                                    just how difficult it really is. The second Zen 
              approach used 
                                    in the Rinzai school is that of tricking the mind 
              out of conscious 
                                    thought and into pure awareness. This is done by 
              giving the 
                                    student an unsolvable riddle which he must solve 
              anyway, and 
                                    by placing him in a horrendous training situation.
               Since he 
                                    cannot flee from the pain of the situation, he 
              must flee into 
                                    a pure experience of the moment. There is nowhere 
              else to go. 
                                    Zen is tough. It is effective for many people, but
               it is really 
                                    tough.<br> <br> Another stratagem, Tantric Buddhism, is nearly the 
              reverse. 
                                    Conscious thought, at least the way we usually do 
              it, is the 
                                    manifestation of ego, the you that you usually 
              think that you 
                                    are. Conscious thought is tightly connected with 
              self-concept. 
                                    The self-concept or ego is nothing more than a set
               of reactions 
                                    and mental images which are artificially pasted to
               the flowing 
                                    process of pure awareness. Tantra seeks to obtain 
              pure awareness 
                                    by destroying this ego image. This is accomplished
               by a process 
                                    of visualization. The student is given a 
              particular religious 
                                    image to meditate upon, for example, one of the 
              deities from 
                                    the Tantric pantheon. He does this in so thorough a
               fashion 
                                    that he becomes that entity. He takes off his own 
              identity and 
                                    puts on another. This takes a while, as you might 
              imagine, but 
                                    it works. During the process, he is able to watch 
              the way that 
                                    the ego is constructed and put in place. He comes 
              to recognize 
                                    the arbitrary nature of all egos, including his 
              own, and he 
                                    escapes from bondage to the ego. He is left in a 
              state where 
                                    he may have an ego if he so chooses, either his 
              own or whichever 
                                    other he might wish, or he can do without one. 
              Result: pure 
                                    awareness. Tantra is not exactly a game of patty 
              cake either.<br> <br> Vipassana is the oldest of Buddhist meditation 
              practices. The 
                                    method comes directly from the Sitipatthana Sutta,
               a discourse 
                                    attributed to Buddha himself. Vipassana is a 
              direct and gradual 
                                    cultivation of mindfulness or awareness. It 
              proceeds piece by 
                                    piece over a period of years. The student's 
              attention is carefully 
                                    directed to an intense examination of certain 
              aspects of his 
                                    own existence. The meditator is trained to notice 
              more and more 
                                    of his own flowing life experience. Vipassana is a
               gentle technique. 
                                    But it also is very , very thorough. It is an 
              ancient and codified 
                                    system of sensitivity training, a set of exercises
               dedicated 
                                    to becoming more and more receptive to your own 
              life experience. 
                                    It is attentive listening, total seeing and 
              careful testing. 
                                    We learn to smell acutely, to touch fully and 
              really pay attention 
                                    to what we feel. We learn to listen to our own 
              thoughts without 
                                    being caught up in them.<br> <br> The object of Vipassana practice is to learn to pay 
              attention. 
                                    We think we are doing this already, but that is an
               illusion. 
                                    It comes from the fact that we are paying so 
              little attention 
                                    to the ongoing surge of our own life experiences 
              that we might 
                                    just as well be asleep. We are simply not paying 
              enough attention 
                                    to notice that we are not paying attention. It is 
              another Catch-22. </span></p>

              <p>Actually, Buddhism does not teach that there is a soul, but that there are Streams of Consciousness. There is a huge difference. Realising Anatta or the truth of no-self is what liberates.</p>

              <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 1.3pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt;" lang="EN-GB">This is the most unique feature 
                  of Buddhism. It is not found in any other religion in the world. 
              Buddha 
                  formulated this doctrine and gave ample reasons to support it. In 
              all the 
                  other religions there exists a Soul or a Self or Atman in humans. 
              This is a 
                  permanent, unchanging, everlasting essence or entity in man. In some
               
                  religions, this soul will end up in heaven or hell eternally after 
              death. In 
                  Hinduism the Atman after many life times of purification will 
              finally unite 
                  with God or Brahman. This Self or soul is the thinker of thoughts, 
              feeler of 
                  sensations and receiver of rewards and punishments. Buddhism reckons
               that 
                  this soul is the cause of all evils and misdeeds because of the 
              selfishness 
                  of ‘me’ and ‘mine’. Selfishness leads to all other defilements like 
              hatred, 
                  ill will, conceit and pride.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoBlockText" style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 1.3pt 0.0001pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Buddha explained that each individual is 
                  composed of five constituents: body, feeling, perception, mental 
              factors 
                  (habitual tendencies) and consciousness. At birth these five 
              constituents 
                  propel the karmic forces to form an individual in this life. At 
              death, the 
                  five constituents break up to leave the forces in the spirit world 
              during 
                  which no individual is in existence. In a subsequent birth these 
              five 
                  separate constituents will reform another individual according to 
              the karma 
                  accrued by that individual in his past life. So the theory goes: in 
              life 
                  these five constituents are inconstant, forever changing and are 
                  impermanent. When impermanent the individual composing of the five 
                  constituents is consistently suffering. These five constituents 
              being ever 
                  changing have no organizing principle or soul or permanent essence 
              apart 
                  from the constituents. This is the rationale of the anatta doctrine.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoBlockText" style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 1.3pt 0.0001pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> </span></p>

              <p class="MsoBlockText" style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 1.3pt 0.0001pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Buddha said that man psychologically 
                  invented the idea of God and Soul for self-protection and 
              self-preservation. 
                  God is supposed to protect man for safety and security. For 
                  self-preservation, man conceives of a Soul or Atman, which will live
               
                  eternally. All other religions cling on to these entities of God and
               Soul 
                  due to selfish motives.  Buddha argued that these ideas are false 
              and 
                  deep-rooted conjured in the minds of the Brahmins. After his 
              enlightenment 
                  he postulated two theories to counter the concept of God and Atman. 
              These 
                  are the <strong>Five Aggregates</strong> and the <strong>Conditioned Genesis</strong>.</span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoBlockText" style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 1.3pt 0.0001pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span></span></p>

                  which are 1) the body, 2) feelings, 3) perception 4) mental 
              tendencies and 
                  5) consciousness. Try as hard as one may, one can find no essence or
               a Self 
                  or an Atman in any of these constituents. He also emphasized that 
              there is 
                  no other essence or substance outside these five constituents. These
               
                  conditioned and ever changing constituents are subjected to 
              suffering---dukkha.</span></span></p>

                  point is to stop at the point where contact gives rise to sensation 
              or 
                  feeling. Even if sensation or feelings have arisen, one should 
              prevent the 
                  feelings from concocting craving and clinging. It is at this point 
              of 
                  craving that kamma is generated. So without craving, clinging and 
              being, no 
                  dukkha is generated as no kamma has been earned.</span></span></p>

                  circle of links of the Conditioned Genesis (Dependent Origination) 
              are 
                  conditioned and conditioning. They are relative, interdependent and 
                  interconnected. Nothing is independent and absolute and there is no 
              first 
                  cause. If the five aggregates and all the other things are 
              conditioned and 
                  interdependent, there should also be no free will. With this 
              Conditioned 
                  Genesis together with the analysis of the Five Aggregates, one finds
               that 
                  there is also no immortal abiding essence in man. Whether this 
              essence is 
                  called Atman or soul it does not matter. This is the Buddhist 
              doctrine of 
                  Anatta, No-Soul or No-Self. In conventional truth or daily 
              conversation we 
                  use the word “I” merely to signify an individual separate from other
               
                  individuals. However in ultimate truth there is no essence or 
              abiding 
                  substance behind this individual. ‘A person should be mentioned as 
              existing 
                  only in designation (conventionally an individual), but not in 
              reality.’</span></span></p>

                  things are impermanent and therefore involved in dukkha, sorrow and 
                  suffering. But verse 279 emphasized that <strong>‘All states’</strong> are <strong>without
               
                  self</strong> (anatta). The word used to denote ‘all states’ is dhamma. 
              The word 
                  dhamma includes both conditioned and unconditioned things and 
              states, the 
                  Absolute and Nibbana. That means there is no Self or Atman in the 
              Five 
                  Aggregates or outside the Five Aggregates. Furthermore, there is 
              also no 
                  Self or Atman in the unconditioned --- the Absolute and Nibbana.</span></span></p>

                  consciousness, Buddha replied that it is better to take the body as 
              self, 
                  because the body is more solid. Also the mind or consciousness 
              changes much 
                  faster than the body. The vague feeling of ‘I Am’ gives the false 
              impression 
                  that there is a self in us. To cure this spiritual disease is to see
               
                  objectively that <strong><em>the Five Aggregates work interdependently in a
               
                  constant flux within the law of cause and effect, and that there is 
              no 
                  eternal, unchanging, and permanent essence in all conditioned and 
                  unconditioned things and states.</em></strong></span></span></p>
