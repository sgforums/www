              <p>Yes, everything is a vivid appearance of pure awareness. Like the words on this screen is an appearance. It is appearing. His suffering is appearing. Precisely because it is appearing that steps should be taken to deal with those appearance. If suffering is not appearing, then why would you do anything about it? So compassion arises naturally in regards to appearances.</p>
              <p>The only problem is when we imagine that behind those appearances there is an inherently existing thing or a self, or that there is an inherently existing 'self' that is acting to save 'other' beings. There is action, but there is no doer and no one being saved. In reality there is just dependently originated appearances, nothing graspable or inherent. In fact there would be no suffering if we realise the empty nature of reality. It is only because we are not aware of it, that we fall into a dream state of samsara full of sufferings. Physical pain is inevitable (it is a dependently originated empty yet vivid appearance), but mental suffering as a result of imagining a 'me' suffering is due to not realising emptiness. That is why bodhisattvas have compassion for those suffering beings still asleep, if we were awake and not suffering, there would be no more appearance of Buddhas.</p>
              <p>In short: Hence it is not true that there is a 'self' experiencing suffering, but it is true that due to not realising there is no self, that suffering is happening. Yes, there is no sufferer apart from suffering, but the fact is that suffering is still appearing and thus there is compassion for these beings and action is being done to address these issues.</p>
              <p>Yes, suffering itself is impermanent, insubstantial, and empty, but due to ignorance of sentient beings and not realising that it is empty, they continue to grasp and suffer due to ignorance. Therefore the Bodhisattvas vow to save them from suffering.</p>

              <p>TRANSFORMING WITHOUT THERE BEING ANYONE TRANSFORMED, 
              TWENTY-FIVE<br> " Subhuti, what do you think? None of you should maintain 
              that 
                            the Thus Come One has this thought: 'I shall save living 
              beings.' 
                            Subhuti, do not think that way. Why? In fact the Thus Come
               One does 
                            not save any living beings. If the Thus Come One saved 
              living beings, 
                            then the Thus Come One would have a sense of a self, 
              others, living 
                            beings, and a life. "Subhuti, although the Thus Come One 
              speaks 
                            of the existence of a self, there is really no self that 
              exists. 
                            However, common people think they have a self. Subhuti, 
              the common 
                            people that the Thus Come One speaks of are not common 
              people. Therefore 
                            they are called common people."</p>

              <p>ULTIMATELY THERE IS NO SELF, SEVENTEEN<br> Then Subhuti addressed the Buddha, "World Honored One, if a
               
                            good man or good woman resolves his mind on 
              Anuttarasamyaksambodhi,

              The 
                            Buddha told Subhuti, "A good man or good woman who 
              resolves 
                            his mind on Anuttarasamyaksambodhi should think thus: 'I 
              should 
                            take all living beings across to Cessation. Yet when all

              if a Bodhisattva 
                            has an appearance of self, others, living beings or a

              <p>what is considered supernatural (in a general context) is constantly changing as society and technoglogy progresses through the ages.  an eclipse used to be a supernatural occurence in olden days, as chinese named the phenomenon å¤©ç‹—é£Ÿæ—¥ (celestial dog devouring the sun), but later scientific discoveries proofed othewise.  while the natural functioning of the phenomenon remains unchanged, the label we humans give it changes depending on our conceptual understanding of it - supernatural for things we can't yet explain or understand, and science for the same thing that later generations did get their conceptual brains around it.  but in the end, the natural phenomenon itself still functions as it has always been, regardless of the label that humans gave it.</p>
              <p>who knows what science will go on to discover in the coming generations, after all us passionate forummers here had long turned to dust :-)  perhaps by then, what is considered supernatural now will be just primary school science topics by then.</p>

              <p>imagine you are a character in an action movie, and you see someone who's drowning or bleeding, and if you don't do anything, the person will naturally die as a result.  if you save the person, he/she will not die as a result of your action.  all laws of karma will still function as usual in the movie. </p>
              <p>but if you change your perspective and realize that all these happenings is nothing but a movie, it appears like an illusion (since movie is not real-life).  but nevertheless, characters in the movie still goes through sufferings, happiness, lives and dies, as a consequence of how the plot unfolds, and all laws of nature and karma will still be very real from the movie's content perspective.</p>
              <p>this is just an analogy for purpose of providing a quick response to your question.  don't take it too literally and over-analyse :-)</p>

              <p>For those more intellectual type of persons, the following article is a very good read IMO and explains why the empty nature of universe allows so called non-local and supernatural occurences. This is also the experience of Thusness and he has said how supernatural experience but he prefers to call it non-local events (e.g. hear not bounded by distance, see not bounded by distance, read other's minds and see into the future, etc) that take places will help deepen one's insight of emptiness. (But only for a person at that level of spiritual maturity and wisdom to comprehend it, otherwise people who attain supernatural powers at an early phase in one's practice can get over fascinated and attached to them and fail to give rise to wisdom, that's why he is always reluctant to discuss these things)<br><br><strong>The Holographic Universe</strong><br><br>Michael Talbot<br><br>In 1982 a remarkable event took place. At the University of Paris a research team led by physicist Alain Aspect performed what may turn out to be one of the most important experiments of the 20th century. You did not hear about it on the evening news. In fact, unless you are in the habit of reading scientific journals you probably have never even heard Aspect's name, though there are some who believe his discovery may change the face of science.<br><br>Aspect and his team discovered that under certain circumstances subatomic particles such as electrons are able to instantaneously communicate with each other regardless of the distance separating them. It doesn't matter whether they are 10 feet or 10 billion miles apart.<br><br>Somehow each particle always seems to know what the other is doing. The problem with this feat is that it violates Einstein's long-held tenet that no communication can travel faster than the speed of light. Since traveling faster than the speed of light is tantamount to breaking the time barrier, this daunting prospect has caused some physicists to try to come up with elaborate ways to explain away Aspect's findings. But it has inspired others to offer even more radical explanations.<br><br>University of London physicist David Bohm, for example, believes Aspect's findings imply that objective reality does not exist, that despite its apparent solidity the universe is at heart a phantasm, a gigantic and splendidly detailed hologram.<br><br>To understand why Bohm makes this startling assertion, one must first understand a little about holograms. A hologram is a three- dimensional photograph made with the aid of a laser.<br><br>To make a hologram, the object to be photographed is first bathed in the light of a laser beam. Then a second laser beam is bounced off the reflected light of the first and the resulting interference pattern (the area where the two laser beams commingle) is captured on film.<br><br>When the film is developed, it looks like a meaningless swirl of light and dark lines. But as soon as the developed film is illuminated by another laser beam, a three-dimensional image of the original object appears.<br><br>The three-dimensionality of such images is not the only remarkable characteristic of holograms. If a hologram of a rose is cut in half and then illuminated by a laser, each half will still be found to contain the entire image of the rose.<br><br>Indeed, even if the halves are divided again, each snippet of film will always be found to contain a smaller but intact version of the original image. Unlike normal photographs, every part of a hologram contains all the information possessed by the whole.<br><br>The "whole in every part" nature of a hologram provides us with an entirely new way of understanding organization and order. For most of its history, Western science has labored under the bias that the best way to understand a physical phenomenon, whether a frog or an atom, is to dissect it and study its respective parts.<br><br>A hologram teaches us that some things in the universe may not lend themselves to this approach. If we try to take apart something constructed holographically, we will not get the pieces of which it is made, we will only get smaller wholes.<br><br>This insight suggested to Bohm another way of understanding Aspect's discovery. Bohm believes the reason subatomic particles are able to remain in contact with one another regardless of the distance separating them is not because they are sending some sort of mysterious signal back and forth, but because their separateness is an illusion. He argues that at some deeper level of reality such particles are not individual entities, but are actually extensions of the same fundamental something.<br><br>To enable people to better visualize what he means, Bohm offers the following illustration.<br><br>Imagine an aquarium containing a fish. Imagine also that you are unable to see the aquarium directly and your knowledge about it and what it contains comes from two television cameras, one directed at the aquarium's front and the other directed at its side.<br><br>As you stare at the two television monitors, you might assume that the fish on each of the screens are separate entities. After all, because the cameras are set at different angles, each of the images will be slightly different. But as you continue to watch the two fish, you will eventually become aware that there is a certain relationship between them.<br><br>When one turns, the other also makes a slightly different but corresponding turn; when one faces the front, the other always faces toward the side. If you remain unaware of the full scope of the situation, you might even conclude that the fish must be instantaneously communicating with one another, but this is clearly not the case.<br><br>This, says Bohm, is precisely what is going on between the subatomic particles in Aspect's experiment.<br><br>According to Bohm, the apparent faster-than-light connection between subatomic particles is really telling us that there is a deeper level of reality we are not privy to, a more complex dimension beyond our own that is analogous to the aquarium. And, he adds, we view objects such as subatomic particles as separate from one another because we are seeing only a portion of their reality.<br><br>Such particles are not separate "parts", but facets of a deeper and more underlying unity that is ultimately as holographic and indivisible as the previously mentioned rose. And since everything in physical reality is comprised of these "eidolons", the universe is itself a projection, a hologram.<br><br>In addition to its phantomlike nature, such a universe would possess other rather startling features. If the apparent separateness of subatomic particles is illusory, it means that at a deeper level of reality all things in the universe are infinitely interconnected.<br><br>The electrons in a carbon atom in the human brain are connected to the subatomic particles that comprise every salmon that swims, every heart that beats, and every star that shimmers in the sky.<br><br>Everything interpenetrates everything, and although human nature may seek to categorize and pigeonhole and subdivide, the various phenomena of the universe, all apportionments are of necessity artificial and all of nature is ultimately a seamless web.<br><br>In a holographic universe, even time and space could no longer be viewed as fundamentals. Because concepts such as location break down in a universe in which nothing is truly separate from anything else, time and three-dimensional space, like the images of the fish on the TV monitors, would also have to be viewed as projections of this deeper order.<br><br>At its deeper level reality is a sort of superhologram in which the past, present, and future all exist simultaneously. This suggests that given the proper tools it might even be possible to someday reach into the superholographic level of reality and pluck out scenes from the long-forgotten past.<br><br>What else the superhologram contains is an open-ended question. Allowing, for the sake of argument, that the superhologram is the matrix that has given birth to everything in our universe, at the very least it contains every subatomic particle that has been or will be -- every configuration of matter and energy that is possible, from snowflakes to quasars, from bluü whales to gamma rays. It must be seen as a sort of cosmic storehouse of "All That Is."<br><br>Although Bohm concedes that we have no way of knowing what else might lie hidden in the superhologram, he does venture to say that we have no reason to assume it does not contain more. Or as he puts it, perhaps the superholographic level of reality is a "mere stage" beyond which lies "an infinity of further development".<br><br>Bohm is not the only researcher who has found evidence that the universe is a hologram. Working independently in the field of brain research, Standford neurophysiologist Karl Pribram has also become persuaded of the holographic nature of reality.<br><br>Pribram was drawn to the holographic model by the puzzle of how and where memories are stored in the brain. For decades numerous studies have shown that rather than being confined to a specific location, memories are dispersed throughout the brain.<br><br>In a series of landmark experiments in the 1920s, brain scientist Karl Lashley found that no matter what portion of a rat's brain he removed he was unable to eradicate its memory of how to perform complex tasks it had learned prior to surgery. The only problem was that no one was able to come up with a mechanism that might explain this curious "whole in every part" nature of memory storage.<br><br>Then in the 1960s Pribram encountered the concept of holography and realized he had found the explanation brain scientists had been looking for. Pribram believes memories are encoded not in neurons, or small groupings of neurons, but in patterns of nerve impulses that crisscross the entire brain in the same way that patterns of laser light interference crisscross the entire area of a piece of film containing a holographic image. In other words, Pribram believes the brain is itself a hologram.<br><br>Pribram's theory also explains how the human brain can store so many memories in so little space. It has been estimated that the human brain has the capacity to memorize something on the order of 10 billion bits of information during the average human lifetime (or roughly the same amount of information contained in five sets of the Encyclopaedia Britannica).<br><br>Similarly, it has been discovered that in addition to their other capabilities, holograms possess an astounding capacity for information storage--simply by changing the angle at which the two lasers strike a piece of photographic film, it is possible to record many different images on the same surface. It has been demonstrated that one cubic centimeter of film can hold as many as 10 billion bits of information.<br><br>Our uncanny ability to quickly retrieve whatever information we need from the enormous store of our memories becomes more understandable if the brain functions according to holographic principles. If a friend asks you to tell him what comes to mind when he says the word "zebra", you do not have to clumsily sort back through ome gigantic and cerebral alphabetic file to arrive at an answer. Instead, associations like "striped", "horselike", and "animal native to Africa" all pop into your head instantly.<br><br>Indeed, one of the most amazing things about the human thinking process is that every piece of information seems instantly cross- correlated with every other piece of information--another feature intrinsic to the hologram. Because every portion of a hologram is infinitely interconnected with ever other portion, it is perhaps nature's supreme example of a cross-correlated system.<br><br>The storage of memory is not the only neurophysiological puzzle that becomes more tractable in light of Pribram's holographic model of the brain. Another is how the brain is able to translate the avalanche of frequencies it receives via the senses (light frequencies, sound frequencies, and so on) into the concrete world of our perceptions. Encoding and decoding frequencies is precisely what a hologram does best. Just as a hologram functions as a sort of lens, a translating device able to convert an apparently meaningless blur of frequencies into a coherent image, Pribram believes the brain also comprises a lens and uses holographic principles to mathematically convert the frequencies it receives through he senses into the inner world of our perceptions.<br><br>An impressive body of evidence suggests that the brain uses holographic principles to perform its operations. Pribram's theory, in fact, has gained increasing support among neurophysiologists.<br><br>Argentinian-Italian researcher Hugo Zucarelli recently extended the holographic model into the world of acoustic phenomena. Puzzled by the fact that humans can locate the source of sounds without moving their heads, even if they only possess hearing in one ear, Zucarelli discovered that holographic principles can explain this ability.<br><br>Zucarelli has also developed the technology of holophonic sound, a recording technique able to reproduce acoustic situations with an almost uncanny realism.<br><br>Pribram's belief that our brains mathematically construct "hard" reality by relying on input from a frequency domain has also received a good deal of experimental support.<br><br>It has been found that each of our senses is sensitive to a much broader range of frequencies than was previously suspected.<br><br>Researchers have discovered, for instance, that our visual systems are sensitive to sound frequencies, that our sense of smell is in part dependent on what are now called "osmic frequencies", and that even the cells in our bodies are sensitive to a broad range of frequencies. Such findings suggest that it is only in the holographic domain of consciousness that such frequencies are sorted out and divided up into conventional perceptions.<br><br>But the most mind-boggling aspect of Pribram's holographic model of the brain is what happens when it is put together with Bohm's theory. For if the concreteness of the world is but a secondary reality and what is "there" is actually a holographic blur of frequencies, and if the brain is also a hologram and only selects some of the frequencies out of this blur and mathematically transforms them into sensory perceptions, what becomes of objective reality?<br><br>Put quite simply, it ceases to exist. As the religions of the East have long upheld, the material world is Maya, an illusion, and although we may think we are physical beings moving through a physical world, this too is an illusion.<br><br>We are really "receivers" floating through a kaleidoscopic sea of frequency, and what we extract from this sea and transmogrify into physical reality is but one channel from many extracted out of the superhologram.<br><br>This striking new picture of reality, the synthesis of Bohm and Pribram's views, has come to be called the holographic paradigm, and although many scientists have greeted it with skepticism, it has galvanized others. A small but growing group of researchers believe it may be the most accurate model of reality science has arrived at thus far. More than that, some believe it may solve some mysteries that have never before been explainable by science and even establish the paranormal as a part of nature.<br><br>Numerous researchers, including Bohm and Pribram, have noted that many para-psychological phenomena become much more understandable in terms of the holographic paradigm.<br><br>In a universe in which individual brains are actually indivisible portions of the greater hologram and everything is infinitely interconnected, telepathy may merely be the accessing of the holographic level.<br><br>It is obviously much easier to understand how information can travel from the mind of individual 'A' to that of individual 'B' at a far distance point and helps to understand a number of unsolved puzzles in psychology. In particular, Grof feels the holographic paradigm offers a model for understanding many of the baffling phenomena experienced by individuals during altered states of consciousness.<br><br><br>-----------<br><br>Also related to the article above:<br><br><img src="http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y199/xabir/indras_net.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480"></p>
              <p><br>The metaphor of Indra's Jeweled Net is attributed to an ancient Buddhist named Tu-Shun (557-640 B.C.E.) who asks us to envision a vast net that:<br><br>* at each juncture there lies a jewel;<br>* each jewel reflects all the other jewels in this cosmic matrix.<br>* Every jewel represents an individual life form, atom, cell or unit of consciousness.<br>* Each jewel, in turn, is intrinsically and intimately connected to all the others;<br>* thus, a change in one gem is reflected in all the others.<br><br>This last aspect of the jeweled net is explored in a question/answer dialog of teacher and student in the Avatamsaka Sutra. In answer to the question: "how can all these jewels be considered one jewel?" it is replied: "If you don't believe that one jewel...is all the jewels...just put a dot on the jewel [in question]. When one jewel is dotted, there are dots on all the jewels...Since there are dots on all the jewels...We know that all the jewels are one jewel" ...".<br><br>The moral of Indra's net is that the compassionate and the constructive interventions a person makes or does can produce a ripple effect of beneficial action that will reverberate throughout the universe or until it plays out. By the same token you cannot damage one strand of the web without damaging the others or setting off a cascade effect of destruction.<br><br>Source: Awakening 101<br><br>...One of the images used to illustrate the nature of reality as understood in Mahayana is The Jewel Net of Indra. According to this image, all reality is to be understood on analogy with Indra's Net. This net consists entirely of jewels. Each jewel reflects all of the other jewels, and the existence of each jewel is wholly dependent on its reflection in all of the other jewels. As such, all parts of reality are interdependent with each other, but even the most basic parts of existence have no independent existence themselves. As such, to the degree that reality takes form and appears to us, it is because the whole arises in an interdependent matrix of parts to whole and of subject to object. But in the end, there is nothing (literally no-thing) there to grasp....<br><br>Source: Sunyata ('Emptiness')<br><br>Compare the first picture with:<br><br><img src="http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y199/xabir/early.jpg" alt=""><br><br>Computer model of early universe.

               reminds me of an article written by Longchen:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">The non-solidity of 
              existence</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">This article 
              describes a spiritual insight. It may be quite hard to understand.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The things that we experience are 
              registered by all the sense organs. The eye sight registers vision, the 
              ears register sound, the body registers sensations. These perception, 
              sensations and experiences are not happening in some places. They are 
              the experience of the arising of certain conditions. There is no 
              solidity and physicality in the actual experience.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">What we experienced is not universal and 
              common to all. Here's an example to illustrate that: We know that as 
              human beings, we see in term of colours. Some animals are however 
              colour-blind, thus they see differently from us. But none of us, is 
              really seeing the truth nature directly. The senses of different species
               of sentient beings experience things differently. So who is seeing the 
              real image of an object? None.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Likewise, the various planes of existence are due to different 
              conditions arising. In certain types of meditation, one is said to be 
              able to access these planes of existence. This is because they are not 
              specific locations. They are mental states and are thus non-localised. 
              In these meditations, our consciousness changes and 'aligned' more with 
              these other states or planes of existence.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">All the planes of existence are

              conditioned arisings, we only see the human world and other beings that

              consciousness and there is no solidity whatsoever. Even our touch sense 
              is just that. The touch sense gives an impression of feeling something 
              that is physical and three-dimensional. But there is really no solid 
              self-existing object there. Instead, it is simply the sensation that

              steps should be taken to deal with those appearance. If suffering
              is not appearing, then why would you do anything about it? So

              <p>Compassion arises naturally in regards to appearances? Why? If appearances of suffering are like illusions, then they will also disappear like illusions without our intervention or regardless of how we feel.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>The only problem is when we imagine that behind those
              appearances there is an inherently existing thing or a self, or
              that there is an inherently existing 'self' that is acting to save
              'other' beings. There is action, but there is no doer and no one
              being saved. In reality there is just dependently originated
              appearances, nothing graspable or inherent. In fact there would be
              no suffering if we realise the empty nature of reality. It is only
              because we are not aware of it, that we fall into a dream state of
              samsara full of sufferings. <strong>Physical pain is inevitable (it is a
              dependently originated empty yet vivid appearance), but mental
              suffering as a result of imagining a 'me' suffering is due to not
              realising emptiness. That is why bodhisattvas have compassion for
              those suffering beings still asleep, if we were awake and not
              suffering, there would be no more appearance of Buddhas.</strong></p>
              <p>In short: Hence it is not true that there is a 'self'
              experiencing suffering, but it is true that due to not realising
              there is no self, that suffering is happening. <strong>Yes, there is no
              sufferer apart from suffering, but the fact is that suffering is
              still appearing and thus there is compassion for these beings and
              action is being done to address these issues.</strong></p>
              <p>Yes, suffering itself is impermanent, insubstantial, and empty,
              but due to ignorance of sentient beings and not realising that it
              is empty, they continue to grasp and suffer due to ignorance.
              Therefore the Bodhisattvas vow to save them from suffering.</p>

              <p>Physical and mental pain or discomfort are two separate things? I thought they are inter-connected.</p>
              <p>Is having a headache or migraine something physical or mental? There are no specific external body parts involved.</p>
              <p>When I'm hungry, I feel weak. Is that physical or mental? Can I wish or will away hunger? When I am having a fever, I feel hot and uncomfortable. When I am diagnosed with kidney failure and undergo daily dialysis (which is freaking uncomfortable), can I wish or will away sickness?</p>
              <p>If there is no sufferer apart from suffering, why do Bodhisattvas need to have compassion for beings? There should be NO beings to feel or develop compassion for, isn't it?</p>
              <p>If suffering is impermanent, insubstantial, and empty, then is compassion impermanent, insubstantial and empty too?</p>

              <p>Maybe you can substitute the word 'character' with 'actor'. If I'm an actor acting out an character who looks at another co-actor acting out a drowning character, I won't be so foolish as to be anxious to save him or her, unless it's part of the script. Safety procedures will definitely be in place (maybe divers are supporting that co-actor under the sea surface). This will also be the same if I'm acting out the drowning character.</p>

              <p>As I explained to AndrewPKYap, there is a big difference between 'the world is an illusion' and 'the world is LIKE an illusion'. And because the world is not an illusion, it cannot disappear (though the mental suffering arising due to ignorance can disappear). While non-Buddhist teachings preach the prior, Buddhism teaches the latter. What's the difference?</p>

                                  is an illusion and
                                                          therefore people should know their own

                                                          such a ground itself is part of the dynamics of 
                                  ignorance. We move
                                                          here to another to major difference within the 
                                  two paradigms. In
                                                          Hinduism liberation occurs when this illusory

                                                          relinquished and it vanishes; what remains is 
                                  the eternal Brahma,
                                                          which is the same as liberation. Since the 
                                  thesis is that Samsara
                                                          is merely an illusion, when it vanishes through 
                                  knowledge, if there

                                  disaster. So in the
                                                          Hindu paradigm (or according to Buddhism all

                                                          would fall into nihilism. But since the Buddhist
                                   paradigm is
                                                          totally different, the question posed by Hindu

                                  when Samsara vanishes
                                                          like mist and the Brahma arises like the sun out
                                   of the mist but
                                                          rather when seeing that the true nature of 
                                  Samsara is itself
                                                          Nirvana. So whereas Brahma and Samsara are two 
                                  different entities,
                                                          one real and the other unreal, one existing and 
                                  the other
                                                          non-existing, Samsara and Nirvana in Buddhism 
                                  are one and not two.
                                                          Nirvana is the nature of Samsara or in 
                                  Nagarjuna’s words shunyata
                                                          is the nature of Samsara. It is the realization 
                                  of the nature of
                                                          Samsara as empty which cuts at the very root of 
                                  ignorance and
                                                          results in knowledge not of another thing beyond
                                   Samsara but of the
                                                          way Samsara itself actually exists (Skt. 
                                  vastusthiti), knowledge of
                                                          Tathata (as it-is-ness) the Yathabhuta (as it 
                                  really is) of Samsara
                                                          itself. It is this knowledge that liberates from
                                   wrong conceptual
                                                          experience of Samsara to the unconditioned 
                                  experience of Samsara
                                                          itself. That is what is meant by the 
                                  indivisibility of Samsara and
                                                          Nirvana (Skt. Samsara nirvana abhinnata, Tib: 
                                  Khor de yer me). The
                                                          mind being Samsara in the context of DzogChen, 
                                  Mahamudra and
                                                          Anuttara Tantra. Samsara would be substituted by
                                   dualistic mind.
                                                          The Hindu paradigm is world denying, affirming 
                                  the Brahma. The
                                                          Buddhist paradigm does not deny the world; it 
                                  only rectifies our
                                                          wrong vision (Skt. mithya drsti) of the world. 
                                  It does not give a
                                                          dream beyond or separate transcendence from 
                                  Samsara. Because such a
                                                          dream is part of the dynamics of ignorance, to 
                                  present such a dream
                                                          would be only to perpetuate ignorance.<br> <br> To Buddhism, any system or paradigm which 
                                  propagates such an
                                                          unproven and improvable dream as an eternal 
                                  substance or ultimate
                                                          reality, be it Hinduism or any other ‘ism’, is 
                                  propagating
                                                          spiritual materialism and not true spirituality.
                                   To Hinduism such a
                                                          Brahma is the summum bonum of its search goal, 
                                  the peak of the
                                                          Hindu thesis. The Hindu paradigm would collapse 
                                  without it. Since
                                                          Buddhism denies thus, it cannot be said honestly
                                   that the Buddha
                                                          merely meant to reform Hinduism. As I have said,
                                   it is a totally
                                                          different paradigm. Hinduism, Christianity, 
                                  Islam, Jainism are all
                                                          variations of the same paradigm. So truly 
                                  speaking, you could speak
                                                          of them as reformations of each other. But 
                                  Buddhism has a totally
                                                          different paradigm from any of these, not merely
                                   from Vedic-

              <p>You have an extreme view of non-existence: that the world is non-existent, an illusion. However in Buddhism we do not teach that the world is an illusion, as explained above. Whereas in Buddhism we do not deny the reality of pain, the reality of world, but that the world is empty of inherent, independent existence. It is ungraspable but clearly presence-ing, appearing, as the most clear and vivid Presence itself. If you realise this Presence you cannot deny this because it is the luminosity of Buddha-Nature itself which is so clear, more real than real that you cannot have a doubt about it. There is no separation between you and what is perceived, so there is just THAT - the vividness of sound, the pain, the scenery. Yet when we try to locate it, and find an independent inherent existence of say a person, a self, or the 'redness' of a red flower, it cannot be found anywhere we look. It is just appearing but without substance, however this does not deny the presence, appearance, reality of the pain/suffering/etc.</p>
              <p>Compassion is a natural response to perceiving someone elses pain. Because pain is arising and it is not an illusion -- it is the experiential reality of the other person, and action can be done to help the other person relatively speaking, but at the same time there is no need for an illusion that there is 'someone suffering' or 'someone who can save the person suffering'. There are just experiences without experiencer, action without doer, and all experiences are vivid but empty.</p>
              <p>Yes, physical pain and suffering can be separated. I cannot say I am at that level, so I can quote something from a highly experienced monk Bhante Gunaratana to give you an idea:</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.vipassana.com/meditation/mindfulness_in_plain_english_12.php">http://www.vipassana.com/meditation/mindfulness_in_plain_english_12.php</a></p>

              <p><em>That last part is more subtle. There are really no human words to
                                   describe this action precisely. The best way to get a handle on it is 
                                  by analogy. Examine what you did to those tight muscles
                                      and transfer that same action over to the mental sphere; relax the 
                                  mind in the same way that you relax the body. Buddhism recognizes that 
                                  the body and mind are tightly linked. This is so true
                                      that many people will not see this as a two-step procedure. For them
                                   to relax the body is to relax the mind and vice versa. These people 
                                  will experience the entire relaxation, mental and
                                      physical, as a single process. In any case, just let go completely 
                                  till you awareness slows down past that barrier which you yourself 
                                  erected. It was a gap, a sense of distance between self and
                                      others. It was a borderline between 'me' and 'the pain'. Dissolve 
                                  that barrier, and separation vanishes. You slow down into that sea of 
                                  surging sensation and you merge with the pain. You become
                                      the pain. You watch its ebb and flow and something surprising 
                                  happens. It no longer hurts. Suffering is gone. Only the pain remains, 
                                  an experience, nothing more. The 'me' who was being hurt has
                                      gone. The result is freedom from pain.</em></p>
              <p><em>This is an incremental process. In the beginning, you can expect 
                                  to succeed with small pains and be defeated by big ones. Like most of 
                                  our skills, it grows with practice. The more you
                                      practice, the bigger the pain you can handle. Please understand 
                                  fully. There is no masochism being advocated here. Self-mortification is

                                  but rather when seeing that the true nature of Samsara is itself Nirvana.</span></strong></em><em><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span></em></span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">So whereas Brahma and Samsara are two
                                  different entities, one real and the other unreal, one existing and the other
                                  non-existing, Samsara and Nirvana in Buddhism are one and not two. <strong>Nirvana is
                                  the nature of Samsara or in Nagarjuna’s words shunyata is the nature of
                                  Samsara. It is the realization of the nature of Samsara as empty which cuts at
                                  the very root of ignorance and results in knowledge not of another thing beyond
                                  Samsara but of the way Samsara itself actually exists (Skt. vastusthiti), knowledge
                                  of Tathata (as it-is-ness) the Yathabhuta (as it really is) of Samsara itself.
                                  It is this knowledge that liberates from wrong conceptual experience of Samsara
                                  to the unconditioned experience of Samsara itself. That is what is meant by the
                                  indivisibility of Samsara and Nirvana (Skt. Samsara nirvana abhinnata, Tib:
                                  Khor de yer me). </strong>The mind being Samsara in the context of DzogChen, Mahamudra
                                  and Anuttara Tantra. Samsara would be substituted by dualistic mind. The Hindu
                                  paradigm is world denying, affirming the Brahma. The Buddhist paradigm does not
                                  deny the world; it only rectifies our wrong vision (Skt. mithya drsti) of the
                                  world. It does not give a dream beyond or separate transcendence from Samsara.
                                  Because such a dream is part of the dynamics of ignorance, to present such a
                                  dream would be only to perpetuate ignorance.</span></em><em><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br> <br> <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">To Buddhism, any system or paradigm which
                                  propagates such an unproven and improvable dream as an eternal substance or
                                  ultimate reality, be it Hinduism or any other ‘ism’, is propagating spiritual
                                  materialism and not true spirituality. To Hinduism such a Brahma is the summum
                                  bonum of its search goal, the peak of the Hindu thesis. The Hindu paradigm
                                  would collapse without it. Since Buddhism denies thus, it cannot be said
                                  honestly that the Buddha merely meant to reform Hinduism. As I have said, it is
                                  a totally different paradigm. Hinduism, Christianity, Islam, Jainism are all
                                  variations of the same paradigm. So truly speaking, you could speak of them as
                                  reformations of each other. But Buddhism has a totally different paradigm from
                                  any of these, not merely from Vedic- Hinduism...</span></em></span></em></p>

                                  as explained above. Whereas in Buddhism we do not deny the reality of pain, the
                                  reality of world, but that the world is empty of inherent, independent
                                  existence. It is ungraspable but clearly presence-ing, appearing, as the most
                                  clear and vivid Presence itself. If you realise this Presence you cannot deny
                                  this because it is the luminosity of Buddha-Nature itself which is so clear,
                                  more real than real that you cannot have a doubt about it. There is no
                                  separation between you and what is perceived, so there is just THAT - the
                                  vividness of sound, the pain, the scenery. Yet when we try to locate it, and
                                  find an independent inherent existence of say a person, a self, or the
                                  'redness' of a red flower, it cannot be found anywhere we look. It is just
                                  appearing but without substance, however this does not deny the presence,
                                  appearance, reality of the pain/suffering/etc.</p>

              <p>Compassion is a natural response to perceiving someone elses pain. Because
                                  pain is arising and it is not an illusion -- it is the experiential reality of
                                  the other person, and action can be done to help the other person relatively
                                  speaking, but at the same time there is no need for an illusion that there is
                                  'someone suffering' or 'someone who can save the person suffering'. There are
                                  just experiences without experiencer, action without doer, and all experiences
                                  are vivid but empty.</p>
              <p>Yes, physical pain and suffering can be separated. I cannot say I am at that
                                  level, so I can quote something from a highly experienced monk Bhante
                                  Gunaratana to give you an idea:</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.vipassana.com/meditation/mindfulness_in_plain_english_12.php">http://www.vipassana.com/meditation/mindfulness_in_plain_english_12.php</a></p>
              <p> <em>That last part is more subtle. There are really no human words to
                                  describe this action precisely. The best way to get a handle on it is by
                                  analogy. Examine what you did to those tight muscles and transfer that same
                                  action over to the mental sphere; relax the mind in the same way that you relax
                                  the body. Buddhism recognizes that the body and mind are tightly linked. This
                                  is so true that many people will not see this as a two-step procedure. For them
                                  to relax the body is to relax the mind and vice versa. These people will
                                  experience the entire relaxation, mental and physical, as a single process. In
                                  any case, just let go completely till you awareness slows down past that
                                  barrier which you yourself erected. It was a gap, a sense of distance between
                                  self and others. It was a borderline between 'me' and 'the pain'. Dissolve that
                                  barrier, and separation vanishes. You slow down into that sea of surging
                                  sensation and you merge with the pain. You become the pain. You watch its ebb
                                  and flow and something surprising happens. It no longer hurts. Suffering is
                                  gone. Only the pain remains, an experience, nothing more. The 'me' who was
                                  being hurt has gone. The result is freedom from pain.</em></p>
              <p><em>This is an incremental process. In the beginning, you can expect to
                                  succeed with small pains and be defeated by big ones. Like most of our skills,
                                  it grows with practice. The more you practice, the bigger the pain you can
                                  handle. Please understand fully. There is no masochism being advocated here.

                                      is different from saá¹�sÄ�ra. That which is the 
              limit of nirvÄ�á¹‡a is
                                      also the limit of saá¹�sÄ�ra; there is not the 
              slightest difference
                                      between the two." [1] And yet there must be some
               difference between
                                      them, for otherwise no distinction would have 
              been made and there
                                      would be no need for two words to describe the 
              same state. So
                                      NÄ�gÄ�rjuna also distinguishes them: "That which, 
              taken as causal or
                                      dependent, is the process of being born and 
              passing on, is, taken
                                      noncausally and beyond all dependence, declared 
              to be nirvÄ�á¹‡a." [2]
                                      There is only one reality -- this world, right 
              here -- but this
                                      world may be experienced in two different ways. 
              Saá¹�sÄ�ra is the
                                      "relative" world as usually experienced, in 
              which "I" dualistically
                                      perceive "it" as a collection of objects which 
              interact causally in
                                      space and time. NirvÄ�á¹‡a is the world as it is in
               itself,
                                      nondualistic in that it incorporates both 
              subject and object into a
                                      whole which, MÄ�dhyamika insists, cannot be 
              characterized
                                      (ChandrakÄ«rti: "NirvÄ�á¹‡a or Reality is that which
               is absolved of all

              nevertheless sometimes
                                      calls "Mind" or "Buddhanature," and so forth"</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">It sounds like profound,
              indirect masochism to me. Only that there may be an absence of
              intention to deliberately self-harm.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">If everyone or at least a
              quarter of the world population succeeds in the above mental
              training, then theoretically speaking, the demand for painkillers,
              doctors and hospitals would decrease and eventually died
              out.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">Furthermore, since this
              method sounds rather non-religious but yet highly effective in
              eliminating physical pain completely (it should in theory work for
              emotional pain as well), then what real motivation is there for
              aspiring Bodhisattvas to develop compassion and wisdom to that of a
              fully enlightened Buddha?</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Well if it were that simple, then yes, perhaps, there would be much less need for painkillers, doctors and hospitals. But is it realistic that everyone can immediately reach Bhante Gunaratana's level of practice considering that Bhante Gunaratana actually started meditating since he was a kid and is already an old man now?</p>
              <p>So realistically speaking I believe painkillers is still needed for most people. The next thing is, pain is usually a symptom of a deeper physical illness. If we simply ignore the pain and not address it from its roots by seeing a physician and getting a diagnosis, then we aren't doing well to take care of our body.</p>
              <p>That said, there are many stories of miraculous healing through Vipassana meditation as described in many instances (scroll down to the bottom in <a href="http://www.buddhanet.net/budsas/ebud/ebmed006.htm">http://www.buddhanet.net/budsas/ebud/ebmed006.htm</a> for an example of having long term or terminal illnesses cured by simply practicing vipassana meditation), and my dharma teachers and master also attest to the healing power of practicing dharma.</p>
              <p>Our moderator Thusness used to tell me many years ago so I can't remember the exact details, of how he used to displaced a bone or something and it was very painful, but he just keep sensing fully and practicing vipassana until it self healed and the next x ray showed that it completely healed by itself.</p>
              <p>Anyway, Vipassana practice (i.e. insight meditation) in fact is only taught in Buddhism, and is the path to liberation.</p>

              <p>However, time is not necessarily a guarantee (many other conditions are involved) that one would naturally advance like Bhante.

              <p>Although Vipassana practice is only taught in Buddhism, not many would know what really constitutes vipassana practice as taught by the Buddha.</p>
              <p>Since those who are liberated usually keep silent or have already passed away into blissful rebirths, it's anyone's guess as to whether one is really liberated by following what appears or is spread by word or mouth as vipassana practice.</p>
              <p>Theoretically speaking, if we take care of our mind through the mental training you have described, we <strong>should be able to eliminate any root cause </strong>of our physical illness, isn't it?

              <p>And you haven't answered this part of my earlier post:</p>

                                      and indifference in ourselves and from fellow humans?</span></p>

              <p>Illnesses that cannot be cured by doctors, such as that which Thusness encountered, and others like my Taiwanese teacher who also encountered an injury that his friends and doctors all thought will leave him paralysed for life yet he miraculously healed himself through dharma practice within 1-2 weeks are examples of the miraculous healing power of dharma if practiced well. However I am not sure if this will happen every time and I suppose sometimes, if the bad karma is really strong one still cannot avoid certain amount of suffering, as even the Buddha and his Arhat disciples are known to get sick at times.</p>
              <p>Actually, the instructions taught by Buddha are laid out very well in the suttas, for example the Mahasatipatthana Sutta is so precise and detailed on the practice of Vipassana as to go into every single details on how one is to be mindful of each minutest details of our sensate reality so as to realise its true nature, and that such a practice is able to result in realisation and liberation in a period of 7 days to 7 years of practice (serious practice of course). Many people have practiced this today and continue to attain liberation or at least gain a high degree of insight, which testifies to the success and relevance of such a practice to people even in the modern world.</p>
              <p>The Buddha said that when he is no longer around, then let the Dhamma be the guide. In this case, suttas like Mahasatipatthana Sutta and other suttas comes in handy for sincere practitioners. And of course, the Sangha (the enlightened beings in the sangha) as well, can be a valuable source of guidance and experience for other practitioners.</p>
              <p>Why do I say compassion is natural? As a matter of fact it motivates everything we do in life, unfortunately it is twisted by the ego into the three poisons.* If you are suffering, do you want to end the suffering? Of course, and you'll do something about it and the response is natural. However because we have a false division of subject and object, me and others, our concern is on the 'me' instead of others. We become concerned about our own well-being than others because of our narrow scope and fixation on the 'me' and 'mine'. If we do not divide into 'me' and 'others', if we let go of self-fixation and expand our awareness, then our compassion becomes more natural and spontaneous. When suffering happens, compassionate action to end suffering will happen and there is no self-centeredness that will hold you back.</p>

              <div class="paragraph Body" style="color: #2c2608; line-height: 20px; opacity: 1;"><em>    As
                      stated earlier, a helpful concept here is compassion, a heart aspect of
                      the practice and reality related to kindness. You see, wherever there
                      is desire there is suffering, and wherever there is suffering there is
                      compassion, the desire for the end of suffering. You can actually
                      experience this. So obviously there is some really close relationship
                      between suffering, desire and compassion. This is heavy but good stuff
                      and worth investigating. </em></div>

                      might conceive of this as compassion having gotten caught in a loop,
                      the loop of the illusion of duality. This is sort of like a dog’s tail
                      chasing itself. Pain and pleasure, suffering and satisfaction always
                      seem to be “over there.” Thus, when pleasant sensations arise, there is
                      a constant, compassionate, deluded attempt to get over there to the
                      other side of the imagined split. This is fundamental attraction. You
                      would think that we would just stop imagining there is a split, but
                      somehow that is not what happens. We keep perpetuating the sense of a
                      split even as we try to bridge it, and so we suffer. When unpleasant
                      sensations arise, there is an attempt to get away from over there, to
                      widen the imagined split. This will never work, because it doesn’t
                      actually exist, but the way we hold our minds as we try to get away
                      from that side is painful. When boring or unpleasant sensations arise,
                      there is the attempt to tune out all together and forget the whole
                      thing, to try to pretend that the sensations on the other side of the
                      split are not there. This is fundamental ignorance and it perpetuates
                      the process, as it is by ignoring aspects of our sensate reality that
                      the illusion of a split is created in the first place.</em></div>

                      yourself and everyone, and then take responsibility for those
                      consequences. It's a tall order and an important practice to engage in,
                      but don't get too obsessive about it. Remember the simplicity of the
                      first training, training in kindness, generosity, honesty and clarity,

              <div class="quote_body"><blockquote>
              <p>Illnesses that cannot be cured by doctors, such as that which
              Thusness encountered, and others like my Taiwanese teacher who also
              encountered an injury that his friends and doctors all thought will
              leave him paralysed for life yet he miraculously healed himself
              through dharma practice within 1-2 weeks are examples of the
              miraculous healing power of dharma if practiced well. However I am
              not sure if this will happen every time and I suppose sometimes, if
              the bad karma is really strong one still cannot avoid certain
              amount of suffering, as even the Buddha and his Arhat disciples are
              known to get sick at times.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The tough part is in knowing clearing when to accept that one's bad karma is really strong. For some, paralysis within 1-2 weeks can be considered strong bad karma. But if one gets cured like your Taiwanese teachr, then you would think you might be foolish for thinking it is strong bad karma.</p>
              <p>So the paradox or irony (correct my vocaubulary if you like) is, if it's really bad, you can't avoid suffering. And you can never know whether this unavoidable certain amount of suffering is actually the original, full amount of suffering that ripens for your bad karma.</p>
              <p>So you can console yourself either foolishly that my karma has been reduced, but without insight knowledge of the actual, full impact of your bad karma, how do you compare and know whether your effects and duration of your strong bad karma has been reduced?</p>
              <p>Only the Buddha and his Arhat disciples can make an accurate and non-biased comparison as to the extent of their suffering for any ripened or soon-to-ripen strong bad karma.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Actually, the instructions taught by Buddha are laid out very
              well in the suttas, for example the Mahasatipatthana Sutta is so
              precise and detailed on the practice of Vipassana as to go into
              every single details on how one is to be mindful of each minutest
              details of our sensate reality so as to realise its true nature,
              and that such a practice is able to result in realisation and
              liberation in a period of 7 days to 7 years of practice (serious
              practice of course). Many people have practiced this today and
              continue to attain liberation or at least gain a high degree of
              insight, which testifies to the success and relevance of such a
              practice to people even in the modern world.</p>
              <p>The Buddha said that when he is no longer around, then let the
              Dhamma be the guide. In this case, suttas like Mahasatipatthana
              Sutta and other suttas comes in handy for sincere practitioners.
              And of course, the Sangha (the enlightened beings in the sangha) as
              well, can be a valuable source of guidance and experience for other
              practitioners.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Then it is quite sad that this sutta is not widely published and distributed enough to beginner Buddhists through temples or affliliated organisations. Since this sutta is so precise, detailed and clearly beneficial even within short time span, then more talks should be held not only to promote awareness, but to clear doubts and help plant seeds of motivation for serious practice among Buddhists. I mean such a good sutta should not only be confined to meditation classes in temples or any Buddhist organisation.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Why do I say compassion is natural? As a matter of fact it
              motivates everything we do in life.* If you are suffering, do you
              want to end the suffering? Of course, and you'll do something about
              it and the response is natural. However because we have a false
              division of subject and object, me and others, our concern is on
              the 'me' instead of others. We become concerned about our own
              well-being than others because of our narrow scope and fixation on
              the 'me' and 'mine'. If we do not divide into 'me' and 'others', if
              we let go of self-fixation and expand our awareness, then our
              compassion becomes more natural and spontaneous. When suffering
              happens, compassionate action to end suffering will happen and
              there is no self-centeredness that will hold you back.</p>
              <p><em>*Dharma Dan:</em></p>
              <div style="color: #2c2608; line-height: 20px;"><em>    As stated earlier, a helpful concept
              here is compassion, a heart aspect of the practice and reality
              related to kindness. You see, wherever there is desire there is
              suffering, and wherever there is suffering there is compassion, the
              desire for the end of suffering. You can actually experience this.
              So obviously there is some really close relationship between
              suffering, desire and compassion. This is heavy but good stuff and
              worth investigating.</em></div>
              <div style="color: #2c2608; line-height: 20px;"><br></div>
              <div style="color: #2c2608; line-height: 20px;"><em>    We might conceive of this as compassion
              having gotten caught in a loop, the loop of the illusion of
              duality. This is sort of like a dog’s tail chasing itself. Pain and
              pleasure, suffering and satisfaction always seem to be “over
              there.” Thus, when pleasant sensations arise, there is a constant,
              compassionate, deluded attempt to get over there to the other side
              of the imagined split. This is fundamental attraction. You would
              think that we would just stop imagining there is a split, but
              somehow that is not what happens. We keep perpetuating the sense of
              a split even as we try to bridge it, and so we suffer. When
              unpleasant sensations arise, there is an attempt to get away from
              over there, to widen the imagined split. This will never work,
              because it doesn’t actually exist, but the way we hold our minds as
              we try to get away from that side is painful. When boring or
              unpleasant sensations arise, there is the attempt to tune out all
              together and forget the whole thing, to try to pretend that the
              sensations on the other side of the split are not there. This is
              fundamental ignorance and it perpetuates the process, as it is by
              ignoring aspects of our sensate reality that the illusion of a
              split is created in the first place.</em></div>
              <div style="color: #2c2608; line-height: 20px;"><br></div>
              <div style="color: #2c2608; line-height: 20px;"><em>    These strict definitions of fundamental
              attraction, aversion and ignorance are very important, particularly
              for when I discuss the various models of the stages of
              enlightenment. Given the illusion, it seems that somehow these
              mental reactions will help in a way that will be permanent.
              Remember that the only thing that will fundamentally help is to
              understand the Three Characteristics to the degree that makes the
              difference, and the Three Characteristics are manifesting right
              here.</em></div>

              suffering motivates everything we do? We could also say that
              everything we do is motivated by compassion, which is part of the
              fundamentally empty nature of reality. That doesn’t mean that
              everything we do is skillful; that is a whole different
              issue.</em></div>

              especially when it involves one's self and all beings. It is sort
              of the flip side of the Second Noble Truth. <strong>The whole problem is
              that “misdirected” compassion, compassion that is filtered through
              the process of ego and its related habits, can produce enormous
              suffering and often does. </strong>It is easy to think of many examples of
              people searching for happiness in the strangest of places and by
              doing the strangest of things. Just pick up any newspaper. The
              take-home message is to search for happiness where you are actually

              there is behind our intentions and actions, the more they reflect
              compassion and the more the results will turn out well. The more
              greed, hatred and delusion or lack of understanding of
              interconnectedness there is behind our intentions and actions, the
