              <p>Thank you for showing respect by answering! The persons you mentioned are forthright, probably too much to you liking. But you have not taken the advantage of this forum by countering their views, instead creating a negative image for yourself. I would rather respect you!</p>
              <p>Please, by all means,study all the holy scriptures of all religions, and ask if you have doubts, if you want to clarify about christianity ask a knowledgeable christian,and buddhism, a knowledgeable buddhist. Get first hand knowledge!Agree to disagree and debate the points, point by point rebuttal.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I thank you again, for being willing to listen! </p>

              <p>I hope you will continue to search for answers within yourself (using suitable Buddhist teachings as your spiritual guide), in addition to what you can physically observe, perceive or apparently understand, from any replies here or elsewhere.</p>
              <p>What is my true purpose or life-long goal in learning or questioning about Buddhism? How will it benefit me after I have decided that the above conclusion is true or false for any reason? Will I become a mere religious cynic or someone's who's anti-religion? Or will I become a religious extremist, for example? Just some questions to ask so that we can help keep any of our subtle negative mental and emotional fluctations in check.</p>
              <p>Unlike monotheistic religious teachings which emphasise absolute ownership rights of a Creator God, Buddhism is always about understanding the truths within and around us, to use the wisdom gained from the Buddha's teachings to guide us on the path towards lasting happiness.</p>
              <p>When one does not understand, one is always under the control of not only others in various ways known or unknown to us, but also under the control of ignorance, frustration and greed for power inside our own minds. This applies to me as well.</p>
              <p>When talking about 'control', its definition differs from person to person and is contextual. Is our government controlling us? Are our parents controlling us? Are our spouses and kids controlling us? Are our friends, colleagues and bosses controlling us? And vice versa, are we controlling any one in either groups?</p>
              <p>One important question to the suggested relevation about religious organisations trying to control its followers might be this, so as to help viewing the matter from other angles: How can I contribute to a better and gradual mindset change in such organisations, if I think what I see or experience is indeed true? Do I want to take the first step to contribute as much as I can, no matter how little, no matter how tiring and thankless it may be, to help bring about what I have understood to be healthy religious views and attitudes etc? Can I see myself doing this till the day I breathe my last?</p>
              <p>Ultimately, one can only change oneself. We can only lead by personal example. But take note that even so, others have the right to choose whether to follow.</p>

              <p>IMOHO.. i think the issue with religious tension primarily stems from the general attitude people have towards their religion.  when a person decides to be a christian/buddhist..etc, we treat it like acquiring another worldly possession in life, like buying a new car, upgrading to bigger house, joining a prestigious country club. </p>
              <p>...religious tension will persists so long as spiritual practice is not integrated into one's daily life and people still treat their religion at a superficial level like any of their worldly possessions - something to be acquired, polished and displayed at the shelf for showing off to the neighbours and friends.</p>
              <p>just a thought.  people may treat it as pure nonsense when you say that the earth is round before the actual scientific discovery is made.  but the earth do not need this belief or proof to be round since it has always been so.  the only one that needs the belief and the proof is the ego.  spiritual practice is something like that.</p>

              <p>I can relate to the above since I have also reflected on the issue from this angle. What is published and universally accepted to be 'scientific facts' now, may be challenged and overturned by later, more in-depth scientific discoveries.</p>
              <p>Science is continuous human exploration of and experimentation with nature. What we know now will never be perfect or absolutely complete. Our present scientific knowledge can at best be considered parts of a humanly inconceivable jigsaw puzzle of natural or supernatural phenomena.</p>

              <p>I hope you will continue to search for answers within yourself
                  (using suitable Buddhist teachings as your spiritual
                  guide), in addition to what you can physically observe,
                  perceive or apparently understand, from any replies here or
                  elsewhere.</p>
              <p>What is my true purpose or life-long goal in learning
                  or questioning about Buddhism? How will it benefit me
                  after I have decided that the above conclusion is true or
                  false for any reason? Will I become a mere religious
                  cynic or someone's who's anti-religion? Or will I become a
                  religious extremist, for example? Just some questions to
                  ask so that we can help keep any of our subtle
                  negative mental and emotional fluctations in check.</p>
              <p>Unlike monotheistic religious teachings which emphasise absolute
                  ownership rights of a Creator God, Buddhism is always about
                  understanding the truths within and around us, to use the
                  wisdom gained from the Buddha's teachings to guide us on
                  the path towards lasting happiness.</p>
              <p>When one does not understand, one is always under the control of
                  not only others in various ways known or unknown to us, but also
                  under the control of ignorance, frustration and greed for power
                  inside our own minds. This applies to me as well.</p>
              <p>When talking about 'control', its definition differs from person
                  to person and is contextual. Is our government controlling us? Are
                  our parents controlling us? Are our spouses and kids controlling
                  us? Are our friends, colleagues and bosses controlling us? And vice
                  versa, are we controlling any one in either groups?</p>
              <p>One important question to the suggested relevation
                  about religious organisations trying to control its
                  followers might be this, so as to help viewing the matter
                  from other angles: How can I contribute to a better and
                  gradual mindset change in such organisations, if I think what
                  I see or experience is indeed true? Do I want to take the first
                  step to contribute as much as I can, no matter how little, no
                  matter how tiring and thankless it may be, to help
                  bring about what I have understood to be healthy
                  religious views and attitudes etc? Can I see myself doing this till
                  the day I breathe my last?</p>
              <p>Ultimately, one can only change oneself. We can only lead by
                  personal example. But take note that even so, others have the
                  right to choose whether to follow.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I can relate to the above since I have also reflected on
                  the issue from this angle. What is published and universally
                  accepted to be 'scientific facts' now, may be challenged
                  and overturned by later, more in-depth scientific
                  discoveries.</p>
              <p>Science is continuous human exploration of and experimentation
                  with nature. What we know now will never be perfect or absolutely
                  complete. Our present scientific knowledge can at best be
                  considered parts of a humanly inconceivable jigsaw puzzle of
                  natural or supernatural phenomena.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I hope you will continue to search for answers within yourself
              (using suitable Buddhist teachings as your spiritual
              guide), in addition to what you can physically observe,
              perceive or apparently understand, from any replies here or
              elsewhere.</p>
              <p>What is my true purpose or life-long goal in learning
              or questioning about Buddhism? How will it benefit me
              after I have decided that the above conclusion is true or
              false for any reason? Will I become a mere religious
              cynic or someone's who's anti-religion? Or will I become a
              religious extremist, for example? Just some questions to
              ask so that we can help keep any of our subtle
              negative mental and emotional fluctations in check.</p>
              <p>Unlike monotheistic religious teachings which emphasise absolute
              ownership rights of a Creator God, Buddhism is always about
              understanding the truths within and around us, to use the
              wisdom gained from the Buddha's teachings to guide us on
              the path towards lasting happiness.</p>
              <p>When one does not understand, one is always under the control of
              not only others in various ways known or unknown to us, but also
              under the control of ignorance, frustration and greed for power
              inside our own minds. This applies to me as well.</p>
              <p>When talking about 'control', its definition differs from person
              to person and is contextual. Is our government controlling us? Are
              our parents controlling us? Are our spouses and kids controlling
              us? Are our friends, colleagues and bosses controlling us? And vice
              versa, are we controlling any one in either groups?</p>
              <p>One important question to the suggested relevation
              about religious organisations trying to control its
              followers might be this, so as to help viewing the matter
              from other angles: How can I contribute to a better and
              gradual mindset change in such organisations, if I think what
              I see or experience is indeed true? Do I want to take the first
              step to contribute as much as I can, no matter how little, no
              matter how tiring and thankless it may be, to help
              bring about what I have understood to be healthy
              religious views and attitudes etc? Can I see myself doing this till
              the day I breathe my last?</p>
              <p>Ultimately, one can only change oneself. We can only lead by
              personal example. But take note that even so, others have the
              right to choose whether to follow.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I can relate to the above since I have also reflected on
              the issue from this angle. What is published and universally
              accepted to be 'scientific facts' now, may be challenged
              and overturned by later, more in-depth scientific
              discoveries.</p>
              <p>Science is continuous human exploration of and experimentation
              with nature. What we know now will never be perfect or absolutely
              complete. Our present scientific knowledge can at best be
              considered parts of a humanly inconceivable jigsaw puzzle of
              natural or supernatural phenomena.</p>

              <p><strong>Sorry, I don't believe in the supernatural. That is invented by some people to cash in on human failings (propensity to believe in the supernatural without any valid evidence of the supernatural) of some people (actually most people). </strong></p>

              <p>Though what you said is not wrong, that is also not what I am talking about.</p>
              <p>What I mean is that everything, the world as such, is a vivid presence, the manifestation of our true nature that cannot be denied. Though vividly appearing, it is empty of inherent existence. It does not deny reality, but that reality is also empty.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Realising non-dual luminous Awareness (a.k.a reality) without 
                  perceiver/perceived division or realising 'oneness with universe' is 
                  only half the story, equally important is realising the empty nature of 
                  Presence. The essence is luminous, its nature is empty, its energy is 
                  expression/manifestation. These three aspects are inseparable. After Thusness Stage 4 (Brahman is the World) is the realisation that there is no ultimate, independent and permanent Brahman that is 'one with the World', there is just manifestation, transient flow of phenomena and events. That is Thusness Stage 5, and that is the Emptiness of Self (self and Self). Furthermore, there is the realisation that all Dharmas, phenomena, are themselves empty which is Stage 6. Together they are called the twofold emptinesses in Buddhism, the Emptiness of Self and the Emptiness of Dharmas.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Regarding the emptiness of dharmas: For example if we were to observe a red flower that is so vivid, clear and right
                                                           in front us, the “redness” only appears to “belong” to the flower, it 
                                                          is in actuality not so. Vision of red does not arise in all animal 
                                                          species (dogs cannot perceive colours) nor is the “redness” an inherent 
                                                          attribute of the mind. If given a “quantum eyesight” to look into the 
                                                          atomic structure, there is similarly no attribute “redness” anywhere 
                                                          found, only almost complete space/void with no perceivable shapes and 
                                                          forms. Whatever appearances are dependently arisen, and hence is empty 
                                                          of any inherent existence or fixed attributes, shapes, form, or 
                                                          “redness” -- merely luminous yet empty, mere appearances without 
                                                          inherent/objective existence.</p>
              <p>Hence everything is vivid yet empty and without substance, like a mirage, like a magick trick, like an illusion but NOT an illusion, like a dream but NOT a dream, for there is no other separate reality apart from these shimmering mirage-like display of pure awareness, which does not disappear in enlightenment but can only be correctly perceived.</p>

              <p>In the Hindu school of Advaita Vedanta, there are three steps or three kinds of realisations, quoting from its founder Shankara and modern day revivalist Ramana Maharshi: 1) The World is Illusory, 2) Brahman alone is Real, 3) Brahman is the World.</p>
              <p>Many people go through step 1 and 2 and stopped. They realised their true self but does not know that Brahman is the World, it is not separate. AndrewPKYap probably goes to Step 3.</p>
              <p>But the point is, in Buddhism, even if we realise non-dual presence as in 'Brahman is the World', even that presence is empty in nature.</p>
              <p>Non-dual awareness does not have any sort of <span>ultimate, 
              changeless and
                                              independent characteristic, like Brahman
               or God. Awareness is not more ultimate than the transient mind.</span></p>
              <p>As Jamber rightly said, <em>It seems like at the relative level, 
              the egoistic "I" who's
                                          learning the Dharma is choosing its one-way 
                  suicidal trip to
                                          oblivion.  Realization along the path will 
              burn 
                  away every
                                          last traces of the egoistic I and all its 
                  notions about the world
                                          until at the end, neither realization nor 
              the 
                  egoistic I remains.
                                           What's left is just the original reality as
               it 
                  is, but in the
                                          end, there isn't even any object of 
              "original 
                  reality" that can be
                                          pinned down.  Just a magical display of 
              whatever
                   there is, as
                                          it is.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That is why Buddhism is not the same as other religions. However emptiness in Buddhism should NOT be misunderstood as Advaita's step one, 'the world is illusory'. It's different.</p>
