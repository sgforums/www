              <p><strong>There is no need to be specific. Anything that you believe but you have no evidence to back it up. There were never any research done to prove or disprove the beliefs. It is impossible to prove or disprove the beliefs.</strong></p>

              <p>I believed the Buddha never said the world is a illusion. In fact, the nature of our 'world' is such that it cannot be defined or explain by mere concepts.</p>
              <p>But I do believe that a teaching or practice can only be beneficial or good if we've experienced it and find it to be beneficial towards us. Even so, our wisdom are limited in the sense that not even what we thought is beneficial could really be beneficial after all.</p>
              <p>I personally don't believe in chanting. I believe in practicing in your daily life. I think it doesn't matter what words you chant, but as long as you recite a passage with enough conviction/faith/belief, you'll feel 'at peace'. It can be a Christian prayer or Muslim prayer or even a child's written composition.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, if the chanting does serve to bring a person's mind to calm down for the time being, that is a 'real' benefit isn't it?</p>

              <p>Chanting does create a positive vibration. It can only be felt by self. What do you think of those knocking on the wooden fish during chanting? To me, i feel that this is a form of concentration exercise, part of the "perfect concentration" in the eight fold path.</p>
              <p>There are many medication for one illness, you will just have to find one that is most suitable for you. I do agree with some of the supertition in buddhism, so with the others too. some may be good others otherwise.</p>
              <p>Take the example of burning joss paper and paper houses, paper dolls. This may not have been buddhist teaching but went it was introduced to replace the burying the live persons, I see the compassion in it.</p>

              <p>Hi Andrew PKYap,  consider yourself blessed with a discriminating mind before you get involved in religion. Most, if not all are usually born in a home and community of a certain faith. Most of the time,before everybody take  an interest in religion,everybody follows what is shown to them. Until the mind is aroused and awakens, everybody goes through the motion of religion, going to school,do things peer group do, going to work. </p>
              <p>This a not a solely a Buddhist phenomenon, most do the same things, chanting the same slogans etc.</p>

              <p><strong>Reading your posts, I realise that the "problem" is so huge I really do not know where to start.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>One thing I get is that all the posts are subjective. The "try it and you will know it" "I have experienced it personally" variety. The Christians will similarly tell you "I have experienced the love of Jesus"</strong></p>
              <p><strong>When you do that, when you are so subjective, you open yourself to delusions.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>First of all, the human mind cannot be trusted.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>I won't go into many details but just think:</strong></p>
              <p><strong>1. You do not have perfect knowledge</strong></p>
              <p><strong>2. You do not have perfect intelligence</strong></p>
              <p><strong>3. You do not know what you do not know</strong></p>
              <p><strong>4. You cannot see what you cannot see</strong></p>
              <p><strong>So how to trust yourself and your experiences? How do you know that it is not your delusion? If you are not a dualistic person you will know that there is "more delusional" and "less delusional".</strong></p>
              <p><strong>So while it is impossible not to be delusional (I know it might be hard for you to grasp the concept that everyone is definitely delusional, only more or less so, and it is hard for you to accept that people and you, are basically delusional, given the limitations of the human mind), you can be less d</strong><strong>elusional.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>So whatever it is that you think and experienced, the first thing you do is to ask yourself: "How do I know it is not my delusion?"</strong></p>

              <p>Chanting does create a positive vibration. It can only be felt

              <p>Take the example of burning joss paper and paper houses, paper

              <p>I believed the Buddha never said the world is a illusion. In
              fact, the nature of our 'world' is such that it cannot be defined
              or explain by mere concepts.</p>
              <p>But I do believe that a teaching or practice can only be
              beneficial or good if we've experienced it and find it to be
              beneficial towards us. Even so, our wisdom are limited in the sense
              that not even what we thought is beneficial could really be
              beneficial after all.</p>
              <p>I personally don't believe in chanting. I believe in practicing
              in your daily life. I think it doesn't matter what words you chant,
              but as long as you recite a passage with enough
              conviction/faith/belief, you'll feel 'at peace'. It can be a
              Christian prayer or Muslim prayer or even a child's written
              composition.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, if the chanting does serve to bring a person's
              mind to calm down for the time being, that is a 'real' benefit
              isn't it?</p>

              <p>It is just like someone tells me that this medicine will cure
              gastric. How do I prove that the medicine really works?  I
              will only know if I take the medicine. Only then I can tell whether
              the person who told me is speaking the truth.</p>

              <p><strong>Exactly what the Christians tell you. Believe and accept Jesus and you will know that it is true. Why don't you? Why are you a Buddhist?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The human mind is delusional in nature. You need to verify and validate your assumptions.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>How do you know that it is the medicine that cured you and not your body naturally cured itself?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Therefore, you need to read up on the research done on the medicine. Therefore you need objective verification and evidence of your beliefs.</strong></p>
