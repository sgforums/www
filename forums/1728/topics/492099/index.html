              to let go of 'conditional thinking'</span></strong></p>

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;">We often take actions to get
              a result other than the action itself. This is what I call “conditional
              thinking,” doing something to get something else. For example, we may work to
              get money so we can take a trip to relax. This type of behavior is typically
              benign and is often our normal mode of operation, but problems can occur when
              we take potentially harmful actions without addressing the underlying cause –
              for example, consuming toxic substances to lessen our anxiety and stress.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>It can be a powerful
              practice to become more aware of our conditional behavior so that we might
              avoid actions that are harmful to ourselves and others. Awareness of
              conditional action can also result in greater satisfaction in the action
              itself: gardening to garden, listening to listen, playing to play.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>I’ve practiced meditation
              for years and now I teach it. One idea that I’ve been contemplating lately is,
              what is the goal, if any, of meditation? This very question is, of course, a
              type of conditional thinking.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>The number of legitimate
              scientific studies that suggest meditation is beneficial has become staggering.
              As I’ve written before, even a modest practice of meditation has benefits
              ranging from improving concentration to modifying the DNA of our cells so that
              we might live longer.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Consequently there’s been a
              lot of interest in the practice of meditation. When some new trend is touted by
              both Oprah and the U.S. military, that’s a sign it has captured the zeitgeist
              of the times. Companies as diverse as Apple and Procter &amp; Gamble have
              jumped on the bandwagon, too, hoping not to miss out on the newest, greatest
              practice that purports to increase productivity, health and happiness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>The problem is, however,
              that many of these proponents of meditation are trying to extract something
              from the practice. And here can be the rub. Attempting to force a condition on
              the practice of meditation changes it to just another consumptive behavior.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Recently a friend came to me
              and told me she’d started practicing meditation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>“I am really enjoying
              meditating; it makes me feel so relaxed,” she said over coffee.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>I nodded in agreement.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>She continued. “But I’m
              wondering how long I have to practice like this to get the long-term benefits?”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'> “I’m not sure what you mean,” I said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>“I mean, it takes 15 to 20
              minutes to meditate every day,” she said. “I’m hoping that I can do this for a
              few months and then get back to my normal life.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>I didn’t know what to say.
              In my experience the practice of meditation is as natural and normal as
              brushing my teeth, so I just shook my head and shrugged.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>What I practice and teach is
              a form of meditation that has its roots in the Buddhist VipassanÄ� tradition but
              also pulls from my experience as a Catholic and my studies into world
              religions, including Judaism, Native American rituals and Hinduism. My practice
              also pulls from the philosophic traditions of Greek, German, French and English
              as well as the Zen poets.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>At the core of my meditative
              practice are three elements: 1) open awareness, 2) nonjudgmental observation
              and 3) compassionate listening to ourselves and others. Each of these three guidelines
              provides a framework that seems to foster peacefulness. Is the condition of my
              practice then peacefulness? Tough to answer definitively, but certainly it’s a
              possibility. However, if you spend time contemplating these three elements in a
              quiet setting, you may find that you actually let go of the conditions and
              instead become intensely connected and at ease with the world around you. So
              then are connection and ease the goals? Again, tough to answer.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Have you ever been doing
              something, perhaps a project or hobby, during which you find yourself joyfully
              lost in the activity to the point where you lose track of time? These are often
              moments of doing something not for some personal gain but instead doing the
              activity for the activity itself. Authors who have written on the subject have
              called these moments “flow” or “single-mindedness” and many other labels. I
              think of these moments as embracing the non-conditional, just doing the thing
              for the doing itself.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Living with more
              non-conditional activity in my life has let me observe and reflect on a few of
              my behaviors that have resulted in suffering for myself and others, such as
              when I drink too much wine or eat too many desserts. When I loosen my grip on
              the outcome and focus instead on the action itself, I find myself more
              flexible, healthy and able to adapt to what is an ever-changing environment,
              which gives me a great feeling of peace.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Does living more
              non-conditionally mean moving to a yurt, going vegan and throwing away your
              shoes. I don’t know, maybe. But for now, at least for me, I am happy with my
              indoor plumbing and tennis shoes.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>So is the goal of my
              meditation to get rid of conditional thinking? Absolutely not. But practicing
              under these guidelines has provided me insight into when I am acting conditionally,
              and when I observe these actions over time I’ve found that I can then work to
              better understand why I am taking actions that in some cases may be causing
              more harm than good.</span></p>

              <p>The purpose of meditation to me is to achieve equipoise, mental acuity in a relaxed state. To be relaxed is be sustainable, and not overly preoccupied.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Concentration, observation(without premise) and inquiry, not unlike trying erecting a pole staff with three ropes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Conditionality, looking from an angle of as ; an aspect of karma, for so long as one interacts, there is conditionality.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The key is whether it is a habitual(learned) response, karma forming or not, or simply just simultaneous response. Perhaps an differentiation of learned and simultaneous response is in order, after a performance, we clap, giving the middle finger when indignant ,these are learned. We scratch when itchy, or rub our hands when cold, biting our nails when nervous etc. those are simultaneous.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Being aware these minor habits may  tell us something of our propensities, karmic afflictions, shallow and deepset</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We simply becomes more aware of different aspect and processes of mind that takes place. Remember, the five aggregates forming mind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Only with mental acuity do we  see a subtle labelling (wholesome/ unwholesome) while we are responding to an interaction. We see instinctive mental reaction based on our learned(cumulative) values. This mental reaction precedes emotional labelling(feeli. We learn what pushes our buttons.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thus, by "seeing" our instinctive values, we prevent ourselves from being and acting judgemental, preventing karmic propensities and repercussions. Gradually, we no longer habitually reinforce our instinctive values and response.</p>
