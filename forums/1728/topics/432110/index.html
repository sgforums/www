Hordes of religious fanatics descend upon the weak, senile, silent and dying; groping for a coerced conversion through squeeze of a hand, nod of a head or consent interpreted from silent bewilderment. Some went so far as to threaten  them with denial of care and provision. Have respect for a person's lifelong faith. A vulnerable person shouldn't be subjected to fear, coercion and aggression during his or her final days. Please support this petition to make deathbed conversions a punishable offense.

              <p>Converting people at deathbed is just sending them to hell. Don't believe, these people may ask those people with 3rd eye or people who have loved ones who were converted at deathbed. Many came back to haunt their loved ones in their dream telling them their souls were suffering. I've heard many true stories.</p>
              <p>I read an article about how these people evangelise in poor countries. They did the same thing like what they did to those vulnerable people at deathbed. They took advantage of their plight. They denied them food and drinks unless they converted.</p>

              <p>Cos you had a confused mind thus it contradicts painstakingly. If I am a muslim or pray Lord Jesus, I would go to western paradise. For example, Catholic, Christian and Muslim are having the same directions to same place of bliss of god's land or in Buddhism known as Western Paradise. So, when christian evangelising muslim, they are contradicting the principle of Jesus.  There is different in appearances in the eyes of mankind, whereas in the eyes of God, they sees equal love in them. There is only one piece of pureland, if you divide them, your heart is divided, and thus you would feel pain. Unethical Conversion on appearances of mere ceremony does not work well although good intent, conversion of heart into love work and is most important. Sometimes, you may like to be a little patient and wait for their next life to convert them, be patient, that's the key <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>The different of charitable personality of bodhisavattas is unconditional, there is no denial of care and provision because they sees living beings as bodhisavattas while doing the routine chore of charity as though they are having candle-light lunch<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>While the request for people to petition to make unethical conversion a punishable offence have some merits, more should be articulated about mental anquish, the right to one's own personal beliefs without coercions or undue pressure, and whether how it is enshrined in our constition.</p>
              <p>Whether it is morally acceptable to impose own personal beliefs on others, and also those close to us, like our parents or our children. With children, especially those of your own, you impose your values without question, as part of their inheritance, maybe until they are of the questioning age. </p>
              <p>Also, this evangelising is specially targetted at a one or a few of the denominations, especially at their inability to empathize and respect the individua'sl or their familie's right to belief and personal space. It all seems too much like a memberhip drive to an exclusive club.</p>
              <p>Most people identify themselves with a religion, but that does not make them an expert on their religion. It is just a makeup of beliefs with they inherit and evolve. Many attach to that without fully examining  or understanding this makeup of beliefs and ideas, it just is.</p>
              <p>So when confronted with protelyzing elements, they are unable to articulate their position, making them confused and angry. This phenomena at protelyzing is not new, it's been around longer than I've been around. And it been increasing segregating the populace, and reaction to it has been getting more vocal.</p>
              <p>Usually this means that this issue have never been fully addressed,seen to be glossed or swept under, at most, to some, a slap on the wrist,therefore, noises are getting louder.</p>
              <p> However, guiding principles must acknowledged and accepted  as on how and when to share beliefs. What that is deemed acceptable and what that deemed is not. </p>

              <p>Cos you had a confused mind thus it contradicts painstakingly. If I am a muslim or pray Lord Jesus, I would go to western paradise. For example, Catholic, Christian and Muslim are having the same directions to same place of bliss of god's land or in Buddhism known as Western Paradise. So, when christian evangelising muslim, they are contradicting the principle of Jesus.  There is different in appearances in the eyes of mankind, whereas in the eyes of God, they sees equal love in them. There is only one piece of pureland, if you divide them, your heart is divided, and thus you would feel pain. Unethical Conversion on appearances of mere ceremony does not work well although good intent, conversion of heart into love work and is most important. Sometimes, you may like to be a little patient and wait for their next life to convert them, be patient, that's the key <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>The different of charitable personality of bodhisavattas is unconditional, there is no denial of care and provision because they sees living beings as bodhisavattas while doing the routine chore of charity as though they are having candle-light lunch<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p><br>Christians evangelise because the bible tells them non believers go to hell so must evangelise. The bible also tell them to share gospel.</p>
              <p>Muslims do dawah to christians cos their Koran tells them Jesus is a prophet and not God/Son of God.And he did not die for the sins of mankind. Muslims do dawah to christians in the west.</p>
              <p>Christians and muslims had fought for jurusalem which both religions consider jurusalem to be holy.</p>
              <p>I have met christians and muslims sharing their religions with me.</p>

              <p>The reason why they are so eager to share the gospel and converting others is they have to obey god. The bible tells them to share the gospel and they must obey. They believe they will be blessed if they can convert as many people as possible. In another words, to convert you is also for their own good.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Voltaire's last words: "For God's sake, let me die in peace."  Would like to add on, "...... and with dignity and integrity." All beings, including the weak, senile, silent and dying, need to be respected. Yet, unethical and/or deadbed conversion is doing the opposite.</div>
