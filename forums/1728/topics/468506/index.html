              <p>"Monks, suppose there was a man whose life span was 100 years, who 
              would live to 100. Someone would say to him, 'Look here, fellow. They 
              will stab you at dawn with 100 spears, at noon with 100 spears, &amp; 
              again at evening with 100 spears. You, thus stabbed day after day with 
              300 spears, will have a lifespan of 100 years, will live to be 100, and 
              at the end of 100 years you will realize the four noble truths that you 
              have never realized before.'</p>
              <p>"Monks, a person who desired his own true benefit would do well to 
              take up (the offer). Why is that? From an inconceivable beginning comes 
              transmigration. A beginning point is not evident for the (pain of) blows
               from spears, swords, &amp; axes. Even if this (offer) were to occur, I 
              tell you that the realization of the four noble truths would not be 
              accompanied by pain &amp; distress. Instead, I tell you, the realization
               of the four noble truths would be accompanied by pleasure &amp; 
              happiness.</p>
              <p>"Which four? The noble truth of stress, the noble truth of the 
              origination of stress, the noble truth of the cessation of stress, and 
              the noble truth of the path of practice leading to the cessation of 
              stress.</p>
              <p>"Therefore your duty is the contemplation, 'This is stress... This is
               the origination of stress... This is the cessation of stress... This is
               the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress.'"</p>

              <p>To regain human birth one should follow precepts and do only wholesome deeds.<br><br><br><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg">http://www.jenchen.org.sg</a><br><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"> <br> The fundamental teachings of Jen Chen (Humanity Vehicle) Buddhism are 
                          to observe the Five Precepts and to perform the Ten Virtuous Deeds. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Students of Jen Chen 
                          (Humanity Vehicle) Buddhism at the least should endeavour to perform the 
                          Ten Virtuous Deeds, for by constantly performing the Ten Virtuous Deeds 
                          they not only ensure rebirth in the human realm and even rebirth in the 
                          heavens in their next life. As the next step, by cultivating liberation 
                          and practising the Bodhisattva Path, they eventually become Buddha. </span></p>
              <p> ........</p>
              <p><br><br>ALL OF us consider ourselves to be good people. It is because there is no universal consensus as to good or evil that the Buddha defines a standard based on the Truth - the Five Precepts and the Ten Virtuous Deeds.<br><br>The Five Precepts are to refrain from killing, stealing, lying, sexual misconduct, consumption of intoxicants, and the Ten Virtuous Deeds are to refrain from killing, stealing, lying, sexual misconduct, frivolous and meaningless talk, tale bearing, abusive speech, covetousness, ill-will, perverted views. Violating any of these will land one in the three evil realms of transmigration: realm of animals, ghost and hell.<br><br>Observing the Five Precepts and practising the Ten Virtuous Deeds ensure rebirth in the human realm. One who performs the highest grade of the Ten Virtuous Deeds can ascend to heaven. However, this is still not the ultimate because even if one has ascended to the highest heaven - the heaven that is beyond the condition of thinking or not-thinking, and the seeds of evil thoughts sowed in the past mature, one<br>immediately descends to hell. To attain the ultimate, one must not commit evil deeds. One should not be attached to the good deeds that one has committed either. It is in this way that we liberate from transmigration in the six realms. It is because sentient beings do not have principles that the Buddha sets this standard.     digvol4.1-5.jpg (4916 bytes)<br><br>There are two kinds of Buddhists: those who have faith in the Buddha, and those who learn from the Buddha. Generally the broad masses believe that Buddha exists, and they also believe in the Dharma spoken by the Buddha. However, a believer in the Dharma may not put them into practice. As for learning from the Buddha, we emulate the Buddha in all his cultivation and deeds. Not only do we take refuge in and form causes with the Three Treasures, we also need to follow the Buddha in renouncing the worldly life and cultivate until we become Buddha ourselves.<br><br><br></p>

              <p>remember, he said, Buddha's aim is non-attachment, non-extreme. ordinary people at first have attachment to worldly stuff, but after learning buddhism, they become attached to Buddhism, that's also not right. it's only shifting the target of attachment, not really getting rid of attachment. </p>
