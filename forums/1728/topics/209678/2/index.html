Meaning it is impossible for you to stop discriminating completely and you will suffer the consequences. An an arhant and a bodhisattva and a buddha cannot possibly 'kill babies for fun'. If you see the entire 'Kosmos' as yourself (nonduality), will you have fun killing yourself? That is only for mentally unsound people, and mentally unsound people cannot stop their discrimination and suffering, and that is why they are unsound.<br><br>Furthermore there must be compassion. <a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendid=75842859" rel="nofollow">http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendid=75842859</a><br>On the right hand panel, play the second video from the top.

Every damned thing I'd ever read in a Buddhist book was confirmed that day. The Universe was me and I was the Universe. I looked up at the sky and it was exactly like looking at a mirror. I don't mean that metaphorically either. You know the feeling of recognition you get when you look in a mirror? That's me, you say. Well I got that feeling no matter where I looked. There was no doubt that this state was true. I had no need to confirm it with anyone. And this state has stayed with me ever since then. Even if I want to put it down I can't. <strong>Sometimes it's painful. You know those assholes that rammed those planes into the World Trade Center? That was me. The people that died in the collapse. Me again. I don't mean I identify with them or sympathize with them. I mean I am them.</strong> It's impossible to explain, but this isn't a figure of speech or bad poetry. I mean it absolutely literally.<br>"But the Universe is soooooo much bigger than any of that. The sky is me, and the stars too, chirping crickets and the songs they make, sparkling rivers, snow and rain, distant solar systems and whoever may live there, it's all me. And it's all you, too." - Brad Warner, author of Hardcore Zen</blockquote>----<br><br><blockquote>Another topic, <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=198803" rel="nofollow">Interesting site about stages of progress</a><br><br>....All the myriad phenomena before his eyes-the old and the young, the honorable and the base, halls and pavilions, verandahs and corridors, plants and trees, mountains and rivers-he regards as his own original, true, and pure aspect. It is just like looking into a bright mirror and seeing his own face in it. If he continues for a long time to observe everything everywhere with this radiant insight, all appearances of themselves become the jeweled mirror of his own house, and he becomes the jeweled mirror of their houses as well. <strong>Dogen Zenji has said: "The experiencing of the manifold dharmas through using oneself is delusion; the experiencing of oneself through the coming of the manifold dharmas is Satori."....</strong></blockquote>So now you know why it's virtually impossible for enlightened people to enjoy sadistic fun.</div>

When we realised that there is really no one there from beginning, knowingness is one clear Presence that is really everything.<br><br>Spiritual journey begins when one first experienced the pure sense of existence.   However when we are unable to fully understand the experience and the implication of dependent origination, we misinterpreted the experience as the Â“I AMÂ”.  The rest of our journey is the unfolding and the further refinement of our understanding of this Â“I AMÂ”.  It will take many years of practice and right conditions for one to come to this realization that the Â‘I AMÂ” is really a mistaken identity.  In fact it is the ultimate block that prevents us from knowing our true nature.<br><br>When Â‘IÂ’ persists, reality is thought-like and conceptual.  When the 'I' subsides, everything is realised as the one Reality.  There is no crystal clear mirror reflecting anything, the manifestation itself is sufficient.
