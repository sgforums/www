This is I AM. I also thought so too in the past... until Thusness probed me to re-investigate the dynamics in deep meditation again.<br><br>Truth is, there is no observer.

            <div class='col-md body'>Smart Ananda pointed out many area where the mind were, but the Buddha deny them all, in Shurangama sutra.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Now you wish to investigate the unsurpassed Bodhi and actually discover your nature.  You should answer my questions with a straightforward mind. The Thus Come Ones of the ten directions escaped birth and death because their minds were straightforward. Since their minds and words were consistently that way, from the beginning, through the intermediate stages to the end, they were never in the least evasive.<br>"Ã�nanda, I now ask you: at the time of your initial resolve, which arose in response to Thus Come OneÂ’s thirty-two hallmarks, what was it that saw those characteristics and who delighted in them?"<br>Ã�nanda said to the Buddha, "World Honored One, this is the way I experienced the delight: I used my mind and eyes.  Because my eyes saw the Thus Come OneÂ’s outstanding hallmarks, my mind gave rise to delight.  That is why I became resolved and wished to extricate myself from birth and death."<br>The Buddha said to Ã�nanda, "It is as you say, that experience of delight actually occurs because of your mind and eyes.  If you do not know where your mind and eyes are, you will not be able to conquer the wearisome mundane defilements.<br>"For example, when a country is invaded by thieves and the king sends out his troops to suppress and banish them, the troops must know where the thieves are.<br>"It is the fault of your mind and eyes that you undergo transmigration. I now ask you specifically about your mind and eyes: where are they now?"<br>Ã�nanda answered the Buddha, "World Honored One, All the ten kinds of beings in the world alike maintain that the mind-consciousness dwells within the body; and as I regard the Thus Come OneÂ’s eyes that resemble blue lotuses, they are on the BuddhaÂ’s face.<br>"I now observe that these prominent organs, four kinds of defiling objects, are on my face, and my mind-consciousness actually is within my body."<br><br>The Buddha said to Ã�nanda, "You are now sitting in the Thus Come OneÂ’s lecture hall.  Where is the Jeta Grove that you are gazing at?"<br>"World Honored One, this great many-storied pure lecture hall is in the Garden of the Benefactor of the Solitary.  At present the Jeta Grove is, in fact, outside the hall."<br>"Ã�nanda, as you are now in the hall, what do you see first?"<br>"World Honored One, here in the hall I first see the Thus Come One, next I see the great assembly, and from there, as I gaze outward, I see the grove and the garden."<br>"Ã�nanda, how are you able to see the grove and the garden."<br>"World Honored One, since the doors and windows of this great lecture hall have been thrown open wide, I can be in the hall and see into the distance."<br>The Buddha said to Ã�nanda, "It is as you say. When one is in the lecture hall and the doors and windows are open wide, one can see far into the garden and the grove. Could someone in the hall not see the Thus Come One and yet see outside the hall?"<br>Ã�nanda answered: "World Honored One, to be in the hall and not see the Thus Come One, and yet see the grove and fountains is impossible."<br>"Ã�nanda, you are like that too.<br>"Your mind is capable of understanding everything thoroughly.  Now if your present mind, which thoroughly understands everything, were in your body, then you should first be aware of what is inside your body.  Could there be beings that first see the inside of their bodies before observing external phenomena?<br>"Even if you cannot see your heart, liver, spleen, and stomach, still, you should be able to clearly perceive the growing of your nails and hair, the twist of your sinews, and the throb of your pulse.  Why donÂ’t you perceive these things?<br>If you cannot perceive your internal organs, how could you perceive what is external to you?<br>"<strong>Therefore you should know that declaring that the aware and knowing mind is inside the body is an impossible statement</strong>."</span><br><br>to cont reading:<br><a href="http://www.buddhistinformation.com/shurangama_sutra.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.buddhistinformation.com/shurangama_sutra.htm</a><br><br>Ananda can point out so many area, ie consider very smart already. nowaday, ppl don't even have His standard.<br><br>/\</div>

Supernatural powers can only be developed through meditative practises, and according to Buddha it is quite a waste of effort to try to develope them on purpose. It should be a byproduct of Precepts, Samadhi and Wisdom cultivation.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Cenarious:</div><div class="quote_body">no self study what, we're all a bunch of soulless things walking around so it wont matter if i killed a bunch of babies<br><br>man i would have gone to taoism if i wanted to be this extreme</div></blockquote>That is not what non-volition/non-action or Wu Wei in Taoism means. In fact non-volition in Taoism is quite similar to Buddhism, where there is action but no doer, which means spontaneity. Spontaneous action, Wei Wu Wei, is liberating. It is true that one who can completely master non-volition (i.e an Arhant) no longer creates karma but that does not mean he will be wreakless in actions. But it does not mean one can escape cause and effect.<br><br>There is a famous story here,<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">After the assembly had departed, Master Pai Chang noticed an old man who stayed behind. The master asked who he was. Â“Not a human being sir, but the spirit of a wild fox. I used to be the head monk here. One day I was asked, Â“Does one who practices still become involved in karma?Â” I replied, Â“No, he is free of karma.Â” For this answer, I earned the karma of being reborn with the spirit of a wild fox for 500 years and have not been able to shake it. Please liberate me by enlightening me on this matter.Â”<br><br>The master said, Â“Go ahead and ask me the same question.Â” So the fox asked, Â“Does one who practices still become involved in karma?Â” Pai Chang replied, <strong>Â“He is not blind to cause and effect.Â”</strong><br><br>The fox was greatly awakened and prostrated before the Master saying, Â“Thank you. Your answer has liberated me from the foxÂ’s body. I live in a hollow on the mountain and would ask you to grant me the usual rites for a dead monk.Â” The next day, Pai Chang climbed the mountain behind his monastery, and in a small grotto, he discovered a dead fox for whom the usual ceremony for a dead monk was held.<br><br>-loosely rendered from The Transmission of the Lamp, this story is also found in other Ch'an collections.

How do we apply this Law of Causality?<br>Using the family to illustrate the Law of Causality, a family is established as a result of the aggregation of causes and conditions. Since the family has already been brought about by these various causes and conditions, we should therefore live peacefully and joyfully as a family. Fulfilling this positive causality for the family will leave us with no regrets in the future.<br><br>We shouldn't reckon presume that 'all forms are empty' (Buddhist philosophy that all things and phenomena are empty because they don't have an independent nature of their own.); you are 'empty', I am also 'empty' and we are all 'empty', and so we don't care about anything. This is wrong. Since all things result from aggregations of causes and conditions we must make good use of these causes and conditions.<br><br>As another example, it is only because I am here to give a Dharma talk that this bouquet of flowers has been prepared. Therefore, we should place these flowers nicely on the table so that people can appreciate them. If while we are admiring the flowers, a person comes by and declares, "Sigh, all phenomena arising from causes and conditions are empty. What use is there in having such a beautiful bouquet of flowers?" He then removes it and throws it away. This person may not be of sound mind, because by now you know about the Law of Causality, and you say that the flowers are empty. But, you are still physically here. You, as a 'person' have not emptied away! So how could you say that the flowers are empty? Therefore, you should diligently learn and practise what the Buddha taught, and cultivate. First of all empty the sentient being (i.e. the arising and ceasing of thoughts and feelings) within you, and then you will not find that things in the world are contradictory.<br><br>So from this, we see how that which is seemingly contradictory in the world, stems from failure to properly grasp the principles. <strong>Because when the principles have not been correctly understood, there cannot be coherence in their application to matters of the world.</strong> This leads to lack of roundedness and harmony in the way we deal with things.</span></blockquote>-------<br><br>[quote]Originally posted by longchen:</div><div class="quote_body">Do not lose the view of the Dharmakaya while in action... or we will not be liberated.<br><br>While in the Dharmakaya viewpoint, do not lose conduct(discriminative right action) or we will accumulate karma.</div></blockquote>-------<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by _wanderer_:</div><div class="quote_body">Basically I think the View refers to the Ultimate View (some call it View of Emptiness, some call it Primordial Wisdom, others call it something else...). I think Padmasambhava is reminding us not to get lost in conduct, thinking that there is "something truly virtuous" to adopt and "something truly nonvirtuous" to abandon in our conduct/actions. This means, while we are adopting virtues and abandoning nonvirtuous we should bear the View of Emptiness in mind, that NO truly existing person is performing any truly existing action towards any truly existing party.<br><br>However, having embraced this View of Emptiness, as what Longchen said, we should not think that we don't need to care about performing virtuous or nonvirtuous actions, because for us the unenlightened beings, we're still bound by karma. So though aware of the "lack of an inherent truly existing nature" of virtues and nonvirtues, we should still try to adopt virtuous behaviour and abandon nonvirtuous behaviour.<br><br>Thanks for all the sharing Longchen, Sinwei and Eternal Now. I found it kinda surprising and very interesting that diff pple have diff interpretations. I believe such sharings can help all of us sharpen our understanding of the Dharma and motivate one another to apply and actualize them. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> </div></blockquote></div>

For example sometimes a song gets caught in your head, can you control it and stop it from arising again? It can even be quite frustrating. But on a higher level of practise, effort is not needed to 'control thoughts'.</div>
