Every damned thing I'd ever read in a Buddhist book was confirmed that day. The Universe was me and I was the Universe. I looked up at the sky and it was exactly like looking at a mirror. I don't mean that metaphorically either. You know the feeling of recognition you get when you look in a mirror? That's me, you say. Well I got that feeling no matter where I looked. There was no doubt that this state was true. I had no need to confirm it with anyone. And this state has stayed with me ever since then. Even if I want to put it down I can't. Sometimes it's painful. You know those assholes that rammed those planes into the World Trade Center? That was me. The people that died in the collapse. Me again. I don't mean I identify with them or sympathize with them. I mean I am them. It's impossible to explain, but this isn't a figure of speech or bad poetry. I mean it absolutely literally.<br>"But the Universe is soooooo much bigger than any of that. The sky is me, and the stars too, chirping crickets and the songs they make, sparkling rivers, snow and rain, distant solar systems and whoever may live there, it's all me. And it's all you, too." - Brad Warner, author of Hardcore Zen</blockquote>wtf i wont wanna be like that</div>

We have been in samsara since no beginning in the past, how can you expect to achieve this in a few years time (let's assume you get to know buddhism for few years only)</div>
