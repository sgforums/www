So even if we are harmed by them, if it benefit them,we don't mind. But of course, once you develop compassion with them, they will feel that and automatically leave you or even help you.<br><br>One thing I don't understand is why some ghosts are afraid of human, not those human that has got the power, but the common people.</div>

We believe in causes and conditions and all happenings are due to the aggregation of causes and conditions... like Isis said, it could be due to a karmic cause.. or it can be others.<br><br>Sometimes a person's mind who is without brightness can easily see these things... it is advisable to chant the Buddha's name often for such a person which will then increase his 'mental brightness' and thus be able to stop seeing them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>purification with constant mindfulness in practicing the precepts illuminates a person and nothing external nor internal could waver him/her into the realm of spirits. spiritual realm is all part of one, all is just in the mind, a thought apart and such separation do self-create to have all sorts of discrimination and unnecessary fears or judging merely based on presumption. karmic affinity plays a role in contact with anyone (anyone refers to both the seen &amp; unseen). precepts do not just lead one to have a better rebirth, i feel it also purifies one and has a great effect on one's progress in spiritual cultivation.<br></div>
