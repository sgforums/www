              often presented as just a technique, and widely claimed to be secularized by
              Western experts.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>Where and how did such a
              perspective emerge? How is this different from the claims in the Eastern Wisdom
              traditions which have a long proven track record in mindfulness meditation –<span> </span><em>beyond just being a technique</em>?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>You have to go back to 16-17
              century Europe where Copernicus and Galileo were up against the all-powerful
              and all-knowing Catholic Church. The Church was based on a set of Beliefs as
              per the bible and interpretations by the Pope and could not be questioned nor
              investigated. There was no space to challenge God’s words. If you did, it cost
              you your career, money or even your life.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>To create space for scientific
              research and scientists, the concept of “secularism” emerged. Secularism
              created space for scientists to investigate, carry out research, propose new
              hypothesis, and argue new theories — but only of the material world. For
              example, it was the brilliant model of a fragmented body-mind-emotions-soul
              proposed by Rene Descartes that allowed scientists to dissect the human body
              and this create a new medical science. The rise of secularism and science led
              them to classify Christianity as set of beliefs and rituals – all based on
              blind faith and which could not be investigated nor verified by scientific
              methods and theories. It was this same set of lens that Westerners then used to
              label Eastern wisdom traditions as a set of beliefs and rituals – all based on
              faith. Until very recently, Western scientists had failed to see and understand
              that Eastern traditions were actually based on a set of practices that could be
              tested and verified – not just a set of beliefs.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>So, fast forward to the 21st
              century. Western scientists without a direct experience of meditation according
              to Eastern Wisdom traditions continue to cling to the mistaken view of yoga and
              meditation as belonging to religions of the East. In essence they still think
              such practices emerge from a set of Eastern Beliefs based on blind faith and
              which cannot be verified. With this view, they then go on to claim that they
              have secularized mindfulness – a key to making it acceptable and digest-able by
              the vast majority of Western consumers. So, by promoting secular mindfulness as
              a standalone technique without any ties Eastern religion it has enabled
              mindfulness to be more widely accepted in the West.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>However, the reality is the the
              fundamental concepts and techniques of mindfulness as currently taught in the
              West is not different from what is taught in the Eastern traditions. Just
              changing the language does not make it secular. But, of course, Western media
              and the public have already bought into this fundamentally flawed label of
              mindfulness as a secular technique aimed at stress management, becoming more
              calm, a better leader, etc. Given the cultural, legal and political context in
              the US, in particular, any linkages to Eastern religion, if proven in the court
              of law, could ban mindfulness from being taught in schools, and possibly from
              mental health therapy.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>In a capitalist, consumer based
              society, increasing customers and sales revenue is essential to be called a
              success. So, mindfulness today is promoted as a STANDALONE technique to reduce
              stress, become more focused and improve your effectiveness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>What is often not publicly
              acknowledged in the West, is that the word “mind” or of awareness and
              consciousness is still not defined, least of all accepted by scientists yet we
              talk as if there is a common meaning of mind. Medical science still accepts and
              practices the 300-year old superstition of Rene Descartes fragmenting the
              mind-emotions and body – despite the evidence. How to break this superstition
              so widely promoted by white coated experts and the pharma-medical complex? How
              to break the monopoly of those Western experts on the nature and meaning of
              mindfulness – when their lens is colored by a biased view of Eastern Wisdom
              traditions as being just a set of beliefs and rituals?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>Western scientists have begun
              to delve into the nature of awareness, consciousness and hence nature of self –
              which they can no longer pretend is just a set of Eastern Beliefs. There seems
              to be a growing recognition that these topics are central to mental health and
              to science in general.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>In the Eastern wisdom
              traditions, mindfulness is the foundation for a larger set of practices and way
              of living that is directly connected with ethics, kindness, positive emotional
              habits and hence can be very perturbing and challenging. In essence,
              mindfulness meditation is not just a technique or tool; rather mindfulness has
              been part of a secular set of practices to transform our patterns of
              thinking-feeling-behaving to realize one’s true potential as a human being.</span></p>

Mindfulness is, however, a </span><em style="box-sizing: border-box; color: #222222; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 18px; -webkit-transition: 0s !important; transition: 0s !important;">specialty</em><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 18px;"> of Buddhism. As Goldstein also notes, the Buddha himself referred to it as “the path to enlightenment.” And so in the 2,600 years since then, many who’ve followed in the Buddha’s footsteps have upheld, skillfully restated, or even innovated upon his mindfulness teachings in to order guide those who would like to live in accord with Buddhist principles.</span></p></div>
