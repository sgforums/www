              <p>Hi Argyle,</p>
              <p>for me, i went temple hopping twice... but end up at the first place...</p>
              <p>I don't know how to explain, sitting there in a sea of strangers and listened to a fa shi i never expected it.</p>
              <p>Listening for clues and don't even know what is taking refuge all about...</p>
              <p>during chanting, i peeped at others which page they are chanting frequently... haha</p>
              <p>I was quite embarrassed to ask questions and so i approached the counter auntie and ask her what is taking refuge and when...</p>
              <p>after taking refuge, all seems to fall in place... chanting and joining some of the activities if i am able to make it..</p>
              <p>but now i am waiting for new intake of class lessons... to study more... now zero knowledge.. haha</p>
              <p>hope u can meet someone who can guide you easier and less troublesome lol</p>

              <p>I frequent this dharma center, which teaches very practical dharma teachings you can apply to your daily life (rather than giving scholarly talks about sutras and so on) so that one may experience freedom, wisdom, awareness, enlightenment even in our daily lives.</p>

              <p>As for fellowship, the people at my dharma center bond very well. We also have activities, outings, etc. There is also different classes - adult class, youth class, children class. Having spiritual friendship is important because we can help and encourage each other on the path.</p>

              <p>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was living among the <a id="sakya" name="sakya">Sakyans</a>. Now there is a Sakyan town named <a id="sakkara" name="sakkara">Sakkara</a>. There <a id="ananda" name="ananda">Ven. Ananda</a> went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to the 
                  Blessed One, sat to one side. As he was sitting there, Ven. Ananda said 
                  to the Blessed One, "This is half of the holy life, lord: admirable 
                  friendship, admirable companionship, admirable camaraderie."<a id="fnt-1" class="noteTag " name="fnt-1" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn45/sn45.002.than.html#fn-1">[1]</a></p>
              <p>"Don't say that, Ananda. Don't say that. Admirable friendship, 
                  admirable companionship, admirable camaraderie is actually the whole of 
                  the holy life. When a monk has admirable people as friends, companions, 
                  &amp; comrades, he can be expected to develop &amp; pursue the noble 
                  eightfold path.</p>
              <p>"<a id="eightfold" name="eightfold">And how</a> does a monk who has 
                  admirable people as friends, companions, &amp; comrades, develop &amp; 
                  pursue the noble eightfold path? There is the case where a monk develops
                   right view dependent on seclusion, dependent on dispassion, dependent 
                  on cessation, resulting in relinquishment. He develops right resolve ...
                   right speech ... right action ... right livelihood ... right effort ...
                   right mindfulness ... right concentration dependent on seclusion, 
                  dependent on dispassion, dependent on cessation, resulting in 
                  relinquishment. This is how a monk who has admirable people as friends, 
                  companions, &amp; colleagues, develops &amp; pursues the noble eightfold
                   path.</p>
              <p>"And through this line of reasoning one may know how admirable 
                  friendship, admirable companionship, admirable camaraderie is actually 
                  the whole of the holy life: It is in dependence on me as an admirable 
                  friend that beings subject to birth have gained release from birth, that
                   beings subject to aging have gained release from aging, that beings 
                  subject to death have gained release from death, that beings subject to 
                  sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair have gained release 
                  from sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair. It is through 
                  this line of reasoning that one may know how admirable friendship, 
                  admirable companionship, admirable camaraderie is actually the whole of 
                  the holy life."</p>

              <p>sorry, i'm a bit on the opposition side from the others. i think nowaday ppl really need <strong>Deligency</strong> and/or maybe encounter some tough surrounding, so u have Enduranceå¿�. once my Dharma senior who use to be æŠ¤æ³• always use this phrase, "è¦�ä½ èƒ½ä¹…!" in hokkien. however he said, he had retrogressed. i'm around there. haha..</p>
              <p>Old MCK also know that those that practice around him are not doing it right, but instead those far away that he had never saw and had been listening to his cd/dvd are the ones that are doing it right. they are the ones that really listen daily all the time, 4-8hrs a day! they are the ones that really get it. He said 5 yrs to 10 years listening to the teachings on one particular sutra, u'll be able to talk/explain on stage.</p>
              <p>Buddha once said, u don't have to be close to Him in order to really learn Dharma.</p>

              <p><em>This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:</em> "Even if a monk, taking hold of my outer cloak, were to follow right behind me, placing his feet in my footsteps, yet if he were to be greedy for sensual pleasures, strong in his passions, malevolent in mind, corrupt in his resolves, his mindfulness muddled, unalert, uncentered, his mind scattered, &amp; his faculties uncontrolled, then he would be far from me, and I from him. Why is that? Because he does not see the Dhamma. Not seeing the Dhamma, he does not see me.</p>
              <p>"But even if a monk were to live one hundred leagues away, yet if he were to have no greed for sensual objects, were not strong in his passions, not malevolent in mind, uncorrupt in his resolves, his mindfulness established, alert, centered, his mind at singleness, &amp; his faculties well-restrained, then he would be near to me, and I to him. Why is that? Because he sees the Dhamma. Seeing the Dhamma, he sees me."</p>

              <p>sorry, i'm a bit on the opposition side from the others. i think nowaday ppl really need <strong>Deligency</strong> and/or maybe encounter some tough surrounding, so u have Enduranceå¿�. once my Dharma senior who use to be æŠ¤æ³• always use this phrase, "è¦�ä½ èƒ½ä¹…!" in hokkien. however he said, he had retrogressed. i'm around there. haha..</p>
              <p>Old MCK also know that those that practice around him are not doing it right, but instead those far away that he had never saw and had been listening to his cd/dvd are the ones that are doing it right. they are the ones that really listen daily all the time, 4-8hrs a day! they are the ones that really get it. He said 5 yrs to 10 years listening to the teachings on one particular sutra, u'll be able to talk/explain on stage.</p>
