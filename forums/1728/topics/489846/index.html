              Chinese authorities have ordered Larung Gar Buddhist Institute in Sertar
              County, in western China’s Sichuan Province, to reduce admissions—in particular
              of nuns, and of monks and nuns from other regions of China—in an effort to curb
              the rapid growth of the monastery’s population.</span></p>

              of Tibet, an independent radio station and website based in Oslo, Norway, and
              Dharamsala, India, quoted an unidentified source as saying that the authorities
              have forced several monks and nuns from the academy and are planning to expel
              more in the coming days. The same source also reported that, “Around 1,000
              monks who study at the monastery are [being] forcefully kept under house arrest
              at a state-run old-age home here in Larung Gar.” (Phayul.com)</span></p>

              Gar Buddhist Institute sits in a valley at an elevation of 13,000 feet and
              about nine miles from the nearest town of Sertar. The nearest large city is
              Chengdu, about 400 miles away. The institute was founded in 1980 by Khenpo
              Jigme Phuntsok (1933–2004), a lama of the Nyingma tradition of Tibetan Buddhism
              and a respected Buddhist teacher. Built in what was then an uninhabited valley,
              the academy has since grown to become perhaps the largest and most important
              center of Buddhist learning in the world. It has an estimated population of
              10,000 monks, nuns, and lay students living in small wooden homes built on the
              hillsides surrounding the monastery complex, although some estimates put the
              number as high as 40,000. </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #2b262a;'>The
              institute has played a key role in revitalizing the teachings of Tibetan
              Buddhism since China eased restrictions on religious practice in 1980. It is
              renowned for the quality of both its religious and secular education. English,
              Chinese, and Tibetan languages and modern computer studies are taught alongside
              a traditional non-sectarian Buddhist curriculum. About 500 <em>khenpos</em>—holders
              of doctoral degrees in divinity—have studied there.</span></p>

              Jigme Phuntsok, himself from Sertar, was born to a family of nomads, and at the
              age of two was identified as the reincarnation of Tertön Sogyal, Lerab Lingpa
              (1856–1926). He was known for keeping a strict focus on Buddhism rather than
              politics at the institute, although he maintained close relations with both the
              Chinese authorities and His Holiness the Dalai Lama.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #2b262a;'>In
              1999, Chinese authorities ordered Khenpo Jigme Phuntsok to reduce the
              population of the institute, at the time numbering 8,800, to 1,400, but he
              refused. In the summer and autumn of 2001, police and military personnel
              forcibly evicted hundreds of nuns and monks and destroyed more than 1,000 homes
              to prevent them from returning. Khenpo Jigme Phuntsok was detained for a year
              following the incident, and in an effort to curb the growth of the institute
              Chinese authorities bulldozed a perimeter road around the site, beyond which
              construction was forbidden. However, despite the space imitations about 1,000
              new huts are built every year.</span></p>

              January 2014, a major fire destroyed about 100 houses of nuns studying at the
              institute. Two nuns were slightly injured in the blaze, which burned for 11
              hours before being brought under control. According to Chinese media reports
              more than 450 rescuers, police, and firefighters attended the scene</span><span style='font-size: 15.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #2b262a;'>.</span><span style='font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #2b262a;'></span></p>
