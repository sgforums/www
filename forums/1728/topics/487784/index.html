              spirit and our health. Stress levels are on the rise. The Harris Poll in 2002
              recorded that tension levels in almost half of Americans had worsened over the
              preceding year. According to the American Institute of Stress, 75 to 90 percent
              of doctors’ visits are for stress-related ailments. Psychological distress such
              as anger, anxiety, and depression seems to be a good predictor of high blood
              pressure, heart attacks, and sudden death. But what is missing from this
              research is the “first cause,” the damaged self—a belief that manifests as
              anger projected for the most part onto others. On one level, this projected
              anger is a defense against one’s “bad self.” On a deeper level, it represents our
              feelings of vulnerability.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">Over 2,500 years ago the Buddha identified anger as one of the three
              poisons that hinder our progress toward liberation from suffering. In the <em>Anumana
              Sutta</em>, a teaching on self-observation, the venerable Mahamoggallana, one of
              the Buddha’s closest disciples, counsels bhikhus against angry thoughts that
              lead to disparaging others. The bhikhus are instructed to refrain from unruly
              behavior such as hypocrisy, mercilessness, jealousy, and selfishness, to name a
              few examples. In the <em>Lekha Sutta</em> the Buddha asserts that there are three
              types of individuals in the world and three ways they manifest anger. First, he
              refers to the individual who is like an inscription on a rock. His anger stays
              with him for a long time. It is not effaced by wind or water. Next, the Buddha
              compares an individual who is often angered, but whose anger does not stay with
              him for a long time, to an inscription in soil that is effaced by wind or
              water. Lastly, the Buddha describes a person who is like water. When this
              individual is spoken to roughly or harshly, he or she remains congenial,
              companionable, and courteous, just as an inscription in water disappears
              immediately.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">After more than 30 years of working first as a therapist and later a
              practitioner of Zen, the poison that stands out the most to me is anger. And
              while I believe that meditation has some transformative power, as a former
              psychotherapist I believe that teachers and spiritual guides need to address
              the role that small mind plays with regard to anger. Meditation enables us to
              see the transparency of our anger, and this is a good start, but we can still
              remain blinded to the mechanics of our anger. The Buddhist teacher and
              psychologist John Welwood asserts that “most of us live caught up in prereflective
              identification most of the time.” In working with dharma students, teachers
              must address the deeper wounds from which anger has sprung. We must enable
              students to see the anger they project onto others as a defense against old
              story lines, such as “I’m damaged, I’m unlovable,” and so on.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">Anger is “habit energy,” to use Thich Nhat Hanh’s term; karmic in its
              origin, it is deeply engrained and deeply rooted. As Welwood says, we imagine
              that our thoughts and feelings are an accurate portrayal of reality and
              therefore justified. If we are to be effective in transmuting our anger into <em>prajna</em> (wisdom), then we must develop an additional measure of psychological insight
              along with our meditation practice that focuses on the cyclical relationship
              between thoughts and our body.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">I saw chronic episodes of anger manifest when I trained former criminal
              offenders in counseling techniques that they could use to redirect youth caught
              up in the criminal justice system. The anger the ex-offenders projected onto
              their clients was cloaked in their judgmental attitude toward them. They were
              hypercritical of behaviors they themselves once engaged in. This behavior
              points to an aspect of anger that we don’t usually think of. We typically
              attribute the source of our anger to someone or something outside of ourselves:
              “I am experiencing great displeasure because it is the ‘other’ who is at
              fault.” The ex-offenders didn’t see their shadow beliefs and resisted
              addressing them. Their anger toward clients was a defense—it allowed them to
              distance themselves from their “bad selves.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">In order to work on anger, we need to employ an approach that
              incorporates psychosocial strategies in the service of spiritual development.
              This approach embraces the transpersonal, personal, and interpersonal.
              Mindfully held anger is a step in the right direction. This approach requires
              that we contain our anger—that we meditatively attend to our anger with an
              emphasis on neither suppressing it nor acting it out. Being present with our
              anger enables us to witness the process of it, which includes all three levels
              of awareness. On the personal level, we witness the felt sense of our anger,
              along with its cognitive and perceptual dimensions. On a social level, we
              witness the effect our shadow beliefs have on our interaction with others. On
              the transpersonal level, we witness the “I,” or who it is who is angry.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">Another approach to dealing with anger on the psycho-social-spiritual
              level is mind-body bridging. This technique enables us to see the impact that
              thoughts have on us viscerally. The prime mover behind the impact thoughts have
              on the body are our requirements: how we should be, how other people should be,
              and how the world should be in order for us to feel acceptable. This approach
              begs the question of how to bring compassion to our anger. It is not easy to
              refrain from repressing or indulging our anger. Our challenge is to embrace it
              with mindfulness and genuine caring.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">We must
              become intimate with anger to clear the way to our connectiveness, to our
              vulnerability and an aliveness to everything. In the end, our anger is
              transmuted to wisdom, which in turn gives rise to compassion.<br> <br> <strong>Jules Shuzen Harris, Sensei</strong> is a Zen teacher in the Soto lineage and the
