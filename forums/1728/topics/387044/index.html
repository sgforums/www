              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Karma 
                  is the 
                              law of moral causation. The theory of Karma is a fundamental
                   doctrine 
                              in Buddhism. This belief was prevalent in India before the 
                  advent 
                              of the Buddha. Nevertheless, it was the Buddha who explained
                   and formulated 
                              this doctrine in the complete form in which we have it 
                  today. </span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> What 
                  is the 
                                cause of the inequality that exists among mankind? <br> Why should one person be brought up in the lap of luxury, 
                  endowed 
                                with fine mental, moral and physical qualities, and 
                  another in absolute 
                                poverty, steeped in misery? <br> Why should one person be a mental prodigy, and another an 
                  idiot? 
                                <br> Why should one person be born with saintly characteristics
                   and another 
                                with criminal tendencies? <br> Why should some be linguistic, artistic, mathematically 
                  inclined, 
                                or musical from the very cradle? <br> Why should others be congenitally blind, deaf, or 
                  deformed?| <br> Why should some be blessed, and others cursed from their 
                  births? </span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Either 
                  this inequality 
                              of mankind has a cause, or it is purely accidental. No 
                  sensible person 
                              would think of attributing this unevenness, this inequality,
                   and this 
                              diversity to blind chance or pure accident. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> In this
                   world 
                              nothing happens to a person that he does not for some reason
                   or other 
                              deserve. Usually, men of ordinary intellect cannot 
                  comprehend the 
                              actual reason or reasons. The definite invisible cause or 
                  causes of 
                              the visible effect is not necessarily confined to the 
                  present life, 
                              they may be traced to a proximate or remote past birth. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> According to 
                              Buddhism, this inequality is due not only to heredity, 
                  environment, 
                              "nature and nurture", but also to Karma. In other words, 
                              it is the result of our own past actions and our own present
                   doings. 
                              We ourselves are responsible for our own happiness and 
                  misery. We 
                              create our own Heaven. We create our own Hell. We are the 
                  architects 
                              of our own fate. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Perplexed by 
                              the seemingly inexplicable, apparent disparity that existed 
                  among 
                              humanity, a young truth-seeker approached the Buddha and 
                  questioned 
                              him regarding this intricate problem of inequality: </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> "What 
                  is 
                              the cause, what is the reason, O Lord," questioned he, "that
                   
                              we find amongst mankind the short-lived and long-lived, the 
                  healthy 
                              and the diseased, the ugly and beautiful, those lacking 
                  influence 
                              and the powerful, the poor and the rich, the low-born and 
                  the high-born, 
                              and the ignorant and the wise?" </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> The 
                  Buddha’s 
                              reply was: </span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> "All 
                  living 
                                beings have actions (Karma) as their own, their 
                  inheritance, their 
                                congenital cause, their kinsman, their refuge. It is Karma
                   that 
                                differentiates beings into low and high states." </span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> He then
                   explained 
                              the cause of such differences in accordance with the law of 
                  cause 
                              and effect. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Certainly we 
                              are born with hereditary characteristics. At the same time 
                  we possess 
                              certain innate abilities that science cannot adequately 
                  account for. 
                              To our parents we are indebted for the gross sperm and ovum 
                  that form 
                              the nucleus of this so-called being. They remain dormant 
                  within each 
                              parent until this potential germinal compound is vitalised 
                  by the 
                              karmic energy needed for the production of the foetus. Karma
                   is therefore 
                              the indispensable conceptive cause of this being. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> The 
                  accumulated 
                              karmic tendencies, inherited in the course of previous 
                  lives, at times 
                              play a far greater role than the hereditary parental cells 
                  and genes 
                              in the formation of both physical and mental 
                  characteristics. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> The 
                  Buddha, for 
                              instance, inherited, like every other person, the 
                  reproductive cells 
                              and genes from his parents. But physically, morally and 
                  intellectually 
                              there was none comparable to him in his long line of Royal 
                  ancestors. 
                              In the Buddha’s own words, he belonged not to the Royal 
                  lineage, 
                              but to that of the Aryan Buddhas. He was certainly a 
                  superman, an 
                              extraordinary creation of his own Karma. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> According to 
                              the Lakkhana Sutta of Digha Nikaya, the Buddha inherited 
                  exceptional 
                              features, such as the 32 major marks, as the result of his 
                  past meritorious 
                              deeds. The ethical reason for acquiring each physical 
                  feature is clearly 
                              explained in the Sutta. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> It is 
                  obvious 
                              from this unique case that karmic tendencies could not only 
                  influence 
                              our physical organism, but also nullify the potentiality of 
                  the parental 
                              cells and genes – hence the significance of the Buddha’s 
                              enigmatic statement, - "We are the heirs of our own 
                  actions." </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Dealing
                   with 
                              this problem of variation, the Atthasalini, being a 
                  commentary on 
                              the Abhidharma, states: </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> "Depending 
                              on this difference in Karma appears the differences in the 
                  birth of 
                              beings, high and low, base and exalted, happy and miserable.
                   Depending 
                              on the difference in Karma appears the difference in the 
                  individual 
                              features of beings as beautiful and ugly, high-born or low 
                  born, well-built 
                              or deformed. Depending on the difference in Karma appears 
                  the difference 
                              in worldly conditions of beings, such as gain and loss, and 
                  disgrace, 
                              blame and praise, happiness and misery." </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Thus, 
                  from a 
                              Buddhist point of view, our present mental, moral 
                  intellectual and 
                              temperamental differences are, for the most part, due to our
                   own actions 
                              and tendencies, both past and present. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Although Buddhism 
                              attributes this variation to Karma, as being the chief cause
                   among 
                              a variety, it does not, however, assert that everything is 
                  due to 
                              Karma. The law of Karma, important as it is, is only one of 
                  the twenty-four 
                              conditions described in Buddhist Philosophy. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Refuting the 
                              erroneous view that "whatsoever fortune or misfortune 
                  experienced 
                              is all due to some previous action", the Buddha said: </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> "So, 
                  then, 
                              according to this view, owing to previous action men will 
                  become murderers, 
                              thieves, unchaste, liars, slanderers, covetous, malicious 
                  and perverts. 
                              Thus, for those who fall back on the former deeds as the 
                  essential 
                              reason, there is neither the desire to do, nor effort to do,
                   nor necessity 
                              to do this deed, or abstain from this deed." </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> It was 
                  this important 
                              text, which states the belief that all physical 
                  circumstances and 
                              mental attitudes spring solely from past Karma that Buddha 
                  contradicted. 
                              If the present life is totally conditioned or wholly 
                  controlled by 
                              our past actions, then certainly Karma is tantamount to 
                  fatalism or 
                              determinism or predestination. If this were true, free will 
                  would 
                              be an absurdity. Life would be purely mechanistic, not much 
                  different 
                              from a machine. Being created by an Almighty God who 
                  controls our 
                              destinies and predetermines our future, or being produced by
                   an irresistible 
                              Karma that completely determines our fate and controls our 
                  life’s 
                              course, independent of any free action on our part, is 
                  essentially 
                              the same. The only difference lies in the two words God and 
                  Karma. 
                              One could easily be substituted for the other, because the 
                  ultimate 
                              operation of both forces would be identical. </span></p>

                  mental

                  all-embracing five 
                              orders or processes which are laws in themselves. Karma as

                  they demand 
                              no lawgiver. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Of 
                  these five, 
                              the physical inorganic order and the order of the norm are 
                  more or 
                              less mechanistic, though they can be controlled to some 
                  extent by 
                              human ingenuity and the power of mind. For example, fire 
                  normally 
                              burns, and extreme cold freezes, but man has walked 
                  scatheless over 
                              fire and meditated naked on Himalayan snows; horticulturists
                   have 
                              worked marvels with flowers and fruits; Yogis have performed
                   levitation. 
                              Psychic law is equally mechanistic, but Buddhist training 
                  aims at 
                              control of mind, which is possible by right understanding 
                  and skilful 
                              volition. Karma law operates quite automatically and, when 
                  the Karma 
                              is powerful, man cannot interfere with its inexorable result
                   though 
                              he may desire to do so; but here also right understanding 
                  and skilful 
                              volition can accomplish much and mould the future. Good 
                  Karma, persisted 
                              in, can thwart the reaping of bad Karma, or as some Western 
                  scholars 
                              prefer to say ‘action influence’, is certainly an intricate 
                              law whose working is fully comprehended only by a Buddha. 
                  The Buddhist 
                              aims at the final destruction of all Karma. </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> The 
                  Pali term 
                              Karma literally means action or doing. Any kind of 
                  intentional action 
                              whether mental, verbal, or physical, is regarded as Karma. 
                  It covers 
                              all that is included in the phrase "thought, word and deed".
                   
                              Generally speaking, all good and bad action constitutes 
                  Karma. In 
                              its ultimate sense Karma means all moral and immoral 
                  volition. Involuntary, 
                              unintentional or unconscious actions, though technically 
                  deeds, do 
                              not constitute Karma, because volition, the most important 
                  factor 
                              in determining Karma, is absent. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> The

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> "I 
                  declare, 
                                O Bhikkhus, that volition is Karma. Having willed one acts
                   by body, 
                                speech, and thought." (Anguttara Nikaya) </span></p>

                  is called 
                              Karma. The exception made in their case is because they are 
                  delivered 
                              from both good and evil; they have eradicated ignorance and

                  tirelessly 
                              active in working for the real well being and happiness of 
                  all. Their 
                              deeds ordinarily accepted as good or moral, lack creative 
                  power as 
                              regards themselves. Understanding things as they truly are, 
                  they have 
                              finally shattered their cosmic fetters – the chain of cause

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Karma 
                  does not 
                              necessarily mean past actions. It embraces both past and 
                  present deeds. 
                              Hence in one sense, we are the result of what we were; we 
                  will be 
                              the result of what we are. In another sense, it should be 
                  added, we 
                              are not totally the result of what we were; we will not 
                  absolutely 
                              be the result of what we are. The present is no doubt the 
                  offspring 
                              of the past and is the present of the future, but the 
                  present is not 
                              always a true index of either the past or the future; so 
                  complex is 
                              the working of Karma. </span></p>

                              is inevitably accompanied by its due effect. Karma is like

                              the effect or result. Anisamsa and Adinaya are the leaves,

                   health, 
                              sickness and poverty – these are inevitable consequences,

                              happen at the same time. Strictly speaking, both Karma and

                              be good or bad, so may Vipaka, - the fruit – is good or bad.
                   
                              As Karma is mental so Vipaka is mental (of the mind). It is 
                  experienced 
                              as happiness, bliss, unhappiness or misery, according to the
                   nature 
                              of the Karma seed. <em>Anisamsa</em> are the concomitant 
                  advantages 
                              – material things such as prosperity, health and longevity. 
                  When 
                              Vipaka’s concomitant material things are disadvantageous, 
                  they 
                              are known as <em>Adinaya</em>, full of wretchedness, and 
                  appear as

                              of causes. From a Buddhist point of view, they are not

              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Every
                   birth 
                                is conditioned by a past good or bad karma, which 
                  predominated at 
                                the moment of death. Karma that conditions the future 
                  birth is called 
                                Reproductive Karma. The death of a person is merely ‘a 
                  temporary 
                                end of a temporary phenomenon’. Though the present form 
                  perishes, 
                                another form which is neither the same nor absolutely 
                  different 
                                takes its place, according to the potential 
                  thought-vibration generated 
                                at the death moment, because the Karmic force which 
                  propels the 
                                life-flux still survives. It is this last thought, which 
                  is technically 
                                called Reproductive <em>(janaka) </em>Karma, that 
                  determines the 
                                state of a person in his subsequent birth. This may be 
                  either a 
                                good or bad Karma. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> According to 
                                the Commentary, Reproductive Karma is that which produces 
                  mental 
                                aggregates and material aggregates at the moment of 
                  conception. 
                                The initial consciousness, which is termed the <em>patisandhi</em> rebirth consciousness, is conditioned by this Reproductive<em> (janaka)</em> Karma. Simultaneous with the arising of the 
                  rebirth-consciousness, 
                                there arise the ‘body-decad’, ‘sex-decad’ and 
                                ‘base-decad’ <em>(kaya-bhavavatthu dasakas).</em> (decad

                  the very

                                combination of sperm and ovum cells. The Pain and

                  attempted 
                                to kill the Buddha and who caused a schism in the Sangha

                  prosperity 
                                were due to the action of the Supportive Karma. The 
                  Counteractive 
                                or Obstructive Karma came into operation when he was

                  from the 
                                Sangha. Finally the Destructive Karma brought his life to a

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> This 
                  is that 
                                which one does or remembers immediately before the moment 
                  of dying. 
                                Owing to the great part it plays in determining the future
                   birth, 
                                much importance is attained to this deathbed <em>(asanna</em>)
                   Karma 
                                in almost all Buddhist countries. The customs of reminding
                   the dying 
                                man of good deeds and making him do good acts on his 
                  deathbed still

                  remembers 
                                or does a good act at the last moment. A story runs that a
                   certain 
                                executioner who casually happened to give some alms to the
                   Venerable 
                                Sariputta remembered this good act at the dying moment and
                   was born 
                                in a state of bliss. This does not mean that although he 
                  enjoys 
                                a good birth he will be exempt from the effects of the 
                  evil deeds 
                                which he accumulated during his lifetime. They will have 
                  there due

                  evil act 
                                of his or by harbouring some unpleasant thought, perchance

                                for about seven days in a state of misery when she lied to
                   her husband 
                                to cover some misbehaviour. </span></p>

                   are exceptional 
                                cases. Such reverse changes of birth account for the birth

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> <strong>Question:</strong> Do the Karmas of parents determine or affect the Karmas of 
                  their children? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> <strong>Answer:</strong> Physically, the Karma of children is generally determined by
                   the Karma 
                              of their parents. Thus, healthy parents usually have healthy
                   offspring, 
                              and unhealthy parents have unhealthy children. On the effect
                   or how 
                              the Karma of their children is determined: the child’s Karma
                   
                              is a thing apart of itself – it forms the child’s 
                  individuality, 
                              the sum-total of its merits and demerits accumulated in 
                  innumerable 
                              past existences. For example, the Karma of the Buddha-to-be,
                   Prince 
                              Siddhartha was certainly not influenced by the joint Karma 
                  of his 
                              parents, King Suddhodana and Queen Maya. The glorious and 
                  powerful 
                              Karma of our Buddha-to-be transcended the Karma of his 
                  parents which 
                              jointly were more potent than his own. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> <strong>Question:</strong> If the Karma of parents do not influence those of their 
                  children, 
                              how would the fact be explained that parents who suffer from
                   certain 
                              virulent diseases are apt to transmit these evils to their 
                  offsprings? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> <strong>Answer: </strong>Where a child inherit such a disease it is due to 
                  the force 
                              of the parents’ characteristics because of the force of the 
                  latter’s 
                              Utu (conditions favourable to germination). Take, for 
                  example, two 
                              seeds from a sapling; plant one in inferior, dry soil; and 
                  the other 
                              in rich, moist soil. The result is that the first seed will 
                  sprout 
                              into a sickly sapling and soon show symptoms of disease and 
                  decay; 
                              while the other seed will thrive and flourish and grow up to
                   be a 
                              tall and healthy tree. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> It will
                   be observed 
                              that the pair of seeds taken from the same stock grows up 
                  differently 
                              according to the soil into which they are put. A child’s 
                  past 
                              Karma may be compared to the seed: the physical disposition 
                  of the 
                              mother to the soil; and that of the father to the moisture, 
                  which 
                              fertilised the soil. Roughly speaking, to illustrate our 
                  subject, 
                              we will say that, representing the sapling’s germination, 
                  growth, 
                              and existence as a unit, the seed is responsible for 
                  one-tenth of 
                              them, the soil for six-tenths, and the moisture for the 
                  remainder, 
                              three-tenths. Thus, although the power of germination exists
                   potentially 
                              in the seed (the child), its growth is powerfully determined
                   and quickened 
                              by the soil (the mother) and the moisture (the father). </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Therefore, even 
                              as the conditions of the soil and moisture must be taken as 
                  largely 
                              responsible factors in the growth and condition of the tree.
                   So must 
                              the influences of the parents (or progenitors, as in the 
                  case of the 
                              animal world) be taken into account in respect to the 
                  conception and 
                              growth of their offspring. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> The 
                  parents’ 
                              share in the Karma determining the physical factors of their
                   issue 
                              is as follows: If they are human beings, then their 
                  offspring will 
                              be a human being. If they are cattle then their issue must 
                  be of their 
                              species. If the human being is Chinese, then their offspring
                   must 
                              be of their race. Thus, the offspring are invariably of the 
                  same genera 
                              and species, etc., as those of the progenitors. It will be 
                  seen from 
                              the above that, although a child’s Karma is very powerful in
                   
                              itself, if cannot remain wholly uninfluenced by those of it 
                  parents. 
                              It is apt to inherit the physical characteristic of its 
                  parents. Yet, 
                              it may occur that the child’s Karma, being superlatively 
                  powerful, 
                              the influence of the parent’s joint Karma cannot overshadow 
                  it. 
                              Of course, it need hardly be pointed out that the evil 
                  influences 
                              of parents can also be counteracted by the application of 
                  medical 
                              science. </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> The 
                  physical 
                              dispositions of the parents may, or may not, be equal in 
                  force. One 
                              may counteract the other to a lesser or greater extent. The 
                  child’s 
                              Karma and physical characteristics, such as race, colour, 
                  etc., will 
                              be the produce of the three forces. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> <strong>Question:</strong> On the death of a sentient being, is there a ‘soul’ that 
                              wanders about at will? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> <strong>Answer:</strong> When a sentient being leaves one existence, it is reborn 
                  either as 
                              a human being, a celestial being, (Deva or Brahama), and 
                  inferior 
                              animal, or a denizen of one of the regions of hell. The 
                  sceptics and 
                              the ignorant people held that there are intermediate stages –
                   
                              <em>antrabhava</em> – between these; and that there are 
                  being 
                              who are neither of the human, the celestial, the Deva or the
                   Brahma 
                              worlds nor of any one of the stages of exist recognised in 
                  the scriptures 
                              – but are in an intermediate stage. Some assert that these 
                  transitional 
                              stages are possessed of the Five Khandhas ( Five Aggregates:
                   they 
                              are Matter <em>(rupa</em>); Feeling <em>(vedana</em>); 
                  Perception 
                              <em>(sanna</em>); 4. Mental-activities <em>(sankhara)</em>; 
                  and Consciousness<em> (vinnana).</em> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Some 
                  assert that 
                              these beings are detached ‘souls’ or spirits with no 
                  material 
                              encasement, and some again, that they are possessed of the 
                  faculty 
                              of seeing like Devas, and further, that they have power of 
                  changing 
                              at will, at short intervals, from one to any of the 
                  existence mentioned 
                              above. Others again hold the fantastic and erroneous theory 
                  that these 
                              beings can, and so, fancy themselves to be in other than the
                   existence 
                              they are actually in. Thus, to take for example one such of 
                  these 
                              suppositious beings. He is a poor person – and yet he 
                  fancies 
                              himself to be rich. He may be in hell – and yet he fancies 
                  himself 
                              to be in the land of the Devas, and so on. This belief in 
                  intermediate 
                              stages between existences is false, and is condemned in the 
                  Buddhist 
                              teachings. A human being in this life who, by his Karma is 
                  destined 
                              to be a human being in the next, will be reborn as such; one
                   who by 
                              his Karma is destined to be a Deva in the next will be 
                  appear in the 
                              land of the Devas; and one whose future life is to be in 
                  Hell, will 
                              be found in one of the regions of hell in the next 
                  existence. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> The 
                  idea of an 
                              entity or soul or spirit ‘going’, ‘coming’, ‘changing’ 
                              or ‘transmigrating’ from one existence to another is an 
                              idea entertained by the ignorance and materialistic, and is 
                  certainly 
                              not justified by the Dhammas that there is no such thing as 
                  ‘going’, 
                              'coming’, ‘changing’, etc., as between existences. 
                              The conception, which is in accordance with the Dhamma, may 
                  perhaps 
                              be illustrated by the picture thrown out by a cinema 
                  projector, or 
                              the sound of emitted by the gramophone, and their relation 
                  to the 
                              film or the sound-box and records respectively. For example,
                   a human 
                              being dies and is reborn in the land of Devas. Though these 
                  two existences 
                              are different, yet the link or continuity between the two at
                   death 
                              is unbroken in point of time. The same is true in the case 
                  of a man 
                              whose further existence is to be in hell. The distance 
                  between Hell 
                              and the abode of man appears to be great. Yet, in point of 
                  time, the 
                              continuity of ‘passage’ from the one existence t</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">There are some who criticise thus: "So, you Buddhists, too, administer capitalistic opium to the people, saying: "You are born poor in this life on account of your past evil karma. He is born rich on account of his good Karma. So, be satisfied with your humble lot; but do good to be rich in your next life. You are being oppressed now because of your past evil Karma. There is your destiny. Be humble and bear your sufferings patiently. Do good now. You can be certain of a better and happier life after death."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The Buddhist doctrine of Karma does not expound such ridiculous fatalistic views. Nor does it vindicate a postmortem justice. The All-Merciful Buddha, who had no ulterior selfish motives, did not teach this law of Karma to protect the rich and comfort the poor by promising illusory happiness in an after-life.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">While we are born to a state created by ourselves, yet by our own self-directed efforts there is every possibility for us to create new, favourable environments even here and now. Not only individually, but also, collectively, we are at liberty to create fresh Karma that leads either towards our progress or downfall in this very life. &lt;end&gt;</span></p>

              <p>That's why, our best hope for a good rebirth is for Habitual Kamma to become our death proximate Kamma.</p>
              <p>That is to say, to radically change our way of thinking and behaving, to purify ourselves as much as possible until it has become a 'habit'. This is for us who hasn't attained any spiritual Sainthood. Kamma is truly our heir.</p>
