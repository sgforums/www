              <p>In Christianity, salvation is by faith, not works. In Buddhism, we do not believe in such thing as salvation and we do not aim for rebirth in heaven so there is no link. Therefore you should not discuss christian concepts here as there is no link. We aim for liberation and nirvana by realization and wisdom, achieved by many in the here and now even today, instead of in some unseen future or afterlife.</p>

              Oh and since you mentioned humility, I believe in being humble but stating facts. I do not believe in false, plastic humility.
                                                  
              Therefore we practice open discussions of what is possible to be attained, realized and experienced (through our own experience and enlightenment) through Buddhist practice for the benefit of forummers, while not claiming loudly claims of attainments for the sake of showing off. When the Buddha proclaimed attainment of full and complete awakening, he was not being proud but stating facts humbly for the sake of all sentient beings so that we know what is achievable in the same way that piano teachers can proclaim mastery of piano so that others may learn or study under him. He humbly and factually states that all of us have the same buddha nature, not any less than buddha himself. Each of us can achieve complete awakening and liberation from all sufferings.
                                                  
              Without belief in God and a higher being, we believe, and not just believe but experience that all humans have the potential of perfection, of perfect and complete awakening in each of us, and that source of intrinsic perfection can be experienced and realized in the here and now, not in an imagined and unseen afterlife.

Terms used in your religion may not connote the same meaning or may not be applicable here which could also lead to miscommunication and misunderstanding as well. It is best to discuss the Christian teaching at a site where everyone knew exactly what each is referring to. </span></p>

              <p class="MsoListBulletCxSpLast" style="text-indent: 0cm; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;   "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I believe also, in your religious belief, you will still go to heaven to be with your Saviour <span> </span>regardless of whatever you have done whilst on earth? It is just a natural progression in a teaching which believes in only one life on earth. Whereas religions which believe in rebirth due to different doctrinal teaching would naturally takes a different course altogether. It is just a matter which teaching you are comfortable with - and sticking to it.</span></p>

              The answer is no, no, and yes.
                                                  
              No, there is no karmic calculator, karma is not a mathematical thing as each karmic cause can have complex karmic result, much more complex than chemical reactions in laboratories. But the basic truth is that wholesome deeds, speech and thought will result in a pleasant karmic effect either here and now, in the future, or in an afterlife, and unwholesome deeds, speech and thoughts result in an unwholesome karmic effect now, in future, or in an afterlife. You also attain complete freedom from mental suffering, you attain bliss and clarity in the here and now, in this life, so enlightenment and liberation is seen here, now, not as an afterlife state.
                                                  
              No, Buddha is not a creator god, simply one who has fully awakened to the true nature of reality and obtained complete liberation from sufferings. Countless people before and after him, including even today, has achieved awakening and liberation. To attain enlightenment is the goal of all Buddhists. Once you are liberated, you are free from the uncontrolled cycle of rebirth in samsara. 
                                                  
              Karma is a natural law of cause and effect that plays itself out, it is an impersonal, causal process that requires and has no judge.

              <p>Another question:</p>
              <p>Since Buddhism supports the concept of past lives, why we dun remember our past lives?</p>

              We don't remember our past lives after undergoing tremendous bodily, biological changes from the time we take birth to growing up.
              
              As a matter of fact, Dr Ian Stevensons and other scientists has done indepth research on hundreds to thousands of children who can remember past lives. He traced and proven that these are true, credible accounts - things the children could remember about their past lives turn out to be true. His research has been published in scientific and medical journals. 
              
              This shows that if you can remember past lives, usually it is when you are very young which you will forget later in life, or you remember your past lives through meditation. Our moderator simpo told me many of his past lives remembered through meditation and how karmic causes from those lifetimes affected his present life. Many meditators can do this.
