              <p>I heard alot of buddhist say that if the good deeds that you do in your life exceeds the bad deeds that you do, than you will go to heaven. If not you go to hell.</p>
              <p>So how do buddhist actually calculate the amount of good deeds and bad deeds that they do?</p>
              <p>Is there a point calculation system?</p>
              <p>Like if I rob a bank, I get minus 100 points. If I go a good deed like feed the stray cats, I get 10 points.</p>
              <p>Or how do the buddhist calculate than?</p>

              <p>LOL. The calculation system is karma. No man operation but it can never go wrong. It is just like when you plant apple tree, the tree will bear apples. Can never go wrong.Doing good deeds but insincere is not considered as good deeds. It is "auto calculated". You can bluff others but you can't bluff karma and get away with your insincere intention of doing good deeds. Karma applies to everyone regardless of your religion. Everyone including Buddha (before His enlightenment) and heavenly gods.</p>
              <p>Chrisitans like to say Buddhists aim to gather good points  in our report book. I wonder what kind of report book they are talking about. No one is going to look at your report book. You are answerable to what you do. No one is interested in your report book because it has nothing to do with Buddha or whoever. Buddha is not going to promote you or demote you. He will only pity you and try to change you through His teachings so you will not suffer.</p>
              <p>By the way, Buddhists don't aim to go heaven. There are Buddhists sutra which clearly explain what are the heavy sins, lighter sins and so on.</p>
              <p>Following is a better explanation in Chinese.</p>

              <p>There is no calculation system, because karma is far more complex than just a simplistic 'good' and 'bad' definition. Each karmic action will have its own particular reaction.
                          
                          Also, it is not true that if you do more good deeds than bad deeds, you will go heaven, and if not, then vice versa. It is also possible that you do a lot of bad deeds, but you go to heaven, only to fall back into hell later.
                          
                          Nothing is as simple as it seems.</p>
              <p>But because our rebirth is determined by our last thought, if you have an unwholesome mind, due to your karmic tendency it is very easy for you to fall into the 3 lower realms.
                      
                      By the way there are 6 realms of rebirth: 3 lower realms are hell, ghost and animal, 3 higher realms are human, asuras, and heavenly or celestial beings/devas.</p>
              <p>Also because your life in heaven, if you do get reborn there, is still temporary, and there is no telling if a bad karma from your previous lifetimes would manifest in the next life after heaven - rebirth in heaven is *insecure*.</p>
              <p>That is why if you have the good opportunity to be born as a human and practice the dharma, strive hard to attain enlightenment and liberation from the uncontrolled karmic cycle of rebirth. This is truly possible, many people up to today have done it.</p>

              <p>Haha... interesting. There's actually no calculator system.</p>
              <p>Try your best to do as many good deeds as possible... no matter how small e.g. giving up seats for the people who needs more than u</p>
              <p>lastly dedicate all your merits to all sentient beings... you will feel great and useful! :)</p>

              <p><br>actually it's different from the <strong><em>brownie points</em> <em>system of x'tian</em></strong><em>.</em></p>
              <p>in general karma mean Action. then purify karma mean purify your <strong>habitual</strong> Action, be it body or mind. there's this <strong>habit</strong> we have in the past that need to change.</p>
              <p>if keep commiting bad action, how to <em>purify</em> into good action? do more good action until it become a good habit. :)</p>
              <p>u can use quiting smoking/gambling as an example.</p>
              <p>it's the root of 3 poisons (greed, hatred, folly) that made one enter into the lower realms such as hell realm. yet the main purpose of buddhists is also not to go to heaven, but escape from samsara/suffering. go to heaven will also one day go to hell. go to hell will also one day go to heaven. what's the point? the point is to all don't go, and let go, that's Nirvana.</p>

              <p>there are just too many deeds to be done over a lifetime which almost all of us can only do that much...be humble and one could reach goodness forever more....</p>

In Buddhism, we do not believe in such thing as  salvation and we do not aim for rebirth in heaven so there is no link. Therefore you should not discuss christian concepts here as there is no link. We aim for liberation and nirvana by realization and wisdom, achieved by many in the here and now even today, instead of in some unseen future or afterlife.</div>
