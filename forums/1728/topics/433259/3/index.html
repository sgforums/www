              <p>Another question:</p>
              <p>Since Buddhism supports the concept of past lives, why we dun remember our past lives?</p>

              <p>There are people who complain that it is unfair that they have to suffer for something that don't remember.  A Ven. said it was never unfair. It was just like a driver who killed someone on the road while drunk driving. He could not remember what he had done but he had to be responsible because the true fact was he killed someone.</p>
              <p>Just like if someone falls and breaks his legs when he is drunk. Though he cannot  recall what happen but that will not save his legs. The fact is his legs are broken. What was done was done. Whether you can recall or not does not matter.</p>

                                You are basically asking me, is the soul eternal? My answer is that there is no soul, there are only aggregation of mental and physical phenomena arising due to karma and many other causes and conditions.
                                
                                Such births are occuring on a momentary level. This arising is not the same as the next, but the present karmic causes cause a new birth, a new psychophysical aggregate phenomena to arise. The new birth is neither the same, nor different from the previous birth. They are causally linked but no unchanging self entity can be found in the process.
                                
                                In this way, the process of rebirth continues while there are karmic conditions for birth, without there being an eternal soul.
                                
                                There is no you, but there is a process of rebirth. There is no hearer apart from hearing, no seer apart from seeing, no thinker apart from thinking, no doer apart from doing, everything happens due to causes and conditions.

              <p><br>Hi Dawn,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Maybe your question needs to be slightly amended to read": Whatever he has <span style="color: #ff0000;">purportedly</span> created are not perfect. So do you think he can judge properly without mistakes?"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Not trying to be semantic, but I am a Buddhist and therefore do not subscribe to the existence of God. It then follows, that which does not exist is not in a position to create anything. So our question here is a rhetorical one and needs to be phrased as such.</p>

              All humans can attain perfection (buddhahood), not all humans are bound for hell (that depends karma), perfection is not necessary for rebirth in heaven, and heaven is not an ultimate and eternal place.
                                
              Just to clear up some christian heresies that are blatantly false from the buddhist perspective.

              <p><br>Create Human in his image does not mean we are perfect human beings.</p>
              <p><strong>Question: "What does it mean that man is made in the image of God?"<br><br>Answer: </strong>On the last day of creation, God said, “Let us make man in our image, in our likeness” (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Genesis%201.26"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Genesis 1:26</span></span></a>). Thus, He finished His work with a “personal touch.” God formed man from the dust and gave him life by sharing His own breath (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Genesis%202.7"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Genesis 2:7</span></span></a>). Accordingly, man is unique among all God’s creations, having both a material body and an immaterial soul/spirit. <br><br>Having the “image” or “likeness” of God means, in the simplest terms, that we were made to resemble God. Adam did not resemble God in the sense of God’s having flesh and blood. Scripture says that “God is spirit” (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/John%204.24"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">John 4:24</span></span></a>) and therefore exists without a body. However, Adam’s body did mirror the life of God insofar as it was created in perfect health and was not subject to death.<br><br>The image of God refers to the immaterial part of man. It sets man apart from the animal world, fits him for the dominion God intended him to have over the earth (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Genesis%201.28"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Genesis 1:28</span></span></a>), and enables him to commune with his Maker. It is a likeness mentally, morally, and socially.<br><br>Mentally, man was created as a rational, volitional agent. In other words, man can reason and man can choose. This is a reflection of God’s intellect and freedom. Anytime someone invents a machine, writes a book, paints a landscape, enjoys a symphony, calculates a sum, or names a pet, he or she is proclaiming the fact that we are made in God’s image.<br><br>Morally, man was created in righteousness and perfect innocence, a reflection of God’s holiness. God saw all He had made (mankind included) and called it “very good” (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Genesis%201.31"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Genesis 1:31</span></span></a>). Our conscience or “moral compass” is a vestige of that original state. Whenever someone writes a law, recoils from evil, praises good behavior, or feels guilty, he is confirming the fact that we are made in God’s own image.<br><br>Socially, man was created for fellowship. This reflects God's triune nature and His love. In Eden, man’s primary relationship was with God (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Genesis%203.8"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Genesis 3:8</span></span></a> implies fellowship with God), and God made the first woman because “it is not good for the man to be alone” (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Genesis%202.18"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Genesis 2:18</span></span></a>). Every time someone marries, makes a friend, hugs a child, or attends church, he is demonstrating the fact that we are made in the likeness of God.<br><br>Part of being made in God’s image is that Adam had the capacity to make free choices. Although he was given a righteous nature, Adam made an evil choice to rebel against his Creator. In so doing, Adam marred the image of God within himself, and he passed that damaged likeness on to all his descendants (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Romans%205.12"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Romans 5:12</span></span></a>). Today, we still bear the image of God (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/James%203.9"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">James 3:9</span></span></a>), but we also bear the scars of sin. Mentally, morally, socially, and physically, we show the effects of sin.<br><br>The good news is that when God redeems an individual, He begins to restore the original image of God, creating a “new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness” (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Ephesians%204.24"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Ephesians 4:24</span></span></a>). That redemption is only available by God’s grace through faith in Jesus Christ as our Savior from the sin that separates us from God (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Ephesians%202.8-9"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Ephesians 2:8-9</span></span></a>). Through Christ, we are made new creations in the likeness of God (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/2%20Corinthians%205.17"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">2 Corinthians 5:17</span></span></a>).</p>
