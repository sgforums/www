                  an oncologist with 29 years of professional experience, I can say that I’ve
                  grown and changed as a result of the tragedies my patients have endured. We
                  don’t know our real measure until, amid adversity, we discover that we are
                  capable of going far beyond what we imagined.</span><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">“Once I’m dead, I think my mother will miss me, but I’m
                  not afraid to die. I wasn’t born for this life.”</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";     '> <br> I have fond memories of the Oncological Hospital of Pernambuco, where I took my
                  first steps as a professional. I started going to the children’s ward, and
                  there I fell in love with pediatric oncology.<br> <br> I witnessed the tragedies my patients endured, as innocent little victims of
                  cancer. With the birth of my first daughter, I started to feel uncomfortable
                  seeing children suffer. Until the day an angel passed by!<br> <br> I saw that angel in the semblance of an 11-year-old girl, exhausted by two years
                  of different treatments, handling, injections and all the problems that
                  chemical treatment programs and radiation involve. But I never saw that little
                  angel give up. I saw her cry many times. I also saw the fear in her eyes, but
                  that is only human!<br> <br> One day I arrived at the hospital, early and I found my little angel alone in
                  her room. I asked her where her mother was. To this day I cannot recount her
                  response without becoming very emotional.<br> <br> “Sometimes my mother leaves the room to cry in the hallway in secret. When I’m
                  dead, I think my mother will miss me, but I’m not afraid to die. I wasn’t born
                  for this life!”<br> <br> “What does death represent for you, my dear?,” I asked her.<br> <br> “When we’re little, sometimes we go to sleep in our parents’ bed, and the day after
                  we wake up in our own bed, isn’t that right? (I thought about my own daughters,
                  who at the time were 6 and 2, and this is exactly what happened with them)”.<br> <br> “That’s what it’s like. One day I will go to sleep and my Father will come for
                  me. I will wake up in His house, in my true life!”<br> <br> I was stunned, and didn’t know what to say. I was shocked by the maturity which
                  suffering had brought about in the spirit of that child.<br> <br> “And my mama will miss me,” she added.<br> <br> Moved, I held back the tears and asked: “And what does missing
                  someone mean to you, my dear?”<br> <br> “Missing someone is the love that remains.”<br> <br> Today, at 53, I challenge anyone to give a better, more direct and simpler
                  definition for the word “longing”: it is the love that remains.<br> <br> My little angel left many us years ago, but she left me with a great lesson
                  that helped me to improve my life, to try to be more human and affectionate
                  with my patients, to rethink my values. When night falls, if the sky is clear
                  and I see a star, I call it “my angel”, who sparkles and shines in heaven.<br> <br> I think that in her new and eternal home, she is a shining star.<br> <br> Thank you, little angel, for the life you had, for the lessons you taught me,
                  for the help you gave me. How beautiful longing is.<br> </span></p>
