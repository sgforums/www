              <p>7.30am – 10.30am Packing up<br><br>A Nyung Nay retreat consists of 7 sessions spread over 3 days. In each session we practise the sadhana of Chenrezig, the Buddha symbolizing compassion. The sadhana involves meditating on bodhicitta (the aspiration to attain Enlightenment in order to help all beings), visualizing Chenrezig, reciting prayers and mantras, and performing prostrations. Each session lasts approximately 3 hours<br><br>A Nyung Nay Retreat is a special two-day meditation, fasting and purification retreat based on the practice of Thousand-Armed Chenrezig and is known for its power in the purification of negative karma and the accomplishment of enlightened qualities.<br>It is a Vajrayana practice from the Kriya ("Action") class of Tantra. It is a powerful, quick and effective method to purify a lot of negativities and at the same time collect a vast amount of merit. Meditators of the past have been known to purify such diseases as leprosy through this practice. However, the principal purpose of the practice is the attainment of supreme Enlightenment for the benefit of all living beings.<br>In consultation with His Holiness Sakya Trizin on the importance of this practice to our members, he said “Nyung Nay, or fasting ritual, is a very effective way of purifying the negative deeds. The main deity is Avalokiteshvara, thousand armed, starting originally from the Bhikshuni Palmo. Since then, it’s been passed down as a great way to purifying the negative deeds. It is said that even those who have committed very heinous crimes can be purified through this ritual. Not only those who are doing the ritual will receive great benefit, even those who sees such person, or hears or any kind of physical or verbal connection to the people who are doing the ritual will also benefit in great ways. Therefore it is a very, very effective way.”<br><br>The vows to be observed include refraining from:<br> Killing<br>Stealing<br>Lying<br> Sexual activities (celibate)<br> Drinking alcohol, taking drugs, smoking cigarettes<br>Using perfumes, wearing make-up or ornaments, singing, playing music, dancing and other forms of entertainment<br> Eating in inappropriate times<br> Sitting in high seats<br><br>What to bring<br> Mala to be used only for Chenrezig mantra<br> Vajra and Bell (optional)<br>Mandala set (optional)<br> Dharma book to read during break times<br> Own sadhanas [Retreat Sadhanas will be provided on 1 April]<br> Gloves, towel/cushion to be used for prostration<br> Sleeping bag, pillow and personal toiletries, torch light. Own pen and note pad if truly need to communicate on Day 2 of retreat (3 April)<br>Many clean clothes, as Kriya Tantra emphasizes cleanliness. Clothing should be comfortable and loose-fitting, and appropriate for a semi-monastic environment (no shorts, translucent or sleeveless shirts)<br>Your own cup (big or medium) and thermos, if possible<br> If desired, you may bring your own additional nutritious food (such as nuts, dried fruit, energy bars) to supplement the one meal on the first day (2 April lunch) of the Nyung Nay. And any special drinks such as dehydration salts<br>You are encouraged to bring kata, flowers, food, fruits and other items to offer to the Retreat shrine. On the Retreat conclusion day (4 April), there will be a Tsog offering<br> Pain relievers might be helpful in case of developing sore muscles from prostrating</p>
