              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Becoming a nun or a monk in America is seen as an extreme.
              It's typically a lifelong commitment that none except a rare few even consider
              (despite the all too common "I seriously think I'll just become a nun"
              comments routinely muttered by the exhausted players in the dating world). When
              we think of the life of a religious servant, we usually conjure up images of
              drab clothing and darkened hallways, prayers and hymns muttered by the
              reclusive.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Buddhist monks, however, are a visible part of the Thai
              community. I see them daily: walking the sidewalks, barefoot; interacting with
              students; perched on the backs of motorbikes. Easily distinguishable by their
              bald heads and dark orange robes, they live within the temples that tourists so
              often visit, from the mountainous beauty of Chiang Mai's Doi Suthep to the
              smallest streetside temples of the southern islands. These men are not allowed
              to a touch a woman in any way, nor are they even allowed to accept anything directly
              from her hand; if I were to pass a monk a bottle of water, I would have to
              first set it down upon a table before he is allowed to pick it up. Direct eye
              contact with a woman, while not strictly forbidden, is considered a rather
              risqué interaction that should be treated with care.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">At the age of 21, a great majority of Thai boys dedicate
              three months of their lives to the monkhood. Some, however, enter into the
              monkhood later in life, for an equally brief amount of time or, perhaps, for
              the rest of their lives. This December, I was invited to the initiation
              ceremony of a man in his fifties who had decided to enter the monkhood in honor
              of the late king Bhumibol Adulyadej.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">He began the ceremony adorned in a knee-length white robe,
              bookended by his elderly mentor and his wife, whose skin he would soon not be
              able to touch. Surrounded by a large group of family and friends, all carrying
              various assortments of yellow and white flowers, the monk-to-be began the
              traditional procession around the temple. Marching in their own parade, the
              group orbits the wat, one woman at the front singing out a joyous Thai hymn
              while the dozens of followers echo her words back to her. Within a basket next
              to the honoree are hundreds of candies, decorations, and coins that have been
              woven into bows. Reaching in, he grasps a handful and tosses them over the
              surrounding fence, where a mixture of enthusiastic children and impoverished
              beggars tumble over each other to seize them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The parade over, about half of the audience follows our
              honoree inside, where the entire congregation of monks is waiting, seated in
              rows before the image of the Buddha. For nearly an hour, the existing monks
              pray with their new brother, pausing to fully explain the limitations of the
              oath he is about to take. He must renounce all worldly goods, and forego all
              relationships but the one he has with the spirit of Buddha. Once accepted into
              the brotherhood, he is stripped of his white robe and wrapped in his own orange
              drapery, changing from one into the other right there in the temple while his
              audience chants a prayer.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">There is no limit to how long he will stay here; it could be
              a month, it could be ten years. Every morning, he will now take to the streets,
              where his daily food will be given to him by the generous members of the
              community. He will spend his days in prayer, meditating, or completing chores.
              It is hard to speculate on anything more specific, as monks are, in their vows,
              barred from speaking of their temple experiences with anyone.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">I admire the bravery of these men and the depth of their
              faith; I applaud their ability to let go of all of the worldly constructs that
              most of us hold onto so tightly. As for this particular new monk, I hope that
              whatever he is searching for within himself, he is able to find within those
              temple walls.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-align: justify;">Just
              like to provide some general knowledge of Buddhism and also let the Buddhist
              community here know what is going on around them on things that may in some way
              or other affect Buddhism as a whole.</span></p>
