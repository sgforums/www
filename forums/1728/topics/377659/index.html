              <p>Something I wrote in another forum's topic on what is an Arhant and how to recognise one.</p>
                  <p><br>What is Arhant? Someone who has passed the 4 stages of
                      awakening (stream entry, once returner, non returner, arhant) to full
                      liberation from samsara, birth and death, sufferings. He has overcome
                      all traces of ignorance or self-views -- The arahat has seen through
                      the sense that there is a continuous, separate, or special controller,
                      doer, observer, or centerpoint that is "who they are" in a very direct
                      perceptual way that is not merely an intellectual or conceptual
                      understanding. They know the sensations that seemed to imply these to
                      be just more sensations arising and vanishing according to conditions
                      as they always have been. This is not something they have to work to
                      maintain, but instead is something that has stopped/completely seen
                      through by insight.<br><br>How to know if someone is an Arhant? In my
                      opinion, there is no single way to judge a person's attainment by just
                      looking at him or even observing his behaviors -- an enlightened person
                      may on the surface and appearance be seemingly ordinary and look just
                      like us. For example the Buddha taught that though enlightened people
                      can look radiant but that should not be the criteria for judging
                      insights. Nor are 'peaceful looking people' any indications of
                      enlightenment, I know of people who are peaceful and not enlightened.
                      So imo this is a poor indicator of enlightenment-ness.<br><br>Hence the
                      only truly reliable way is to check by the criteria of insight alone,
                      of meditative experience and insight to guage where one is on the path.
                      But it is a little bit complex and complicated if you are not familiar
                      with the maps of awakening. It is however good to be familiar with maps
                      of the stages of meditative experiences/insights/awakening in the sense
                      that one at least has an idea where he is on the path and how to
                      proceed and not be lost or stuck in any place. All these guidance can
                      however only come from the personal experiences of a true enlightened
                      teacher. The ancient maps (the goods ones) do however give some
                      important indications of the path. <br><br>These maps can be found in
                      all traditions: Theravada, Mahayana, Zen, Vajrayana, etc. What kind of
                      maps? Maps that relate to meditative insights and territories. Others
                      may include the 10 bhumis as presented in terms of meditative maps and
                      insights in Lankavatara Sutra, the Tibetan presentation of the 10
                      bhumis in terms of yogic experience such as the Mahamudra Four Yogas
                      (check out books by Dakpo Tashi Namgyal and Thrangu Rinpoche's
                      commentaries, truly good), the 5 ranks of Tozan, the 10 oxherding
                      pictures (here's a nice commentary <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.terebess.hu/english/oxherding.html">http://www.terebess.hu/english/oxherding.html</a> by a modern zen master), Thusness's seven stages of experience, Dharma
                      Dan's nondual model of the 4 paths, and other similar maps.<br><br>Lastly:
                      one should ask why should we be so bothered about whether someone is an
                      arhant? Even if he has deep insights is that indication of arhatship?
                      This is a controversial topic, but I reckon is not that relevant nor
                      particularly practical, though good to know (perhaps for inspiration,
                      knowing that it's possible, etc?). It is more useful to know that
                      certain insights are presented well by certain teachers and authors and
                      that we should learn what we can learn from it and apply it in practice. We shouldn't be using dharma to judge others, but use it as a lamp post to guide our way.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">The "Ten Ox-herding 
                    Pictures" are one example of "Ox-herding Pictures." Here, our 
                    essential self is compared to an ox. We seek the ox, grasp it, tame it and finally 
                    the self which has always been seeking becomes completely one with the ox. But 
                    this also is forgotten so that we now simply carry on our ordinary lives. This 
                    is the process described by the Pictures. They show concretely the progression 
                    of our practice and are very helpful for a self-examination of our own practice 
                    and as encouragement for further practice. I hope then that studying the Ten 
                    Ox-herding Pictures will provide an opportunity for all of us to continually 
                    examine our practice and also give an indication for self-reflection as to what 
                    stage we have now arrived. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> All that is known 
                    about the author of the verses to the Ten Ox-herding Pictures, Master KAKUAN 
                    Shion, is that he was a disciple of DAIZUI Genjô [1065-1135], the twelfth 
                    in the line of Master Rinzai. His dates of birth and death as well as other 
                    information are unclear. To each of the ten pictures of the Ten Ox-herding Pictures 
                    Master Kakuan has first put a verse and at the end his disciple, Jion (some 
                    say Kakuan himself, others say the friend of Kakuan) is said to have put a general 
                    introduction and a brief introduction to each one of the verses.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> In the Ten Ox-herding 
                    Pictures a little child and an ox are depicted. The ox is the essential self 
                    which we are seeking. The little child represents the self of the phenomenal 
                    world which wants very much to grasp the essential self - not through concepts 
                    and thoughts, but as it really is. This little child (the self of the phenomenal 
                    world) is, in fact, always seeking something. It wants money, status, and fame. 
                    But life is more than just money, more than just status, and more than just 
                    fame. So, the self goes on seeking, now through this philosophy, now through 
                    that religion, and endeavors to grow and to make as much progress as possible. 
                    There are some who are defeated by the struggle, become neurotic, and even go 
                    so far as suicide. For them the spirit of seeking something has operated only 
                    as a minus factor; the fact that they are still expending energy and continuing 
                    to seek something has not changed.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> But why is it 
                    that men and women always seek something in this way? According to the teaching 
                    of Zen, men and women are essentially perfect and complete, in reality limitless 
                    and absolute (this is called "buddha" [hotoke] or "essential 
                    buddha-being" [honrai-jôbutsu]). Nevertheless, though being such, 
                    they appear phenomenally as imperfect, limited, relative, passing sinful beings 
                    (sometimes this is called "ordinary people" [bompu], and sometimes 
                    "living beings" [shujô]). Besides, although human being are 
                    born this way, they cannot know the essence (Buddha nature) of their own perfection 
                    and limitless absoluteness.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> The Ten Ox-herding 
                    Pictures have concretely depicted the process in which the imperfect, limited, 
                    and relative self (the little child) awakens to the perfect, unlimited, and 
                    absolute essential self (the ox), grasps it, tames it, forgets it, and completely 
                    incorporates it into the personality. But we must stress that these pictures 
                    and verses are merely an indication of the way to practice and not an object 
                    for conceptual thought. Thus, the study of the Ten Ox-herding Pictures are very 
                    useful for those who are actually striving to make clear the true self in Zen 
                    through the actual sitting with aching legs. But for those who want only to 
                    learn the rationale of Zen I must warn that these pictures and words will be 
                    only "white elephants" of no use whatsoever. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Accordingly for 
                    the present study I will omit an explanation of the general introduction and 
                    proceed to explain the spirit of the particular introduction for each stage. 
                    After that I would like to appreciate each line of the verses composed by Master 
                    Kakuan himself. </span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"><br> The first of the Ten Ox-herding Pictures is "Seeking the Ox." It is 
                    the stage when the desire has arisen to seek the essential self, the original 
                    self (the ox). It is known as the "first stirring of the heart" [sho-hosshin] 
                    and is indeed a precious and beautiful movement. Although there are billions 
                    of people living on this earth, there are only very few who know that the essential 
                    self is completely perfect and absolutely limitless. Nor is it an exaggeration 
                    to say that there are hardly any who have realized this in fact and made it 
                    a part of themselves. How fortunate that we have encountered the authentic and 
                    traditional Buddha Way and taken the first step in its practice! How beautiful 
                    and precious indeed! </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> On this earth 
                    of ours the first to have realized that our essence is completely perfect and 
                    absolutely limitless was Shakyamuni Buddha. So, once you realize it, the completely 
                    perfect self (ox) does not go anywhere. Shakyamuni proclaimed that since we 
                    are endowed with it from the start there was no need to seek it out. The saying 
                    that "all living beings are originally Buddhas" is an expression of 
                    this reality. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> But how is 
                    it with us really? No one has any idea of what way we are completely perfect 
                    or how we are absolutely limitless. No matter what, we can only see ourselves 
                    as imperfect and insufficient, as relative beings that exist for the limited 
                    span of 50 or 80 years. This is because we turn our backs on pursuing the crucial 
                    question "What is the true self?" to open our eyes to our real essence, 
                    but, instead, go after only the objective world outside us, thus becoming more 
                    and more estranged from our true self. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Once we turn 
                    to this dust of delusive differentiation, we go from one thing to another pursuing 
                    delusions and becoming hopelessly lost in that infinite dust, until finally 
                    we have completely lost sight of our true self. A common mistake into which 
                    those doing zazen fall is surely this. Therefore, no matter what is seen, no 
                    matter what is heard, no matter what comes to mind, not to pay attention to 
                    any of it but only become "Mu" itself [cf. Koan "Jôshu's 
                    Dog" in Mumonkan Case 1]. But rather, thinking Mu is outside of themselves, 
                    people try to grasp it conceptually and go after whatever comes to mind, from 
                    one thing to the next, without knowing how to stop. Then, Mu (their true self), 
                    which is what they should be seeking, goes off somewhere. As a result, no matter 
                    how many years pass, they cannot grasp Mu. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> And so the 
                    familiar mountains and houses of your native place (true self) become distant, 
                    and you can no longer know the road over which you originally came. Even if 
                    you want to return, you no longer know the way to go back; rather, you go off 
                    on a side road which leads in a direction farther and farther away from the 
                    true self. What is that side road, you may ask? It is the endlessly critical 
                    mind which arises like a sharp dagger, judging some things good and others bad 
                    from the criterion of your own profit-gain. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Not being satisfied 
                    with the material world and attempting to achieve a solid spiritual base, you 
                    have reached the level of "seeking the ox." But if you make a mistake 
                    in the method of Zen, immediately you go down a side road with the result that 
                    it would have been better not to do zazen at all. Therefore, at the point of 
                    beginning zazen it is extremely important to choose an authentic master; at 
                    the same time you must never forget to always have a strict spirit of self-reflection 
                    when practicing the Way. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Now let's look 
                    at the verse of Master Kakuan: </span></strong></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Incessantly 
                      you brush aside thick grasses in pursuit. </span></strong></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> You make the 
                    practice of Mu trying with all your might to overtake the ox by sweeping away 
                    the grass of delusive discrimination appearing continually. The legs become 
                    painful and the knees ache. In the afternoon you become drowsy. At "kinhin" 
                    [i.e., walking meditation between zazen sessions] you loosen the legs, wash 
                    the face and take away the drowsiness. You revive your spirit and once again 
                    challenge Mu. </span></strong></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">The waters 
                      are wide, the mountains far,<br> and the path leads on without end. </span></strong></p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> No matter how 
                    far you go, the channel of the river keeps widening, and the mountain ranges 
                    continue far in the distance; you never reach a place where you can say, "Now 
                    it is enough." Day after day, there is only sitting facing the wall. Can 
                    a person really solve the problems of life by just doing this? Thoughts get 
                    confused by the thousands and you go off on an unclear road. </span></strong></p>
              <blockquote>

              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Bodily strength 
                    is gone as well as mental energy. You don't know what to do. "What can 
                    I do? How can I do it?" Only those who have really practiced in a down-to-earth 
                    way can understand what it means to reach this point. However, here, at the 
                    lowest point, the point of the Great Death, you have reached the very important 
                    state that is called "being close to the treasure place." </span></strong></p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> It is now evening. 
                    The cicadas in the maple trees are singing "miiiin, miiiin" in a frenzy. 
                    When you hear their cry you want to cry also. "Oh, today also is finishing 
                    in vain." Unless you have experienced this kind of thought a number of 
                    times, you cannot find your true self. </span></strong></p>

                    Pictures <br> Stage 2<br> FINDING THE TRACKS</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"><img src="http://www.terebess.hu/english/img/cow02.jpg" alt="" width="281" height="304"><br> </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"><br> The stage of "finding the tracks" is the stage of having discovered 
                    the hoofmarks of the ox. In general, the "hoofmarks" signify the stage 
                    in which you read and understand the sutras, or study the various teachings 
                    of Shakyamuni and of the patriarchs, and come to a conceptual understanding 
                    of the content of their experience. That is to say, it is the stage in which 
                    you have understood "cerebrally" the existence of the ox. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> However, in 
                    actual practice, when you do the practice of Mu with all your might,at first 
                    what were two separate entities - yourself and Mu - gradually become one through 
                    your efforts and a deepening of Mu practice. And the conviction is born: "if 
                    I continue at this rate, I too can certainly make kensho." And then your 
                    strength is put into Mu even more. This stage is called that of "finding 
                    the tracks." </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> What does it 
                    mean to say that you understand conceptually that the ox exists? It means to 
                    have understood the principle that all beings in heaven and earth are empty 
                    ("Form is emptiness" - [a famous quote from the Prajna-Paramita Sutra 
                    or Hannya Shingyô Sutra]). Once you understand the nature of this emptiness 
                    you also understand the principle that all things in heaven and on earth are 
                    the self. As Monk Jô [who lived in the 4th century China] says: "Heaven 
                    and earth and I are of the same root; all things and I are the same body." 
                    Now there is an "I" which understands this principle. Yet, insofar 
                    as this "I" remains, you do not really understand the true emptiness 
                    or the inner state expressed as "Heaven and earth and I are one body." </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Thus it is 
                    necessary to personally experience the fact of "Form is emptiness." 
                    And to do that there is only one way: to give your whole self to Mu, to forget 
                    the self so that just Mu remains. If you continue this practice, you will eventually 
                    at some opportunity or another take hold of the "fact" that you are 
                    completely empty and do not exist anywhere and the "fact" that because 
                    you are empty everything is yourself. Insofar as you do not actually do this 
                    practice nor have this experience, be assured that your Zen is simply conceptual 
                    and theoretical Zen. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Those who are 
                    captives to this kind of conceptual and theoretical Zen are also spoken of as 
                    a whole as those in the position of "finding the tracks." Those who 
                    do scholarly research in Zen, no matter how fine and detailed the research is, 
                    from the standpoint of the practice of Zen are taken together as being in the 
                    stage of "finding the tracks." </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Let's now try 
                    to appreciate the verse of Master Kakuan: </span></strong></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">At the waters 
                      edge, under the trees - hoofmarks are numerous. </span></strong></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Along the water's 
                    edge and in the depths of the forest, in every place the hoofmarks of the ox 
                    can be seen. Theoretically, "form is emptiness, emptiness is form; heaven 
                    and earth and I are of the same root; all things and I are you body." But 
                    from the aspect of practice, each and every Mu is every and all the hoofmarks 
                    of the ox. </span></strong></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Balmy grasses 
                      grow abundantly - can you see them or not? </span></strong></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> There are sweet 
                    smelling grasses spreading out abundantly and swayed by the wind. The poet challenges 
                    us, Can you see them? All things in heaven and on earth, each one by one, are 
                    the open and clear and identical expression of this true fact. Do we understand 
                    this or not? The verse seems to insinuate that we might comprehend a little 
                    with the head, but that we aren't able to truly understand the real thing. </span></strong></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Even if you 
                      go deeper and deeper into the mountains. </span></strong></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> The more you 
                    pursues the original ox with your "Muuuuu," the fartherit goes into 
                    the recesses of the mountains. If you look at Mu from the outside and try to 
                    pursue it, it just keeps going farther and farther away. This is a very important 
                    point: your practice must not be one of pursuing and looking at Mu from the 
                    outside. It must be one of just completely becoming Mu itself. </span></strong></p>
              <blockquote>

              </blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> But wait a 
                    moment. With each Mu are we not grasping the muzzle of the ox, and is it not 
                    the ox (the real self) itself? Is it not a reality that cannot be hidden anywhere? 
                    This is a sincere warning for us. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> If you are 
                    really faithfully practicing, at first you don't know what is what,but gradually 
                    the way of folding the legs,holding the hands, and keeping the position become 
                    clear; the way of controlling the breath and the practice of Mu itself becomes 
                    understood. If you continue for a few months or half a year or a year, gradually 
                    the heart becomes calm and the way of doing Zazen itself begins to deepen. And 
                    the conviction arises that if you continue this effort, you will without fail 
                    attain enlightenment. You begin to sit with greater and greater enthusiasm. 
                    Even conceptually you become certain and your conviction of Zen does not waver 
                    even with the slightest thing. You have not yet grasped the ox experientially, 
                    but you have fully gotten into gear with the practice of Zen. This is the stage 
                    of the position of "finding the tracks." </span></strong></p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"><img src="http://www.terebess.hu/english/img/cow03.jpg" alt="" width="281" height="304"><br> </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"><br> "Catching sight of the ox" is the stage of having seen clearly the 
                    real self. What does it mean to see clearly the real self? Up to that time you 
                    have been accustomed to think that there was a "substance" (the ego) 
                    which was called the self. But to see the real self clearly is to experience 
                    the fact that actually the self is completely devoid of substance and that the 
                    so-called ego was never even there! </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> For many this 
                    experience is initiated through some kind of resonating sound. Master Mumon 
                    [1183-1260, author of the Mumonkan] attained a great enlightenment as soon as 
                    he heard the "boom" of a big drum. Master Kyôgen [? -898] was 
                    raking in the garden very earnestly when a stone lodged in his broom flew off 
                    and struck a bamboo tree with great force. At the sound of the "whack" 
                    the delusion that had enveloped him up to that time was blown away at once and 
                    he attained the true self. And so there are many examples of such achievements 
                    following upon sounds of various kinds. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> In this way 
                    when you realize the true self, you reach the source, namely, "whatever 
                    you see or hear, each individual thing is, just as it is, the true self." 
                    Of course, it is important that this be a true experience. If even a little 
                    conceptual thought creeps in, it is not a true experience of "catching 
                    sight of the ox." </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Let's look 
                    at this phenomenon more closely. There are said to be six "roots" 
                    [kon] of perception, that is, six sense organs: eyes, ears, nose, tongue, (tactile) 
                    body, and mind. Corresponding to these organs there are six "objects"[kyô] 
                    of perception: color and shape, sound, smell, taste, tangible objects, and mental 
                    objects. And there are six "consciousnesses" [shiki] which occur when 
                    the six sense organs correspond to the six objects of perception: visual consciousness, 
                    auditory consciousness, olfactory consciousness, gustatory consciousness, tactile 
                    consciousness, mental consciousness. True enlightenment is understanding that 
                    each one of these is true reality, devoid of any substance, the true self; among 
                    them there exists absolutely no difference. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> And it is not 
                    only the six sense organs, six objects of perception, and the six consciousnesses 
                    which are meant here. Standing, sitting, crying, laughing, eating, drinking, 
                    slipping, spilling - all such movements are the true self, the true fact, that 
                    is, the ox as a whole really appearing in total openness. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> The condition 
                    of the true ox as devoid of all content is just like the saltiness in sea water 
                    or the glue in the pigment, which cannot be detected from outside. Ordinary 
                    people know only the superficial forms like the sea water or pigment. But after 
                    enlightenment you realize that there is saltiness in sea water and glue in pigment, 
                    and that, in actuality, these elements have been doing their natural work. When 
                    you know clearly saltiness which makes sea water what it actually is and glue 
                    which makes out pigment, with confidence you can say that this is the ox (the 
                    true self). The result is that the entire way of looking at things you have 
                    used up to now changes completely. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Let's now take 
                    a look at the verse of Kakuan Zenji: </span></strong></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">The bush warbler 
                      sings on the branch. </span></strong></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> The term "bush 
                    warbler" means nightingale. The nightingale sits on a branch and warbles 
                    in a loud voice. "Catching sight of the ox" (enlightenment) must be 
                    a clear experience like this. It is the "boom" of Master Mumon and 
                    the "whack" of Master Kyôgen. Insofar as you bring to dokusan 
                    some abstraction like, "Each thing in heaven and on earth is itself an 
                    expression of Mu," it is not the real thing. Abstractions, concepts, thoughts 
                    are play models of Zen and not Zen itself. Both teachers and students of Zen 
                    must take this to heart. Accordingly checking this out is very important. </span></strong></p>
              <blockquote>

              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> When you have 
                    experienced really "catching sight of the ox" (enlightenment), you 
                    for the first time escape from the fetters of the ego and see reality just as 
                    it is. It is like when you have put down the pack from your shoulders just as 
                    the spring sunlight comes through and a gentle breeze flows; the weeping willows 
                    on both banks are putting out green leaves and the branches are swaying gently. </span></strong></p>
              <blockquote>

              </blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> The true ox 
                    being expressed in the softness of this spring scene is not just the world which 
                    is seen by the eyes or heard by the ear [ninku]. All the environment surrounding 
                    us is the true ox itself [hokku]; all the universe is the ox itself. Thus, if 
                    this is true, even should you want to escape from the ox there would be no way 
                    to escape. And: </span></strong></p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> No one can 
                    express or diagram or foretell when and in what way the ox will appear, for 
                    the movements of the real ox are very lively in the midst of the forest. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> But what we 
                    must keep in mind here is that, when you have an experience like this, you feel 
                    just like you have gotten hold of the neck of the devil, and before you know 
                    it, you are boasting of the experience, neglecting your practice, disregarding 
                    the master, such that it would have been better never to have done Zen in the 
                    first place. "Catching sight of the ox" is still only the third stage. 
                    Know that you must walk a road of continual striving for improvement. </span></strong></p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"><br> The stage of "seizing the ox" is that at which you have firmly laid 
                    hold of the ox, which is our essential nature. The essence of the ox has become 
                    clear. At the stage of "catching sight of the ox, " you have only 
                    seen the ox. If you slacken your effort, thinking that this is already the highest 
                    attainment, the ox soon disappears from sight again. The resulting state is 
                    one in which all that remains is the memory of having seen the ox (having reached 
                    enlightenment). Thus, if you have reached enlightenment, it is vitally important 
                    to continue your practice more and more vigorously to make that world which 
                    has been glimpsed become even clearer. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> However, this 
                    ox in our heart for a long time has been set deeply in the outlying fields and 
                    in the midst of mountains,which is to say, it has been mired in the phenomenal 
                    world of dualism. And because it cannot forget the taste of that world, it has 
                    been very difficult to pull it away from it. As the result of long years of 
                    practice, for a brief moment today, you have been able to grasp the ox. This 
                    is the stage of "seizing the ox." </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Well, exactly 
                    what does it mean to have seized the ox (real self), you may ask. It means to 
                    see clearly, without the mediation of concepts, that the essence of your self 
                    is completely empty, and that because the essential self is empty it has the 
                    unlimited ability to become anything. The expression in the Prajna-Paramita 
                    Sutra, "Form is emptiness," refers to this reality; it is neither 
                    a thought nor a concept. When you reach this point, there is no fear of losing 
                    the "ox" anymore. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> However, the 
                    world of dualism that you have become accustomed to so long is a very comfortable 
                    world in which to live. The true ox that is completely empty of substance, before 
                    you are able to come to know it, separates off and becomes the slave of its 
                    surroundings. It becomes buried and is unable to free itself. That part of us 
                    which is attached to the old world of dualism is not only very stubborn but 
                    also has the tendency to soon get out of control. So, in one way or another 
                    you cannot help but thinking there is an objective world outside of yourself. 
                    If you understand that from the beginning the essence of your self is empty 
                    [shinku], you should also be able to see that the objective world is also empty 
                    [hokku]. But in reality, things do not go so easily. In order to further make 
                    the world of hokku(world as empty) clear you must work and practice harder and 
                    harder. Once you have taken hold of ninku (self as empty) and hokku (world as 
                    empty), then for the first time the world of truly "seizing the ox" 
                    becomes apparent: the whole universes is only one person, so that "above 
                    and under heaven there is only I, alone and sublime." </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Now we can 
                    appreciate the verse of Master Kakuan: </span></strong></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">You have exhausted 
                      all your faculties to take hold of him. </span></strong></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> ecause you 
                    found the true ox ("seeing the ox"), you were overjoyed and encouraged 
                    a hundredfold. Then, you were further inspired to try to actually grasp the 
                    ox with your hands. As a result of this long and persistent pursuit, you were 
                    finally able to seize the nostrils of the ox. </span></strong></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Because his 
                      spirit is strong and his strength abundant, <br> it is difficult to rid him of his habits. </span></strong></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> But once you 
                    grasp this true ox, you find that its habit of seeking the discrimination of 
                    dualism remains strong. You put yourself forward everywhere, see the other as 
                    other, and are taken up in that world of discrimination. There is danger that 
                    those very reins holding the ox, by which you have gone to the trouble to make 
                    clear the world of emptiness, will be severed. The bad habit of opposing self 
                    and other, because it has perjured over such a long period, does not easily 
                    change even though you have understood emptiness. Therefore you must more and 
                    more throw yourself into the practice of Zazen. </span></strong></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Sometimes

              </blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Let me elucidate 
                    that state of not being able to change. At some time, even though it is just 
                    for a moment, standing at the pinnacle of "seizing the ox," you linger 
                    in the world of emptiness and become attached to the world where - as a famous 
                    phrase goes - "there are no living beings to be saved, even if you should 
                    want to save them." You boast that "no one has had as deep an enlightenment 
                    as I." When your heart is seized by this state, the freedom of mind and 
                    action no longer exists. Surely, it is few that have actually experienced such 
                    a thorough emptiness, and certainly the joy of having experienced that world 
                    is without comparison. But to become attached to that world leads to self-complacency; 
                    a person afflicted with Zen sickness like this is nothing but a white elephant 
                    that is completely useless for saving other living beings. </span></strong></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Other times

              </blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Another facet 
                    which is difficult to eradicate is the tendency to return quickly to the world 
                    of dualism - the makyô [delusive fantasy] which spreads so easily like 
                    a smoke screen. From there it is very hard to escape again. Because the self-consciousness 
                    that "I have attained an enlightenment which others couldn't" has 
                    become so strong, such a person is, on the contrary, more stubborn than those 
                    who have not attained enlightenment. Such people put themselves forward more 
                    strongly, and reach a state which is beyond help. Undoubtedly there were some 
                    cases like this in the past because there is an ancient term "arrogant 
                    Zen-devil" [zen-tenma] to warn against just such a state. To avoid that 
                    pitfall, you must, after reaching enlightenment, become more and more humble 
                    and put yourself more into Zen practice. </span></strong></p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"><img src="http://www.terebess.hu/english/img/cow05.jpg" alt="" width="281" height="304"><br> </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"><br> Once you have reached the point of "seizing" the ox, which is the 
                    true self, you must not rest on your laurels but continue to practice with all 
                    your strength and go on to the next stage. It is the stage of taming the ox, 
                    a very important process by which you make your own that which has been realized. 
                    As I mentioned previously, seizing the ox is grasping clearly the fact that 
                    the essence of your self is completely empty [ninku] and at the same time all 
                    beings in the universe are also completely empty [hokku]. But to have attained 
                    such an enlightenment does not mean that our concepts and delusions automatically 
                    all disappear. With the re-appearance of just a minor conceptualization, the 
                    delusive concepts come back again one after another without end. In fact, it 
                    is the case that the clearer your experience of seizing the ox, the harder it 
                    is to escape the delusion of having understood this whole world and to avoid 
                    the proud thoughts which ensue one after another. You boast of the experience, 
                    talk proudly of Zen, and fall prey to the reckless desire to want to direct 
                    and lead others. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Of course, 
                    if you should ask what is the essence of these delusive and discriminatory thoughts 
                    that arise continually, know that they are in themselves empty and without reality. 
                    If you can really rest assured in that fact, each of them, one by one, becomes 
                    the true self as it is. But we humans, unfortunately, always cling to what we 
                    have experienced and have the habit of not letting go. This is especially true 
                    in the case of the seizing of the ox, a feat that most people have a difficult 
                    time achieving. Once we have made it, we boast that no one has had such a wonderful 
                    experience. We cling to the delusive and proud thoughts that arise one after 
                    another, such as, "Perhaps even Shakyamuni Buddha himself did not have 
                    such an experience as I." And these thoughts themselves become a new reason 
                    for delusion. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> We always can 
                    see only the oppositional world of dualism, subject and object, but the concept 
                    that the objective world "is" appears not because the objective world 
                    is really there. Only because in our hearts we recognize "The objective 
                    world is," it is. This means that this "is-ness" is, in reality, 
                    only in our mind. Therefore, there arises in the mind the idea of "I" 
                    which has experienced seizing the ox, so the world corresponding to that "I" 
                    also appears, with the result that the objective world is conjured up by the 
                    proud "I". In the true world of seizing the ox, the objective world 
                    as well as the subjective world is totally empty; there is no room for being 
                    and non-being to appear at all. To be always at rest securely in such a world, 
                    it is necessary by all means to put the halter through the nose of the ox and 
                    pull it firmly. If the ox starts to eat the grass of discriminatory delusion, 
                    tell him "No, no!", never neglecting the due training, and continue 
                    in hard practice to the end. The practical means to that end is that single 
                    sharp spear, MU. This is the practice for post-enlightenment, and you must say 
                    that, in a sense, it is endlessly more difficult than the pre-enlightenment 
                    practice. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Let's now look 
                    at the verse of Master Kakuan: </span></strong></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Occasional 
                      whipping does not depart from the body. </span></strong></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> The stage of 
                    taming the ox is one in which you must make the utmost effort to bring under 
                    control as far as possible the ox you have seized. For that purpose you must 
                    never let the whip or the halter get away from your self. </span></strong></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Lest he follow 
                      his own whim, entering the dust and dirt. </span></strong></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> If you don't 
                    take such precautions, without fail the ox will go off on its own and will enter 
                    that world of discrimination full of dust and dirt. It goes without saying that 
                    this applies to the secular world in which it was so much at home before, but 
                    it also wants to go into that world of enlightenment (seizing the ox), and it 
                    is not easy for it to come out from there again. </span></strong></p>
              <blockquote>

              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> To "devotedly 
                    tame him" means that if you really become serious and keep taming the ox, 
                    your heart gradually softens and becomes pure. This is a very important process. 
                    Having your experience approved, and coming to the stage of seizing the ox, 
                    an experience which most people have a hard time achieving, you come, by and 
                    by, to think greatly of yourself, and without noticing, you become proud of 
                    yourself. It is only through strenuous sitting and continual training that the 
                    heart gradually becomes gentle, and the physiognomy becomes mellow, and the 
                    former harsh way of speaking drops away. If this does not happen, it is not 
                    the true effect of Zen. </span></strong></p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Once the ox 
                    has become tamed, even if you do not attach the bridle or chains, the ox naturally 
                    starts to follow. Therefore, standing, sitting, crying, laughing, the true ox 
                    always remains.</span></strong></p>

                    Pictures <br> Stage 6<br> RIDING THE OX HOME </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"><img src="http://www.terebess.hu/english/img/cow06.jpg" alt="" width="281" height="304"><br> </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"><br> As the title says, this is the stage in which you get on the ox and ride it 
                    home. It is the fruit of the previous stage of taming the ox, and it is that 
                    stage in which at last the ox follows what it is told. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> In the stage 
                    of seizing the ox, you were able to grasp your true self. However, as is often 
                    said, if thoughts occur even a little, other thoughts are soon to follow; you 
                    are then bothered by thoughts which occur one after another. Especially the 
                    thought that you have achieved a great enlightenment rarely attained by others, 
                    gradually without your noticing it, becomes a source of pride which is difficult 
                    to dispel. Therefore, you try to tame this ox by fighting strongly against such 
                    a thought, saying to yourself: "This is not enough, this is not enough." 
                    Now this effort at taming the ox has brought results, and the struggle is over 
                    at last. By that I mean that you have recognized that the substance of unenlightened/enlightened, 
                    ordinary/holy, good/bad, gain/loss is empty and that accordingly the wall between 
                    unenlightened/enlightened, ordinary/holy, good/bad, gain/loss has disappeared. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> And so just 
                    as the lumberjack hums a country melody or children innocently play their children's 
                    tunes on their flutes, so too does such a person enter a state of true freedom 
                    without any blocks. From the standpoint of the ordinary person it is indeed 
                    an enviable state. This state in which the ox (your true self) does exactly 
                    what it is told,is like being able to lie down leisurely and watch the clouds 
                    in the sky move gently here and there. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Even if you 
                    try to call the ox back,it does not look back. Even if you try to grab it and 
                    to lock it up, it would not stop. Letting things run their course, day by day, 
                    hour by hour, doing what should be done, you go along without any hindrances. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> This is truly 
                    a wonderful state. However, there is here a big trap. That is because there 
                    is an ox which is walking along smoothly on its own and a self which is looking 
                    at that ox. And that self is happy, gazing at the ox (the true self) and thinking 
                    how gentle it has become. Your state has become so comfortable. You proclaim 
                    that you have reached a wonderful state. And those who hear that admire it as 
                    something worthy. But they also think that such a person must be special, and 
                    they feel no urge to try zazen. The result is a completely useless Zen, certified 
                    by only your self. But once you have come this far, you must urge yourself on 
                    further by the motto, "Practice another 30 years," and sit and sit 
                    and polish the self. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Now let's look 
                    at Master Kakuan's verse: </span></strong></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">You mount 
                      the ox and want to make your way slowly home. </span></strong></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> The word for 
                    "slowly" [iri] in the original text refers to something connected 
                    and stretching for some distance. Here you have mounted the ox, which is your 
                    true self, and is slowly proceeding to return to your native village with no 
                    end yet in sight. "Wanting to make your way" means that you are trying 
                    to return, but it also implies that you are not being able to do that. What 
                    keeps you from coming back? It is because there is a self, which is looking 
                    at the ox. </span></strong></p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">"A barbarian" 
                    [kyô] refers to a foreign tribe living in the northwest of China. The 
                    sound of a flute played by someone in this tribe salutes the sunset note by 
                    note. It can be heard so clearly. But that flute, like the sound of a foreigner 
                    playing in a strange land, brings a tinge of melancholy. </span></strong></p>

              </blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> That is true, 
                    but, in each song and each note, there is an infinite savoring. That is so because 
                    in every clap of the hands, or every footstep, or in each blade of grass, the 
                    true self is at work. You are able to experience directly these things without 
                    logical thinking and manipulation of concepts. </span></strong></p>

              </blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> But what really 
                    is that like, you may ask. In ancient China there were two friends, Hakuga and 
                    Chôshiki. Hakuga was a master of the Chinese lute. When Hakuga played 
                    the lute, Chôshiki would discern the state of his mind and his disposition 
                    by listening carefully to the sound and the tone. So it is not always necessary 
                    to verbalize what is within. There is a way of understanding perfectly while 
                    being silent. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> It is not easy 
                    to reach this state. However, this close friend, that is to say, the ox, which 
                    without saying or proclaiming anything, is always still there. Because this 
                    state is pleasant and happy, the sickness of clinging by all means to this experience 
                    appears. This is the innate weakness of human nature. And little by little, 
                    unawares, you fall into this way of thinking. This stage is only the sixth stage, 
                    and you should know that you are still "on the way." </span></strong></p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"><br> In the stages of the practice of the Buddhist way we have at last reached the 
                    seventh stage, "forgetting the ox." It goes without saying that the 
                    ox refers to what may be called the original self or the true self. It is Mu 
                    which all of you are looking for. This is the stage of forgetting the ox. But 
                    what does it mean to "forget the ox"? </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> We began our 
                    practice by seeking the ox. We discovered the ox (catching sight of the ox), 
                    took hold of the ox (seizing the ox), brought the ox under control (taming the 
                    ox), and have been training the ox to do, to a certain degree, what it is told 
                    (riding the ox home). In this process you have handled many koans, knowing the 
                    joy of passing them as well as the pain and anxiety of not getting through them. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> When you seek 
                    in such a thorough fashion the true self (the ox), that self which is doing 
                    the seeking disappears, and only the true self remains. More exactly, you enter 
                    the world in which the true self also does not come into consciousness. This 
                    is truly that world in which you have forgotten the self completely, a world 
                    of complete emptiness, "without even a wisp of cloud to obstruct your vision" 
                    [manako ni sayuru kumonohamo nashi]. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Were you to 
                    compare this world to something concrete, you might think about extracting pure 
                    gold from base ore. It is totally pure and without blemish. The whole universe 
                    is pure gold. The ore from which you extracted the gold, the tools you used 
                    to extract the gold are all gone. Or again, it is just like the moon moving 
                    apart from the clouds and shining in the fullness of the heavens completely 
                    white. The whole world is a world in which there is only the moon with no clouds 
                    at all. The sublimity of a world completely void is beyond verbal expression. 
                    It is a world which can only be savored by actual experience. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> When you arrive 
                    at this point, the koans with which you have struggled and labored become completely 
                    useless [kankagu: "unnecessary pieces of furniture"]. However there 
                    is always room for greater attainment. At this stage there still remains as 
                    a residue [kasu] the self-consciousness that this world is without any substance. 
                    That is the aspect of this stage expressed as zainin ("the person remains"). 
                    YAMADA Kôun Roshi has expressed his own experience in the following way: </span></strong></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">"In terms 
                      of my own experience, for about a week after my enlightenment it seemed as 
                      if my whole body was trembling. And like a fish put in to the water to swim, 
                      I was able to live without any hindrance. I felt very free and happy. However, 
                      that did not continue long. After about 10 days or a month, the self appeared 
                      again. It was not so much the consciousness of the egoistic possessive ego, 
                      but rather the consciousness of the self. You are conscious of the self. That 
                      remains." </span></strong></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> In my case 
                    I realized that koans were totally "unnecessary furniture," and for 
                    a while I felt that doing koans was completely foolish; as I remember, the self-consciousness 
                    that the thinking self was there continued for quite a long time. This is not 
                    yet the real thing. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Let's now go 
                    on to Master Kakuan's verse: </span></strong></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">You have mounted 
                      the ox <br> and already reached your home in the mountains. </span></strong></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> In the verse 
                    on the sixth Picture ("riding the ox home.") it was said, "You 
                    mount the ox and want to make your way slowly home." The words "want 
                    to" convey the meaning that you try to go home but can't. And why is that? 
                    I said it was because there is still a self which is looking at the ox. When 
                    you do away with this self which is doing the looking, you actually understand 
                    that you have already reached home. I want you all to really grasp how important 
                    it is to have had the experience once of thoroughly forgetting the self. </span></strong></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">The ox is 
                      gone and the person has nothing more to do. </span></strong></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Both the ox 
                    to be sought (the true self) and the seeker also are totally void and empty 
                    of content. Once this is understood, the ox and the seeker are totally one. 
                    We could say, "When you stop seeking, the whole thing appears." The 
                    world in which there is no one and no thing manifests itself clearly and vividly 
                    before your eyes. It surely expresses the spirit of "the leisurely person 
                    of the Way, who, having finished learning, has nothing more to do" [zetsugaku 
                    mui no kandônin - a quote from the Shôdôka]. </span></strong></p>

              </blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Absolutely 
                    nothing more to do! Even though the bright red sun climbs in the sky as high 
                    as "three bamboo lengths," you are still in dreams and sleeping. This 
                    attests to the level of realization at which the entire universe is intrinsically 
                    safe and sound. </span></strong></p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Accordingly, 
                    the whip and halter used to control the ox are not needed any more. They are 
                    left alone at a corner of the hut where the grass is growing. Formerly, with 
                    a great effort using the whip and binding with the halter you trained the ox. 
                    But now that is completely unnecessary. Yet there can be no slackening of effort! 
                    There is still that self-consciousness of the self that "no longer needs 
                    to train the ox."</span></strong></p>

                Pictures <br> Stage 9<br> RETURNING<br> TO THE SOURCE</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"><img src="http://www.terebess.hu/english/img/cow09.jpg" alt="" width="281" height="304"><br> </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"><br> How much time and pain it took to come to the eighth stage of "Person and 
                Ox Both Forgotten"! Now you have reached at last the stage where you realize 
                the fact of "Person is empty, so is the dharma," that is, the subject 
                (person) and the object (dharma) are both totally empty. Since this is the fruit 
                of extremely long and hard labor, you tend to stick to this stage and to cherish 
                it endlessly - the last residue of enlightenment. If you succeed in washing 
                it away by constant and persistent sitting, you come to a state of realization 
                that the fact of "Person is empty, so is the dharma" is the essential 
                state of human beings, signifying nothing special at all. Through this realization 
                you return to your original starting point. This is the stage of "Returning 
                to the source," where not a trace of such things as "Buddhism" 
                or "Tathagata" is found anywhere. It is true that "the state 
                after enlightenment is exactly the same as that of before enlightenment." 
                It is the state of mind of "a leisurely person of the Way, who, having 
                finished learning, has nothing more to do."</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> At this stage 
                you can observe that all the highs and lows and vacillations of this world are, 
                as they are, void of substance and are manifestations of the world of perfect 
                stillness and non-being. Expressed in these terms it sounds as if there were 
                two things - being and non-being. But in fact, being is non-being; the aspect 
                of being is, as it is, non-being itself. There is no distinction between the 
                two at all. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> This proposition 
                "Being is non-being" is a crude fact, not a temporary illusion or 
                a dream. At this point you can realize and affirm that it has been entirely 
                unnecessary to be consciously engaged in practicing the way or trying to attain 
                enlightenment. This is a very important point: you start with the first stage 
                of "Searching the Ox," and, spending many years in practice, you come 
                at last to the ninth level of "Returning to the Source," and as a 
                result of this entire process you can say that practice and enlightenment were 
                unnecessary. It is totally wrong to maintain from the very beginning that practice 
                and enlightenment are of no use. Such an attitude is called "inactive zen" 
                [buji-zen] . Today, almost all Zen schools in Japan have degenerated to this 
                "inactive zen." They maintain that just sitting is enough, not appreciating 
                the experience of enlightenment or even ignoring it. On the other hand, you 
                must bear in mind: No matter how strongly you argue that enlightenment is important, 
                if it's nothing more than just propagating a conceptional zen or if you take 
                pride in your experience (if it was an authentic experience), you are only mid-way. 
                There is no other way than to sit and sit and sit, until you can very clearly 
                say that practice and enlightenment were intrinsically unnecessary. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Let's now appreciate 
                the verse by Master Kakuan: </span></strong></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Having come 
                  back to the origin and returned to the source,<br> you see that you have expended efforts in vain. </span></strong></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> You are now 
                back to your starting point. How much effort you needed for that! Occasionally 
                you encouraged yourself washing your face with the ice-chilly basin water, or 
                you sank into desperation listening to frogs croaking in the dusk outside, or 
                you kept sitting in defiance of the pains in the legs or of unbearable fatigue. 
                Many times you have felt, "Now, this time I've come to a true experience!" 
                but soon that experience is covered with anxiety and discontent. How many times 
                you have determined to stop doing zazen altogether!.</span></strong></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">What could 
                  be superior to becoming blind and deaf <br> in this very moment? </span></strong></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Come to think 
                of it now, why didn't I become like a blind and deaf person right away? "Blind 
                and deaf" here means a state of mind where there is nothing to see and 
                nothing to hear. When you see, there's only the seeing, and the subject that 
                sees doesn't exist. When you hear, there's only the hearing, and the subject 
                that hears doesn't exist. The objects which are seen or heard are, just as they 
                are, without substance. But understanding the logic of this will not do. When 
                this is realized as a fact, you become like a "blind and deaf" person. </span></strong></p>

              </blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> The late YAMADA 
                Kôun Roshi comments that this line comes from a dialogue between Unmon 
                [864-949] and Master Kempô [dates unknown]: Unmon visited Master Kempô 
                and asked, "Why doesn't a person inside the hermitage know anything outside 
                the hermitage?" To this, Kempô burst out into laughter. The point 
                is why the person inside the hermitage (subject) cannot see the things "in 
                front of the hermitage" (object). That's because there isn't anything in 
                front of the hermitage. You may say that there is only the subject, there being 
                no object at all. Yet, in actual truth, that "subject" doesn't exist 
                either. </span></strong></p>

              </blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> The water runs 
                smoothly, the flowers are colored scarlet. This line seems to imply that there 
                are only the objects and there's no subject at all. However, as a matter of 
                fact, those objects do not exist at all. It's simply that the water is running 
                smoothly, and flowers are scarlet. Everything is just as it is [tada korekore], 
                and everything is void as it is now [arugamama no aritsubure]. The fact that 
                there is no distinction between self and others simply continues without end 
                - "The water flows of itself and the flowers are naturally red.". </span></strong></p>

                Pictures <br> Stage 10<br> ENTERING THE MARKETPLACE<br> WITH ARMS HANGING LOOSE</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"><br> <img src="http://www.terebess.hu/english/img/cow10.jpg" alt="" width="281" height="304"> </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"><br> We have finally reached in our study the tenth of the Ten Ox-herding Pictures, 
                "Entering the Marketplace with Arms Hanging Loose." A person is going 
                into a market with hands swinging loosely by his side, that is, as casually 
                as you can be. From the first stage, "Seeking the Ox," through the 
                ninth stage, "Returning to the Source," by practicing extremely hard, 
                you have cleared the head of all concepts such as Buddhist Way, enlightenment, 
                certificate of approval [inka shômei] and so on. They have all been completely 
                swept clean. And, of course, it goes without saying, that any remnants of the 
                dualistic concepts opposing self to other are completely gone. The depths of 
                a person at this stage cannot be fathomed or seen into by even Shakyamuni himself. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> And the person 
                who has reached this level does not show any outward signs of being in such 
                a high or deep or tranquil stage of being. Nor does he or she make any conscious 
                effort to keep the rules of conduct and teachings of the saints and wise people 
                of old. You simply go where you want, do what you want, and live as you like. 
                And yet you do not stray from the right path. You lead a life of total freedom, 
                a life of natural simplicity without striving to do anything - and yet there 
                arise no problems. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> As an example 
                of that total freedom in all its naturalness in daily life, there is offered 
                the picture of a fellow swaggering to the market while chatting and swinging 
                a canister of sake at his hip and sharing it with others. By the time he heads 
                for home he will be completely drunk and tottering on his legs. But even so 
                he naturally makes his influence felt on the guests and owners of the bars and 
                fish shops, and convinces all that they are completely saved as they are. Such 
                a power of influencing people for the good is a virtue naturally acquired in 
                such a person. The substance of enlightenment has been totally personalized 
                with no untoward effects remaining. In other words, the person has completely 
                matured in buddha-hood. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Now let's savor 
                Master Kakuan's final verse: </span></strong></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Shoeless and 
                  bare-chested he enters the marketplace. </span></strong></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> With chest 
                bared, he saunters along barefoot without shoes, and enters the marketplace. 
                Without giving any thought to what others may be thinking of him, he opens himself 
                completely with no premeditation and acts and talks to them spontaneously. All 
                pictures representing the tenth of the Ten Ox-herding Pictures show a fellow 
                named Hotei [ ?-917, Zen monk in old China]. He is said to have had a big belly. 
                His gut is big and his chest bare. He has a big bag and a staff. And perhaps 
                he has been walking barefooted. The attitude of the dear old Hotei, who is said 
                to be a manifestation of Bodhisattva Maitreya, was presumably as that depicted 
                by this verse. The purpose of your practice is this, and insofar as there still 
                remains even a little remnant of the smell of enlightenment, you are still imperfect 
                and immature and foolish, and it is necessary to add even more practice and 
                discipline. </span></strong></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">He is daubed 
                  with earth and ashes, and a smile fills his face. </span></strong></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Only after 
                you become such a personality, for the first time you suffer with a suffering 
                person [kaitô-domen: ash-covered head and earth soiled face] and ever 
                so naturally a power to save that person emerges. This is not by any conscious 
                effort of will to do so, but it appears as something you must do as a manifestation 
                of the spirit of compassion. This is what is meant by the term "compassion 
                arising out of the body even without Dharma-bonds" [muen-dôtai no 
                jihi]. As Shakyamuni is reputed to have said: "All lands are my land; and 
                all the living beings in those lands are my children." When you achieve 
                this state you help people realize their own Buddha-hood daily and naturally 
                in every place and at every time. Because such a person is at all times peaceful 
                and calm at heart, there is always a smile playing on his or her face even when 
                not laughing, and the lips are always smiling. This is the meaning of the phrase, 
                tenka-taihei (all is peaceful under the sun). </span></strong></p>
              <blockquote>

                  use of the secrets of gods and wizards. </span></strong></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> To reach such 
                a state and live in such a way there is no need to have supernatural powers 
                of a holy hermit. That is the meaning of the third line of the verse. In days 
                of old many of those who did Zazen practice earnestly were able to achieve such 
                mental power of concentration that they could have many kinds of supernatural 
                powers. Shakyamuni himself in his Dharma-combats with his non-Buddhist opponents 
                made use of such powers. But these are, in the final analysis, byproducts of 
                zazen, and not the purpose of the practice of the Buddhist Way. And even should

              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Accordingly 
                in the Ten Ox-herding Pictures, far from emphasizing such powers, it is proclaimed 
                quite clearly here that they are not necessary at all. </span></strong></p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> The achievement 
                of this state is that you can help even those who, like a withered tree, have 
                lost all mental zest come to "blossom" again with a new breath of 
                life. The vow expressed in the words: "Living beings are numberless, I 
                vow to save them" is truly the prayer of all buddhas and bodhisattvas and 
                is none other than the font of the practice of the Buddhist Way. And the fact 
                that this capacity is already perfect in all men and women and all have it, 
                is what Shakyamuni preached, lived, and passed on. <br> </span></strong></p>
