So there isnt really a fixed me or we.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by january:</div><div class="quote_body">what is being moral? the is a very subjective question...<br>when you see a person in trouble and you can easily help him, you will usually do it because it is easy for you. like giving up seats and helping people to pick up things...<br><br>but when the help involves is bigger and if it may involve the safety of your own self, then you are more unlikely to help.<br><br>Selfish theory focuses on self, and this is important because it ensures safety to the self. if you think about it, we are usually thinking about ourselves our beliefs and what we are going to do. self centredness is an essential character of self.<br><br>sometimes,people need to cooperate also because of selfish theories... you cooperate and help others because in the end, it will lead to an effect of helping yourself because teamwork create a bigger power than individual...<br><br>i therefore dun see how one should be moral..... most people dun do immoral act because there are laws, punishments and social scolding that will occur along with it.....<br><br>if nobody is going to scold you and hate, and if all the punishment are removed, then people will do things that were labeled immoral in the past....<br><br></div></blockquote>As i have just said. Moral values are not only influenced by religion. You can't justified that buddhism is faulty because of ur concept on moral values.<br><br>Mm by the way ur "self" theory is arrowing emptiness?<br>From my understanding on buddhism, it is rather different.<br><br>However, i disagreed with 'self-centredness' is essential character of self.<br>The statement sound simple and narrow in context.<br><br>Some people tends to think for themselves; to get what they want and inconsiderate to others; to protect ourselves from necessary harm from others . You do agreed that we all need one another to get a task done right? You also mention that you help others because it benefits you.<br><br>There are different level of self-fishness.<br>One can be self-serving in certain matters and yet not excessively self-centred  at other times.<br><br>Do you think without the help of others, you can actually succeed in the first place? The fact is there is no seperate entity. We are all inter-related and we need and depend on one another.<br><br>So my question is if everyone is ( Let say extremely self-centred ), will there be a team in a first place? There are people who are tremendously egotistic. Trust me, some of them are just not likeable. Most of the successful person whom are capable leader, have a likeable personality.<br><br>What if everyone wants to satisfy different selfish needs and only looking for themselves, will there be synergy in the team to perform task effectively? Do u look forward to work in a back-stabbing environment and co-workers who do not care how you feel ?<br><br>I don't deny there are people who back-stab. No one is perfect or is behaving perfectly morally but who are we to judge them? In buddhism, we don't just see the goody-side of everyone. We see things as they are.<br><br>Lastly, may i ask when ur selfish needs aren't satisfied, will u feel very unhappy? A  person who is excessively self-serving tend to think for only themselves &gt; of only their only happiness and problems. It is harder for them to step out of their small little self to view the bigger picture. They might become more dogma.<br><br>There are also other people who are worse off than you but fail to "see" it cos ur mind is so much focus on nothing but a self.<br><br>Many times, we also tend to think that we are all TOO important, that we lack humilty to see our mistakes.<br><br>mm so imagine, without moral values, what our society will be like? You couldn't feel safe even stepping out of your house; where will u keep your money? Do u think that will be a proper working legal system for business to work out for? You can't trust others. If you can't trust others, can u truly know how to love?<br><br></div>

We always like to think of ourselves as THE ICON infront of others.  Buddhism teaches us to forgo that thought.  Reason being simple, your desire is endless, you may not get the kind of attention you wanted, and if you don't get what you want, you'll feel dejected, betrayed and it's painful.<br><br>You may choose to complain "why that so and so is so selfish?", or you may think it the other way that "maybe I was selfish to him first, then he reciprocate the same behaviour towards me".   If your choice is not later, then you jolly well keep your mouth shut when something bad happens to you because you have acknwledge that selfishness is the right way to live.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by january:</div><div class="quote_body">2) karma is another crap<br><br>the problem with buddhism is that it fails to learn from the basis of science.<br>theories have to be verifable...... if it cannot be experimentally carried out...<br><br>we do not make another hypothesis and conclusions<br><br>but i am amazed that buddhist believe in recarniations.....<br><br>therefore.. buddhist lack reasoning skills seriously in these areas...<br><br></div></blockquote>Buddhist don't lack reasoning in karma.

The substance of the wind does not take in a fragrance of the exquisite flowers. The substances of the fragrance, the wind, and the organ of touch' have neither shape nor color, but the fragrance cannot spread far away without the power of the wind. Wise Protector, in the same way, after a sentient being dies, his consciousness will take birth again together with the elements of feeling, awareness, and dharmas. Accompanied by the elements of feeling, awareness, and dharmas, the consciousness is reincarnated through [the union of] its parents, who are the conditions of its rebirth." </span><br><br>/\<br></div>
