                  with the term “Buddhist modernism,” used by David J. McMahan in his book, </span></em><em><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #333399; font-style: normal;">The Making of Buddhist Modernism</span></em><em><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal;">. This
                  excellent book makes a significant contribution to the discourse on the process
                  of modern Buddhism. However, there was one area which was not covered, an
                  aspect of Buddhism that is a very potent force in present day dharma, which is
                  the matter of faith; the kind of faith that is belief in supernatural beings
                  who offer help and salvation to human beings.</span></em><strong><em></em></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 19.2pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><em><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal;">I don’t intend to deal with the subject
                  comprehensively in a blog post, rather I am going to offer a few snapshots
                  together with some observations. Nonetheless, there are some questions I think
                  readers could keep in mind as they read the material. When there is an apparent
                  preoccupation on rebirth and karma, which could be considered more as matters
                  of doctrine rather than superstition, is the  religion vs. philosophy
                  debate concentrated on the right issues? Are we closing the gap between the two
                  Buddhisms (“ethnic” and “convert”) or widening it? Do convert Buddhists have an
                  accurate understanding of the role that supernatural beings play in the lives of
                  the majority of the world’s Buddhists? Is faith-based Buddhism authentic
                  dharma? Is there a place for faith in modern Buddhism? For prayer?</span></em><strong><em></em></strong></p>

                  and steps leading to the main shrine hall at Hsi Lai Temple</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 19.2pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I once gave a series of talks to the Cal-Poly Buddhist
                  Association. The faculty advisor, a Caucasian professor of Biological Sciences,
                  was concerned that since many of the members of the club, almost all of whom
                  were Chinese-American and went to Hsi Lai Temple, a predominately Pure Land
                  temple in Hacienda Heights, they took the teachings on O-mi-tuo-fo (Amida
                  Buddha) too literally. I devoted one of my talks to debunking Amida, the idea
                  of faith in Buddhism, and so on. I thought I was pretty good, too. Clear, logical,
                  and convincing. Immediately after the talk a young woman, an engineering
                  student, stood up  and said, “Your talk was nice, but when I pray to
                  O-mi-tuo-fo with sincerity, my prayers are answered.”</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 19.2pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Another student got up and testified how he had strong faith that
                  his earnest chanting of Amida Buddha’s name would result in his salvation and
                  rebirth into the Pure Land. Someone else said pretty much the same thing only
                  in relation to Kuan Yin. And so it went.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 19.2pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">These young people were very different from the professor and me.
                  They were born into their faith, whereas for the two of us, we had each
                  rejected the faith of our parents and through a process of investigation and
                  experimentation, made a conscious decision to become Buddhist. Our Buddhism had
                  nothing to do with faith, prayer, or supernatural beings. Ours was a pragmatic
                  approach to dharma, based on meditation and philosophical study. But we really
                  were in the minority, for faith and prayer is precisely the orientation for the
                  majority of Buddhists in the world today.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 19.2pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">In his book, David. J. McMahan states,</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: 24.0pt; line-height: 19.2pt; background: lightskyblue;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Yet, as noted, while meditation
                  has always been considered necessary to achieving awakening, only a small
                  minority of Buddhists actually practice it in any serious way. The vast
                  majority of Asian Buddhists have practiced the dharma through ethics, ritual,
                  and service to the sangha.”</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 19.2pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">This, for Asian Buddhists, is changing, but on the whole McMahan’s
                  assessment is valid. Furthermore, there has always been two kinds of Buddhism:
                  one for the monks and the educated elite, and another one for the masses. The
                  former has been meditation-based, while the latter, faith-based.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 19.2pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The ritual McMahan alludes to includes rites such as celebrating
                  the Buddha’s birthday, alms giving, lighting incense at shrines, as well as a
                  good deal of worship, directed at devas and/or celestial Buddhas and
                  Bodhisattvas. “Deva” means “deity.”  According to Buddhist cosmology, many
                  devas were human and still retain human qualities, but they are essentially
                  gods and they are worshiped by Buddhists because they are capable of rendering
                  help to human beings in times of difficulty. For a good overview of deva
                  worship in Theravada Buddhism, read “Worship of Devas” by A.G.S. Kariyawasam <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/kariyawasam/wheel402.html">here</a>.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 19.2pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Now that illiteracy in the world has been significantly reduced,
                  the two Buddhisms mentioned above have morphed into a different two Buddhisms,
                  described by Charles Presbish in the late 1970’s as “ethnic” and “convert.”
                  Even though Prebish’s model is over 30 years old, I think it still stands.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 19.2pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I used to go to the same temple the students from Cal-Poly
                  attended, Hsi Lai, which describes itself as “Pure Land/Ch’an.” There, the two
                  Buddhisms would come together under one temple roof and for the most part
                  remain separate, the twain never meeting. Ch’an at the temple was made up of an
                  eclectic group of Caucasians and Chinese-Americans, while Pure Land was all
                  Chinese.  On Sunday mornings, the Ch’an folks practiced qigong and
                  meditation in a conference room, while in the main temple the Pure Land group
                  chanted Amida Buddha’s name.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 19.2pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">This to me is a microcosmic representation of the state of
                  Buddhism today, East and West. I could be wrong, but in America, I doubt if
                  most meditation-based Buddhists have much knowledge about or have had
                  interaction with faith-based Buddhism. There are many reasons for this, such as
                  language, culture, location, and inclinations. For many of the same reasons,
                  the faith-based “ethnic” Buddhists rarely venture out of their comfortable
                  environment.  That’s what I have noticed in my experience, living in a
                  metropolitan area where all the major Buddhist schools and nearly all ethnic
                  traditions can be found.  I have made a point of sampling as many of these
                  different tastes of dharma as I can.</span></p>
              <p class="wp-caption-text" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Shakyamuni,
                  Amida, and Medicine Buddha in the main shrine hall at Hsi Lai</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 19.2pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">World-wide, the largest faith-based Buddhism, and indeed, the
                  largest of any Buddhist branch, is Pure Land. This form of dharma is based on
                  the notion of the Three Periods: the Former, Middle and Latter Days of the
                  Dharma, which did not become a fully realized concept until the 5th century CE.
                  The Former Day of the Dharma (Jp. <em>Shoho</em>) is the first thousand years
                  after the historical Buddha’s advent, when people can attain enlightenment
                  through their own effort and the teachings flourish. During the Middle (<em>Zoho</em>)
                  Day, the second thousand years, the Dharma continues to spread but begins to
                  lose its power. In the Latter Day (<em>Mappo</em>) Shakyamuni’s dharma is
                  almost completely degenerated and the minds of Buddhist practitioners are so
                  deluded that they can no longer liberate themselves through their own efforts,
                  they must rely on the saving grace of some “other-power.”</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 19.2pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">This is Amida Buddha, an entirely mythical being who promises
                  salvation and rebirth in his Pure Land for all those who take faith in him and
                  chant his name. There is no significant daylight between this and, say,
                  Christianity. And in Pure Land we find a real tension between their approach
                  and the teachings of the historical Buddha, who obviously did not teach this
                  kind of faith. Regarding this, Roger Corless, in his essay “Pure Land Piety”
                  (included in the anthology <em>Buddhist Spirituality</em>) says,</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: 24.0pt; line-height: 19.2pt; background: lightskyblue;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Pure Land Buddhism, however, is
                  not ambiguous. It speaks explicitly and often of reliance on Amita Buddha as
                  “Other Power” . . . This has led some scholars to claim that Pure Land is not,
                  or is not fully, Buddhist . . . charging that Pure Land Buddhism is a
                  corruption of “true” Buddhism.”</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 19.2pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I am sympathetic to this point of view, yet at the same time,
                  given its noble history and fine tradition of scholarship, I feel it is a bit
                  unfair to deny Pure Land full status as a branch of Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 19.2pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 19.2pt;">The second largest faith-based Buddhism is Nichiren Buddhism. The
                  Soka Gakkai describes their brand of faith, </span><a style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 19.2pt;" href="http://www.sgilibrary.org/search_dict.php?id=607">this
                  way</a><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 19.2pt;">: “Faith means to believe in the Gohonzon, or the object of devotion.”
                  The Gohonzon is the “mandala” inscribed by Nichiren (It used to be called “the
                  object of worship”). Nichirenism is presented as the antithesis of
                  “other-power” and Pure Land, however I have long felt that Nichiren originally
                  intended to create a virtual carbon-copy of Pure Land and that his mandala
                  actually represents a Supreme Being. That will be the subject of an upcoming
                  post.</span></p>
