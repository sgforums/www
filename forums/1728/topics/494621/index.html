              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Practicing
              with the Four Reminders</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">One
              of the best ways to prepare for death is to acknowledge that we really are
              going to die. We’re falling in the dark and have no idea when we’ll hit the
              ground. Buddhist scholar Anne Klein says, “Life is a party on death row.
              Recognizing mortality means we are willing to see what is true. Seeing what is
              true is grounding. It brings us into the present. . . .” We all know that we’re
              going to die, but we don’t know it in our guts. If we did, we would practice as
              if our hair were on fire. One way to swallow the bitter truth of mortality and
              impermanence—and get it into our guts—is to chew on the four reminders.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              four reminders, or the four thoughts that turn the mind, are an important
              preparation for death because they turn the mind from constantly looking
              outward to finally looking within. These reminders, also called the four
              reversals, were composed by Padmasambhava, the master who brought Buddhism from
              India to Tibet. They can be viewed as representing the trips Prince Siddhartha
              took outside his palace that eventually transformed him into the Buddha. During
              these trips, Siddhartha encountered old age, sickness, and death, and developed
              the renunciation that turned his mind away from the distractions and deceptions
              of the outer world and in toward silence and truth.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">As
              a meditation instructor, I often prescribe the four reminders as the best
              remedy to get students who have stalled on the path back on track. As with
              mindfulness itself, the four reminders provide another way to work with
              distraction. They bring the key instruction from The Tibetan Book of the Dead—“do
              not be distracted”—to a more comprehensive level. The four reminders show us
              that it’s not just momentary distraction that’s problematic but distraction at
              the level of an entire life. If we’re not reminded, we can waste our whole
              life.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              Tibetan Buddhist teacher Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche presented them this way:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">FIRST
              Contemplate the preciousness of being so free and well favored. This is
              difficult to gain and easy to lose. Now I must do something meaningful.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">SECOND
              The whole world and its inhabitants are impermanent. In particular, the life of
              beings is like a bubble. Death comes without warning; this body will be a
              corpse. At that time the dharma will be my only help. I must practice it with
              exertion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">THIRD
              When death comes, I will be helpless. Because I create karma, I must abandon
              evil deeds and always devote myself to virtuous actions. Thinking this, every
              day I will examine myself.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">FOURTH
              The homes, friends, wealth, and comforts of samsara are the constant torment of
              the three sufferings, just like a feast before the executioner leads you to
              your death. I must cut desire and attachment, and attain enlightenment through
              exertion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">How
              long should we contemplate these reminders? Until our mind turns. Until we give
              up hope for samsara (the worldly cycle of birth and death), and realize the
              folly of finding happiness outside.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Most
              of us spend our lives looking out at the world, chasing after thoughts and
              things. We’re distracted by all kinds of objects and rarely look into the mind
              that is the ultimate source of these objects. If we turn our mind and look in
              the right direction, however, we will find our way to a good life—and a good
              death. Instead of being carried along with the external constructs of mind, we
              finally examine the internal blueprints of mind itself.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It’s
              often said that the preliminaries are more important than the main practice.
              The significance of these four reminders, as a preliminary practice, cannot be
              overstated. Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche said that if we could truly take them to heart,
              50 percent of the path to enlightenment would be complete. These contemplations
              develop revulsion to conditioned appearances, point out their utter futility,
              and cause awareness to prefer itself rather than outwardly appearing objects.
              They turn the mind away from substitute gratifications and direct it toward
              authentic gratification—which can only be found within.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              four thoughts remind us of the preciousness of this human life; that we are
              going to die; that karma follows us everywhere; and that samsara is a waste of
              time that only perpetuates suffering. Memorize them. They will reframe your
              life, focus your mind, and advise you in everything you do. As Dr. Samuel
              Johnson, the author of the first English dictionary, said: “When a man knows he
              is to be hanged in a fortnight, it concentrates his mind wonderfully.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">What
              would you do if you had six months to live? What would you cut out of your
              life? What would you do if you had one month, one week, one day? The Indian
              master Atisha said, “If you do not contemplate death in the morning, the
              morning is wasted. If you do not contemplate death in the afternoon, the
              afternoon is wasted. If you do not contemplate death in the evening, the
              evening is wasted.” The four reminders remove the waste.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">We
              see others dying all around us but somehow feel entitled to an exemption. In
              the Hindu epic Mahabharata, the sage Yudhishthira is asked, “Of all things in
              life, what is the most amazing?” He answers, “That a man, seeing others die all
              around him, never thinks he will die.” If we acknowledge death and use it an
              advisor, however, it will prioritize our life, ignite our renunciation, and
              spur our meditation. The Buddha said: “Of all footprints, that of the elephant
              is the deepest and most supreme. Of all contemplations, that of impermanence is
              the deepest and most supreme.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Bring
              these supreme reminders into your life and realize that life is like a candle
              flame in the wind. Visualize friends and family and think, “Uncle Joe is going
              to die, my sister Sarah is going to die, my friend Bill is going to die, I am
              going to die.” Put pictures of dead loved ones on your desk or shrine; put
              sticky notes with the word “death” or “I am going to die” inside drawers or
              cabinets to remind you; read an obituary every day; go to nursing homes,
              cemeteries, and funerals. The essence of spiritual practice is remembrance,
              whether it’s remembering to come back to the present moment or recalling the
              truth of impermanence. Do whatever it takes to realize that time is running out
              and you really could die today. You are literally one breath away from death.
              Breathe out, don’t breathe in, and you’re dead.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">One
              of the marks of an advanced student is that he or she finally realizes that
              today could be the day. Realizing impermanence is what makes them advance. For
              most of us, however, as Paul Simon sang, “I’ll continue to continue to pretend
              / My life will never end. . . .” We essentially spend our lives moving deck
              chairs around on the Titanic. No matter how we position ourselves—no matter how
              comfortable we try to get—it’s all going down.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">These
              teachings exhort us not to spend our lives, which most of us do—literally and
              figuratively. Reinvest. Take the precious opportunity that has been given to
              you, and do not waste your life. The four thoughts that turn the mind turn it
              from reckless spending to wiseinvesting. We spend so much effort investing in
              our future. We invest in IRAs, 401(k)s, pension plans, and retirement
              portfolios. Spiritual advisors exhort us to invest in our much more important
              bardo (post-death) retirement plan. That’s our real future.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Don’t
              worry so much about social security. Finance your karmic security instead.
              Invest in your future lives now. Investing so much in this life is like
              checking into a hotel for a few days and redecorating the room: what’s the
              point? B. Alan Wallace says, “In light of death, our mundane desires are seen
              for what they are. If our desires for wealth, luxury, good food, praise,
              reputation, affection, and acceptance by other people, and so forth are worth
              nothing in the face of death, then that is precisely their ultimate value.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">On
              a personal note, understanding impermanence has been the greatest gift in my
              study and practice of the teachings on death. I’m thickheaded, but I finally
              get it: I am going to die—and it could be today. My life has been completely
              restructured because I now believe it. The rugged truth of impermanence has
              simplified my life, shown me what is important, and inspired me to really
              practice. Sogyal Rinpoche says in The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Ask
              yourself these two questions: Do I remember at every moment that I am dying,
              and that everyone and everything else is, and so treat all beings at all times
              with compassion? Has my understanding of death and impermanence become so keen
              and so urgent that I am devoting every second to the pursuit of enlightenment?
              If you can answer “yes” to both of these, then you really understand
              impermanence.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">These
              reminders may seem like a morbid preoccupation with death, but that is only
              because of our extreme aversion to dying. For most of us, death is the final
              defeat. As Jack LaLanne, the fitness and diet guru, once said, “I can’t afford
              to die. It would wreck my image.” We live in denial of death, and suffer in
              direct proportion to this denial when death occurs. The four reminders remind
              us of the uncompromising truth of reality, and prepare us to face it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              four reminders, joined with mindfulness meditation, instill a strength of mind
              that benefits both self and other. Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche says,</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              strength of shamatha [mindfulness meditation] is that our mind is slow enough
              and stable enough to bring in the reality, to really see it. Then when someone
              we know is dying, we aren’t so shaken up. We may be sad, in the sense of
              feeling compassion, but we have thoroughly incorporated the notion of death to
              the point that it has profoundly affected our life. That is known as strength
              of mind.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">That
              stability naturally radiates to stabilize the mind of the dying person, which
              helps them when everything is being blown away.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Dying
              people are sometimes jealous of those still alive. “Why do I have to die when
              everyone else keeps on living? It’s so unfair. Why me?” At that point they need
              to remember that those left behind are not returning to a party that lasts till
              infinity. Those left behind are returning to a challenging life that is filled
              with endless dissatisfaction and suffering. As you are dying, remember that
              it’s just a matter of time before everyone else joins you, just as you are
              about to join the billions of others who have already left this life for
              another one. Those left behind are a minority. No one is going to get out of
              this alive.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">And
              he who dies with the most toys still dies.</span></p>
