              Utd and she lived in London.

              and Buddhist nun Ani Rinchen shakes her shaven head with laughter as she tells
              me: “Of course I gave it in the end – he was a charismatic man.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #2c2c2c;'> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #2c2c2c;'>In another life – and I hear Buddhists have a few – she was a
              mini-skirted blonde model called Jackie Glass. She became the first serious
              girlfriend of football’s first pin-up. And not only did she play it cool at the
              start, she was the one who dumped him, refusing to take him back when he
              begged.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #2c2c2c;'>“We were together for a year properly and then another year off
              and on. I was his first love,” she says.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #2c2c2c;'>But then he was unfaithful and she read about in the papers.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #2c2c2c;'>“He said it didn’t mean anything and tried to get back with me.
              I was tempted, but I couldn’t see things would change,” she says. “We loved
              each other but our lifestyles were different. I didn’t want to be a
              footballer’s wife.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #2c2c2c;'>Now 67, Ani Rinchen (her Buddhist name means “precious”) is
              celibate, lives alone, meditates daily, wears plain red robes and no make-up.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #2c2c2c;'>But I can still make out a thread between the serene woman
              sipping elderflower cordial and the Sixties society girl wearing Mary Quant.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #2c2c2c;'>Her face often breaks into the same angular smile. And she’s
              tough. You have to be tough to follow her solitary path. And you had to be
              tough to date George Best at the height of his fame.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #2c2c2c;'>“Girls threw themselves at him. We couldn’t walk down the
              street,” she says. “Even going to the cinema he had to wait until everyone went
              in. It became such a bind. You would sit in your flat, or go to another
              person’s, or go to a restaurant if you knew the people there.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #2c2c2c;'>Then there was the drinking. George was making £2,000 a week
              when the national average was £23, but he never had to pay for the conveyor
              belt of alcohol that appeared before him.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #2c2c2c;'>“That was the root of the problem,” she recalls. “I have no idea
              what we got through. But I found it boring sitting in a dark bar drinking. I’d
              have preferred to go dancing.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #2c2c2c;'>“He didn’t court the adulation. But he didn’t have protection
              around him so he was vulnerable. And he was headstrong – not easy to guide. I
              tried to help but I was a bit reckless, too, at that age.” She adds: “He wasn’t
              happy. After the European Cup Final win in 1968 it all went a bit flat. He
              played well by anyone’s standards except his own.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #2c2c2c;'>As Jackie, she grew up in a middle-class Manchester family and
              began modelling at 16, moving to London as her career took off.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #2c2c2c;'>She went to Morocco for a shoot and stayed for a while,
              improving her A-level French so much that she offered to translate a screenplay
              into English for friend-of-a-friend Gerard Brach, a scriptwriter who worked
              with director Roman Polanski. She and Brach collaborated on the screenplay to
              Secret World, a 1969 movie starring Jacqueline Bissett.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #2c2c2c;'>She found herself in the very heart of swinging London, at
              parties with photographer David Bailey and his French actress wife Catherine
              Deneuve.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #2c2c2c;'>“I read somewhere that the Swinging Sixties only applied to
              about 100 people in London – I suppose it applied to me!”</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #2c2c2c;'>She went to film premieres with the Beatles and Paris with
              “crazy” Polanski.<br> “He stopped at a traffic light in Paris and jumped out, bashed his head against
              it, and got back in streaming blood!” she says. “He’d been trying to show us how
              most of the traffic lights there were made of rubber!”</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #2c2c2c;'>But she was back in Manchester, at a nightclub with a male
              friend, when George made his approach.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #2c2c2c;'>“This guy asked my friend could he dance with me,” she recalls.
              “He looked familiar and I realised it was George Best. I just remember thinking
              he was old-fashioned for asking! I know now George never danced, so it was
              quite extraordinary. He got self-conscious because everyone looked at him.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #2c2c2c;'> “He said ‘Can I have your
              number?’ I said there was no point because I lived in London. Then he asked me
              to the opening of his boutique the next day. He didn’t try to kiss me – he was
              a well-behaved man.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #2c2c2c;'>So she went, and gave him her number. By the time she got back
              to London he’d left a message.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #2c2c2c;'>“He said he was coming the next day. I met him at the station
              but he said he had training in the morning and had to get back.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #2c2c2c;'>“I said, ‘What did you come for then?’ He said he was hoping I’d
              go back with him. He’d come down to get me! So I got back on the train he’d
              just got off.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #2c2c2c;'>So began their whirlwind romance.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #2c2c2c;'> “I remember going to
              Polanski’s wedding to Sharon Tate. Warren Beatty was there, Jane Birkin, Mia
              Farrow. But George and I only had eyes for each other. We didn’t stay very
              long!”</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #2c2c2c;'>But his fame, drinking and womanising made a future together
              impossible. “I didn’t see it as glamorous – it was constraining,” Ani Rinchen
              explains.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #2c2c2c;'>After the split they never got in touch again. She had her
              daughter Rosie with “a tree surgeon, the polar opposite of Best” and when that
              relationship ended she took Rosie travelling, settling in Bali, running a
              textiles business, and taking an interest in Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #2c2c2c;'>Back in the UK when Rosie was 12, she heard the Dalai Lama speak
              and was “spellbound”. So when Rosie left home she went to live in a Buddhist
              monastery and inside a year, in 1994, was ordained as a nun.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #2c2c2c;'>At first she feared a dour life with no distractions. “I had
              this idea I wouldn’t be able to have a laugh,” she says. “But I had become
              bored with parties, people drinking a lot and talking rubbish.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #2c2c2c;'>“I cut my long blonde hair off. I could feel the air on my head.
              It was liberating.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #2c2c2c;'>“I was giving up all the things that weren’t good for me – I
              didn’t tell my daughter until afterwards!” Now Ani Rinchen manages a Tibetan
              Buddhist meditation centre in Edinburgh.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #2c2c2c;'>“I still like to have a joke – I’m a down-to-earth person,” she
              grins. “But I have simplified my life – I have inner peace.”</span></p>
