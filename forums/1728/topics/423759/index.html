              <p>Buddha had asked us not to blindly accept words from the authority, am I right to say that?</p>
              <p>Now lets take an example. When a Dharma Master say thing such as "æ‰€æœ‰ä¸€åˆ‡å®—æ•™é‡Œé�¢çš„åˆ›å§‹äºº ä»–ä»¬å…¨æ˜¯ä½›è�©è�¨çš„åŒ–èº«ã€‚" , that to many Buddhist is unheard of!!! It doesn't sound orthodox teaching!!!! So, they voice out their concern. <strong>Now, whats wrong with that?</strong></p>
              <p>Should we give ALL KIND OF UNORTHODOX TEACHINGS, HERETICAL TEACHINGS benefit of doubt??? Where to draw the line? Practice another ten twenty thirty years then voice out concern on unorthdox, heretical teaching??</p>
              <p>I think the best 'policy', best approach is when there's any question on the teachings, just shoot. No need to put some veil over the truth, shroud it with secrecy or something.</p>

              It doesn't sound orthodox teaching!!!! So, they voice out their
              concern. <strong>Now, whats wrong with that?</strong></p>
              <p>Should we give ALL KIND OF UNORTHODOX TEACHINGS, HERETICAL
              TEACHINGS benefit of doubt??? Where to draw the line? Practice
              another ten twenty thirty years then voice out concern on
              unorthdox, heretical teaching??</p>
              <p>I think the best 'policy', best approach is when there's any
              question on the teachings, just shoot. No need to put some veil

              <p>I can say I agree with you on this after having attended church for ten years and later getting involved in a Universalist-type religion for yet another decade. In these twenty years, I felt like I was searching and searching for something but never quite finding it.</p>
              <p>To borrow a pretty cool statement recently posted by another forum member, "most of us live our lives foolishly seeking consolations of love than enlightenment."  That was indeed what I was seeking.  Seeking love from the divine, and that ultimately disappointed.</p>
              <p>It wasn't until I finally realized the futility in that, accepted the four noble truths and took a much more serious look at Buddhism did I come to see that what was needed to liberate me was right under my nose all along. </p>
              <p>For many years, even though in a Universalist religion, I chose to focus more on the concepts of the divine than the concepts of seeking truth.  Buddhism really is the most ç©¶ç«Ÿ as you say.  It examines the human condition uncompromisingly, yet compassionately give methods and practices out of that misery.</p>

              <p>Hey good morning <em>SoulDivine</em> :)</p>
              <p>Certainly, we're not saying that Buddhism is the only way.  The word used is "ç©¶ç«Ÿ", which in this context may be understood more as "thorough, complete, exhaustive".</p>
              <p>That being said, "<em>a Buddhist cannot agree that 'all religions are essentially expressions 
              of the same inner reality'. Sometimes this stance is urged on Buddhists 
              with the coercive pressure of a theological correctness, but Buddhism 
              does not even regard itself as 'an expression of reality'. It sees its 
              own teachings and practices as means of creating conditions which 
              conduce to the perception of reality and Buddhists will judge other 
              teachings by the same criterion. Where there are differences of belief 
              and practice Buddhists need to ask (in the ample spirit of friendly 
              dialogue and tolerance) whether other religions, philosophies and 
              spiritual paths are based, ultimately on one of the two essential 'wrong
               views': nihilism and eternalism.</em>"</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800000; font-weight: bold; font-size: x-large;">Eternalism and Nihilism </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: large;"><em>The Buddha rejected both extremes
                          of eternalism and nihilism.</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-large;">T</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: large;">o develop Right View or Perfect
                          View, we must first be aware of two views which are considered imperfect or wrong. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: large;"><span>The first view is eternalism. This doctrine or
                          belief is concerned with eternal life or with eternal things. Before the Buddha's time, it
                          was taught that there is an abiding entity which could exist forever, and that man can
                          live the eternal life by preserving the eternal soul in order to be in union with Supreme
                          Being. In Buddhism, this teaching is called <em>sassata ditthi </em>----the view of
                          eternalists. Such views still exist even in the modern world owing to man's craving for
                          eternity.</span> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: large;">Why did the Buddha deny the teaching of eternalism?
                          Because when we understand the things of this world as they truly are, we cannot find
                          anything which is permanent or which exists forever. Things change and continue to do so
                          according to the changing conditions on which they depend. When we analyse things into
                          their elements or into reality, we cannot find any abiding entity, any everlasting thing.
                          This is why the eternalist view is considered wrong or false. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: large;"><span>The second false view is nihilism or the view held
                          by the nihilists who claim that there is no life after death. This view belongs to a
                          materialistic philosophy which refuses to accept knowledge of mental conditionality. To
                          subscribe to a philosophy of materialism is to understand life only partially. Nihilism
                          ignores the side of life which is concerned with mental conditionality. If one claims that
                          after the passing away or ceasing of a life, it does not come to be again, the continuity
                          of mental conditions is denied. To understand life, we must consider all conditions, both
                          mental and material. When we understand mental and material conditions, we cannot say that
                          there is no life after death and that there is no further becoming after passing away.
                          This nihilist view of existence is considered false because it is based on incomplete
                          understanding of reality. That is why nihilism was also rejected by the Buddha. The
                          teaching of kamma is enough to prove that the Buddha did not teach annihilation after
                          death; Buddhism accepts 'survival' not in the sense of an eternal soul, but in the sense
                          of a renewed becoming.</span> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: large;"><span>Throughout the Buddha'</span>s long period of
                          teaching the Dhamma to His followers, He actively discouraged speculative arguments.
                          During the 5<sup>th</sup> century B.C. India was a veritable hive of intellectual activity
                          where scholars, yogis, philosophers, kings and even ordinary householders were constantly
                          engaged in the philosophical arguments pertaining to human existence. Some of these were
                          either ridiculously trivial or totally irrelevant. Some people wasted valuable time
                          arguing at great length about all manner of subjects. They were far more concerned about
                          proving their powers in mental gymnastics than seeking genuine solutions to the problems
                          that beset humanity.<span> (In the 18<sup>th</sup> century Jonathan Swift satirized a
                          similar pastime in England when he showed the Lilliputians in <em>'Gulliver's Travels</em>'
                          waging a war to decide whether an egg should be broken on its sharp end or its broad end).</span> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: large;">The Buddha also refused to get involved in speculations
                          regarding the universe. He stated very clearly that the problem facing mankind is not in
                          his past or his future but in the immediate present. Knowledge about Eternalism or
                          Nihilism can in no way help man to break the present fetters which bind him to existence
                          and which are the source of all his feelings of discontent which arise from his inability
                          to completely satisfy his cravings. The Buddha stated that before one can begin to tread
                          the path which leads to Nibbana one must have Right View. Only when one knows clearly what
                          one is seeking will one be able to attain it.</span></p>

              <p>Hey good morning <em>SoulDivine</em> :)</p>
              <p>Certainly, we're not saying that Buddhism is the only way.  The word used is "ç©¶ç«Ÿ", which in this context may be understood more as "thorough, complete, exhaustive".</p>
              <p>That being said, "<em>a Buddhist cannot agree that 'all religions are essentially expressions of the same inner reality'. Sometimes this stance is urged on Buddhists with the coercive pressure of a theological correctness, but Buddhism does not even regard itself as 'an expression of reality'. It sees its own teachings and practices as means of creating conditions which conduce to the perception of reality and Buddhists will judge other teachings by the same criterion. Where there are differences of belief and practice Buddhists need to ask (in the ample spirit of friendly dialogue and tolerance) whether other religions, philosophies and spiritual paths are based, ultimately on one of the two essential 'wrong views': nihilism and eternalism.</em>"</p>

              <p>Yeah yeah, this is precisely what I meant by "ç©¶ç«Ÿ" (complete and thorough). Most of the religion preach only 2 realms (heaven and hell) but Buddhism says there are 6 realms. Ghost realm is one of the proven one. I said proven due to my personal experience and many others experiences.</p>
