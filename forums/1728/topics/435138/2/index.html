              <p>The bear are being tortured for a prolong period. If the decay is really bad, I would guess same go with the organ. I will give a head shot.</p>
              <p>No, I do not play such game.</p>
              <p>There are poachers in Singapore, but do the Sg Police Force care ?</p>
              <p>If I am one of those animal lover, I will simply "confiscate" those traps in the day. Or put a trap for human right next to those trap. Any proof who made those trap ? The Police in Sg will tell you it is VERY DIFFICULT. Check it out.</p>

              The Animals Asia group comprise mainly of surgical medical team and it is a voluntary organisation. Never mind you think they are Chiak Liao Bee, i just wait for you to go and do what you want to save the moon bears.  Maybe can read on yahoo news, ya?
              
              I just do a small part to buy a few t-shirts, spread the words about the suffering of the moon bears to let more people understand.  Just like putting down a name to stop the Somalia Tragedy. I can't do much.  The others like the Animals Asia volunteers really dedicate their time and money.

              <p>I have no doubt bear bile farming happen in China. But most of  those money collection are just for personal use.</p>
              <p>Gong An must be involve in such rescue operations. The rest are just Pei Jiao.</p>

              I've seen documentaries where the bears suffered mentally after being confined in cages. They would typically sway sideways incessantly, very sad.
                  Which also reminds of thr dancing bears. It is a response action where everytime the music is being played, it would trigger of reflex due memories of being on jumping in pain of being tortured.

              <p>Absolutely cruel.</p>
              <p>It is therefore I do not want to watch animal show. Eg. circus or those at Mandai Zoo. I knew there is certain amount of beating.</p>
              <p>But there are always people who want to attract visitors by using animal to entertain.</p>

              <p>Please forgive me, but i like to share some thoughts in all these discussions about cruelty to animals. I for one, do not condone any form of cruelty either to animals, humans or mother nature. However, I also realise that the best way out of all these evil, is working for self enlighjtenment and paying attention to good things that people do. Make a world a happier place by focusing on the good of humanity. Encourage others by showcasing what good many has done. Make laughter a daily antidote. I like sending funny clips so people can smile a little. I like to send inspiration clips so people can feel more for others. If we keep forcusing on the bad that people do, our thoughts only go there. We will be channeling our energies to negative vides. It does not help us or others. It may bring more awareness true, but it are side effects on our consciousness. We will think more about the bad of humanity and not the good. Newspaper are very good at this. If we want to see good, we have to first see the good in others. I have a co worker who everyday complain to me about other people, but she is no better as a person. Sorry i am not using this as pointer directly on anyone here, but use it to highlight how her negative thoughts have effected her as a person and she has became addictive to think this way. </p>
              <p>About enlightenment. Many feel that enlightennment is a personal thing, it has nothing to do with others, but we are wrong. We are all spiriutally connected to one another. What we gain in our victory, we share with others in the spiritual way. The more of us become enlighten, our consciousness will be share with the rest of humanity, only then will the world move spiritually forward. So try to focus only on the good of humanity. This will encouarge more to be good and do good.  </p>
              <p>I am writing this note because i understand your point. But you may not understand the effect of your own point. </p>
