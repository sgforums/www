              STOMPer Fanny wishes to share this online account of a man who visited a bear farm and witnessed the horrific practice of bile farming, which caused a mother bear so much pain that she killed her own cub to prevent it from suffering.
              
              Bear bile farming involves keeping Asiatic black bears in captivity to harvest bile, a digestive juice found in the ball bladder. 
              
              The bears are commonly kept in 'crush' cages that do not allow them to stand upright or even move, in some cases.
              
              The bile is then extracted via a tube inserted into the bear's abdomen, or allowed to drip freely from a permanent hole made in the bear's gall bladder.
              
              Bile farming is reported to be extremely painful for bears as they chew their own paws and beat their heads during the extraction. 
              
              To stop the bears from committing suicide, they are made to wear iron vests that cover their abdomen.
              
              The bears are farmed for 10 - 20 over years, and usually killed for their meat, fur, paws and gall bladders after they stop producing bile.
              
              Bear bile is used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) to reduce fever, improve eyesight, and some believe to increase sexual potency.
              
              It is estimated that about 500kg of bear bile is used by TCM practitioners yearly, but over 7000kg is produced every year. The excess is usually used in wine, eyedrops and tonics.
              
              There are also natural herbs and synthetic alternatives to bear bile. 
              
              Read the eyewitness account of how a mother bear killed her own cub to save it from bile farming on the next page

              Can we spread the words and appeal for this cruelty to stop. I am very sad and angry at the same time. Imagine a pain of 20 to 30 years for these bears.
              
              The bears can't fend for themselves, can we as humans stop this act by using law, using protests ,using other new methods , or even think of some ways to stop the pain of the bears?
              
              Please spread the pain of these bears to more people. Let them understand the box of medicine is cruelty.
              
              Or think of ways to reduce the pains of these bears by asking the bile farmers to use anesthesia for eg.
              
              The mother bear kills its baby bear to lessen its life sufferings. Such is a mother's love for its cub.  We as humans should understand the heart breaking pain of this bear mother.

              website of the Animals Asia that is working towards rescuing more bears from bile farms.
                  
              
              Animals Asia have a huge undertaking: the rescue, rehabilitation and care of 700 bears in China and Vietnam for the rest of their years while steadily working towards ending bear farming.
              
               To be successful we need the help of people like you to volunteer your time to help us spread the word about the plight of the bears and to raise the precious funds necessary for us to continue this vital work.

              TIB783G  some vegetarians do not even take any milk or dairy products. They are the blood from the cows.
              
              Extreme is not the right way to live. Each individual should find the right diet be it vegetarian or half meat or lesser meat for their health to live well.
              
              I don't think being a vegetarian does help the animals directly. But spreading messages like The Animals Asia people have certainly stopped 21 provinces out of 31 in China to sign a treaty to stop bile farming/industry.  I don't think all the staff of Animals Asia are extreme vegetarians as you suggest but they have certainly help the moon Bears tremenduously with their efforts.

              <p>Please be informed that Traditional Chinese Medicine uses plant extract. Cao Yao. Just because some Chinese extract some stuff from the bear means those stuff are "main stream Chinese medicine". There are many animal extract that are selling in the "Medical Hall" in Sg. Many people relate that as TCM !</p>
              <p>But the fact is animal extract is much more effective and have faster reaction.</p>

              The founder of Animals Asia has in face seek help with many TCM specialists to list down other herbs that people can use instead of bear gall medicine pills.
              
              TCM may use some animals in the prescription but mainly dried and dead ones, like seahorse .   
              
              They do not use live and kicking animals that are kept squashed in a cage for 20 - 30 years , suck the gall out daily and forbid the painful bears to commit suicide from this horrendous ordeal.   
              
              The Animals Asia planted many herbs and plants that the TCM specialists recommend to show to visitors what they can use instead of moon bear bile.

              I believe in TCM due to family upbringing , I believe there are other alternatives other than bear bile. 
              
              I until now haven't take bear bile for even once.

              <p>By labelling bile farming is for TCM already offended a certain sector of people.</p>
              <p>Close those involve in the capturing, farming and trading into the same cage with the bears.</p>

              that's not true that China don't care about animals, there are many who still care and are vegetarians.
              
              In fact , China has one membership drive of Animals Asia to stop bear bile farming. Hongkong also has this membership.   Singapore doesn't have. 
              
              Now Vietnam has just started the bear bile farming in 2004 and this need to be stopped too. Vietnam has a membership group to stop this.
              
              If someone kill a bear for bear paw , this is instant death but to capture a moon bear for 20-30 years just to suck out the gall is inhuman behaviours.

              <p>In China, eating dog (Xiang Rou) is common. On TV or YouTube can see.</p>
              <p>Method of slaughtering a Rabbit is 1st, tie one of the hind leg and hang the Rabbit onto the wall. After that, use 2 hand, left hand support the chin, right hand on top of the head. Right hand push down. The rabbit is dead.</p>
              <p>So what does Animals Asia do ? Why "s" in the word "Animals"  ?</p>
              <p>Only the Government could put a drastic stop to such thing. Eg. Sg.</p>
              <p>If I am a mainland Chinese or Vietnamese, I will go into the bear farm to kill the bear with the rifle. With some help from my buddies. Perhaps lock those farmer with a few bear.</p>
              <p>You guys think the Gong An will care ? Or people will report ?</p>

              you kill the bears for what ? you play too much violent games that you think killing is right?
              
              You can imagine all you want just don't go around shooting. That's wrong when you put it into actions.
