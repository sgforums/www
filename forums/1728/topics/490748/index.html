              first half of life is "acquire, compete, win," says Bill Kerley, a
              Jungian therapist with a doctorate in theology who practices out of St. Paul's
              United Methodist Church in Houston. It's about "being very interested in
              winning, being right and having stuff."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";'>The

              Kerley says, the airwaves and highways are full of people stuck in late
              adolescence, regardless of their calendar age. Psychologist and writer Bill
              Plotkin, he adds, has pegged about 80 percent of adults as out of touch with
              nature and far too involved with themselves.</span></p>

              you're not imagining it, Kerley continues: Many adults today fit the profile of
              the narcissistic personality.</span></p>

              have treated many hundreds of patients. Among those in the second half of life
              - that is to say, over 35 - there has not been one whose problem in the last
              resort was not that of finding a religious outlook on life."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";'>Nancy
              Gordon, director of the California Lutheran Homes Center for Spirituality and
              Aging, doesn't have statistics. "But it does seem," she says,
              "that the last quarter or half of life, the question is raised: What has
              it all meant?"</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";'>Often,
              that question arises when some of life's outward markers have been reached - or
              passed. If the kids are launched, the career goals met (or not), what next?
              "Who am I, and what does it mean when the labels don't apply
              anymore?" Gordon says. "If people get serious about it, they look to
              spiritual answers to help make sense of it all."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";'>Stockton,

              she felt she didn't truly understand. She went to Perkins School of Theology
              (part of Southern Methodist University) in Galveston "to figure out what I
              didn't know," she says, and studied women in the early Christian
              tradition.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";'>"By
              the time I graduated from Perkins, I figured out the problem was not that I didn't
              understand," she says.</span></p>

              tempting to think of midlife spiritual questioning as a 21st-century issue, but
              that's just ego. The quest is at least as old as modern civilization and
              probably older.</span></p>

              "Inferno" famously begins: "In the middle of the journey of our
              life I found myself within a dark woods where the straight way was lost."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";'>Is
              that a metaphor for midlife spiritual questioning?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";'>Yes,
              says Cristina Giliberti, who teaches Italian at Rice University. At the time of
              the writing, around 1302, Dante was in exile from Florence, likely close to 35
              years old ("the middle" of the biblical three-score and 10),
              uncertain of his future and writing a great poetic work on heaven and hell. His
              outer hopes dashed, he turned inward.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";'>It's
              tricky, Kerley warns. The opposite of faith is certainty, and religion isn't an
              insurance policy.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";'>"It's
              so ironic that many Christians treat religion like an evacuation plan to the
              next world," he says. "The Kingdom of God is not a place to get to,
              but a place to come from. In the second half of life we have to heroically pick
              up the tools and embrace that."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";'>Earlier
              in her life, Stockton had explored holotropic breath work, which combines
              breathing and music. She decided to become a facilitator. "That's when the
              journey really deepened," she says. "I could get a glimpse of the
              patterns of life that caused me to go in search in the first place."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";'>She
              went back to school again, this time to become a psychotherapist. "I love
              the work," she says. "It's so rich and meaningful."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";'>Gordon
              believes learning to age well is one way boomers can help reshape the
              conversation. She plans to downsize and move into a tiny house on her
              daughter's property. "I want to strip down to what I need and love,"
              she says.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";'>Kerley

              to be less reactive," he says. "Learn how to accept life on life's
              terms. You have to be in some community. You can't love by yourself."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";'>Stockton,
              who had "already been a little attracted to Buddhism," found herself
              visiting the Dawn Mountain Center for Tibetan Buddhism in Montrose. "I
              came to realize that the Buddhist path speaks to me in a way that the Christian
              path never did," she says. "Over the years, the Christian identity
              fell away."</span></p>

              spiritual journey keeps going on and deepening," Stockton says.
              "There are many, many practices" in Buddhism, she adds. "I don't
