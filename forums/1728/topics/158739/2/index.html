            <div class='col-md body'>A post from E-Sangha which I found very good (Regarding the Brunei Exorcism Video): <a href="http://www.lioncity.net/buddhism/index.php?showtopic=20578&amp;st=0&amp;p=291172&amp;#entry291172" rel="nofollow">http://www.lioncity.net/buddhism/index.php?showtopic=20578&amp;st=0&amp;p=291172&amp;#entry291172</a><br><br>Hi All ,<br>This is a brief translation of the item with my rusty Malay.<br>This happended in Brunei when girl school kids dabbled in challenges in the spirit calling games surmoning of spirits to ask for the exam questions . They stricked coins and called the spirits. Some one used the blood of a girl's menses which brought the spirit and it vocalised for blood . This frightened the kids and they all ran away , but did not return the spirit back to its world. The angry spirit threatend to attack with 28000 soldiers of his and it wanted blood. Thus havoc pervailed causing even teacher to fear the school. During a surpirse visit by the Sultan the girl during a school oral test became possessed asked for blood and the video showed a Bomoh ( Malay medium) exorcise the girl.<br><br>THere were rumours of disaster happening due to the ghost story and people stayed home in fear till 18 Oct passed. They coment on the differnt ghost that exists and their role is to destroy humans.<br><br>These sorts of things happen a lot in Malaysia,Indonesia as it is a common practice amongst the Malay community. I had come across these events in Singapore as well when I stayed there a long time ago where "Black magic" were used by evil men and women for personal gains. I am sure these practices still exists, there and in other parts of South East Asia .<br><br>This shows how easy it is to fall into the 'dark side " of the path and how frail we humans are . Once we passed to the wrong side we are almost always lost.<br>Buddha had explained of the other side of the world dimensions and has fortunately provided us with many means to help us , but it need the authorised Sangha to do that.<br><br>These beings are, just as we in this Saha world, suffering , but they can be malevolent and easily angered most likely Asuras . The best personal defence is Metta ( Metta Sutta)and transfering of merits. When faced or possessed with more malevolent spirits one need the Sangha to help/exorcise who have a lot more mantras in the sutras eg Ratana Sutra, Surangama Sutra , Medicine Buddha and Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva Great Compassionate Dharani Sutra etc. These sutras describe events of these and its correction.<br><br>I had once travelled on a path that was haunted near where I went for a retreat. There were so many ghosts that made my hair stand on ends . For two nights I had to walk this path to and fro all the time chanting the Metta suta and transfering merits of blessings ( before I learnt any Mahayana Mantras) . By the third night these beings were no longer angry or threatening - in fact welcoming me to pass in peace and comfort . others too felt the difference. The power of Metta experienced first hand with patience ( Khanti parami)! It may take more cultivated people a few moments to do that same thing I took 2 days to achieve, but it was a good lesson. Since then I have no more fear of ghosts or haunted places, i do not go with any intension of clearing them off - it is their right to be there . They just need our compassion and metta and some merits for their well being . Some need merits so that they can go on their way to their rightful world instead of being stuck here in limbo.<br>Ghosts = other sentient beings so we should help them as much as we can.<br><br>Sabbe Satta Suhkita Hontu!<br>Metta Karuna Mundita Upeka Parami!<br>Namo Amitofo !<br>AgSurfer<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>here's from a story from a clairvoyances who see such beings.<br><br>QUOTE<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Hi there,<br><br>U can call me A. I wish for my identity to remain anonymous and has no wish to enter the Sangha. I m just a simple believer of Buddhism. But. I have a few questions for u about mind mapping, mind control, psychic or telepathy whatever terms they call it. But before i continue, I will like to tell u a bit about myself. I do not know why but when I was a small boy I suddenly possess the ability to see supernatural spirits and yes I saw it in my backyard. I was playing alone and I saw it. It looks like a ball of fire but I do not understand fear and so I just continue with my game. I just ignore it.<br><br>Yeah, another time, I was staying in a big house. I am still a small boy. Strange but before I enter that house, I start to have goose bumps. Yeha, standing up my fore arms. I figure that it is my supernatural instinct that the house is not clean. But I did enter and we stayed there for a week. Yeah, I went to the badminton court and the goose bumps came again. I see a lot of Banana trees outside the fencing. Could there be tree spirits...HAH.<br><br>At night, I bath and strange feeling came to me as if someone is watching me but I cannot pinpoint the position. Come to bedtime, OOOoo, I had nightmares and my head was whirling like a hurricane. Next night, I slept in another room but the same thing happen. I had slight fever...but I dunno wat is there in the house. It is very eerie and old but this time I could feel and understand fear. Fear of the unknown.<br><br>Now older, I possess another ability. Yeha, dreams. Hard to understand but my dreams can help me to foresee future events relating to myself and the people I am to meet. I do not know why but it is ok.<br><br>Yeah, I meet spirits again. This time I was driving in the wee hours. Yeah, I was driving at 135 km/hr. As I make my way, I saw a shadow-like form and it flick itself across the road horizontally. I make no sense of it. When I reach my destination, I enquire about that location and it was said that it was a frequent car accident area and people had died in the accident.<br><br>Yeah now I know I have the eyes. It seems my ability is developing over the years. Next, I had a spiritual contact again. This time, I could hear them talking...yes it is quite scary cuz u cannt see but u can hear. Worse, another time, a spirit with a very evil voice was talking to another. A male to a female. The laugh was so damn evil I never hear before any living being laugh like that and they were talking in a language that I have never hear before in my life.  They talk for about 25 mins. I was very shaken. I prayed to the Almighty One yeah ... no use at all.<br><br>Now I m a Buddhist following the VajrayÃ¢na thoughts cuz there is Tibetan healing involved but read of some Sutras from the Ways of TheravÃ¢da, MahÃ¢yÃ¢na too. My psychic powers developed again. I can ask for lottery winnings but I m scare now. I believe that to give u have to take back. Maybe my life will be shorten. There is no free lunch in this world.<br><br>I continue my study to Black Magic which I can understand the workings behind it. I have seen its effect once on people and my father. I will not elaborate here on my setting up and exiting ceremony. Yes, they can alter events in this world which result in predictions. But now, I believe they r just evil spirits.<br><br>Now I am older and wiser too. I have no fear for them anymore. I have understood that these evil spirits are in fact creating a lot of chaos and waging an invisible war with humans. I do not know their purpose for doing so yet. They are in fact about ten to twenty thousand years old and have been living in this lonely planet for a long time. Yes, I know they have the ability to reside in animals, plants and humans too. Their numbers are too many. As a matter of fact, I believe they are technologically more superior than us humans cuz they are actually invisible and possess all knowledge about human civilizations. They are cleverer and more cunning and understand the psychological needs and thoughts of humans.<br><br>Now I could understand their advanced technology and how they use it to control the minds of humans. Their methodology is simple but most effective.</span><br><br>What i reply.<br><br>QUOTE<br><span style="font-style: italic;">According to Buddhism, what you say is very close, except for the part that ghost are more advance? Agree only that ghost have 'limited' spiritual powers, such as seeing future, read minds, see people's karma. Their dimensions and ours are pretty close. i think some also follow different religions, carried forward from human believe to ghost realm. i know even the general of China dynasty (Yie Fei) had become a King in maybe a domain of Ghost realm.<br><br>Also think they respect one who uphold a good morality/precepts. As they see future that these good people will enter the realm of devas/ bodhisattva paths. They don't dare to disturb you, as they will be planting bad karma themselves. Think they disturb those that are bad and unproper. If a person's ying energy is low or running on bad conditions/luck, they can hurt you. But most of the time if your spirit/yang energy is high, they will be 70% more afraid of us than we are to them ie 30%. Let alone, for those who recite Buddha's Name/mantras/sutras (or praying to Gods), their yang/light energy is too Bright for them. They will run off. </span><br><br>/\<br></div>

As long as you ignore those superstitious things, and focus on practising the dharma, then its OK. Not every Thai Buddhist temple practise such superstitious. Many Thai masters became liberated Arhats.</div>

Our entire existence, our life, everything is due to karma.<br><br>Just like animal kingdom... there are even more than 36 kinds of animals. This is due to different kinds of ignorant and unwholesome karma being created by their Body, Speech, Mind while they were people like us.<br><br>Unwholesome karma leads to the 3 lower realms: Hell, Ghost, Animal realm. Wholesome karma leads to 3 higher realms: Asura, Human, Deva (celestial being/heaven) realm. All Buddhas teach this: Avoid evil, do good, and PURIFY ONE'S MIND. Most religions emphasize 1) and 2), but did not emphasize 3). Buddhism thinks this is particularly important because our minds need to be purified of defilements and afflictions before we can attain liberation from rebirth in samsara (world of sufferings; the 6 realms).<br><br>an article i posted recently: <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=171090" rel="nofollow">The Pursuit of Happiness, Bliss and understanding Sufferings</a></div>

Btw how do the tattoos look like?<br><br>In Buddhism, we believe that as long as you are a virtuous person, naturally <strong>virtuous spirits</strong> will protect you. In this case there is no need to go and find them or seek their protection...<br><br>Vedas is like the Bible of Hinduism. It means 'divine knowledge'. Vedas of Hinduism itself is not a superstitious teaching... but its teachings later became corrupted and mispractised... Buddha can be seen as a reformist of India's corrupt spirituality, just like Jesus was a reformist (he taught New Testament) of the Judaist faith.</div>
