              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">To call something</span></strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  "> “a fundamental principle of
                  Buddhism” is correct only if, first, it is a principle that aims at the
                  quenching of <em>dukkha</em> (suffering) and, second, it has a logic that one can
                  see for oneself without having to believe others.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">The Buddha refused to deal with those things that don’t lead to the
                  extinction of dukkha. He didn’t discuss them. Take the question of whether or
                  not there is rebirth after death. What is reborn? How is it reborn? What is its
                  “karmic inheritance”? These questions don’t aim at the extinction of dukkha.
                  That being so, they are not the Buddha’s teaching nor are they connected with
                  it. They don’t lie within the range of Buddhism. Also, the one who asks about
                  such matters has no choice but to believe indiscriminately any answer that’s
                  given, because the one who answers won’t be able to produce any proofs and will
                  just be speaking according to his own memory and feeling. The listener can’t
                  see for himself and consequently must blindly believe the other’s words. Little
                  by little the subject strays from dharma until it becomes something else
                  altogether, unconnected with the extinction of dukkha.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">Now, if we don’t raise those sorts of issues, we can ask instead, “Is
                  there dukkha?” and “How can dukkha be extinguished?” The Buddha agreed to
                  answer these questions. The listener can recognize the truth of every word of
                  the answers without having to believe them blindly and can see the truth more
                  and more clearly until he understands for himself.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">There aren’t that many fundamental, or root, principles of dharma. The
                  Buddha said that his teaching is “a single handful.” A
                  passage in the <em>Samyutta-nikaya</em> makes that clear. While walking through
                  the forest, the Buddha picked up a handful of fallen leaves and asked the monks
                  who were present to decide which was the greater amount, the leaves in his hand
                  or all the leaves in the forest. Of course, they all said that there were more
                  leaves in the forest, that the difference was beyond comparison. Try to imagine
                  the truth of this scene; clearly see how huge the difference is. The Buddha
                  then said that, similarly, those things that he had realized were a great
                  amount, equal to all the leaves in the forest. However, that which was
                  necessary to know, those things that should be taught and practiced, were equal
                  to the number of leaves in his hand.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">From this it can be seen that, compared to all the
                  myriad things in the world, the root principles to be practiced for the
                  complete extinction of dukkha amount to a single handful. We must appreciate
                  that this single handful is not a huge amount; it’s not something beyond our
                  capabilities to reach and understand. This is the first important point that we
                  must grasp if we want to lay the foundation for a correct understanding of the
                  Buddha’s teachings.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong style="line-height: 1.231;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">The saying</span></strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.231;"> of the Buddha that deals with the practice regarding <em>shunyata</em> (voidness)
                  is the saying that is the heart of Buddhism. It requires our careful attention.
                  "Nothing whatsoever should be clung to as 'I' or 'mine.'" (<em>Sabbe
                  dhamma nalam abhinivesaya.</em>) The Buddha himself declared that this is the
                  summation of all the Tathagata’s [Buddha’s] teaching. He said that to have
                  heard the phrase “Sabbe dhamma nalam abhinivesaya” is to have heard everything;
                  to have put it into practice is to have practiced everything; and to have
                  reaped its fruits is to have reaped every fruit. So we need not be afraid that
                  there is too much to understand. When the Buddha compared the things that he
                  had realized, which were as many as all the leaves in the forest, with those
                  that he taught his followers to practice, which were a single handful, the
                  single handful he referred to was just this principle of not grasping at or clinging
                  to anything as being self or as belonging to self.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">“To hear
                  this phrase is to hear everything,” because all subjects are contained within
                  it. Of all the things the Buddha taught, there wasn’t one that didn’t deal with
                  dukkha and the elimination of dukkha. Grasping and clinging is the cause of
                  dukkha. When there is grasping and clinging, that is dukkha. When there is no
                  grasping and clinging—that is, being void of grasping and clinging—there is no
                  dukkha. The practice is to make the non-arising of grasping and clinging
                  absolute, final, and eternally void, so that no grasping and clinging can ever
                  return. Just that is enough. There is nothing else to do.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong style="line-height: 1.231;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>“This
                  practice</span></strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.231;"> is every practice.” Can you think of anything that remains to be
                  practiced? In a given moment, if a person—whether Mr. Smith, Mrs. Jones, or
                  anyone at all—has a mind free of grasping and clinging, at that moment, what
                  does the person have? Please think it over. We can see that the person has
                  attained all the traditional practices: the Triple Refuge (<em><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>tisarana</span></em>),
                  giving (<em><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>dana</span></em>),
                  virtuous conduct (<em><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>sila</span></em>), meditation (<em><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>samadhi</span></em>), the discernment of truth (<em><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>panna</span></em>),
                  and even the path-realizations, their fruits, and <em><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>nirvana</span></em>.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">At that moment of non-grasping, one has certainly attained the first
                  practice, that of the Triple Refuge. One has reached the Buddha, the Dhamma,
                  and the Sangha, for to have a heart free of the mental defilements and dukkha
                  is to be one with the heart of the Triple Gem. One has reached them without
                  having to chant <em>“Buddham saranam gacchami”</em> [“I take refuge in the
                  Buddha”]. Crying out “Buddham saranam gacchami” and so on is just a ritual, a
                  ceremony of entrance, an external matter. It doesn’t penetrate to the Buddha,
                  Dhamma, and Sangha in the heart. If at any moment a person has a mind void of
                  grasping at and clinging to “I” and “mine,” even if only for an instant, the
                  mind has realized voidness. It is one and the same as the heart of the Buddha,
                  the Dhamma, and the Sangha.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">The next practice is giving (<em>dana</em>). The meaning of giving is to let
                  go, to end all grasping at and clinging to things as being “I” or “mine.” At
                  the moment that one has a mind void of ego-consciousness, then one has made the
                  supreme offering, for when even the self has been given up, what can there be
                  left to give? Thus, at any moment that a person has a mind truly void of self,
                  when even the self has been completely relinquished, he or she has developed
                  giving to its perfection.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">To move on to virtuous conduct (<em>sila</em>), one whose mind is void and
                  free of grasping at and clinging to a self or possession of self, is one whose
                  bodily and verbal actions are truly and perfectly virtuous. Any other sort of
                  morality is just an up-and-down affair. We may make resolutions to refrain from
                  this and abstain from that, but we can’t keep them. Whenever the mind is void,
                  even if it’s only for a moment, or a day, or a night, one has true <em>sila</em> for all of that time.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">As for concentration (<em>samadhi</em>), the void mind has supreme
                  samadhi, the superbly focused firmness of mind. A strained and uneven sort of
                  concentration isn’t the real thing. Only the mind that is void of grasping at
                  and clinging to “I” and “mine” can have the true and perfect stability of
                  correct concentration. One who has a void mind always has correct samadhi.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">The next practice is <em>panna</em> (intuitive wisdom). Here we can see
                  most clearly that knowing sunnata, realizing voidness—or being voidness
                  itself—is the essence of wisdom. At the moment that the mind is void, it is
                  supremely keen and discerning. When a mind is void of foolishness, void of “I”
                  and “mine,” there is perfect knowing, or panna. So the wise say that sunnata
                  and panna (mindfulness and wisdom) are one. Once the mind is rid of delusion,
                  it discovers its primal state, the true original mind.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">We can go on to the path-realizations, their fruits, and nibbana. Here
                  the progressively higher levels of voidness reach their culmination in nibbana,
                  which is called the supreme voidness (<em>parama-sunnata</em>).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">Now, you may see that from taking refuge and progressing through giving,
                  virtuous conduct, concentration, and wisdom, there is nothing other than
                  sunnata, or non-clinging to self. Even in the path-realizations, their fruits,
                  and nibbana, there’s nothing more than voidness. In fact, they are its highest,
                  most supreme level.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 13.1pt; text-align: justify;">Consequently,
                  the Buddha declared that to have heard this teaching is to have heard all
                  teachings, to have put it into practice is to have done all practices, and to
                  have reaped the fruits of that practice is to have reaped all fruits: Nothing
                  whatsoever should be clung to as “I” or “mine.” (</span><em style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 13.1pt; text-align: justify;">Sabbe dhamma nalam
                  abhinivesaya</em><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 13.1pt; text-align: justify;">.) You must strive to grasp the essence of what this word
                  “voidness” really means.</span></p>
