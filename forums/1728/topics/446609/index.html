              <p>“Dear Bro. Shi’an, ‘The Gift of Truth Excels All Other Gifts.’ Thank 
              you for sharing the Pure Land Teachings with us. You have delivered the 
              teachings in a very concise, interesting and creative manner. We enjoyed
               the lessons very much and have benefitted a lot from them. We are glad 
              to have an excellent Dharma teacher like you in the Buddhist 
              world. Sadhu! Sadhu! Sadhu! Amituofo!” – With appreciation,<strong> Tuck Khuen, Amy, Ivy, Doris &amp; Joey</strong></p>

              [email] write-up… I truly enjoy reading it and understand Buddhism 
              better. Appreciate your constant sharing with us.” – <strong>Eliza</strong></p>
              <p>“Thank you so much for teaching us about Amituofo and Pure land. 
              Truthfully speaking, I was amazed and didn’t expect that there’s so many
               teachings for the above.” <strong>- Silvi</strong></p>
              <p>“8 lessons had attended (so far), I had turn with conviction. Thanks.” <strong>- Andrew<br> </strong><br> “This is rare opportunity hearing a good Dharma session about the Pure 
              Land of Amitabha Buddha. Please accept my deepest bow and true

              during your stay in Jakarta. The seminar really gave me a whole 
              new perspective on Buddhism… I couldn’t have made a better decision than
               registering. A lot of the teachings were affirmative and complementing 
              of what I’ve understood about Buddhism so far.” <strong>- William</strong></p>
              <p>“I had the impression that it would be a ‘dry’ and boring class 
              initially. Thank Buddha you have the ability to make us giggle or laugh 
              during class. It is a ‘good investment’ to sign up for your class.” <strong>- Irene</strong></p>

              appreciation to you for conducting the Amitabha Sutra class. You are 
              able to explain the sutra clearly and have provided excellent examples 
              and illustrations. My husband, Lawrence, and I, together with our 
              friends truly enjoy your class and we have gained a better understanding
               Amitabha Sutra. We also want to thank the volunteers for manning the 
              registration booth every Saturday and the ushers… Once again, thank you 
              for your excellent teaching.  Rejoice. Namo Amituofo!” <strong>- Lay Ling &amp; Lawrence</strong></p>

              <p>“Thanks very much for weeks of enlightening and insightful 
              edutainment. The ‘before/after effect’ (like Marie France) of Pureland 
              teachings is indeed profound. I must say I’ve progressed rapidly in 
              ‘faith, vows and practice’, thanks to your passionate and generous 
              sharing.”<strong> – Han</strong></p>
              <p>“Thank you for the insightful answers! I look forward to Lesson 2 this Saturday.”  – <strong>Amituofo, Yong Guan </strong></p>

               wonderful Dharma especially about the Pureland to more people.”<strong> – Amituofo, Huan Ghee</strong></p>
              <p>“Ha ha ha u are a funny guy. Every time during the class, we look at 
              your action and the way u give us example really make me laugh. Tks and 
              keep up the good job.” <strong>- Sherlis</strong></p>

              <p>“Thank you for an educational and interactive first lesson. Fresh 
              perspective and insight gained. My hubby and I enjoyed it thoroughly. 
              Look forward to the next class. We enjoy every lesson. The path to Pure 
              Land is simple and fuss free. Coming from the past 15 years of Theravada
               Buddhist teachings’ background, this is refreshing and would certainly 
              add depth on our Dharma pursuits. We have never had a structured and 
              systematic education on Buddhism of any branch although all our lives we
               are connected to it from birth. The laoshi (teacher) Shen Shi’an is 
              engaging, witty and knowledgeable. Teacher is very well prepared, 
              eloquent, knowledgeable and systematic. <strong>- Lye Wai Fun</strong></p>
              <p>“I really enjoy the class. Thanks for making the class interesting and engaging.” <strong>- Hazel</strong></p>

              <p>“Thanks for delivering such an interesting presentation that is 
              beneficial for us to have a better fundamental understanding of 
              Buddhism. The organising committee is very committed to make this class a
               success, and tried their best to provide a conducive environment for 
              the participants.” <strong>- Yong Leow</strong></p>
              <p>“[The teacher is] very knowledgeable.” <strong>– Candy</strong></p>
              <p>“Many thanks for your interesting lesson at the Amitabha Sutra class yesterday. I enjoyed it thoroughly.”<strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> – Kok Leong</strong></p>
              <p>“The trainer has done an excellent job in bringing Mahayana teachings
               to English-speaking Buddhists. He is able to dispel the myth that 
              Chinese Buddhism is suitable only to illiterate old men and women. May 
              the trainer be able to help more sentient beings to contact the 
              teachings. May Buddhas and Bodhisattvas support him in his endeavor.” <strong>- Anon3</strong> <strong> </strong></p>
              <p>“It was an enlightening session for the lesson that you have 
              conducted today. Thank you for imparting the knowledge on the ‘crash 
              course’ (on Buddhism for the first lesson). Things I learn in your 
              lesson today: To re-ignite my compassion to all beings, including those 
              that I previously do not like due to heavy office politics. Your passion
               in Buddhism that energised my learnings. It was another informative 
              session yesterday and I can understand the concept well, through your 
              interesting presentation.” <strong>– Jeffrey</strong></p>
              <p>“[The teacher] is lively and can sustain attention.” <strong>- Anon4</strong></p>
              <p>“There are many comparisons to our daily lives to reinforce learning.” <strong>- Anon1</strong></p>
              <p>“This is a great course. I am thankful for this affinity that led me 
              to this course and enable me to start walking the spiritual path.” <strong>- Anon2</strong> <strong> </strong></p>
              <p>“[The teacher] can explain very well!” <strong>- Bee Ting</strong></p>
              <p>“[The teacher is] well researched and well prepared.”<strong>– Jono</strong></p>
              <p>“Instructor allows us to email him questions in doubt which benefits beginners.”<strong>- Anon5</strong></p>
              <p>“Yes, very good and very relevant. You have also made it very interesting.” <strong>– Pearly</strong></p>

              <p>“I enjoyed the first lesson yesterday night as you were an engaging and humourous teacher. Thanks.”<strong>– Yingying</strong></p>
              <p>“Many thanks for the inspiring sharing on 10 July.”<strong>- Hui Ping</strong></p>
              <p>“I find the course informative and delivered in an interesting manner.”<strong>– CH</strong></p>
              <p>“Many thanks, Shi’an! It was a very fruitful learning experience! Amitoufo!” <strong>- Jennifer</strong></p>
              <p><strong> </strong>“Must tell you that we enjoy your class. It is very comprehensive, with easy to understand and lively presentation.”<strong>– Rita</strong></p>
              <p>“Your clarion call on high importance and high urgency of learning 
              the route to Pureland was depicted with a ‘think out of the box’ 
              (manner) effectively. Witty dialogue on the multi-purpose use of 
              Amituofo’s name remains vividly in my mind. Leaves us much to practice. 
              Thank you for being a wonderful teacher by bringing the Dharma to us in a
               simple, interesting and fun way. In all the classes, we had been 
              educated and entertained! It was the very first time that we ever 
              attended a structured course, though we are ‘Buddhists” all our lives. 
              Lessons were joyfully taught by a highly knowledgeable and energetic 
              instructor who engaged your attention and captivated your imagination by
               the power of interesting visuals and sometimes comical parables.” <strong>– Lye Wai Fun</strong></p>
              <p>“Dear Bro Shi’an, I really enjoy your class on Amituofo. Learn many 
              things everytime I go for the class. Today’s testimonial is also really 
              inspiring! Amituofo” <strong>- Tiong Han</strong></p>
              <p>“Brother Shi’an, You are a great teacher; your teachings alone are a 
              tremendous inspiration to those like me who have good karmic affinity to
               listen to you. You sold and I bought the ticket to Pureland on the very
               first lesson in March last year. That’s how inspiring you are! Thank 
              you. é˜¿å¼¥é™€ä½› _()_ ” <strong>– Steven</strong></p>
              <p>“Thanks for the guidance. I have re-evaluated your advice and 
              implemented it. The outcome is encouraging. Thank you for your statement
               that kept me motivated and not giving up. Thanks for making a 
              difference in our lives.” <strong>– Jeffrey</strong></p>
              <p>“Hi Shi’an, I want to thank you for giving me better insights of the 
              sutra, as well as instilling in me more faith. I am very thankful that I
               have the opportunity to attend your class. It is very difficult to find
               good English Buddhist classes and interesting teachers. I hope you can 
              conduct more classes so we English educated ones would not miss the 
              opportunity to understand and appreciate the Buddhist teaching and to 
              reach Pure Land. Your class is super, never one moment boring and time 
              just flies. I wish it never ends. Every moment is motivating, 
              interesting, soft-selling but never forcing, well presented and 
              delivered. Very good visual and presentation material. I believe that 
              only those with faith and passion like you could conduct such classes. 
              Academics would present and speak without conviction, but your easy 
              style and passion makes the class alive, interesting and motivating. 
              Shi’an good job!! Please don’t stop, we need your guidance. Thank you 
              again.” <strong>- Amituofo, Pauline</strong></p>
