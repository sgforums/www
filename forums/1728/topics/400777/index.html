              <p> Was on the section call quantum entanglement. Feel that its kinda link to cause and effect of buddism. When 2 atoms are entangle, even lightyears away, any changes to one atom will have effect on the another.</p>

               of the Lankavatara Sutra sharing by Thusness</a></p>
              <p>Thusness (2007):</p>
              <p><em>...So the teaching is consistent in
                                      terms of philosophy, in terms of meditation 
              practice, and in terms
                                      of the truths that is being preached.<br><br> And also in terms of spiritual powers. When I 
              say something like
                                      Clairvoyance... I can see, not bounded by 
              distance. I can hear, not
                                      bounded by distance. How come? Why? If we were 
              to take other
                                      religions, they canÂ’t explain. But if you were 
              to take Buddhism,
                                      Buddha had never told you, has never taught, 
              something of an Ego,
                                      something of a Where, something of a When. It is
               not bounded by
                                      Time and Space at all in the entire philosophy. 
              Never has he taught
                                      anything like that. And therefore, when we talk 
              about spiritual
                                      powers, it is consistent. It is knowing without 
              the need for a
                                      Space and Time, not bounded by Space and Time, 
              because the entire
                                      teaching is so. And what is being said about 
              this? It is the
                                      Nature. This is your nature. Reality is like 
              that, it is so.
                                      Therefore, when we understand the teachings, we 
              understand that
                                      yes, it is not right to be attached, therefore 
              we cannot say we
                                      want to seek spiritual powers, like Nub. But we 
              have to understand,
                                      this is our Nature, this is our Reality. Because
               the teaching has
                                      never contradicted itself. If you want to know 
              about your reality,
                                      you have to practise. That is the teaching. And 
              the practise has
                                      always been telling you to observe these 3 
              universal
                                      characteristics. So when we see the link between
               the practise, the
                                      philosophy, even something spiritual and 
              something that is not
                                      scientific. This is important.</em></p>
              <p><em>.................</em></p>
              <p><em> When I say that things happen, it is not
                                      like those people that subscribe to think that 
              anything is just
                                      taking by itself, itÂ’s nature. Mainly what is 
              important is
                                      conditions. You must have the conditions, then 
              things can surface.
                                      When the conditions is there, they just 
              surfaces, and manifest. If
                                      there is cause in ten million miles away or ten 
              million light years
                                      away, or whatever it is, or in other realms, as 
              long as there is
                                      conditions, it WILL surface, it is not 
              travelling {inaudible}. Can
                                      you understand this part? Condition is there, 
              they just manifest.
                                      This is one thing.<br><br> The second thing, to break the view of an 
              entity, when we say that,
                                      where? Why must we keep of asking where? Why 
              must we keep on asking
                                      who? Where does the seed of propensity reside? 
              It doesnÂ’t reside
                                      anywhere. DonÂ’t ask where. ItÂ’s just the way it 
              is. Because
                                      whenever you ask where, who, and when, it is 
              because you are very
                                      accustomed to our way of inquiry. The way we 
              enquire. It is an
                                      inquiry system only. It is not reality. It is 
              just the way you ask
                                      things only. It is just the way we are molded, 
              and therefore we ask
                                      things this way. If we ask things this way, then
               the idea of God is
                                      more {inaudible} You see, the idea of God is 
              based on the first
                                      cause, right? What is God? God is the first 
              cause. But why must
                                      there be a first cause? There is a first cause 
              because there is a
                                      limit to the way we think. It is due to the 
              poverty of our own
                                      thinking mechanism. The mind requires a base to 
              start. So it is for
                                      the thinking mind to understand. It is not 
              reality. Only the mind
                                      needs to understand this way. Reality doesnÂ’t 
              behave that way. Can
                                      you see? So we are trying to fit reality into a 
              model of concept.

              <p><br> <strong>The Holographic Universe</strong><br> <br> Michael Talbot<br> <br> In 1982 a remarkable event took place. At the 
              University of Paris a
                                      research team led by physicist Alain Aspect 
              performed what may turn
                                      out to be one of the most important experiments 
              of the 20th
                                      century. You did not hear about it on the 
              evening news. In fact,
                                      unless you are in the habit of reading 
              scientific journals you
                                      probably have never even heard Aspect's name, 
              though there are some
                                      who believe his discovery may change the face of
               science.<br> <br> Aspect and his team discovered that under 
              certain circumstances
                                      subatomic particles such as electrons are able 
              to instantaneously
                                      communicate with each other regardless of the 
              distance separating
                                      them. It doesn't matter whether they are 10 feet
               or 10 billion
                                      miles apart.<br> <br> Somehow each particle always seems to know what 
              the other is doing.
                                      The problem with this feat is that it violates 
              Einstein's long-held
                                      tenet that no communication can travel faster 
              than the speed of
                                      light. Since traveling faster than the speed of 
              light is tantamount
                                      to breaking the time barrier, this daunting 
              prospect has caused
                                      some physicists to try to come up with elaborate
               ways to explain
                                      away Aspect's findings. But it has inspired 
              others to offer even
                                      more radical explanations.<br> <br> University of London physicist David Bohm, for 
              example, believes
                                      Aspect's findings imply that objective reality 
              does not exist, that
                                      despite its apparent solidity the universe is at
               heart a phantasm,
                                      a gigantic and splendidly detailed hologram.<br> <br> To understand why Bohm makes this startling 
              assertion, one must
                                      first understand a little about holograms. A 
              hologram is a three-
                                      dimensional photograph made with the aid of a 
              laser.<br> <br> To make a hologram, the object to be 
              photographed is first bathed
                                      in the light of a laser beam. Then a second 
              laser beam is bounced
                                      off the reflected light of the first and the 
              resulting interference
                                      pattern (the area where the two laser beams 
              commingle) is captured
                                      on film.<br> <br> When the film is developed, it looks like a 
              meaningless swirl of
                                      light and dark lines. But as soon as the 
              developed film is
                                      illuminated by another laser beam, a 
              three-dimensional image of the
                                      original object appears.<br> <br> The three-dimensionality of such images is not 
              the only remarkable
                                      characteristic of holograms. If a hologram of a 
              rose is cut in half
                                      and then illuminated by a laser, each half will 
              still be found to
                                      contain the entire image of the rose.<br> <br> Indeed, even if the halves are divided again, 
              each snippet of film
                                      will always be found to contain a smaller but 
              intact version of the
                                      original image. Unlike normal photographs, every
               part of a hologram
                                      contains all the information possessed by the 
              whole.<br> <br> The "whole in every part" nature of a hologram 
              provides us with an
                                      entirely new way of understanding organization 
              and order. For most
                                      of its history, Western science has labored 
              under the bias that the
                                      best way to understand a physical phenomenon, 
              whether a frog or an
                                      atom, is to dissect it and study its respective 
              parts.<br> <br> A hologram teaches us that some things in the 
              universe may not lend
                                      themselves to this approach. If we try to take 
              apart something
                                      constructed holographically, we will not get the
               pieces of which it
                                      is made, we will only get smaller wholes.<br> <br> This insight suggested to Bohm another way of 
              understanding
                                      Aspect's discovery. Bohm believes the reason 
              subatomic particles
                                      are able to remain in contact with one another 
              regardless of the
                                      distance separating them is not because they are
               sending some sort
                                      of mysterious signal back and forth, but because
               their separateness
                                      is an illusion. He argues that at some deeper 
              level of reality such
                                      particles are not individual entities, but are 
              actually extensions
                                      of the same fundamental something.<br> <br> To enable people to better visualize what he 
              means, Bohm offers the
                                      following illustration.<br> <br> Imagine an aquarium containing a fish. Imagine 
              also that you are
                                      unable to see the aquarium directly and your 
              knowledge about it and
                                      what it contains comes from two television 
              cameras, one directed at
                                      the aquarium's front and the other directed at 
              its side.<br> <br> As you stare at the two television monitors, you
               might assume that
                                      the fish on each of the screens are separate 
              entities. After all,
                                      because the cameras are set at different angles,
               each of the images
                                      will be slightly different. But as you continue 
              to watch the two
                                      fish, you will eventually become aware that 
              there is a certain
                                      relationship between them.<br> <br> When one turns, the other also makes a slightly 
              different but
                                      corresponding turn; when one faces the front, 
              the other always
                                      faces toward the side. If you remain unaware of 
              the full scope of
                                      the situation, you might even conclude that the 
              fish must be
                                      instantaneously communicating with one another, 
              but this is clearly
                                      not the case.<br> <br> This, says Bohm, is precisely what is going on 
              between the
                                      subatomic particles in Aspect's experiment.<br> <br> According to Bohm, the apparent 
              faster-than-light connection
                                      between subatomic particles is really telling us
               that there is a
                                      deeper level of reality we are not privy to, a 
              more complex
                                      dimension beyond our own that is analogous to 
              the aquarium. And, he
                                      adds, we view objects such as subatomic 
              particles as separate from
                                      one another because we are seeing only a portion
               of their
                                      reality.<br> <br> Such particles are not separate "parts", but 
              facets of a deeper and
                                      more underlying unity that is ultimately as 
              holographic and
                                      indivisible as the previously mentioned rose. 
              And since everything
                                      in physical reality is comprised of these 
              "eidolons", the universe
                                      is itself a projection, a hologram.<br> <br> In addition to its phantomlike nature, such a 
              universe would
                                      possess other rather startling features. If the 
              apparent
                                      separateness of subatomic particles is illusory,
               it means that at a
                                      deeper level of reality all things in the 
              universe are infinitely
                                      interconnected.<br> <br> The electrons in a carbon atom in the human 
              brain are connected to
                                      the subatomic particles that comprise every 
              salmon that swims,
                                      every heart that beats, and every star that 
              shimmers in the
                                      sky.<br> <br> Everything interpenetrates everything, and 
              although human nature
                                      may seek to categorize and pigeonhole and 
              subdivide, the various
                                      phenomena of the universe, all apportionments 
              are of necessity
                                      artificial and all of nature is ultimately a 
              seamless web.<br> <br> In a holographic universe, even time and space 
              could no longer be
                                      viewed as fundamentals. Because concepts such as
               location break
                                      down in a universe in which nothing is truly 
              separate from anything
                                      else, time and three-dimensional space, like the
               images of the fish
                                      on the TV monitors, would also have to be viewed
               as projections of
                                      this deeper order.<br> <br> At its deeper level reality is a sort of 
              superhologram in which the
                                      past, present, and future all exist 
              simultaneously. This suggests
                                      that given the proper tools it might even be 
              possible to someday
                                      reach into the superholographic level of reality
               and pluck out
                                      scenes from the long-forgotten past.<br> <br> What else the superhologram contains is an 
              open-ended question.
                                      Allowing, for the sake of argument, that the 
              superhologram is the
                                      matrix that has given birth to everything in our
               universe, at the
                                      very least it contains every subatomic particle 
              that has been or
                                      will be -- every configuration of matter and 
              energy that is
                                      possible, from snowflakes to quasars, from bluü 
              whales to gamma
                                      rays. It must be seen as a sort of cosmic 
              storehouse of "All That
                                      Is."</p>
              <p>Although Bohm concedes that we have no way of knowing what else
                                      might lie hidden in the superhologram, he does 
              venture to say that
                                      we have no reason to assume it does not contain 
              more. Or as he puts
                                      it, perhaps the superholographic level of 
              reality is a "mere stage"
                                      beyond which lies "an infinity of further 
              development".<br> <br> Bohm is not the only researcher who has found 
              evidence that the
                                      universe is a hologram. Working independently in
               the field of brain
                                      research, Standford neurophysiologist Karl 
              Pribram has also become
                                      persuaded of the holographic nature of reality.<br> <br> Pribram was drawn to the holographic model by 
              the puzzle of how and
                                      where memories are stored in the brain. For 
              decades numerous
                                      studies have shown that rather than being 
              confined to a specific
                                      location, memories are dispersed throughout the 
              brain.<br> <br> In a series of landmark experiments in the 
              1920s, brain scientist
                                      Karl Lashley found that no matter what portion 
              of a rat's brain he
                                      removed he was unable to eradicate its memory of
               how to perform
                                      complex tasks it had learned prior to surgery. 
              The only problem was
                                      that no one was able to come up with a mechanism
               that might explain
                                      this curious "whole in every part" nature of 
              memory storage.<br> <br> Then in the 1960s Pribram encountered the 
              concept of holography and
                                      realized he had found the explanation brain 
              scientists had been
                                      looking for. Pribram believes memories are 
              encoded not in neurons,
                                      or small groupings of neurons, but in patterns 
              of nerve impulses
                                      that crisscross the entire brain in the same way
               that patterns of
                                      laser light interference crisscross the entire 
              area of a piece of
                                      film containing a holographic image. In other 
              words, Pribram
                                      believes the brain is itself a hologram.<br> <br> Pribram's theory also explains how the human 
              brain can store so
                                      many memories in so little space. It has been 
              estimated that the
                                      human brain has the capacity to memorize 
              something on the order of
                                      10 billion bits of information during the 
              average human lifetime
                                      (or roughly the same amount of information 
              contained in five sets
                                      of the Encyclopaedia Britannica).<br> <br> Similarly, it has been discovered that in 
              addition to their other
                                      capabilities, holograms possess an astounding 
              capacity for
                                      information storage--simply by changing the 
              angle at which the two
                                      lasers strike a piece of photographic film, it 
              is possible to
                                      record many different images on the same 
              surface. It has been
                                      demonstrated that one cubic centimeter of film 
              can hold as many as
                                      10 billion bits of information.<br> <br> Our uncanny ability to quickly retrieve whatever
               information we
                                      need from the enormous store of our memories 
              becomes more
                                      understandable if the brain functions according 
              to holographic
                                      principles. If a friend asks you to tell him 
              what comes to mind
                                      when he says the word "zebra", you do not have 
              to clumsily sort
                                      back through ome gigantic and cerebral 
              alphabetic file to arrive at
                                      an answer. Instead, associations like "striped",
               "horselike", and
                                      "animal native to Africa" all pop into your head
               instantly.<br> <br> Indeed, one of the most amazing things about the
               human thinking
                                      process is that every piece of information seems
               instantly cross-
                                      correlated with every other piece of 
              information--another feature
                                      intrinsic to the hologram. Because every portion
               of a hologram is
                                      infinitely interconnected with ever other 
              portion, it is perhaps
                                      nature's supreme example of a cross-correlated 
              system.<br> <br> The storage of memory is not the only 
              neurophysiological puzzle
                                      that becomes more tractable in light of 
              Pribram's holographic model
                                      of the brain. Another is how the brain is able 
              to translate the
                                      avalanche of frequencies it receives via the 
              senses (light
                                      frequencies, sound frequencies, and so on) into 
              the concrete world
                                      of our perceptions. Encoding and decoding 
              frequencies is precisely
                                      what a hologram does best. Just as a hologram 
              functions as a sort
                                      of lens, a translating device able to convert an
               apparently
                                      meaningless blur of frequencies into a coherent 
              image, Pribram
                                      believes the brain also comprises a lens and 
              uses holographic
                                      principles to mathematically convert the 
              frequencies it receives
                                      through he senses into the inner world of our 
              perceptions.<br> <br> An impressive body of evidence suggests that the
               brain uses
                                      holographic principles to perform its 
              operations. Pribram's theory,
                                      in fact, has gained increasing support among
                                      neurophysiologists.<br> <br> Argentinian-Italian researcher Hugo Zucarelli 
              recently extended the
                                      holographic model into the world of acoustic 
              phenomena. Puzzled by
                                      the fact that humans can locate the source of 
              sounds without moving
                                      their heads, even if they only possess hearing 
              in one ear,
                                      Zucarelli discovered that holographic principles
               can explain this
                                      ability.<br> <br> Zucarelli has also developed the technology of 
              holophonic sound, a
                                      recording technique able to reproduce acoustic 
              situations with an
                                      almost uncanny realism.<br> <br> Pribram's belief that our brains mathematically 
              construct "hard"
                                      reality by relying on input from a frequency 
              domain has also
                                      received a good deal of experimental support.<br> <br> It has been found that each of our senses is 
              sensitive to a much
                                      broader range of frequencies than was previously
               suspected.<br> <br> Researchers have discovered, for instance, that 
              our visual systems
                                      are sensitive to sound frequencies, that our 
              sense of smell is in
                                      part dependent on what are now called "osmic 
              frequencies", and that
                                      even the cells in our bodies are sensitive to a 
              broad range of
                                      frequencies. Such findings suggest that it is 
              only in the
                                      holographic domain of consciousness that such 
              frequencies are
                                      sorted out and divided up into conventional 
              perceptions.<br> <br> But the most mind-boggling aspect of Pribram's 
              holographic model of
                                      the brain is what happens when it is put 
              together with Bohm's
                                      theory. For if the concreteness of the world is 
              but a secondary
                                      reality and what is "there" is actually a 
              holographic blur of
                                      frequencies, and if the brain is also a hologram
               and only selects
                                      some of the frequencies out of this blur and 
              mathematically
                                      transforms them into sensory perceptions, what 
              becomes of objective
                                      reality?<br> <br> Put quite simply, it ceases to exist. As the 
              religions of the East
                                      have long upheld, the material world is Maya, an
               illusion, and
                                      although we may think we are physical beings 
              moving through a
                                      physical world, this too is an illusion.<br> <br> We are really "receivers" floating through a 
              kaleidoscopic sea of
                                      frequency, and what we extract from this sea and
               transmogrify into
                                      physical reality is but one channel from many 
              extracted out of the
                                      superhologram.<br> <br> This striking new picture of reality, the 
              synthesis of Bohm and
                                      Pribram's views, has come to be called the 
              holographic paradigm,
                                      and although many scientists have greeted it 
              with skepticism, it
                                      has galvanized others. A small but growing group
               of researchers
                                      believe it may be the most accurate model of 
              reality science has
                                      arrived at thus far. More than that, some 
              believe it may solve some
                                      mysteries that have never before been 
              explainable by science and
                                      even establish the paranormal as a part of 
              nature.<br> <br> Numerous researchers, including Bohm and 
              Pribram, have noted that
                                      many para-psychological phenomena become much 
              more understandable
                                      in terms of the holographic paradigm.<br> <br> In a universe in which individual brains are 
              actually indivisible
                                      portions of the greater hologram and everything 
              is infinitely
                                      interconnected, telepathy may merely be the 
              accessing of the
                                      holographic level.<br> <br> It is obviously much easier to understand how 
              information can
                                      travel from the mind of individual 'A' to that 
              of individual 'B' at
                                      a far distance point and helps to understand a 
              number of unsolved
                                      puzzles in psychology. In particular, Grof feels
               the holographic
                                      paradigm offers a model for understanding many 
              of the baffling
                                      phenomena experienced by individuals during 
              altered states of
                                      consciousness.</p>

If you separate its constituent parts, it’s already no longer a table. You will have the legs, the table top, and so on. If you then reduce them all to sawdust, these constituent parts in turn lose their identity. If you now examine one grain of the sawdust, you find molecules, and then atoms. (Curiously the Greek word atom or ‘atomos’ means ‘uncuttable’.)</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Buddhism uses the same word, in general, and speaks of particles that ‘have no parts’, which cannot be subdivided. These are therefore supposed to be the ultimate constituents of matter. Now take one of these particles, considered as an autonomous entity. How could it combine with other particles to constitute matter? If these particles were to touch each other, the left-hand side of one particle, for example, would touch the right-hand side of another. But if they have left and right-hand sides, they can be divided, and thus lose their characteristic of being ‘indivisible’. If they have neither sides nor directions, they must by like points in mathematics, without dimension, thickness, or substance. If you tried to put together two dimensionless particles, either they wouldn’t touch and cannot therefore be put together, or they do make contact with one another, in which case they merge with one another. A whole mountain of indivisible particles could then dissolve into a single one of them.</span></span></p>

Even more, if an atom had mass, a dimension, and a charge would it be identical to the whole set of its attributes? Would it exist outside its attributes? An atom is not identical to its mass, nor to its size. But nor is it other than its mass and its size. So an atom has a set of characteristics, but is none of them.</span></span></p>
