              <div style="text-align: left;" dir="ltr">Writing this article has been on my to-do list for a few months but I 
              couldn't do it due to exams and workload. Now I'm having a short holiday
               so I think I should quickly get this typed out.<br><br>There is a kind 
              of pathology or danger in various kinds of insights because they are 
              partial and one may not have yet seen the complete picture. As you may 
              have seen in my recent discussions, the pathology or danger in 
              non-doership is that one will fall into a kind of extreme deterministic 
              thinking - that somehow because there is no doer, nothing can/should be 
              done about things. This leads to a very passive attitude to things, or 
              rather, one is restricted to experiencing no-self in a passive way (of 
              merely letting experience happen in non-doership), one which prevents 
              the experience of non-dual in action/activities via complete non-dual 
              engagement, involvement, incorporating intentions, and later going into 
              total exertion. (Also non-doership does not imply one has arisen 
              non-dual insight)<br><br>Furthermore, someone who had some insight into 
              the non-division of subject and object can fall into the extremes of 
              subsuming (either object into subject like certain forms of traditional 
              and neo Vedanta, or subsuming subject into object like Actualism), and 
              via subsuming all phenomena into pure subjectivity, end up with an 
              extreme notion of solipsism (the view that there is no others, only me).<br><br>Then there is the often mentioned-by-me (and Thusness) "disease of non-conceptuality".<br><br>As I pasted some days back an excerpt from Thusness from one year ago on the disease of non-doership:<br><br>"John
               Tan: Nihilistic tendencies arise when the insight of anatta is skewed 
              towards the no-doership aspect. The happening by itself must be 
              correctly understood. It appears that things are accomplished by doing 
              nothing but in actual case it is things get done due to ripening of 
              action and conditions.<br><br>So the lack of self-nature does not imply 
              nothing needs be done or nothing can be done. That is one extreme. At 
              the other end of extreme is the self-nature of perfect control of what 
              one wills, one gets. Both are seen to be false. Action + conditions 
              leads to effect.<br><br>June 1 at 11:32am · Unlike · 8"<br><br>And I just wrote:<br><br>"What
               you said is not completely wrong but can be misleading unless you 
              understand 'nature' as 'dependent origination' (replying to a post about
               anger, killing, suffering being the expression of nature instead of a 
              self). Which is to say, it is not fate, or some sort of outside 
              determinism, nor is it spontaneous arising without causes, but simply 
              dependencies playing out here.<br><br>For example, torturing people is 
              the result of ignorance, aggression, etc etc. There are various causes 
              and conditions as listed in the twelve links of dependent arising. And 
              it is not something that is fixed. By engaging in dharma practice we 
              deal with the afflictions and liberate them. Four noble truths are like 
              what doctor does - diagnosis, cause, relief, cure. Four noble truths are
               completely in alignment with "no self, dependent origination". It would
               be erroneous if a doctor realizes there is no self, therefore, thinks 
              that all diseases are 'just as it is' and should not or cannot be dealt 
              with. They should be dealt with. But they are dealt with not via the 
              attempting to exert control or hard will via by the false notion of 
              agency (sickness can't be cured merely by trying to will or control it 
              out of existence - there are so many dependencies involved). They are 
              dealt with via seeing its dependent origination and treating its 
              dependent origination in a non-inherent way.<br><br>Now in the case of 
              'torturing', if someone practices metta, it can help (or if you prefer, 
              leave out the 'someone' -- 'practicing metta can help'). Then when 
              fundamental delusion is cleared, aggression can no longer arise. There 
              is nobody controlling anger, anger arise whether one wants to or not -- 
              yet it can be treated by applying the right antidote (e.g. metta) or 
              actualizing wisdom so that it releases (e.g. anatta, twofold emptiness),
               just like diseases happen whether one wants to or not -- yet there is 
              medicine, cure. There is suffering, the cause of suffering, the end of 
              suffering, and the path that ends suffering."<br><br>Thusness then added on:<br><br>"“There is nobody controlling anger, anger arise whether one wants to or not”<br><br>Maybe sees it this way:<br><br>There is no one controlling anger, anger arises due to dependent origination.<br><br>With
               ignorance comes attachment. When attachment meets its secondary 
              conditions, anger arises. Without secondary conditions, anger does not 
              arise. Although it does not arise, it will not cease to arise unless the
               primary cause is severed. Here the appearance of “spontaneous arising” 
              is seen from the perspective of DO.<br><br>Seeing this way, there is 
              anatta; there is dependent origination; there is mindfulness of the 
              cause of anger, the conditions, the cure and the ending of it. There is 
              no bypassing as in “nothing needs be done”, albeit no-self."<br><br>...<br><br>Now.. there is another pathology which actually is the main one I wanted to address in this post.<br><br>On
               solipsism, as pointed out by Thusness before based on his own 
              experience (that is, he too faced this tendency of solipsism after an 
              initial breakthrough to nondual over a decade ago), the danger of 
              someone going into nondual or even emptiness without the taste of total 
              interpenetration is that one can easily fall into the extremes of 
              solipsism. If we are directly experiencing our reality like in 
              Vipassana, what we see are endless dependencies - seamless and 
              intricate, in such a case there is no danger of falling into the view of
               solipsism.<br><br>As I wrote in my article Dharma Body last year: 
              "...(Note: Dharma as simply a unit of experience dependently originating
               - not implying any inherently existing material universe [as the 
              universe/dharma body here is seen as marvelous activities/phenomena 
              dependently originating seamlessly without center or boundaries], nor is
               this dharma body in any sense a subjective body at all [if it is 
              subjectively self-existent then causes and conditions will not be 
              incorporated nor necessary for any given manifestation])..." - 
              http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.sg/2013/09/dharma-body.html<br><br>Also,
               as Piotr shared last month, "...what Soh told me in the past, if we 
              apply Buddha's deconstruction from sound example from sutra, then 
              clarity I call visual form right now of this laptop, letters is no more 
              "mine" than any of secondary conditions right now, and Buddha's teaching
               about not-mine and other teachings sealed possibility of solipsism 
              permanently for me. Somehow [solipsism] for me its non-issue lol "<br><br>He's referring to what I told him many months ago:<br><br>"Thusness wrote "you see, when we say there is no self or other, we can still not see in terms of DO."<br><br>I
               commented: this is very important.. and lately I'm seeing it more as 
              well. To overcome all sense of I, me, and even mine, D.O. has to step 
              in. Many people talk about no I, no background, but still there is sense
               of mine... and there are also those that say everything is 'the 
              manifestation of my mind or my nature'.. that is subtly subsuming 
              everything to mind. Even if there is no duality.<br><br>In dependent 
              origination you totally see the entire formation of interdependencies...
               not in words but directly taste the totality of its workings forming 
              every moment of experience. When the drum beat sounds you don't see it 
              as just 'the manifestation of my mind' but you see it as the person 
              hitting, the drum, the vibration, the ears etc... all in total 
              exertion... how can that have anything to do with I or mine? It is not 
              'mine' anymore than it is the person hitting, the drum's, the 
              vibration's... etc. It is not only that there is no hearer behind 
              sound... not only no I but no mine at all.. the sound itself does not 
              belong to anyone... it is the entire universe in total exertion so to 
              speak.. but it is not understood in logic. You have to see the whole 
              process and interdependencies directly. Breathing is like this... 
              walking is like this... every action every experience is like this. This
               is the path to dissolve I, me, mine... only through D.O. is the release
               thorough.<br><br>Not 'everything is just consciousness' or 'everything 
              is my consciousness'... consciousness isn't that special or important. 
              It does not have a special, independent, ontological status. Rather it 
              is the interdependencies the workings of D.O. through which that moment 
              of consciousness/experience is in total exertion. The true turning point
               is when mind is completely separated from mine.. I, me, mine.. the 
              dualistic and inherent tendency must be dissolved and replaced with the 
              wisdom of D.O."<br><br>Some conversations with Thusness back in 2012 are quite illuminating on this subject:<br><br>10/22/2012 9:09 AM: John: To me is just is "AEN" an eternal being...that's all.

               there is another disease after one has some non-conceptual direct 
              realization -- be it I AMness or some sort of non-dual insight, one has a
               direct taste of pristine, unsullied Awareness or Presence. One's 
              practice then becomes based on that direct taste, that taste is only 
              present when one is bare, naked and non-conceptual.<br><br>Furthermore, 
              one may find that 'thoughts' is a source of much misery and confusion, 
              and think that the goal of practice is therefore to completely strip off
               all thoughts. These practitioners could not find a resolution to these 
              confusion and so they resorted to practice of non-conceptuality and 
              naked awareness (however if they did realize anatta and emptiness, these
               confusions will dissolve but not via grasping to a state of 
              non-conceptuality). Actually, suffering and confused thoughts are the 
              result of a more fundamental underlying cause -- delusion, view of 
              inherency, and so it is more important to resolve those fundamental 
              underlying causes that causes grasping.<br><br>As I often quoted from Thusness in this article on the disease of non-conceptuality:<br>http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.sg/2011/08/disease-of-non-conceptuality.html<br><br>Excerpt: "In case 1 practitioners see ‘The seen is neither subjective nor objective.... it just IS....’<br>In
               terms of experience, practitioners will feel Universe, Life. However 
              this is not anatta but rather the result of stripping off 
              (deconstructing) identity and personality.<br><br>When this mode of 
              non-conceptual perception is taken to be ultimate, the terms “What is”, 
              “Isness”, “Thusness” are often taken to mean simply resting in 
              non-conceptuality and not adding to or subtracting anything from the 
              ‘raw manifestation’. There is a side effect to such an experience. 
              Although in non-conceptuality, non-dual is most vivid and clear, 
              practitioners may wrongly conclude that ‘concepts’ are the problem 
              because the presence of ‘concepts’ divides and prevent the non-dual 
              experience. This seems logical and reasonable only to a mind that is 
              deeply root in a subject/object dichotomy. Very quickly 
              ‘non-conceptuality’ becomes an object of practice. The process of 
              objectification is the result of the tendency in action perpetually 
              repeating itself taking different forms like an endless loop. This can 
              continue to the extent that a practitioner can even ‘fear’ to establish 
              concepts without knowing it. They are immobilized by trying to prevent 
              the formation of views and concepts. When we see ‘suffering just IS’, we
               must be very careful not to fall into the ‘disease’ of 
              non-conceptuality."<br><br>What these practitioners fail to understand 
              that the key to release does not lie in trying to sustain a state of 
              non-conceptuality or naked awareness, but in releasing the various bonds
               of consciousness that reifies self and phenomena. Very soon, 
              non-conceptuality itself becomes one's new bondage and attachment. 
              Non-conceptual experience isn't itself a problem, but attachment to it 
              or treating as a be-all end-all of practice is problematic.<br><br>In 
              fact, non-conceptual experience should be complemented with right view, 
              and at the beginning even a conceptual understanding of right view can 
              be very helpful, as it serves as a condition for direct realization of 
              emptiness. As Thusness also wrote, "...The journey of emptying also 
              convinces me the importance of having the right view of Emptiness even 
              though it is only an intellectual grasped initially. Non-conceptuality 
              has its associated diseases…lol…therefore I always advocate not falling 
              to conceptuality and yet not ignoring conceptuality. That is, strict 
              non-conceptuality is not necessary, only that habitual pattern of 
              reification needs be severed..." - <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.sg/2014/07/a-and-emptiness.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.sg/2014/07/a-and-emptiness.html</a><br><br>Only
               after deepening of insights do we realize, it is the realization and 
              actualization of twofold emptiness that is the definitive path of 
              self-release/liberation. This is discussed more indepth in my previous
