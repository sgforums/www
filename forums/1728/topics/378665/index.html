                  <div>Alerted by the émigré Hungarian scientist Leo Szilard to the possibility 
                      that the Germans might build an atom bomb, he wrote F.D.R. of the danger, even 
                      though he knew little about recent developments in nuclear physics. When Szilard 
                      told Einstein about chain reactions, he was astonished: "I never thought about 
                      that at all," he said. Later, when he learned of the destruction of Hiroshima 
                      and Nagasaki, he uttered a pained sigh.</div>

                      tremendous burst of light followed shortly thereafter by the deep growling roar

                  <p>Von Neumann oversaw computations related to the expected size of the bomb 
                      blasts, estimated death tolls, and the distance above the ground at which the 
                      bombs should be detonated for optimum shock wave propagation and thus maximum 
                      effect. The cultural capital <a title="blocked::/wiki/Kyoto

              <p>Nice sharing. Thanks. The effects of karma is really very real. Sometimes the scenes of hell will appear in their dreams first. A person once asked my master how come after slandering the Buddha in the past he had dreams of having a very long tongue pulled by a buffolo.</p>
              <p>My master replied that is exactly the kind of hell retribution that he would have to experience due to slandering as described in the sutras. He should chant Buddha/bodhisattva's name seriously to help with his karma.</p>

              <p>I am not sure if the Nazis at that time, will develop nuclear weapons. even if they do, it will not be more than the 2 atom bombs dropped in Japan. The US can always develop more atom bombs and then dropped in germany, with more millions perished.</p>

              <p>Ancient City Found In India Irradiated<br><br>By Nuclear Blast 8,000 Years Ago<br><br>This file from Bryant Stavely was excerpted from the World Island Review, January 1992.<br><br>Radiation still so intense, the area is highly dangerous. A heavy layer of radioactive ash in Rajasthan, India, covers a three-square mile area, ten miles west of Jodhpur. Scientists are investigating the site, where a housing development was being built.<br><br>For some time it has been established that there is a very high rate of birth defects and cancer in the area under construction. The levels of radiation there have registered so high on investigators' gauges that the Indian government has now cordoned off the region. Scientists have unearthed an ancient city where evidence shows an atomic blast dating back thousands of years, from 8,000 to 12,000 years, destroyed most of the buildings and probably a half-million people. One researcher estimates that the nuclear bomb used was about the size of the ones dropped on Japan in 1945.<br><br>The Mahabharata clearly describes a catastrophic blast that rocked the continent. "A single projectile charged with all the power in the Universe...An incandescent column of smoke and flame as bright as 10,000 suns, rose in all its splendor...it was an unknown weapon, an iron thunderbolt, a gigantic messenger of death which reduced to ashes an entire race.<br><br>"The corpses were so burned as to be unrecognizable. Their hair and nails fell out, pottery broke without any apparent cause, and the birds turned white. After a few hours, all foodstuffs were infected. To escape from this fire, the soldiers threw themselves into the river."<br><br>Historian Kisari Mohan Ganguli says that Indian sacred writings are full of such descriptions, which sound like an atomic blast as experienced in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He says references mention fighting sky chariots and final weapons. An ancient battle is described in the Drona Parva, a section of the Mahabharata. "The passage tells of combat where explosions of final weapons decimate entire armies, causing crowds of warriors with steeds and elephants and weapons to be carried away as if they were dry leaves of trees," says Ganguli.<br><br>"Instead of mushroom clouds, the writer describes a perpendicular explosion with its billowing smoke clouds as consecutive openings of giant parasols. There are comments about the contamination of food and people's hair falling out."<br><br>Archeologist Francis Taylor says that etchings in some nearby temples he has managed to translate suggest that they prayed to be spared from the great light that was coming to lay ruin to the city. "It's so mid-boggling to imagine that some civilization had nuclear technology before we did. The radioactive ash adds credibility to the ancient Indian records that describe atomic warfare."<br><br>Construction has halted while the five member team conducts the investigation. The foreman of the project is Lee Hundley, who pioneered the investigation after the high level of radiation was discovered. </p>

The town belonged to one of the most developed civilizations in the world. The ancient civilization existed for two or three thousand years. However, scientists were a lot more interested in the death of the town, rather than in its prosperity.<br><br>Researchers tried to explain the reason of the town's destruction with various theories. However, scientists did not find any indications of a monstrous flood, skeletons were not numerous, there were no fragments of weapons, or anything else that could testify either to a natural disaster or a war. Archaeologists were perplexed: according to their analysis the catastrophe in the town had occurred very unexpectedly and it did hot last long.<br><br>Scientists Davneport and Vincenti put forward an amazing theory. They stated the ancient town had been ruined with a nuclear blast. They found big stratums of clay and green glass. Apparently, archaeologists supposed, high temperature melted clay and sand and they hardened immediately afterwards. Similar stratums of green glass can also found in Nevada deserts after every nuclear explosion.<br><br>A hundred years have passed since the excavations in Mohenjo-Daro. The modern analysis showed, the fragments of the ancient town had been melted with extremely high temperature - not less than 1,500 degrees centigrade. Researchers also found the strictly outlined epicenter, where all houses were leveled. Destructions lessened towards the outskirts. Dozens of skeletons were found in the area of Mohenjo-Daro - their radioactivity exceeded the norm almost 50 times.<br><br>The great ancient Indian epic, the Mahabharata, contains numerous legends about the powerful force of a mysterious weapon. One of the chapters tells of a shell, which sparkled like fire, but had no smoke. "When the shell hit the ground, the darkness covered the sky, twisters and storms leveled the towns. A horrible blast burnt thousands of animals and people to ashes. Peasants, townspeople and warriors dived in the river to wash away the poisonous dust."<br></p>

              <p>Incidently, <span style="font-style: italic;">Oppenheimer</span>, the
                  inventor of the atom bomb, on being interviewed by the media, gave a
                  surprising reply referring to the atom bomb which he had just invented,
                  as- " <span style="font-style: italic;">not the first nuclear weapon, but the first one of modern times".</span></p>
              <p>.............</p>
              <p>A chilling and historically significant passage. Verse 32 was
                  remembered by Robert Oppenheimer, who was in charge of the Manhattan
                  Project (which built the first atomic bombs), when he saw the very
                  first bomb explode at <a href="http://www.friesian.com/ross/trinity.htm">Trinity Site</a> in New Mexico (nearer Socorro than Alamogordo, where the wire service
                  story was filed), on July 16, 1945. Oppenheimer was familiar with a
                  different translation: "Now I am become Death, the destroyer of
                  worlds." This seems more to the point, for the Atomic Bomb, than "I am
                  all-powerful Time which destroys all things." The word <em>kâla</em> can mean "Time, fate; death, god of death," so both translations express part of the meaning.</p>

              <p>at that time, the US could only develop 2 atom bombs, you think germany can develop how many? more than the US 2 atom boms, I dun think so. if the war is prolonged, the US can still develop a few more, but germany was already reeling from the war. its a matter of time before they surrender. even in germany, there are also people in the army against the regime of hitler.</p>

              <p>Yeah. For Germany the circumstances were against them... but U.S. couldn't take any chances. If the Germans did manage to suddenly build an atomic weapon, the tide of war will turn. In any case even if Germans failed to develope it, the Soviets will, and in the end they have to develope it.</p>
              <p>It takes many years of international cooperation for disarmament.</p>

              <p>Yes there were carbons, fossils, and evidences that prove that those ancient materials were irradiated (very high trace of radioactivity) and melted under extreme high temperature (above 1500 degrees) only possible due to nuclear blast as the article stated.</p>

              <p>Einstein had never thought about nuclear weapon and the theory behind it. When his friend Szilard told him about it, he was shocked and said he never thought it was possible. However, his friend managed to convince him to sign a letter to the US president to start a project to address the threat of Nazi's atomic bomb project. Einstein was never involved in anyway in the Manhattan project and many scientists in the project also has no idea that they were creating a bomb initially.</p>
              <p>In fact after the war, Szilard was in such a remorse that he changed his career from physics to biology.</p>
