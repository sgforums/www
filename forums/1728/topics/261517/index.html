            <div class='col-md body'>Have to mention... Longchen is the professional dream interpreter in this forum <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> (i'm serious)<br><br>About dream interpretation, IMHO it have its values, but it's better <strong>not</strong> to talk about dream interpretation in Buddhism in general. As a general guideline I would not encourage people to do dream interpretations unless they have clear guidance from an enlightened master who clearly knows how dream interpretation is going to be used in a way that does not confuse the practitioner further but benefits him on his spiritual path. If there are certain Vajrayana sects teaching dream interpretation as part of their practices, or it is part of certain tantras, then it is best kept within the Vajrayana sects and traditions, as these practices usually require instructions and teachings or initiations from the rinpoches/teachers, we can't just anyhow do it... and those dreams are interpreted for very specific purposes, I believe, they are not just meant for mundane purposes.<br><br>Also as path_seeker pointed if you are not skilled in this, then you may interprete things wrongly... which might just make things worse. Without right knowledge, dream interpretation might just be a distraction on one's path. If one has received instructions to do dream interpretations (I'm not sure if anyone has) then it's better to keep this practice to oneself and try not to confuse others.<br><br>The Buddha was against dream interpretation generally for many obvious reasons.. even though in the sutras he did dream interpretation for at least one occasions or more (one of which was interpretating Ananda's dreams).<br><br>Other than that, the general statement made by Buddha on dream interpretation is that Dream Interpretations are 'lowly arts' and 'wrong livelihood' (which is against the 8 fold path):<br><br><blockquote>"Whereas some priests and contemplatives, living off food given in faith, maintain themselves by <strong>wrong livelihood</strong>, by such <strong>lowly arts</strong> as: reading marks on the limbs [e.g., palmistry]; reading omens and signs; interpreting celestial events [falling stars, comets]; <strong>interpreting dreams</strong>; reading marks on the body [e.g., phrenology]; reading marks on cloth gnawed by mice; offering fire oblations, oblations from a ladle, oblations of husks, rice powder, rice grains, ghee, and oil; offering oblations from the mouth; offering blood-sacrifices; making predictions based on the fingertips; geomancy; laying demons in a cemetery; placing spells on spirits; reciting house-protection charms; snake charming, poison-lore, scorpion-lore, rat-lore, bird-lore, crow-lore; fortune-telling based on visions; giving protective charms; interpreting the calls of birds and animals Â— <strong>he abstains from wrong livelihood, from lowly arts such as these.</strong><br><br>~ <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.02.0.than.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.02.0.than.html</a></blockquote>Also not to take dreams too seriously:<br><br><blockquote>If you want to continue to be a devoted yogi, generally you should never cling to dreams. If you do, you will eventually expose yourself to the influence of the four maras. If your dreams are positive, do not have any expectations. If we are filled with hopes and expectations, even positive things can turn negative. If your dreams are negative, don't take them too seriously. Learn to see negative dreams as illusion, not real. Then, although a dream seems negative, because we realize that it isn't real, it becomes a positive thing that prepares us for further development and realization in the spiritual path. This is the practice of a yogi.<br><br>-- from The Life of Gampopa by Jampa Mackenzie Stewart, just published by Snow Lion Publications.</blockquote></div>
