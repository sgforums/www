            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by sinweiy:<br><strong><br><br>Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche -[A] <span style="font-style: italic;">LetÂ’s sort this out once and for all! When we talk about kham, at the moment we are talking about this special kind of kham, the rig kham, the Buddha-nature kind of element. But usually kham is used to refer to the elements more generally, the 18 dhatus. There are the six outer kham: form, sound, smell, taste, feeling, and phenomena. These are the outer elements, and they are explained in detail if we study the abhidharma. Then there are six inner elements: the eye, ear, nose etc., and in between there are the six types of consciousness (namshey ): the eye consciousness, ear consciousness etc. The point here is that scientists are usually talking about the outer dhatus and even among these, they donÂ’t usually talk about the dhatu of Dharma, as then they would be talking about mind. But now we are talking about abhidharma, and all phenomena that we can perceive exist within these 18 dhatus or kham. Some phenomena have only one or two of these 18 elements. Some, like us, have all of them. For instance, a stone might only have the form element. But even just the form element is also divided into the five elements: earth, water, fire, air, and space. So Buddhists also believe that a stone has many of these elements, for example the fire element, the moisture element to hold it together, gravity and so on. That is all acceptable. And each of these dhatus has some kind of movement, some kind of function. TheyÂ’re not permanent and unchanging. For example, when the sun rises, the lotus opens. I donÂ’t know the detailed explanation, but there must be some kind of communication between the fire element, the moisture element and so on. But this kind of movement does not mean that this phenomenon has all the 18 dhatus.<br>Scientists have discovered many things like DNA, and these are all totally<br>acceptable to Buddhists. But there is something that scientists havenÂ’t found yet, which Vasubandhu and all the early Buddhist metaphysicists have found. There are other types of phenomena that donÂ’t have most of the 18 dhatus, just one or two. But instead of only having inanimate elements, they only have animate elements, such as consciousness. This corresponds to certain god realms, where they donÂ’t have form, colour, moisture or any of that. Similarly, bardo beings donÂ’t necessarily have all 18 dhatus. They may only have one or two, but these are typically the more Â‘animateÂ’ ones, the inner or Â‘in-betweenÂ’ dhatus. So if we compare a phenomenon that has only one kham or dhatu, and a phenomenon that has all the 18 kham, they are different. They function differently. [b]We have all 18 dhatus and the Buddha-nature, but to be referred to as Â‘animateÂ’, a being only has to have the 12 ayatanas Â– the 12 inner and in-between dhatus or kham. </span></strong><br>LetÂ’s say that a stone has the form element. As I said, form includes earth,<br>water, fire and all that. Now if one of these sub-elements is reduced, such as the water element, then perhaps the stone will disintegrate. But this doesnÂ’t mean that the stone has mind dhatu, the consciousness dhatu. This is what the Buddhists would say. There is scientific support for this view too. For example, the difference between chimpanzees and humans in terms of our DNA is very small Â– we are 99% exactly the same. But look at how big the difference is between us, even with just these few molecules of DNA! Phenomena are incredible! They are really beyond our comprehension. For example, cats have only two vowels but they can still have a conversation with each other!<br><br>/\[/b]</blockquote>Metaphysics don't equal to physics.

It gives us, more or less, only half the story (the Right Hand half).<br><br>David Chalmers (1995) recently caused a sensation by having his essay `The Puzzle of Conscious Experience' published by Scientific American, bastion of physicalist science. Chalmers' stunning conclusion was that subjective consciousness continues to defy all objectivist explanations. `Toward this end, I propose that conscious experience be considered a fundamental feature, irreducible to anything more basic. The idea may seem strange at first, but consistency seems to demand it' (p. 83). It never ceases to amaze how Anglo-Saxon philosophers greet the reinvention of the wheel with such fuss.<br><br>But Chalmers makes a series of excellent points. The first is the irreducibility of consciousness, which has to be `added' to the physical world in order to give a complete account of the universe. `Thus, a complete theory will have two components: physical laws, telling us about the behavior of physical systems from the infinitesimal to the cosmological, and what we might call psychophysical laws, telling us how some of those systems are associated with conscious experience. These two components will constitute a true theory of everything' (p. 83).<br><br>This simple attempt to reintroduce both Left and Right Hand domains to the Kosmos has been considered quite bold, a testament to the power of reductionism against which so obvious a statement seems radical. Chalmers moves toward a formulation: `Perhaps information has two basic aspects: a physical one and an experiential one. . . . Wherever we find conscious experience, it exists as one aspect of an information state, the other aspect of which is embedded in a physical process in the brain' (p. 85). That is, each state has an interior/intentional and exterior/physical aspect. My view, of course, is that all holons have not just those two, but rather four, fundamental and irreducible aspects, so that every `information state' actually and simultaneously has an intentional, behavioural, cultural, and social aspect; and moreover, each of those aspects has at least ten basic levels -- much closer to a theory of everything, if such even makes any sense.<br><br>Chalmers goes on to point out that all of the physicalist and reductionist approaches to consciousness (including Daniel Dennett's and Francis Crick's) only solve what Chalmers calls `the easy problems' (such as objective integration in brain processes) leaving the central mystery of consciousness untouched. He is quite right, of course. The funny thing is, all of the physicalist scientists who are sitting there and reading Chalmers' essay are already fully in touch with the mystery: they are already directly in touch with their lived experience, immediate awareness, and basic consciousness. But instead of directly investigating that stream (with, say, vipassana meditation [Varela et al., 1993]), they sit there, reading Chalmers' essay, and attempt to understand their own consciousness by objectifying it in terms of digital bits in neuronal networks, or connectionist pathways hierarchically summating in the joy of seeing a sunrise -- and when none of those really seem to explain anything, they scratch their heads and wonder why the mystery of consciousness just refuses to be solved...</span></div>
