              <h1>We are what we see</h1>
              <p>The manifold of phenomenal appearances is primordially unoriginated 
                              and non-dual, just like an image reflected in a mirror. The nature of 
                              openness isn’t separate from phenomenal appearances, just as water and 
                              its quality of being moist are combined in a non-dualistic condition. 
                              Free of the limits of illusion, like an imaginary city, the instant 
                              things manifest they are in the condition of being primordially unborn.</p>
              <p>Although the phenomenal world appears to be located (in time and 
                              space, in fact) it is the non- abiding dimension of being itself. The 
                              instant an appearance seems to disappear it does not in fact cease, 
                              (since ultimately phenomena) neither increase nor decrease. As such, 
                              phenomenal appear- ances do not exist in the way they appear.</p>
              <p>These lines are from a text called the Natural Freedom of Being by 
                              the great Complete Fulfill- ment master Longchenpa who lived in Tibet in
                               the fourteenth century. As we have said elsewhere, the Complete 
                              Fulfillment or Dzogchen tradition offers a spiritual perspective that is
                               very consistent with our own work. Here we will unpack these few lines 
                              for they will help us understand the radical immediacy of the Complete 
                              Fulfillment experience which embraces and dissolves the sense of 
                              separation we create between ourselves and the world.</p>
              <p>Longchenpa begins by stating that our sensory experience is uncreated
                               and indivisible. He uses the analogy of a mirror-image to illustrate 
                              this idea. This is an image that is used frequently in nearly all 
                              Buddhist traditions to illustrate how our experience lacks any discrete 
                              and irreducible properties. In our own time we can also use the examples
                               of film or video images. If we examine an image in a mirror the image 
                              gives the appearance of being composed of separate elements, yet in 
                              reality it is a single indivisible image. We cannot take the image apart
                               and put it together in another way. The elements appear to be separate 
                              but in fact they are inseparable. As an image, the seeming boundary 
                              between one feature and the next signifies nothing. There is no change 
                              in constitution, or media that differentiates one feature from another. 
                              Even if the image is moving and changing its shape and constitution it 
                              cannot be broken up into separable elements.</p>
              <p>From the Complete Fulfillment perspective the sense world is no 
                              different from the mirror image. While it appears to be divisible and 
                              manipulable like a set of building blocks, the idea that we can isolate 
                              one element of our experience and move it around, or replace it with 
                              another, is a linguis- tically created illusion. In particular, it is 
                              created through the language that attributes choice and agency to 
                              ourselves and others. The language of human agency produces the 
                              appearance of control and manipulation. We learn to claim responsibility
                               when certain, often repetitive actions, occur in a predicatable way. 
                              For example, when our body moves as we stand up from a chair we say we 
                              choose to do this. At a more profound level, the image of a reflection 
                              in a mirror also illustrates the inseparability between a perceiver and 
                              that which is perceived. According to the Complete Fulfillment, concepts
                               of a perceiver and objects of perception are theoretical abstractions, 
                              which have no basis in the domain of being. In the same way that an 
                              image in the mirror is inseparable from the mirror, similarly we don’t 
                              exist as something different from the universe that we experience. This 
                              is an extension of the idea that is now commonly accepted in the natural
                               and human sciences, that our experience is “theory laden”. In other 
                              words, our perceptions are shaped and influenced by our beliefs, 
                              theories, and structures for interpreting the world. However, the 
                              Complete Fulfillment tradition applies this discovery in a far more 
                              radical way by demonstrating that even the most obvious and palpable 
                              dimensions of our experience, such as the feeling of being different 
                              from the things we experience, are but structures of interpretation.</p>
              <p>The contemporary English mystic Douglas Harding has presented the 
                              visual dimensions of this disclosive space in a particularly accessible 
                              way through his notion of “having no head.” As Harding demonstrates in 
                              his writings, and through simple practical exercises, we never 
                              experience our own head in the same way that we experience those around 
                              us. In place of our head is a space that is the universe we experience. 
                              As Harding writes (p. 9), “This is not a matter of argument, or of 
                              philo- sophical acumen, or or working oneself up into a state, but of 
                              simple sight…. Present experience, whatever sense is employed, occurs 
                              only in an empty and absent head.” Our own head is a theoreti- cal 
                              construct, inferred on the basis that we are like the people who show up
                               within the field of our experience.</p>
              <p>Though our limbs and torso are often revealed within this field, our 
                              head is never revealed as an object of perception. Were it ever to be 
                              where we “think” it is, it would occlude the possibility of experiencing
                               anything else. If our head was where we “imagine” it is, the universe 
                              would disappear. As Harding says (p. 11), “there is one place where no 
                              head of mine can ever turn up, and that is here on my shoulders, where 
                              it would blot out this Central Void which is my very life-source.” Of 
                              course, you might say that the existence of our head as the gateway for 
                              our visual, auditory, and olfactory perception can be confirmed by 
                              reaching out and touching a mass that seems to rest on our shoul- ders, 
                              but as Harding says (p. 8), “when I start groping around for my lost 
                              head, instead of finding it here I only lose my exploring hand as well: 
                              it, too, is swallowed up in the abyss at the centre of my being.” In the
                               place where our head would be is a space that is the universe as we 
                              experience it. Consequently, from this perspective we are the universe. 
                              As Harding writes (p. 19): “It is absolutely Nothing, yet all things; 
                              the only Reality, yet an absentee… There is nothing else whatever. I am 
                              everyone and no-one ...”</p>
              <p>In the above lines Longchenpa uses the term openness (shunyata), thus
                               connecting the Com- plete Fulfillment to the broad and powerful river 
                              of Buddhist wisdom contained in the Perfect Wis- dom (Prajnaparamita) 
                              tradition. In language reminiscent of the famous Buddhist text, the 
                              Heart Scripture, Longchenpa writes that “the nature of openness isn’t 
                              separate from phenomenal appear- ances.” The Heart Scripture itself 
                              says: “Form is openness and openness itself is form. Openness does not 
                              differ from form and form does not differ from openness. Whatever is 
                              form, that is open- ness. Whatever is openness, that is form.”</p>
              <p>The point being made here is that there is no separation between that
                               which is disclosed (i.e., the phenomenal world) and the disclosive 
                              field that makes the disclosure of any universe possible. A disclosive 
                              space is the field within which all things manifest, persist, and decay,
                               exactly as they do. Ultimately, it is indistinguishable from the 
                              experiential field. It is the occurance of that which occurs in it. As 
                              Harding says (p. 60), “The Space is the things that occupy it.” This 
                              disclosive space cannot be created since this is tantamount to creating 
                              the universe. Further, to the extent that there is never a time when 
                              there is no disclosive space (time being an occurance within it), it is a
                               vacuous concept. In fact, the disclosive space that is disclosed 
                              doesn’t exist. This is why Buddhist philosophers such as Nagarjuna and 
                              Chandrakirti emphasize that the experience of openness is itself open 
                              and insubstan- tial.</p>
              <p>A consequence of this level of immediacy is there is no act of 
                              perception. As the Heart Scripture also says, “in the sphere of openness
                               there is no eye, ear, nose, tongue, body or mind, and there are no 
                              forms, sounds, smells, tastes, touchables or objects of mind. Because 
                              there is no perception, there is no perceiver, or object of perception 
                              either. As Harding writes (p. 6): “[T]hese coloured shapes present 
                              themselves in all simplicity, without any such complications as near or 
                              far, this or that, mine or not mine, seen-by-me or merely given. All 
                              twoness-all duality of subject and object-has vanished: it is no longer 
                              read into a situation which has no room for it.” It is meaningless to 
                              say that the world is out there, or in here, because disclosive space is
                               neither inside nor outside. There is nothing it doesn’t disclose, so it
                               can’t be inside since nothing can be outside. Nor, can it be outside 
                              because whatever is inside is disclosed by this space. Also, because 
                              there is no inside or outside, this space cannot be said to be small or 
                              large, expanded or contracted, hidden or revealed, here or there. 
                              Furthermore, because there is no sense of here or there, there is no 
                              experience of distance within this disclosive space. The feeling that we
                               are closer to some things and further away from others is an illusion 
                              created by the beliefs that things remain constant in size, even when 
                              they change their dimensions, and things can occlude each other. 
                              Consequently, we aren’t located within this space because we are the 
                              space itself. For example, when we sit in a room we believe that the 
                              room is located within a house which is within a city or town, but this 
                              isn’t given in our experience at all. That our room is located in a 
                              country on planet earth is an interpretation that is seemingly 
                              substanti- ated by memories.</p>
              <p>Perhaps that is so, you might say, but I still have the experience of
                               being located in this room. You might say you are sitting near the west
                               facing wall, or standing in the middle of the room. If we say we are 
                              located near the west wall we do so on the basis of a belief that the 
                              room exists in a larger universe. Here the sense of location is derived,
                               not from our experience, but that things exist “on the other side” of 
                              our experience. If we say we are in the middle of a room we believe that
                               things can be more, or less distant from us, in virtue of believing 
                              that phenomena have stable dimensions, even when they shrink or enlarge 
                              within our field of experience.</p>
              <p>Because the experience of distance and location deconstruct within 
                              the Complete Fulfillment perspective, there is no experience of motion 
                              or stillness. The phenomenon of walking or driving is completely 
                              consistent with us moving through a stationery landscape, or the 
                              landscape moving through us. In the absence of an arbitrary framework of
                               interpretation, there is absolutely no way of distinquishing whether we
                               are moving, or whether phenomena are moving through the clearing we 
                              identify as the locus of our head. Consequently, we are neither still 
                              nor moving. From the Complete Fulfillment perspective there is simply 
                              “an experience” of colors and shapes that modulate like reflections on 
                              water.</p>
              <p>This thing that we call our “body” isn’t the locus of our identity. 
                              It is simply the most constant gestalt that occurs in “our” experience. 
                              Many of our visual experiences are accompanied on the lower periphery by
                               an inchoate and indistinct sensation that frequently transforms into an
                               experience of hands, arms and sometimes legs. We identify these 
                              sensation as our body because they invariably show up wherever we think 
                              we are. We think we are there because these limbs consistently display 
                              the same markings in terms of color, shape, size, weight, etc. If 
                              another set of limbs showed up with predictable constancy around the 
                              bottom half of our visual field, we would think that we were there. We 
                              interpret that we are walking when certain changes occur in our visual, 
                              auditory and tactile fields. In fact, we simply witness modulations in 
                              our experience like those that can be partially replicated with virtual 
                              reality technology. The difference between virtual reality and the 
                              Complete Fulfillment perspective is that virtual reality creates an 
                              impression of movement while we are statio- nery. This is partially a 
                              limitation of virtual reality technology which cannot yet replicate the 
                              pixel resolution of human vision, or simulate the muscular activity 
                              involved in actions like walking. But more significantly it is due to 
                              the memories we have of stepping into a virtual reality unit. But unlike
                               virtual reality the Complete Fulfillment perspective doesn’t condition 
                              the experience of being in a fixed location with images changing around 
                              us. In other words, though the experience of real motion dissolves, it 
                              doesn’t produce the sensation of being stuck in the same location. 
                              Spatial location and dislocation both dissolve in this perspective. From
                               the Complete Fulfillment perspective, reality is always a virtual 
                              reality.</p>

              <p>My view is similar to Longchen's:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>No, no, life is not an illusion. It is 
              dangerous to think that
                                      way. It is what you perceive of as self-existing
               and permanent that
                                      is an illusion. If one think that life is an 
              illusion, one may go
                                      on to deny the things that we experience in 
              life.</em></p>

              <p>The article is an indepth inquiry into the nature of reality as non-dual without subject and object division. When non-duality is experienced, there is no division between 'me' as a observer and 'things' being observed. There is no distance. When you hear a sound, the sound is not out there and you the hearer inside, there is just the sound, the ringing. That is non-duality.</p>
              <p>Imagine a mirror, where the world reflected in it looks 3D with distance, but in fact, everywhere you look in the mirror, the images have the same distance from the mirror: 0 distance. Though distance looks real, actually it's just the same mirror appearing as those images, and there is actually 0 distance, no separation whatsoever in reality. In fact our reality is the same: everything is the same mirror-like Awareness even though things appear to have distance apart from us. There is literally nothing outside of Awareness. Everything you see, hear, touch, is the same non-dual Awareness. There's nothing that is outside you or apart from you, and neither are you a thing inside and apart from things outside.</p>
