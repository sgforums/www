            <div class='col-md body'>Hi crescent,<br><br>I believe that having peace at heart and doing things right should be a majority part of practising Buddhism.<br><br>I believe that there are many so-called 'non-buddhists' are actually living in a more buddhistic life than the many 'buddhists'.<br><br>Buddhism is not a ritualistic practice. If you are interested in Buddhism, you can source around for good books, to comprehend the Buddha's perspective towards this very same world we're living as He had. I believe you will have the knowledge to differentiate good and erm, sub-standard books.<br><br>It's nice to know that someone puts Dhamma into life and may you be your own inspiration and the inspiration of many others.</div>

But easier said than done.. in fact even those who have certain amount of attainments, even though it has become their 'natural state', cannot maintain mindfulness at all times and is fallible. Only someone completely liberated is able to. So practise hard.</div>

And even if you do not have, have Bodhisattva and Buddha pictures all around you. For me, I have a Kalachakra Mantra Mandala pasted in my room, I also have pictures of Bodhisattvas and a sandalwood figure of Shakyamuni Buddha in my room.<br><br>Sexual fantasies may not be entirely wrong because as lay persons, we are alright to have relationships and bear children. But sexual fantasies of your sort generally leads to sexual misconducts, which is breaking one of the 5 precepts. Even if you do not commit sexual misconducts in this lifetime, the seeds planted deep in your 8th consciousness will in another lifetime lead you to commit such atrocities. It is therefore dangerous. It is very evident. If you stop watching porn for a few days, if you already have the habit of watching it, there will be alot of dirty thoughts surfacing. Why? Because these imprints is already deep within your 8th consciousness, and needs to be cleansed. It needs your deep awareness of your Mind, Speech, Action. Awareness not as in "knowing it intellectually" - but being merely aware, watching it. I hope you understand. Deep awareness is like bright light shining into a dark room - everything within is lit up and all the darkness will be dispelled. You need to continue practising that, so that whenever a thought of that sort surfaces, you will immediately know and not be misled by it. If you are misled, it will inevitably lead to the next thought, forming a long continuous chain of thoughts of lust. And then eventually to other actions.<br><br>Lastly, if you do not have a Buddhist teacher, I hope you will find a Buddhist teacher and learn the dharma. If you can describe as it is in the first post, I believe you could have been a practitioner in your past life. You need to practise the dharma again in this lifetime otherwise your life will be wasted away... it is pitiful. Even past life practitioners still have habits that are not removed from their 8th consciousness. I have a friend in my dharma centre, he also used to have the habit of watching porn, but now he has quit and already has certain levels of attainment and awakening. He is only 23 I think. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
