Devas, or celestial beings, live in heaven, but does not mean they are enlightened or Buddhas. Buddhas like Shakyamuni is always human, even though in previous lifetime they might be Bodhisattvas appearing as Devas. What this means is, not only Shakyamuni Buddha is human, other Buddhas, like the previous Buddhas Kassapa, or next Buddha, Maitreya, will all appear on Earth as humans. Also, the Human realm is the best place to practice and get enlightened -- the hell realm is too full of suffering for people to want to practise, while heaven has too much enjoyment for the beings to want to practise. Human realm has all the right conditions, neither too pleasurable nor displeasant with a good amount of suffering for us to want to wake up.<br><br>Anyway as I said celestial realm, which is the highest realm in the 6 samsaric realms, are where the devas stay. (3 lower realms: Hell, Ghost, Animals. 3 higher realms: Human, Asura, Deva) However it is still a realm of samsara, and the devas are still subject to Birth and Death, they are not yet liberated from the uncontrolled cycles of samsaric rebirths, and therefore Devas take Buddha as their Teacher -- the Buddha surpasses all samsara realms, even that of the Devas.<br><br>Do read: <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/jootla/wheel414.html" rel="nofollow">Teacher of the Devas</a><br><br>Contents<br><br>* I.

The first five, derived from one's own existence, are:<br><br>1. one has obtained a human body.<br><br>2. one was born in a region where Buddha-dharma is present.<br><br>3. one has all one's faculties and can therefore understand what is taught.<br><br>4. since this teaching is being received, one has not been swept away on the tide of effects ripening from past unwholesome actions.<br><br>5. one has confidence in dharma.<br><br>The second five, received from others, are:<br><br>1. the Buddha Sakyamuni appeared in this fortunate kalpa.<br><br>2. the Buddha Sakyamuni taught the profound and extensive dharma.<br><br>3. the dharma taught by the Buddha has endured.<br><br>4. many have followed, and continue to follow the noble dharma.<br><br>5. many sentient beings rejoice in and support the practice of dharma so those who practice are not destitute.<br><br>This precious human birth is difficult to obtain, as can be understood by contemplating the previously listed conditions. Most sentient beings are habituated to unwholesome activity: very few can hold non-clinging compassionate awareness even some of the time, due to the powerful nature of ignorance. Ignorance gives rise to the two veils of conflicting emotions and primitive or partial views, which bind one to the wheel of rebirth. Therefore the importance of cultivating the wholesome in order to establish future resultant of precious human births is of primary importance.<br><br>To appear in the three times (past, present and future) and the three world systems (sensual, form, and formless) as a free and well-favoured human is rare. The number of sentient beings taking birth in other forms vastly overshadows those few who have the excellent opportunities of this birth. Understanding this makes it clear that one now has the best circumstances for developing spiritual realization. Practising dharma as one endowed with a precious human birth is as rare an occurrence as the appearance of stars in the daytime sky.<br><br>A free and well-favoured human birth is easily lost. Few conditions favour survival, while many conditions threaten it. Fire, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, accidents, poison, weapons, malevolent planetary influences (disasters), and disease are all around. It is unknown when they will arise. One breath is the difference between life and death.. It could be this breath. One's body is as easily destroyed as a bubble.<br><br>Do not meaninglessly waste it. Through habituation and ignorance of the preciousness of this moment, many humans use their life's energies to accumulate possessions and positions which cannot follow them after death. With the break-down of the body, the actions and motives that fueled daily activity will continue to bear fruit. Practice the good and good results will form the stream that carries through the process of death-birth.<br><br>Use the free and well-favoured human birth to attain ultimate realization. This life is the only condition needed. If the aspiration to see things as they are is strong, there is no need for special circumstances in order to do one's practice. Rather than feeling as though one were somehow more deserving than others, see that Bodhicitta resides everywhere. Unfavourable outer conditions and obstacles provide the opportunity to practice generosity, patience, equanimity. By condemning one's daily circumstance and companions, the seeds are sown for losing a cherished possession -- the present moment...</span></div>
