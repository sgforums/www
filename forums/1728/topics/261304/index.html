            <div class='col-md body'>There is no denying that this can be a complicated choice. In such cases I would definitely recommend consulting a wise Buddhist master/teacher.<br><br>Though we have to consider one's life, karmic factors will come to play as well. Any abortions regardless of one's life circumstances is still killing and ending lives, it is also going to be a very painful and gruelling process for the aborted child.<br><br>If possible, it's best NOT to abort the baby, and take care of the baby even if he is not very healthy compared to others. It is also part of the parents' karma, so one should take this as a chance to gradually clear our karma from the past, and as a test of one's dharma practice and cultivation, rather than pushing the karma forward into future lifetimes or even worsening it. We should take care of the child to our best, shower him with love, treat him like any other child.<br><br>If one has already decided, or already had abortions, one is advised to dedicate all merits in one's lifetime and practise to the aborted child, among other advises (please read the link below)<br><br>Regarding the topic of Abortion, I already had discussions on this forum previously: <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=230323" rel="nofollow">Buddhism's Stance on Abortion</a><br><br>P.S.

Because abortions is so predominant in the world nowadays, the world is creating very heavy collective karma as a result.<br><br><blockquote><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol4no4d.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol4no4d.htm</a><br><br><strong>8. Abortion is legal in some countries. Does Jen Chen Buddhism support abortion? What are the retributions from the karma of abortion?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Jen Chen Buddhism advocates contraception, not abortion.</span></strong><br><br>Jen Chen Buddhism advocates the observance of the Five Precepts: to abstain from (1) killing, (2) stealing, (3) sexual misconduct, (4) false speech and (5) consumption of all kinds of intoxicants. To abstain from killing is the first precept and that means to avoid taking the life away from any living beings. All killings are sinful, especially the killing of human beings since they are of the highest order amongst all living things on earth. As viviparous animals, the human embryo is considered a human being. Therefore, one who has aborted a foetus has committed an act of killing.<br><br>Jen Chen Buddhism absolutely does not support abortion because it is an act of killing. The retribution of killing is to suffer in hell. Moreover, the consciousness of the foetus whom has been deprived of his birth and caused to suffer in his killing, will be engulfed in hatred and anger. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Thus, the collective negative karma of killing will lead to a common retribution, resulting in calamities among humanity.</span></strong><br><br>Jen Chen Buddhism hopes that humanity accepts contraception and objects to abortion. It is in this way that humanity can have happiness and bliss.</blockquote>Most abortions (97%) are made not due to health reasons and most of them are completely avoidable... yet, they chose to abort their babies because they do not want to take the responsibility of bringing up the child due to various circumstances. They also did not take other alternatives. Which is very sad.</div>
