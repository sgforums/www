            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by An Eternal Now:<br><strong><br><br>Not exactly. Obviously you wasn't paying attention to my posts. But at the same time I stated that only 3% of abortion are made due to health reasons.<br><br>By Ven. S Dhammika:<br><br><a href="http://www.goodquestiongoodanswer.net/gqga_The_Five_Precepts.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.goodquestiongoodanswer.net/gqga_The_Five_Precepts.html</a><br><br>[b]QUESTION: What does Buddhism say about abortion ?</strong><br><br>ANSWER: According to the Buddha life begins at conception or very soon after and so to abort a fetus would be to take a life. [Back to Top]<br><br><strong>QUESTION: But if a woman is raped or if she knows that her child is going to be deformed, wouldnÂ’t it be better to stop the pregnancy ?</strong><br><br>ANSWER: A child conceived as the result of a rape is as entitled to live and be loved as any other child. He or she should not be killed simply because their biological father committed a crime. Giving birth to a deformed or mentally retarded child would be a terrible shock for the parents but if its okay to abort a fetus like this then why not kill children or adults who are deformed or handicapped? There might be situations where abortion was the most humane alternative, for example, to save the life of a mother. But letÂ’s be honest, most abortions are preformed simply because the pregnancy is inconvenient, an embarrassment or because the parents want to have the child later. To Buddhists, these seem a very poor reasons to destroy a life. [Back to Top][/b]</blockquote>Go and suck your 3 percent, numbers don't mean anything in this circumstance but it always depends on your situation.<br><br>"Of course, abortion, from a Buddhist viewpoint, is an act of killing and is negative, generally speaking. But it depends on the circumstances. If the unborn child will be retarded or if the birth will create serious problems for the parent, these are cases where there can be an exception. I think abortion should be approved or disapproved according to each circumstance".<br><br>Quote from the present Dalai Lama.</div>

The exposure, certainly you would have know would mark great differences.<br><br>I've known couples who chose to abort; some don't due to different reasons. The couples who abort doesn't necessarily feel good. But at least to my knowledge, another abortion may actually gave another couple another chance to lead new life.<br><br>For me, I'd been asked several times on whether to abort or not reason being friends know that I'm a buddhist and seek my opinion.<br><br>I always tell them, by buddhistic principle, one should not take the life of another, especially a human life. I don't go and tell them kill baby bad kamma, kamma will follow you, etc. 'cos these people if there <span style="font-style: italic;">are</span> buddhists, they probably won't even ask me in the first place. And at this situation of paranoid and anxiety, I don't see <span style="font-style: italic;">any</span> good to add in the kamma follow you which <span style="font-style: italic;">is</span> a fear factor to people who probably has little or no idea what kamma is.<br><br>However, given in a <span style="font-style: italic;">practical</span> situation, I will in return ask them, are they prepared mentally and financially for this baby? Are they willing to accept the new life? Because ultimately in the end, I am <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> responsible in bringing up their child, so I don't go and <span style="font-style: italic;">shove it down people's throat that they have <strong>no right</strong> to this or that</span>!<br><br>I don't know how cycle know my age but as you'd claimed to be older, definitely you know better than me that raising a kid, especially in Singapore is definitely not easy.</blockquote>There are many children who are born in poor families, but they also become very rich and successful people in the future, have you thought of that?<br><br>I think human life is one of the most precious gift, and even if one cannot support the baby there are other options: such as adoption.<br><br>If we can give the baby away for adoption, but instead chose to abort due to social reasons, then isn't that irresponsible?<br><br>I am not shoving it down people's throat, I'm just asking people to think whether what I said is right or not.<br><br><blockquote>What is the point when a couple is not prepared for the child and ended up having <span style="font-style: italic;">more</span> family problem? Juvenile violence, drug paddling, family violence, etc. Of course in AEN's eyes these may not substantiate any reason for abortion. For me, it simply lies on the couple's readiness. Mind you, these people are not buddhists to start with! So is AEN willing to take up the responsibility of the bad family situation due to not aborting the child for whatever reason that the couple is not ready for? Of course AEN will say it's not his responsibility!</blockquote>Yeah that's not my responsibility, but it is also irresponsible if someone asked for my comments and I say, well, since you're not a Buddhist you can abort. I'm not judging others, I'm not imposing fear on others, I'm just advising that we should avoid abortion to the best of our abilities, because most abortion cases are done due to poor reasons and are completely avoidable just like what Ven S Dhammika said. In this case, don't you think we should advise them not to abort?<br><br>Of course it depends on case to case basis, I never said we must not abort no matter what.<br><br><blockquote>AEN here definitely has the good kamma to be borned in a family that allowed him not only to live comfortably and have the chance to listen to the good Dhamma.<br><br>But this doesn't apply to all.<br><br>Why have I choose to response in this thread because I feel what HZ feels about it too as quoted above.</blockquote>Yeah, and I won't force Buddhist concepts for non-Buddhists, nevertheless I will advise on the basis of the preciousness of life and encourage the alternatives that one can take. I won't anyhow impose or 'shove' concepts of karma on others. Depending on whether he can accept it, I might mention my viewpoint and perspective of karma, and of course if he is a Buddhist, then of course we can remind him what he already knew.<br><br><blockquote>And I think precepts are guidelines, not commandments. But having said that again I stress that I don't mean to encourage people to break them.<br><br>AEN, in another current thread on the sexual misconduct, someone quoted about cannot having sex etc, these are <span style="font-style: italic;">really</span> in the vinaya to the best of my knowledge. I think it's Theravada's you can go do a research on that. In fact there are certain day and time one shouldn't have sex. And Buddha said that male organ can only enter female organ and female organ can only allow male organ.</blockquote>Agreed. And I never said the Thunder thing is wrong, it's just that I'm a little surprised and I do not know the reason for it, and I said I would like to read further on that, so if someone has any materials on it please refer it to this forum for us to read.<br><br><blockquote>This would mean that homosexuality is actually <strong>not</strong> allowed in Buddhism! Why don't you make some comment on why homsexuality is allowed in contemporary Buddhism then?</blockquote>Because nobody is asking about homosexuality in that thread, what. I posted some articles previously.<br><br><blockquote>Cycle, even HHDL had mentioned about these precepts thing in regards to sexual misconduct, and if my memory didn't fail me, he had said something like it's difficult to answer too!</blockquote>That requires wisdom to talk about it and yet not distort Buddha's teachings. Otherwise better not comment. I have never seen HHDL going against what Buddha preaches.<br><br>Similarly, I didn't say in all cases abortions cannot be made (such as to save the mother's life). But at the same time I try to align myself with what the Buddha taught about not killing lives. I don't have much wisdom, but at least I think I didn't go against Buddhism's teachings of non-killing in any major way yet on the points.<br><br><blockquote>Of course it's difficult. Given the current time and situation, many things have changed. And how Buddhism is going to adapt to be a more realistic teaching?</blockquote>Dharma is dharma, you can't change dharma, you can only change the way you bring the message to the world. The dharma is taught by the Buddha, we do not teach our own dharma, if we want to talk about Buddhism we should only talk about what was taught by the Buddha. We can mention our own personal views, but we should put a disclaimer that this was not taught by Buddha, it is just my view.<br><br>You cannot change the truth! Not that I am judging people, but think for yourself, do I have the right to anyhow fit the dharma with our own concepts? The Dharma is taught by Buddha! Do I have the right to distort it base on my needs..? In any case you may choose not to follow the Buddha on certain issues, and that's fine because we all make choices for ourselves and are responsible for our own action and thinking.<br><br>But can we say that we are 'fitting dharma to our situation', or is it really just 'we are incapable of following strictly the dharma because I am not yet a Buddha or a great practitioner' and I don't have his greatness and wisdom? I'm not saying everyone here is a great practitioner, and neither am I, I'm just saying we shouldn't use our own sentient being's concepts to interpret Buddha's teachings. We should be very careful of this and I'm not saying I have never made this mistake before, I'm just saying we should be careful of this point and hopefully help each other, remind each other, when one of us made this mistake.<br><br><blockquote>Are we simply going to condemn people, buddhists or not who had abortion?</blockquote>Buddhists never condemn anyone, we treat all beings as equal, I have also not condemn anyone, in fact I said those who have undergone abortion does not mean they are doomed or condemned, but they should try to clear their karma and dedicate merits to the deceased.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>In regards to deformity, as AEN had mentioned no one is given any right to take one's life away simply due to deformity, then I ask, so who has the right to decide that this deformity will be live for the rest of their lives in humiliation and pain?</blockquote>But you must see things in a bigger perspective.<br><br>There are many cases where there are deformities but a person can continue to live like others, and given a choice of course they would want to continue living. Like most handicapped people, just because they are handicapped doesn't mean they don't want to live.<br><br><blockquote>Sometimes, it even takes quite a long time for the immediate family to accept the child, let alone the eyes of public.<br><br>And as AEN as said it's not your responsible in bringing them up, then I think you should learn to take the humble pie and not hanging on your stat and theory by keep saying majority not meant for abortion.</blockquote>Ok let's not talk about statistics, but clearly there are many people out there who can choose the alternative, and we must do our best to advise them, encourage them to choose a better path than to kill a child. We are not being 'arrogant' or 'shoving people down Buddhist ideas', but it must be done out of sincerity and good will, to appreciate life's preciousness.<br><br><blockquote>'cos end of the day it's the choice of theirs not yours.</blockquote>I never denied that, like I said we never shove things down on others, we can only advise.<br><br><blockquote>Cycle, I suggest to AEN to do volunteer work, first thing, being in service of others in charity act can be considered as part of a buddhist cultivation and it will give him exposure to the pain of the less fortunate. I believe Buddha's love is the practical love, not sit in meditation treating metta as some kind of wave to generate. The best way to be compassion is to show and act the act of compassion!</blockquote>That is a good advise and I thank you for that...<br><br><blockquote>To sum my point up, I do not support nor against abortion. If people were to ask me, I will say yes, abortion would violate the first precept of not taking lives. But is the couple willing and prepare for the new life? Because I respect their decision.</blockquote>Personally, I would not ask them 'are you prepared or willing' because this discourages them at the times of confusion, so if they are thinking whether they should choose to abort, they will result in thinking more negatively.<br><br>I would just encourage them, help them, give our support we can give, eventually they may appreciate it. We are also helping to save a life.<br><br>This does not mean we disrespect his descision, like I said, it is only advise and encouragement.<br><br>Of course it is mutually understood that ultimately it's your own choice you have to make.</div>

I beleive AEN will never go to the hospitals and tell all the non- buddhist patients who are contemplating abortion the terrible karmic results they wld incurred later for themselves.

This is also a paramita of Giving.<br><br>- too attached to forms like voluntering must be of certain patterns or ways wld leads to vexations too.<br><br>- but of cos if AEN can mix wif ppl of poorer backgrounds( maybe he has, we don't know), he may advanced faster in his practise. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> But again ths is also a form of attachment.<br><br>ok, gtg. take pills n lie down.</div>
