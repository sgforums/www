Everything the Buddha taught, he said, you can realise it for yourself. Means through practise, we will realise what the Buddha realise. Or like they said, 'come and see', 'ehipassiko'.<br><br>Karma is happening all the time, this volition, it is subtle and yet happening all the time, surfacing all the time, affecting us all the time. And consciousness is always creating new karma, all the time when there is volitional action. This must be the realisation through practise. And this is leading to the third dharma seal. I have been posting about the topic of karma lately in recent posts of mine.<br><br>However it is not helpful, and almost impossible, for ordinary people like us to go into the specifics of speculating cause and effect. That's not the point and cannot be done other than by the very wise like Buddha himself, or some great practitioner. Which is why the exact Karmic cause and effect, as Buddha said, is one of the 4 imponderables that if you become obsessed with thinking, can lead to insanity.</div>

I also made a point that 25% of fetuses in Singapore are aborted, and it wouldn't make sense that much of the numbers are aborted due to health reasons but usually they are aborted due to unwillingness and other avoidable reasons.<br><br>In any case I also have to make a point that even if abortion is done under circumstances such as health reasons, we cannot just say there will not be karmic effects.. as Yamizi is said, karma isn't just a system to judge a person. The act of killing the baby, causing tremendous pain, taking away life, itself has karma even though it might be done under various circumstances. The same goes for euthanasia, even if choices are made due to that circumstance it doesn't mean no karma will be created. So even though the karmic effects may not be the same as, say abortion done out of unwillingness to bear a child, we should bear in mind that all abortions will result in some form of karma, and therefore, we should under such circumstances try to lighten our karma and his karma and dedicate merits to the child.</div></blockquote>** it is actually 3% upon further research.</div>

Think through again or better go back to attend some basic buddhism course.</blockquote>Of course I know karma is not fatalism, but that doesn't mean you can do evil deeds on the basis that you can become Angulimala. BTW, even Angulimala had to suffer some bad karmic consequences EVEN if he had attain arhatship -- like having to suffer being despised by everyone and not receiving alms. And also, getting serious injuries throughout the body, completely bleeding, by the bandits. Buddha had to suffer headaches, dysentry, at his last days.<br><br>About Angulimala (<a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.086.than.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.086.than.html</a>): <span style="font-style: italic;">...Then Ven. Angulimala, early in the morning, having put on his robes and carrying his outer robe &amp; bowl, went into Savatthi for alms. Now at that time a clod thrown by one person hit Ven. Angulimala on the body, a stone thrown by another person hit him on the body, and a potsherd thrown by still another person hit him on the body. So Ven. Angulimala Â— his head broken open and dripping with blood, his bowl broken, and his outer robe ripped to shreds Â— went to the Blessed One. The Blessed One saw him coming from afar and on seeing him said to him: "Bear with it, brahman! Bear with it! The fruit of the kamma that would have burned you in hell for many years, many hundreds of years, many thousands of years, you are now experiencing in the here-&amp;-now!" 3...</span><br><br>Secondly, it is only someone enlightened like Angulimala or Milarepa that can clear that amount of karma. It is only one who has at least attained Arhatship that can 'zhong bao qing shou', that means karmic effect does not bear as much fruition as it would have been. We can also lighten our karma but it is very limited unless we become enlightened. The karma of killing is not light at all, you know. If not for having practised and attained enlightenment, Angulimala would have to suffer many thousands of years in hell. So the question is, are you so confident you'll become enlightened very quickly and be a very great practitioner such as Angulimala or Milarepa? Otherwise, the karma will still be heavy. Nevertheless I did say quite clearly that one who has chosen to abort babies should try to lighten his and the baby's karma, as well as dedicate merits to the baby.<br><br><blockquote>Once again, it will be up to the couples' decision in whether to abort or not for whatever reasons.<br><br>You see a retard boy happy that's because the family has the strength and will to go through but not all of them can. But in the bottom of everyone's heart, who would not wish that one's child is normal? You dare to take the vow to have all your babies to be borned deformed and willing to take care of them for the rest of your lives? Of course this is about deformity.</blockquote>No, because I am not responsible for their doings. If it happens to me, then I will take responsibility. I do not have Avalokitesvara's great compassion and capacity, but if such things happen to me, I have no choice but to accept it and take it as a chance to practise the dharma.<br><br>If everyone wish that their child was normal, but didn't want to take responsible a child that has some deformalities, then that's useless. Like I said -- retarded children can lead lives as happy as ours, and we do not have the right to kill them just because there is some deforms as long as they can live their lives well enough. Otherwise it is the same as saying we can kill handicapped people.<br><br><blockquote>To those couples who are simply not wanting to take responsibility due to that moment of lust, that's another issue.<br><br>Afterall we are bystanders, if the couples are not willing to take then ARE YOU willing to take care?</blockquote>Nope, but it is not my child and therefore not my responsibilities. If it is mine then it's a different issue.<br><br>That is the whole purpose of all these discussion, is to convince people to take responsibilies and to take care of the children themselves. We are not them but we can give dharma advises, there is no problem at all with giving advises.<br><br><blockquote>So instead sounding self-righteous here, please expose yourself to these people with special needs. Try to volunteer 2 times a week for say 5 years. Get a feel of yourself. Give some practical love then sitting on a self-made pedestral seat in a surreal forum deciding who has or hasn't have any right to take life or not.<br><br>It's easy for one to preach love, dhamma, etc during peace times. When the real challenges come, it depends again.<br><br>WILL YOU BE ABLE TO DO SO YOURSELF?</blockquote>If it happens to me, as a Buddhist practitioner and having learnt so many years of dharma, of course I will do my best to raise the child and not choose abortion.<br><br>I just cannot see how one have the right to kill a child. Especially if they are healthy -- at most they can be given for adoption, there is no reason why we should take away a life just because of that. Or even if he has some deformation, as long as he can live well, that's good enough. On my part I will definitely do my best to be loving, patient, and caring.<br><br>It's a matter of whether you are practising dharma, practising precepts, metta, and paramitas! Of course, it is not just talk. Cultivation is never an easy thing, if you look into the 500 lifetimes of Shakyamuni Buddha in the Jataka tales, do you think it is easy to practise as a Bodhisattva? But if we do not train and cultivate the paramitas in this way, how can we ever hope to attain Buddhahood?<br><br>But of course, in the beginning a true Buddhist should have the wisdom not to end up in such a situation in the first place.</div>

[Back to Top]<br><br><strong>QUESTION: But if a woman is raped or if she knows that her child is going to be deformed, wouldnÂ’t it be better to stop the pregnancy ?</strong><br><br>ANSWER: A child conceived as the result of a rape is as entitled to live and be loved as any other child. He or she should not be killed simply because their biological father committed a crime. Giving birth to a deformed or mentally retarded child would be a terrible shock for the parents but if its okay to abort a fetus like this then why not kill children or adults who are deformed or handicapped? There might be situations where abortion was the most humane alternative, for example, to save the life of a mother. But letÂ’s be honest, most abortions are preformed simply because the pregnancy is inconvenient, an embarrassment or because the parents want to have the child later. To Buddhists, these seem a very poor reasons to destroy a life. [Back to Top]</div>

I don't go and tell them kill baby bad kamma, kamma will follow you, etc. 'cos these people if there <span style="font-style: italic;">are</span> buddhists, they probably won't even ask me in the first place. And at this situation of paranoid and anxiety, I don't see <span style="font-style: italic;">any</span> good to add in the kamma follow you which <span style="font-style: italic;">is</span> a fear factor to people who probably has little or no idea what kamma is.<br><br>However, given in a <span style="font-style: italic;">practical</span> situation, I will in return ask them, are they prepared mentally and financially for this baby? Are they willing to accept the new life? Because ultimately in the end, I am <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> responsible in bringing up their child, so I don't go and <span style="font-style: italic;">shove it down people's throat that they have <strong>no right</strong> to this or that</span>!<br><br>I don't know how cycle know my age but as you'd claimed to be older, definitely you know better than me that raising a kid, especially in Singapore is definitely not easy.<br><br>What is the point when a couple is not prepared for the child and ended up having <span style="font-style: italic;">more</span> family problem? Juvenile violence, drug paddling, family violence, etc. Of course in AEN's eyes these may not substantiate any reason for abortion. For me, it simply lies on the couple's readiness. Mind you, these people are not buddhists to start with! So is AEN willing to take up the responsibility of the bad family situation due to not aborting the child for whatever reason that the couple is not ready for? Of course AEN will say it's not his responsibility!<br><br>AEN here definitely has the good kamma to be borned in a family that allowed him not only to live comfortably and have the chance to listen to the good Dhamma.<br><br>But this doesn't apply to all.<br><br>Why have I choose to response in this thread because I feel what HZ feels about it too as quoted above.<br><br>And I think precepts are guidelines, not commandments. But having said that again I stress that I don't mean to encourage people to break them.<br><br>AEN, in another current thread on the sexual misconduct, someone quoted about cannot having sex etc, these are <span style="font-style: italic;">really</span> in the vinaya to the best of my knowledge. I think it's Theravada's you can go do a research on that. In fact there are certain day and time one shouldn't have sex. And Buddha said that male organ can only enter female organ and female organ can only allow male organ. This would mean that homosexuality is actually <strong>not</strong> allowed in Buddhism! Why don't you make some comment on why homsexuality is allowed in contemporary Buddhism then?<br><br>Cycle, even HHDL had mentioned about these precepts thing in regards to sexual misconduct, and if my memory didn't fail me, he had said something like it's difficult to answer too!<br><br>Of course it's difficult. Given the current time and situation, many things have changed. And how Buddhism is going to adapt to be a more realistic teaching?<br><br>Are we simply going to condemn people, buddhists or not who had abortion?<br><br>In regards to deformity, as AEN had mentioned no one is given any right to take one's life away simply due to deformity, then I ask, so who has the right to decide that this deformity will be live for the rest of their lives in humiliation and pain?<br><br>Sometimes, it even takes quite a long time for the immediate family to accept the child, let alone the eyes of public.<br><br>And as AEN as said it's not your responsible in bringing them up, then I think you should learn to take the humble pie and not hanging on your stat and theory by keep saying majority not meant for abortion.<br><br>'cos end of the day it's the choice of <strong>theirs</strong> not <strong>yours</strong>.<br><br>Cycle, I suggest to AEN to do volunteer work, first thing, being in service of others in charity act can be considered as part of a buddhist cultivation and it will give him exposure to the pain of the less fortunate. I believe Buddha's love is the practical love, not sit in meditation treating metta as some kind of wave to generate. The best way to be compassion is to show and act the act of compassion!<br><br>To sum my point up, I do not support nor against abortion. If people were to ask me, I will say yes, abortion would violate the first precept of not taking lives. But is the couple willing and prepare for the new life? Because I respect their decision.<br><br>I believe HZ and Omni get my points =)</div>
