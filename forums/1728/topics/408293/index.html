              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I am writing this was because quite sometime back I was told by someone that if a buddhist follows the proper buddha's teachings, your forehead is supposed to emit some white light. Is it true? Is this refer to the white light from 3rd chakra / forehead or reducing in karma? Just curious. Thanks a lot.</p>

              <p>To the white light.</p>
              <p>These kind of things does happen, but it will lead to attachment.</p>
              <p>When I meditate I also see lights, but these are stuff that arise and pass away.</p>
              <p>Only true realization is something that is life changing and permanent. Therefore go for true realization... not passing experiences.</p>

              <p>This is true. Evil spirits cannot get near someone's whose mind's brightness is strong. When you practice your mind's brightness will be revealed.</p>

              <p><br>hi 18th Vow, i think the fo guang mentioned by Positron comes when you are sincere enough with your practice and Amitabha blesses you.  It is a sign of blessing. </p>
              <p>The light from body is your own energy... also will flux according to your own practice, health so forth.</p>
              <p>As AEN said, if you really serious to practice, then don't bother too much about the various light phenomenas happening... tat is only eye consciousness, we should only aim at liberation, transcend even the 8th consciousness.</p>
              <p>All these lights are energy. It is nothing special deserving interest. For eg, we walk, that requires energy. Food gives us energy. Electricity is energy. All these are simply physics of life. It is catchy because it is little talked about. eg body aura... but not important for real spiritual progress and ending of suffering.</p>
              <p>Look inwards not outwards for progress. Eg, in the past, i am very attached to something, something happening will make me angry easily etc. now after my practice, did i change?</p>
              <p>Real practice result show in our daily life. It is not a flashy thing... but such things are heartfelt changes and will give us true freedom.  Freedom from boredom, loneliness, selfishness, indifference,  desire, anger.  And will make us alive , vibrant, joyful, carefree, loving, kind and compassionate. And when death comes, we have ultimate confidence and freedom.</p>
