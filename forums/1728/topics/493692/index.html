              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Gaylon Ferguson| March 9,
              2017| Lion’s Roar</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">What
              is this thing we call “self”? We assemble it ourselves, according to Buddhist
              psychology. Gaylon Ferguson breaks down the five-step process of ego
              development.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">William
              James, one of the founders of modern psychology, wrote in 1890 that our
              earliest experience of the world is of “a great blooming, buzzing confusion.”
              While modern research shows that newborns have more ability to make sense of
              their experience than James believed, even as adults we remain confused about
              how our minds work. Yes, we all know that we have minds and psychological
              experiences, but who are we really? How does mind work to shape our experience
              of our world, our felt experience of being alive? How might we slow down for a
              moment to see clearly the dazzlingly rapid unfolding of mind and world?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Buddhist
              psychology begins by examining our everyday experience of clarity and confusion
              about our minds and self. The earliest Buddhist maps of our sense of self show
              five key steps in the process of ego development. The Sanskrit word for these
              five, the skandhas, literally means “aggregates” or “heaps.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              skandhas are not so much collections of elementary particles of existence as
              momentary gatherings of mental and physical events. In fact, mind and body—the
              mental and the physical—are the two main kinds of events. We experience
              ourselves as embodied beings in a world of other physical forms like trees and
              cars. We also move in a world of other living beings with their own mental
              experiences of suffering and ease.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              five skandhas, the “heaps” of our basic being, are (1) form, (2) feeling, (3)
              perception, (4) concept, and (5) consciousness. Let’s walk together now through
              these five and examine how step-by-step they build our sense of self.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Form</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              first skandha is called “form,” meaning both our physical body and the body of
              the world. How is this part of our experience of mind?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Form
              is the ground of our being, the fundamental sense that we are this body,
              somewhat separate from this mind. This separation is the primary distinction in
              our ordinary experience. My body has weight that appears on the bathroom scale
              in the morning, while my thoughts are of uncertain substance. They matter,
              particularly to me, but they are not material. My body and my mind arise
              together, but in uneasy tension. I cannot simply think my weight up or down.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              body and mind are like two quarreling but conjoined siblings.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">As
              in any dualistic relationship, body and mind may go along harmoniously for a
              time together, enjoying each other’s company and friendship. But body and mind
              can also fall into deep division, quarrels, and entrenched separations. When
              all is going well, my body cooperates with what my mind seems to want from it:
              “Let’s have breakfast now, shall we?” But sometimes my body rebels, developing
              a knee ache just when I wanted to go for a run or falling asleep during an
              important meeting.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              body and mind are like two quarreling but conjoined siblings. If we are
              physically tired or hungry, our experience and judgment of others may be
              correspondingly flavored by fatigue or low blood sugar. A recent study showed
              that Israeli judges granted parole in sixty-five percent of cases heard
              immediately after they had eaten and in nearly zero cases heard just before a
              break period or at the end of the day. So the first insight into the working of
              our minds is that understanding mental experience requires close attention to
              the skandha of form as well.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Feeling</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              next phase in the emergence of self is called “feeling.” This means our basic
              sense of liking, disliking, or being indifferent to whatever we perceive.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">How
              do we feel about the forms and beings we are encountering? Do they feel
              attractive or threatening? Do we feel like moving toward or away from them?
              These intuitive feelings—not quite full-fledged emotions—are the basis for our
              subsequent impulses toward or away from whatever we are experiencing. “A warm
              sweater in winter? Hmm, good, I like this very much.” “Too many layers in the
              heat of the midday sun? Hmm, bad, I’d like to take some of these off.” Like,
              dislike, neutral, attraction, repulsion, neutrality—around and around we go all
              day and all night. Daydreams and nightmares are all flavored by feeling.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Feeling
              is the general background to all our experience, a changing texture of
              encounter and exchange with our world. This is not denying that there are
              benevolent and malevolent beings in the world, those who wish us well and those
              who would cause us harm. As they say, “Even paranoids have real enemies.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Note
              that these feelings are our mental experience. It’s partly the delight of our
              own minds we are tasting when we enjoy a delicious apple. The skandha of
              feeling points to this primarily mental aspect of all our experience. Our own
              minds accompany our experience of anything and everything. This sounds obvious
              at first, barely worth mentioning, but it’s one of the key insights of the
              contemplative traditions. Our pleasant or unpleasant experiences of whomever or
              whatever always have an inner aspect. We call this inner aspect “mind.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Perception</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              next stage in the development of the self is called “perception.” These are
              more specific discernments than the simple, broad-brush evaluations of
              feeling—thumbs up, thumbs down, or neutral. Here it’s “I like, very much, not
              only the warmth provided by my new wool sweater but also its light-blue color
              and smooth texture.” These perceptions of the desirable, handsome qualities of
              the new sweater are all tinged by biases from the past. We’ve prejudged it as
              having good qualities based on our prior feelings.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Note
              that these perceptual judgments are all from my point of view, from the
              perspective of a gradually solidifying “me.” (A moth’s experience of the
              sweater would be very different.) We perceive this as “a really good light-blue
              wool sweater” because, for the moment at least, it seems to be “on my side,” on
              the side of a central “me.” There is a dawning sense that this sweater fulfills
              and completes me, so I grasp to hold on to it. It’s as though by holding on
              tightly to the sweater (substitute whatever fits for you), I am also holding on
              to a self.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              self-centeredness of this “perceiving” comes home to roost in the psychological
              payoff: that this sweater makes me good, “good to go,” slightly better than I
              was without it—and a lot more solid in a fast-changing world.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Our
              experience of the world arrives conveniently packaged into things we perceive
              are good for us and things that aren’t.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It’s
              as though the skandha of perception were an old-fashioned central switchboard
              operator fearfully screening our telephone calls according to one simple criterion:
              for me or against me? As a result, our experience of the world arrives
              conveniently packaged into things we perceive are good for us and things that
              aren’t. What’s wrong with that?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              problem is that the switchboard operator acts in anxious haste, barely pausing
              to ask the name of the caller or the nature of the call. The operator
              quickly—too quickly—decides to let some calls through as “friends” and to deny
              access to others as “enemies.” This would be tremendously helpful and efficient
              if it were accurate.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Unfortunately,
              it’s all too frequently a comic series of painful errors, just a prejudiced
              guess based on habitual patterns: “Oh, I remember you from the pleasing sound
              of your voice yesterday, Mr. Smith, you’re a very good friend, let me put you
              through immediately.” Or “No, I don’t remember you, Mr. Jones, never heard of
              you, but your ugly voice reminds me of a crank caller yesterday, so please go
              away, good-bye!” As we see from this analogy, perception adds names and labels
              of “recognition” based on past experience. We also see corresponding impulses
              developing to actively grasp or push away our experience.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Our
              hyper-busy perceptual switchboard operator also fails to take into account the
              crucial fact of change. We have all had the experience of discovering that the
              person we were uncertain about yesterday turns out to be a close ally and
              friend tomorrow—and vice versa. This enlivening discovery of the new is what
              the “downloading” of past perceptions blocks.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Concept</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              developmental process of ego hardens further with the fourth skandha: “concept”
              or “mental formation.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">With
              concept, we now have a name for the kind of person Mr. Smith is—“good,
              pleasing”—and a series of names—“bad, unpleasant”—for the kind of person Mr.
              Jones represents to us. This is the realm of story lines and ideologies. This
              is the dualistic aspect of mind that we call “false intellect”—using fixed
              conceptual categories to identify ourselves and others.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              this realm of distorted insight, we begin cleverly deceiving ourselves based on
              snap judgments, clouded intuitions, yesterday’s news: “Oh, I see now: I’m this
              kind of person and you’re that kind of person. So we couldn’t possibly be
              friends. Good-bye!”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">We
              leave the spacious, open humility of not-knowing far behind and take shelter in
              a thicket of concepts.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">At
              this stage, we have developed sophisticated interpretations of ourselves and
              our experience, far beyond the basic “yea” and “nay” of feeling. This is the
              dimension of psychological explanations: “I am this kind of person, because
              that happened before.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Again,
              this is not to deny the power of previous causes and conditions in shaping the
              beings we have become. But the temptation is to solidify the flowing water of
              fresh insight into the frozen ice of fixed mental ideas. I repeat to myself
              over and over again—and to whoever is willing to listen—old stories of who I
              am, who I was, and who I am becoming (as well as who you are and why you’re
              that way). We leave the spacious, open humility of not-knowing far behind and
              take shelter in a thicket of concepts. Ouch!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Consciousness</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Finally,
              we discover the mental experience of the fifth skandha, “consciousness.” The
              accumulated momentum of the initial mind–body split, the positive or negative
              felt sense of others, and the labels of ourselves and our world culminates in a
              vivid display of emotions and thoughts.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">This
              skandha is the familiar stream of consciousness that we experience in everyday
              life, our mind-stream. Buddhist psychology breaks it down into eight separate
              consciousnesses. In addition to the familiar sense consciousnesses of seeing,
              hearing, smelling, tasting, and touching, Buddhist psychology adds a sixth
              sense consciousness of “minding.” Just as visual consciousness notices sights
              and auditory consciousness attends to sounds, this sixth consciousness of mind
              attends to thoughts and emotions. It also synthesizes and integrates the
              experience of the other consciousnesses into a coherent whole, like a skillful
              film editor coordinating image, sound, and discursive commentary.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Underlying
              these six sense consciousnesses, we may sometimes glimpse two more
              consciousnesses: a winding, subconscious stream of conflicting emotions and
              anxiety (the klesha, or “nuisance consciousness”) and even a hazy background
              awareness (the alaya, or “storehouse consciousness”) that we sometimes look
              back toward and call “I.” These underground currents are great instigators,
              bubbling up occasionally with old resentments and jealousies, fixated passions,
              and strongly motivated denials.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              skandha of consciousness completes the development of a deluded ego-sense. We
              now feel separate, independent, and unitary—even though there is ample evidence
              to the contrary.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Far
              from being single, unitary beings, we arise as a dynamic collection of physical
              and mental happenings.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">We
              are not separate from our environments. If we were, how could we breathe, eat,
              drink, sustain ourselves? Where did the language we speak and write and read
              come from? None of us is self-produced and independent, as our mothers and fathers
              remind us. And far from being single, unitary beings, we arise as a dynamic
              collection of physical and mental happenings, including breathing, sleeping,
              dreaming, and waking. We have emotional and physiological, skeletal and
              psychological aspects to our being, and although these occasionally conflict
              with each other, they also cooperate and harmonize.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">What You Can Learn from the Skandhas</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Insight
              into your own psychological processes—into how your mind works—is not an end in
              itself. The tradition doesn’t offer this teaching as mere intellectual
              knowledge or information. You are encouraged to use this map to become more and
              more familiar, through direct experience, with the processes you call “me” and
              “my mind.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Developing
              a harmonious friendship with yourself is a central part of the Buddhist path of
              awakening. These teachings on the five skandhas invite you into a deeper, more
              intimate experience of yourself. What do you find when you look into your own
              experience of body and mind? This isn’t about dogma—the point isn’t to confirm
              that the map is accurate or “correct.” Part of the point is to notice that the
              map is not the territory and never could be. (Imagine a map of Canada that was
              the size of Canada: how useless would that be?) You are invited to set forth as
              explorers of your own inner and outer terrains. Bon voyage.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">When
              you engage in this psychological exploration, one of your best companions will
              be a sense of friendliness toward yourself and others. Friendliness means
              taking these five mental processes not as signs of an inherent weakness or
              fundamental inadequacy but as aspects of your basic humanity. Through
              cultivating friendliness, you can experience the skandhas (as well as whatever
              else arises along the way) with a real sense of gratefulness and appreciation.
              Let me be more specific here.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">If
              you can simply feel your feelings as they arise, without rejecting them or
              telling yourself stale stories of why you are “right” to feel this way, then
              feelings emerge as highlights of being human, vivid signs of being alive.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              skandhas point, first, to healing the body–mind split. If you pay caring
              attention to body and mind as an actual experience, not just a distant “good
              idea,” then you’ve made a good start. This is traditionally called “mindfulness
              of body.” It’s a simple sense of welcoming and including your present physical
              experience—not exaggerating your body or denigrating it, neither praising nor
              condemning it. This is mind–body friendliness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              same goes for the other skandhas as well. If you can simply feel your feelings
              as they arise, without rejecting them or telling yourself stale stories of why
              you are “right” to feel this way, then feelings emerge as highlights of being
              human, vivid signs of being alive. You don’t need to act them out or repress
              them. This is spacious freedom. Beyond grasping and fixation, you allow your
              feelings to arise, be present, and go. You appreciate that life bubbles up as
              colorful emotions, as heartfelt experience. You appreciate being human.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Similarly,
              your thoughts and ideas can be seen as the liberating play of wisdom. If you
              notice your thoughts as thoughts, rather than confusing them with reality, then
              they become friends and allies, companions along the path. Instead of confining
              your consciousness of sense perceptions in narrow, tight boxes of “for me” or
              “against me,” you can open into a larger appreciation of seeing and hearing.
              You can taste the vastness of your world.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">On
              this journey, you see that both clarity and confusion are woven into your
              everyday experience of mind. The skandhas illuminate a fivefold process of mind
              grasping and fixating, engaging in a losing battle of ego against the world.
              Yet the same mental events can be the basis for a cease-fire, an entrance into
              non-struggle and luminous peace.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Each
              moment in the unfolding of your experience is an opportunity to welcome
              yourself, your feelings, your mind, and others in your world. The key to
              working with mind, to understanding its processes, is found in the innate
              warmth and friendliness of the mind itself. You don’t need a newer, better,
              super-improved body–mind. The real challenge is making friends with the mind
              and body you already are.</span></p>
