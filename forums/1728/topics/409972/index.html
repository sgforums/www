              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>Before any insights, one live 100% in a world view dictated by beliefs, ideas and concepts.</p>
              <p>Now, you are asking that question from that world view. There will be no answer that will be fully satisfactory for you from that perspective.</p>

              <p>What kind of Buddhism do you practice? Did you take refuge?</p>
              <p>Btw many vegetarians are very strong. The reason why you eat 
              until thin and bony is because, no offense, you do not know how to cook 
              good healthy vegetarian meals. You can eat very healthily if you know 
              how to cook good and well balanced vegetarian meals with all the 
              nutritions necessary for good health. All you needed was a vegetarian 
              cook book.</p>
              <p>Vegetarians are generally long lived (less risk of many 
              diseases), many vegetarian Buddhist monks and masters lived till a very old age (for example 
              the modern Chinese Ch'an Master Hsu Yun lived to 120 years old), have 
              better health, and are strong, provided they know how to cook good 
              vegetarian food.</p>
              <p>Being very fat puts you in danger of many diseases.</p>
              <p>Anyway, vegetarianism was never a requirement in Buddhism to begin with. I still eat meat.</p>

              <p>From here, I can tell that you have not fully understand Buddhism. That is why I always say those who convert to Christianity are those who do not understand Buddhism.</p>
              <p>It is a matter of time that you realise attachment brings miseries. I wonder do you understand what are attachment and detachment, if you do, logically you should understand this simple logic.</p>
              <p>I had posted stories of Christians born in ghosts realm. Today, I heard of another case of Christian born in ghost realm, her relative who is a Christian dreamt of her suffering in the ghost realm but did not mention or do anything. So, she let her non- Christian relatives dreamt of her suffering in the ghost realm, they did some prayers and it was then that her Christian relative mentioned about the same dream that she had.</p>
              <p>So, if you don't heed Buddha's advice to practice detachment, you are just heading to ghost realm. Remember, by then don't seek help from Chritians as they are unable to help you, seek help from Taoists or  Buddhists, at least they can help you.</p>
              <p>I swear to Buddha, what I said above were all true.</p>

              <p>If you are a good guy, you will think that everyone is a good guy like you as you cannot imagine or understand why someone can be so evil. Likewise, one will only think that others are satanic only when one is satanic and thinks that others are like him.</p>

              <p><br>just curious, what truth was exposed?</p>
              <p>I am vegetarian too... i became thinner it is true.. But i feel happier.  It is not necessary that Buddhist are vegetarians. Some Christians are vegetarians too because they love animals.  I think you shouldn't generalise by diet.  Buddhism is not about diet.</p>

              <p><br>when my frens start to want to go on vegetarianism due to sudden impulse or aspiration... i am usually quite against... it is better to be gradual.</p>
              <p>Firstly your family is going to object. Your social dining life is going to be affected. Frens need time to adjust.</p>
              <p>Secondly, if your taste buds are highly attached to good food, you will turn around quite soon. </p>
              <p>Thirdly, some body types will have health issues... like mine</p>
              <p>Fourthly, need time, research, tips from frens, and knowledge to know how to eat and stay in good nutrition-state...</p>
              <p>I always suggest, start with being vegetarian on the vegetarian days prescribed eg in Medicine Buddha sutra or on holy days... </p>
              <p>Or eat less meat, or choose your meat that kills the minimum life, or do much prayers for the animals you eat. </p>
              <p>Later on, after several years, then can slowly shift to full vegetarianism... but must know how to eat.. if your health is poor, parents/relatives are definitely going to have worries and anger at your choice and thus also develop negative feeling about your religion.</p>
              <p>One does not have to think that vegetarianism is compulsory when becoming Buddhist. And one has to be sensible to make a long-term shift, not just do things impulsively.</p>

              <p>Amituofo Take that,</p>
              <p>even heard some gold olympians of running, swimming and even weight lifting are vegetarian?!</p>
              <p>i agree with wisdomeye to go gradually, like for myself.</p>
              <p>over the years, i realised and learned from MCK that the most healthy or unhealthy food is not the food itself, but the mental attachment/grasping of food. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Greedy</span> eaters are the most canceric. ç—…ä»Žå�£å…¥ã€‚Eating is ok, it's the greed that's not okay. Don't go for the taste. We all favour the mouth, and hack care the stomach. The mouth might like it, but the stomach might not.  </p>
              <p>The most healthy food is eat simple and without greedy thought. if one can do that, even junk/dirty/rotten food can be healthy. But most people cannot to that. sorry this one need more practice. hehe..</p>
              <p>so ya, take it simple and without greed. u can choose nutritions like said above.</p>

              <p>Did you take enough food for your daily calories intake? What is your diet like?</p>
              <p>Buddhism is not about being a vegetarian. There are many reasons why Buddhist or <strong>Non-Buddhist</strong> choose to become a vegetarian. Reason 1. Compassionate for the animals being slaughtered. Reason 2. Being a vegetarian can actually be good for one's health. Reason 3:  Vegetarism can actually help the environment.</p>

              <p><br>Do you know your reasons of being vegetarian in the first place? Lets not just follow blindly.</p>
              <p>You can accept anything which when practise leads to unconditional love, contentment and wisdom which then lead to a happier and peaceful mind.</p>
              <p>You can rightly reject anything when you accepted and practised, leads to more anger, more greed, more delusion.</p>
