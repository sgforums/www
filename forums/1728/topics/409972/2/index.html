              <p>??? When did Buddha demand that a Buddhist to be a vegetarianism? I think the <strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><em>K.Sri Dhammananda, </em>has advised this matter on a precise manner in his book, "What Buddhists believe"</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: x-small;">Vegetarianism<br><br>One should not judge the purity or impurity of man simply by observing what he eats.<br><br>In the Amagandha Sutta, the Buddha said:<br><br>'Neither meat, nor fasting, nor nakedness, Nor shaven heads, nor matted hair, nor dirt, Nor rough skins, nor fire-worshipping, Nor all the penances here in this world, Nor hymns, nor oblation, nor sacrifice, Nor feasts of the season, Will purify a man overcome with doubt.'<br><br>Taking fish and meat by itself does not make a man become impure. A man makes himself impure by bigotry, deceit, envy, self-exaltation, disparagement and other evil intentions. Through his own evil thoughts and actions, man makes himself impure. There is no strict rule in Buddhism that the followers of the Buddha should not take fish and meat. The only advice given by the Buddha is that they should not be involved in killing intentionally or they should not ask others to kill any living being for them. However, those who take vegetable food and abstain from animal flesh are praiseworthy.<br><br>Though the Buddha did not advocate vegetarianism for the monks, He did advise the monks to avoid taking ten kinds of meat for their self respect and protection. They are: humans, elephants, horses, dogs, snakes, lions, tigers, leopards, bears hyenas. Some animals attack people when they smell the flesh of their own kind. (Vinaya Pitaka)<br><br>When the Buddha was asked to introduce vegetarianism amongst His disciples, the Buddha refused to do so. As Buddhism is a free religion, His advice was to leave the decision regarding vegetarianism to the individual disciple. It clearly shows that the Buddha had not considered this as a very important religious observance. The Buddha did not mention anything about vegetarianism for the lay Buddhists in His Teaching.<br><br>Jivaka Komarabhacca, the doctor, discussed this controversial issue with the Buddha: 'Lord, I have heard that animals are slaughtered on purpose for the recluse Gotama, and that the recluse Gotama knowingly eats the meat killed on purpose for him. Lord, do those who say animals are slaughtered on purpose for the recluse Gotama, and the recluse Gotama knowingly eats the meat killed on purpose for. Do they falsely accuse the Buddha? Or do they speak the truth? Are your declaration and supplementary declarations not thus subject to be ridiculed by others in any manner?'<br><br>'Jivaka, those who say: 'Animals are slaughtered on purpose for the recluse Gotama, and the recluse Gotama knowingly eats the meat killed on purpose for him', do not say according to what I have declared, and they falsely accuse me. Jivaka, I have declared that one should not make use of meat it is seen, heard or suspected to have been killed on purpose for a monk. I allow the monks meat that is quite pure in three respects: if it is not seen, heard or suspected to have been killed on purpose for a monk.' (Jivaka Sutta)<br><br>In certain countries, the followers of the Mahayana school of Buddhism are strict vegetarians. While appreciating their observance in the name of religion, we should like to point out that they should not condemn those who are not vegetarians. They must remember that there is no precept in the original Teachings of the Buddha that requires all Buddhists to be vegetarians. We must realize that Buddhism is known as the Middle Path. It is a liberal religion and the Buddha's advice was that it is not necessary to go to extremes to practise His Teachings.<br><br>Vegetarianism alone does not help a man to cultivate his humane qualities. There are kind, humble, polite and religious people amongst non-vegetarians. Therefore, one should not condone the statement that a pure, religious man must practise vegetarianism.<br><br>On the other hand, if anybody thinks that people cannot have a healthy life without taking fish and meat, it does not necessarily follow that they are correct since there are millions of pure vegetarians all over the world who are stronger and healthier than the meat-eaters.<br><br>People who criticize Buddhists who eat meat do not understand the Buddhist attitude towards food. A living being needs nourishment. We eat to live. As such a human being should supply his body with the food it needs to keep him healthy and to give him energy to work. However, as a result of increasing wealth, more and more people, especially in developed countries, eat simply to satisfy their palates. If one craves after any kind of food, or kills to satisfy his greed for meat, this is wrong. But if one eats without greed and without directly being involved in the act of killing but merely to sustain the physical body, he is practising self restraint. </span></strong></p>

              <p>Buddha teach us detachment because everything is impermanent, and attachment to impermanent object will cause suffering.<br>Even if you have very good karma, that makes you a CEO of a company, one day when you are no longer a CEO, no longer being visited and given smiling face everyday, no longer able to give instructions, you will feel very depressed.<br>You feel happy when you manage to convince people to believe your words, this is how attachment increase, one day when people disagree with your opinion, you will become angry.<br>Why a baby is happier than adult, because they don't have as much attachment as an adult.<br>All these sufferings is because of attachment to a impermanent object including money, body, fame, idea, relationship etc.<br>This is not just theory. This is something that happen in our lives.</p>

              <p>This universal intelligence spinning the earth, growing the grass and the nails, and expressing itself as this very moment of consciousness... this isn't something 'I' as a separate individual self could ever do, because the separate 'I' has never existed. It is a word that is powerless.</p>

                       other agent exists in the world. The nature of phenomena is created 
                      through me ... The very manifestation of existence itself depends on me 
                      ... I am self-arising wisdom that has existed from the beginning. I am 
                      the supreme source of everything, pure and total consciousness 
                      ...'Consciousness' means that self-arising wisdom, the true essence, 
                      dominates and clearly perceives all the phenomena of the animate and 
                      inanimate universe. This self-arising fundamental substance, not 
                      produced by causes and condition, governs all things and gives life to 
                      all things ... As my nature is unhindered and all-pervading, it is the 
                      celestial abode of wisdom and luminous space: therein abides only 
                      self-arising wisdom. As I am the substance whence everything arises, the
                       five great elements, the three worlds [i.e. the worlds of Desire, Form,
                       and Formlessness] and the six classes of beings [hell-denizens, ghosts,
                       animals, humans, Titans, and gods] are only my body, my voice, and my 
                      mind: I myself create my own nature ... The root of all phenomena is 
                      pure and total consciousness, the source. All that appears is my nature.
                       All that manifests is my magical display. All sounds and words express 
                      only my meaning ... </span></span></p>
