              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 1.231;">Buddhistdoor International Dorje Kirsten 2014-10-30</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: 0.65pt; line-height: 1.231;">After traveling the world for the
              last four years, the Jade Buddha has returned to tour the United States for a
              second time. Carved out of a single piece of polar jade that was discovered in
              Canada in the year 2000, the Jade Buddha weighs over 4 tons and stands 2.5
              meters high. It was modeled after the Buddha statue in the Mahabodhi Temple in
              Bodhgaya because the statue’s form, which is said to actually resemble the
              historical Buddha, Shakyamuni, is recognized by all Buddhist traditions. The
              Jade Buddha is the largest gemstone-quality Buddha statue in the world. Since
              the completion of its carving in 2009, it has traveled to over 14 countries
              including Vietnam, Australia, the USA, Canada, Germany, Sweden, Norway,
              Switzerland, France, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, Sri Lanka, and India.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: 0.65pt; line-height: 1.231;">The Polar Pride jade from which
              the statue is made is the largest gemstone-quality piece of jade found in
              living memory. Its carving into the Buddha statue was overseen by Ian Green,
              who spearheaded the project after his teacher Lama Zopa Rinpoche told him it
              was destined to become a Buddha that would “illuminate the world.” The work was
              done in Thailand, and took three years. It was completed under Lama Zopa’s
              supervision, and was consecrated by the Dalai Lama. Having an appeal for all
              schools of Buddhism, it has found itself at both Vajrayana and Mahayana
              Buddhist centers during its tour, and has so far been seen by over 7 million
              people.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: 0.65pt; line-height: 1.231;">Last month, the Jade Buddha was
              in the Seattle area, and it has now moved to the Samantabhadra Buddhist Center
              INC in Braintree, Massachusetts, where it can be viewed until 9 November. It
              will then travel to the Vietnamese Bhikkhuni Buddhist Congregation in San Jose,
              California, and will stay there from 13 November until 4 January 2015. Next year
              it will continue to travel around the United States, visiting Florida, Texas,
              Virginia, Colorado, Washington, Oregon, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and North
              Carolina, before heading back to Massachusetts. Eventually the statue will make
              its way to its final resting place at the Great Stupa of Universal Compassion,
              which is being built in Bendigo, Australia, by Ian Green.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: 0.65pt; line-height: 1.231;">A number of photographs taken of
              the Jade Buddha while on tour display spheres of light resembling Buddhist
              mandalas. These lights have appeared in all weather conditions, and even in
              photos taken inside the buildings where the Buddha was on view. When the
              photographs were analyzed, the lights themselves were seen to contain colorful
              patterns. These lights have appeared at every showing of the Jade Buddha so
              far.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; letter-spacing: .65pt;">The intent of the Jade Buddha
              tour is to inspire everyone who sees the statue, whatever their religion, to
              meditate on peace, whether in the world, in their relationships, or within
              themselves. Lama Zopa Rinpoche has said that the statue will “bring
              inconceivable peace and happiness and help prevent the destruction that is
              happening in so much of the world, including war.” Let us hope that it may
              indeed be a source of joy, inspiration, and positive motivation for all those
              fortunate enough to see it.</span></p>
