              When I was young, I debated with my Christian friend - If all Christians (who don't sin) will go to heaven after death. Then heaven got so many space to accomodate ? And all go heaven there will be no humans left on earth, no rebirth.
              
              Similarly, now I became a buddhist. Like millions of buddhist in Singapore, I too aim or at least hope to go to Pureland after death. Not that pureland is heavenly, but I just want to get out from the cycle of birth, old age, sickness and death. 
              
              My question is, just like the Christian's heaven, our Buddhist Pureland got enough space to accomodate so many buddhist who after death go up there? 
              
              I know normal human beings who are alive now can't answer my this question. But what about those with 3rd eyes ? Can you see your deceased buddhist friend/relatives going up to Pureland or did you ever dream of them in Pureland?

              Let's assume that there are many buddhist out there who have attained enlightenment, hence their spirit is pure and can go to Pureland (Yes, Pureland in buddhist concept is equal to Heaven).

              <p>easy question. :)</p>
              <p>pureland is also not a "place". like Nirvana, it's a puriest state of <strong>mind</strong>. hence how infinite samsara is, its how infinite pureland/Nirvana is. like Hua Yen Sutra states, the <strong>Mind-ground</strong>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic;"><em><strong>"What is the Pureland really? The Pureland is one's own stainless primordial awareness. If, from moment to moment, you regain and retain your own primordial enlightened nature: that is the Pureland. Everything comes from your own mind. Understand that, remain there: that is the Pureland."</strong></em></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>this is so also for the dream-like heaven and hell. or samsara in a sense. when u dream of a place, how big is it? is there a beginning in ur dream?</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm;">When I become a Buddha, all the living beings born in my Land will ultimately arrive at the position of only one birth before Buddhahood. Provided they vow to save living beings, they would be armed with great vows to teach and transform all the sentient beings, so that all will bring forth the faith to cultivate the Bodhi conduct and practise the path of Samantabhadra Bodhisattva. Even though such beings are being born in the other worlds, they will forever be free from the Evil Paths. May be some would like to speak the Dharma, some would like to listen to Dharma, or some may appear to have the spiritual power. Everyone of them will practise according to their wish, and none will be unable to accomplish them. If I am unable to accomplish such vows, I will not attain The Proper Enlightenment.</p>

              <p>Pureland is not equal to the Christian concept of an eternal heaven. </p>
              <p>Sentient beings don't go there to live 'happily ever after'.  They go there to continue cultivation so that they may attain Buddhahood. </p>
              <p>Rebirth in Pureland halts the cycle of birth and death in the sense that you stay in that realm for as long as it takes to attain Buddhahood; after which you may choose to come back to <em>Samsara</em> to save sentient beings from their ignorance (åº¦ä¼—ç”Ÿ).  It's not exactly a place where you just stay there forever to enjoy and live in bliss.</p>

              <p>Once when venerable Guang qing ask a lay disciple .Have you practised ?</p>
              <p>The lay disciple immediately say ,yes i have and i chanted 10,000 times .Ven Guang Qing replied in hokkien , oh ,so you can count the Buddha name ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What Ven Guangqing means is that Buddha name chanting is not supposed to count and start attaching to the numbers.the purpose of recitation is to cultivate the final unwavering thought(last thought before death)</p>
              <p>in seeking rebirth to Sukhavati.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If everyone start boasting how many numbers chanted of Buddha name ,then why arent many most of them in their deathbed able to passed away peacefully to Sukhavati ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the number we worldly people talk about is attachment, its different from the real merit of chanting and samadhi explained in all Buddhist sutra ..</p>

As population increases, it invites environmental awareness as more resources are involved in a small dot. More importantly is the mind of gracious, compassionate, patient, calm and peace of mind living together. It can impact the pleasant of the enviroment as it altered / harmonise directly the formula of cell into crystal formation - this is how pureland amitabha is developed from realization and actualization of this truth by Dharmastore Bodhisavatta then. The only way is to know one's love and meditative mind, and that buddhism can provide flawlessly. Another consideration is to increase the salary of Singaporean in many-fold so that if over-crowded, singaporean who lack of understanding can choose to move to other lovely country to live and grace on<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif">, like some wealthy Singapore family migrated to other country.  Future is always lovely, 2moro is better than today.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p>interesting thread... never thought of it before...</p>
              <p>there are actually many Pure Lands to go. But Amituofo's PL is recommended by all Buddhas. If u are reborn there, u can visit other Buddhas' PLs. Imagine Amituofo's one is like HQ which u can go other PL and consult Buddhas questions lol</p>
              <p>So can u imagine how vast it is...? More spacious than u can imagine. In the Amituofo sutra, Shakyamuni Buddha said there are countless sravakas (sheng wen), arhats, bodhisattvas like the sand of Ganges River (translation correct right...?)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But I can't help to bring in the picture of Avici Hell.</p>
              <p>Di Zang sutra stated... just one sentient being alone suffering there, the Hell is fully occupied. If many beings, the Hell is still equally fully occupied... really defies the understanding of physical space.

              <p>@LavenderWu,</p>
              <p>Forgot to add, some people without 3rd eyes claim to see Amituofo coming to bring the departed. Some claim to hear heavenly music, or unique fragrance that fill the air around the departed... all these are auspicious signs... </p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Buddha Amitabha appeared to instruct Avalokiteshvara on the practice, and empowered him to fulfill his mission. With this blessing, Avalokiteshvara aspired further "from each and every pore of my body, may I manifest Buddhas and Bodhisattvas according to the needs of all sentient beings. With these manifestations, may I liberate all sentient beings without leaving anyone behind. If I have of self-clinging, may my head crack into pieces". Buddha Amitabha praised him, "Well done. The Buddhas of the ten directions and three times and I have also developed the same enlightened attitude as you. We have made this aspiration and attained Enlightenment. I will assist you." Buddha Amitabha blessed his aspiration and empowered him further. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Manifestation of Six Buddhas in the Six Realms<br>Avalokiteshvara then radiated six lights from his body to the six realms of beings. Each light manifested as one Buddha.<br>The six Buddhas are:<br>Buddha Gyajin in the gods realm to subdue the pride of all gods and relieve their suffering;<br>Buddha Thagzangri in the demi-gods realm to subdue their jealousy and relieve their suffering of constant fighting and warfare;<br>Buddha Sakyamuni in the human realm to subdue their desire and relieve them from birth, old age, sickness and death;<br>Buddha Senge Rabten in the animals realm to subdue their defilement of ignorance, and relieve their sufferings of being hunted, eaten and tortured;<br>Buddha Namkhazod in the hungry ghost realm to subdue their defilement of miserliness, and relieve their suffering of hunger and thirst;<br>Buddha Chokyi Gyalpo in the hell realm to subdue the defilement of hatred, and relieve the suffering of extreme hot and cold and other intense sufferings.<br>Countless sentient beings were thus liberated.<br>Manifestation of the Thousand-Armed Thousand-Eyes Avalokiteshvara and the Six-Syllable mantra.<br><strong>After some time, Avalokiteshvara thought that he would have reduced significantly the number of suffering sentient beings. When he gazed with his wisdom eye from Mount Meru, he was disappointed to find that the numbers had not decreased. He radiated his lights to the six realms another three times to liberate the sentient beings. When he checked again, he was disappointed. With despair, he thought, "Truly as what the Tathagatha has spoken, space is infinite; so likewise sentient beings are also infinite. I have liberated so many beings and yet their numbers have not decreased. Samsara has no end. I must liberate myself.</strong><br>With this degenerate thought, he broke his bodhisattva vow. His head cracked into a hundred pieces. With great repentance, he cried to Buddha Amitabha and all the Buddhas for help, "I have not accomplished my purpose and sentient beings’ purpose, please help me." Buddha Amitabha appeared, collected the hundred pieces of cracked skull, and transformed them into eleven heads. He blessed ten of them with peaceful appearances and one with wrathful appearance in order to subdue those who could not be subdued by peaceful means.<br>Buddha Amitabha then instructed, "There is no beginning to samsara. There is also no end to samsara. You must benefit sentient beings until samsara ends</span></p>

The<br>“transformation-born” are beings that change form – they seem to<br>be there and then disappear. They seem not to be there and then<br>appear.</p>
              <p>They “come about in response.” In every kind of birth there is<br>a stimulus and a response. For instance, “The egg-born come from<br>thought.” There must be four conditions present for birth from<br>eggs to occur:<br>1. the condition of a father,<br>2. the condition of a mother,<br>3. the condition of individual karma, and<br>4. the condition of warmth.<br>With them, the egg-born come from thought. For example, a<br>mother hen sits on her eggs all day long; she gets unbearably hot,<br>but she won’t get up. Once a day she leaves long enough to defecate<br>and eat a little, and then she goes right back to sitting and thinking,<br>“Come out, little chicks. Hatch, little ones.” That’s why it says that<br>the egg-born come from thought.<br>“The womb-born are due to emotion, the moisture-born<br>arise from union.” Moisture-born beings can come about from two<br>conditions:<br>1. the condition of sunlight, and<br>2. the condition of moisture.</p>
              <p>“Transformations occur through separation.” These beings are<br>created from karma alone and are changeable. They appear and<br>disappear; disappear and appear. Transformation is attributable to a<br>strong desire for the new and a dislike for the old, hence it occurs<br>through separation.</p>
              <p>Sutra:<br>“Emotion, thought, union, and separation go through<br>further changes, and from all the karma received one either<br>rises or sinks. From these causes and conditions comes the<br>continuity of living beings.</p>
              <p>Commentary:<br>“Emotion, thought, union, and separation go through<br>further changes.” There is a combined interaction involving<br>change, over and over again. “And from all the karma received<br>one either rises or sinks.” From the retribution undergone, beings<br>vary from birds in the air to fish in the sea. “From these causes<br>and conditions comes the continuity of living beings.”Living<br>beings are those receiving twelve kinds of rebirth:<br>1. those born from wombs,<br>2. those born from eggs,<br>3. those born from moisture,<br>4. those born by transformation,<br>5. those born with form,<br>6. those born without form,<br>7. those born with thought,<br>8. those born without thought,<br>9. those born not totally with form,<br>10. those born not totally without form,<br>11. those born not totally with thought, and<br>12. those born not totally without thought.<br>This is the ceaseless continuation of living beings. First we<br>discussed the continuity of the world. Next we have discussed the<br>continuity of living beings.</p>
