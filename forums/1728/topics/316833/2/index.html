              The story below is extracted from http://linletkyalsin.blogspot.com/2008/05/blog-post_9574.html
              
              The prediction by juntas master fortune tellers
              
              Though I don't believe in fortune telling and Yatayar (ways of averting
              misfortune), I still believe a bit. I believe the reason behind how the cruel juntas
              have been gripping on to their power must be due to Yatayars.
              A few days ago, I have received confirmed news from an insider. After dictator
              Than Shwe has known the prediction about his sunset time, he restricts
              on international aid teams coming in. The prediction given for Than Shwe is
              that "if a western soldier in full combat could land on Myanmar capital,
              then that would be the doom day of the juntas". Being unable to do Yatayar
              for protection against the prediction, international aid teams are not allowed in.
              Juntas fear about westerners being very eager to come for help.
              As of now, the priority should be about helping the cyclone victims. Politicizing
              about the current crisis should be kept minimal. Though cyclone is not started
              by juntas, consequences such as increasing death toll, failure to prepare
              precautionary measures, denial of international aids, failure to feed the victims
              etc are caused by the fear in juntas. And it is very saddening from humanitarian
              perspective.
              Right now, western aid teams are poising to get inside Myanmar. We, overseas
              Burmese should try our best to get these aid teams into help the cyclone victims
              as well as to bring about the doom day of juntas according to the prediction.
              This is the must-do task for us. In this era, I understand that there are people
              who believe and who don't believe. Acts such as juntas wearing traditional royal
              costumes and walking pig on pagoda are not being done as they have turned
              crazy. These are done to ensure their grip on power as instructed by their master
              fortune tellers.
              As there are more capable people out there, I would like to request you all to
              make this prediction comes true. Currently, it is the right time as westerners are
              really eager to go inside Myanmar to help. Please help disseminate the
              information. We must uproot these juntas who bring sufferings and torture our
              Myanmar people. It hurts me much to see Myanmar people being bullied by
              USDA members. Myanmar people have been in the most miserable stage in the
              world completely. As to get back to our golden days where everyone can have
              decent life, juntas must completely disappear.
              The prediction by juntas' master fortune tellers:
              "If a westerner could set his feet in Myanmar capital in full military
              combat in 2008, juntas' doom day will come"
