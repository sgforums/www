              <p>It is said in their website .......'While the candle is burning, the monk adopted by you will on a daily basis, for 49 days, chants on your behalf to help purify the karma of body, speech and mind. This practice paves the way to invigorate your life through the inter-connection with spiritual values in chanting. Pujas are beautiful and powerful. Body, speech, and mind are all involved. Prayers and pujas involve reciting sutras, chanting mantras, performing mudras, visualizing Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, and offering water, flowers, incense, lights, food, music, etc. All these methods generate merit. Merit is necessary for good health, long life, happiness, worldly success, spiritual realization and good rebirth.' <br></p>

              <p>The abbot of this temple, Sek Meow Di, sounds familiar to me. I think I read about him in the newspaper but I can't remember what it was about.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, It is ok to go for altar candle service for immediate issue. However, as what bohirichi said it is a temporary solution. It is better to solve the roots of the problems by practicing according to Buddha's teachings than to solve the problem.</p>
              <p>I've seen some people, who do not know about Buddha's teachings,  seek the help of medium whenever they have problem The medium really helps them to solve their immediate problem but they seem to have different sets of problems every now and then. Almost every month, they have to seek the medium's help. This is not a long term solution. Think about it.</p>

              <p>Hi sue</p>
              <p>It is good to perform lighting candle act before the triple gems. However, nothing is more meritous than learning and practising the Dharma.</p>
              <p>Buddha last word to us was, "Depend on the Dharma, not the people."</p>
              <p>Recently I had an experience with an accquaintance who was a palm reader. He was quite famous for this. Hence I asked him to perform a reading on me. It was quite accurate in certain past incident. He even predicted my affinity with Guan Yin Bodhisattva. Overall was great. However, it loss accuracy when it come to the residence home portion. He predict, " I stay in a small unit." I smile and replied, " Nope, my unit is 2 time bigger." He was shocked. Because normally he is pretty precise on it.</p>
              <p>Anyway, through the incident I learn one truth. Dharma can be experienced and tested. The principle is timeless and it bestow result. I am rather grateful for the fact that I am able to know the Dharma in this life. I hope and pray the Buddhist pals in this forums will continue to excel in your practise to change the destiny too.</p>

The path to the cessation of suffering.</a></p>
              <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bookman Old Style', Bookman, Times, serif; font-size: 11pt;"> </p>
              <p class="paragraphheader" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bookman Old Style', Bookman, Times, serif; font-size: 11pt; font-weight: bold;"><a name="truth1"></a>1. Life means suffering.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bookman Old Style', Bookman, Times, serif; font-size: 11pt;">To live means to suffer, because the human nature is not perfect and neither is the world we live in. During our lifetime, we inevitably have to endure physical suffering such as pain, sickness, injury, tiredness, old age, and eventually death; and we have to endure psychological suffering like sadness, fear, frustration, disappointment, and depression. Although there are different degrees of suffering and there are also positive experiences in life that we perceive as the opposite of suffering, such as ease, comfort and happiness, life in its totality is imperfect and incomplete, because our world is subject to impermanence. This means we are never able to keep permanently what we strive for, and just as happy moments pass by, we ourselves and our loved ones will pass away one day, too.</p>
              <p class="paragraphheader" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bookman Old Style', Bookman, Times, serif; font-size: 11pt; font-weight: bold;"><a name="truth2"></a>2. The origin of suffering is attachment.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bookman Old Style', Bookman, Times, serif; font-size: 11pt;">The origin of suffering is attachment to transient things and the ignorance thereof. Transient things do not only include the physical objects that surround us, but also ideas, and -in a greater sense- all objects of our perception. Ignorance is the lack of understanding of how our mind is attached to impermanent things. The reasons for suffering are desire, passion, ardour, pursuit of wealth and prestige, striving for fame and popularity, or in short: <em>craving</em> and <em>clinging</em>. Because the objects of our attachment are transient, their loss is inevitable, thus suffering will necessarily follow. Objects of attachment also include the idea of a "self" which is a delusion, because there is no abiding self. What we call "self" is just an imagined entity, and we are merely a part of the ceaseless becoming of the universe.</p>
              <p class="paragraphheader" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bookman Old Style', Bookman, Times, serif; font-size: 11pt; font-weight: bold;"><a name="truth3"></a>3. The cessation of suffering is attainable.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bookman Old Style', Bookman, Times, serif; font-size: 11pt;">The cessation of suffering can be attained through <em>nirodha</em>. Nirodha means the unmaking of sensual craving and conceptual attachment. The third noble truth expresses the idea that suffering can be ended by attaining dispassion. Nirodha extinguishes all forms of clinging and attachment. This means that suffering can be overcome through human activity, simply by removing the cause of suffering. Attaining and perfecting dispassion is a process of many levels that ultimately results in the state of <em>Nirvana</em>. Nirvana means freedom from all worries, troubles, complexes, fabrications and ideas. Nirvana is not comprehensible for those who have not attained it.</p>
              <p class="paragraphheader" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bookman Old Style', Bookman, Times, serif; font-size: 11pt; font-weight: bold;"><a name="truth4"></a>4. The path to the cessation of suffering.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bookman Old Style', Bookman, Times, serif; font-size: 11pt;">There is a path to the end of suffering - a gradual path of self-improvement, which is described more detailed in the<a style="color: #666666; text-decoration: none;" href="http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism/eightfoldpath.html">Eightfold Path</a>. It is the middle way between the two extremes of excessive self-indulgence (hedonism) and excessive self-mortification (asceticism); and it leads to the end of the cycle of rebirth. The latter quality discerns it from other paths which are merely "wandering on the wheel of becoming", because these do not have a final object. The path to the end of suffering can extend over many lifetimes, throughout which every individual rebirth is subject to karmic conditioning. Craving, ignorance, delusions, and its effects will disappear gradually, as progress is made on the path.</p>
