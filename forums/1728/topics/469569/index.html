              <p><span style="font-size: small;">From Piya Tan<br><br>Every Wednesday at 7.15 pm (TMC sutta study 
              with guided meditation): see end of email.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Free 
              Buddhism<br><br></span></strong>American author, philosopher, neuroscientist, and 
              founder CEO of Project Rea­son, Sam Harris, in his thoughtful article, “Killing 
              the Buddha” (2006), writes: <br> <br><a name="_ftnref1"></a>“There is a reason 
              that we don’t talk about ‘Christian physics’ or ‘Muslim algebra,’<a name="_ftnref1"></a> though the Christians invented physics as we know it, and the 
              Muslims invented algebra. Today, anyone who emphasizes the Christian roots of 
              phy­sics or the Muslim roots of algebra would stand convicted of not 
              understanding these disciplines at all. In the same way, once we develop a 
              scientific account of the contemplative path, it will utterly trans­cend its 
              religious associations. Once such a conceptual revolution has taken place, 
              speak­ing of ‘Buddhist’ medita­tion will be synonymous with a failure to 
              assimilate the changes that have occurred in our under­standing of the human 
              mind.”[1] <br> <br>Harris champions what is becoming a viable and valuable 
              reality today -- “contemplative science” -- that is how Buddhism should be 
              accepted today, shorn of all its religiosity. I fully agree with Harris that 
              such a contemplative science would bring great and broad benefits to the world 
              as physics and algebra (just to mention the examples he has given) have done. 
              However, let us explore deeper the significance of tak­ing Buddhism as such a 
              “contemplative science.”<br> <br>In his best-seller, <em>The End of Faith: 
              Religion, Terror, and the Future of Reason</em> (2004), Harris criticizes 
              org­anized religion, the clash between religious faith and rational thought, and 
              the problems of tolerance towards religious fundamentalism. In 2006, he 
              published the book <em>Letter to a Christian Nation</em>, a res­ponse to 
              criticisms of <em>The End of Faith</em>. This was followed by <em>The Moral 
              Landscape</em> (2010), on the science of morality, then his long-form essay 
              <em>Lying</em> (2011), and the short book <em>Free Will</em> (2012).<br> <br>Harris 
              is a well-known contemporary critic of religion and proponent of scientific 
              skepticism and the "New Atheism." If we see history as a human struggle against 
              the abuses and domination of religion (especially the God-religions and churched 
              Buddhism), and the rise of scientific knowledge and the free world, then Sam 
              Harris is one of its key proponents. It is on account of the wisdom and courage 
              of peo­ple like Sam Harris, over the centuries, that we today are freer and 
              wiser to reject religious evangelism, dogmas and superstitions, for more 
              meaningful and liber­ated ways of life that respect human dignity and life as a 
              whole.<br> <br><a name="_ftnref2"></a>Most of us would generally agree with Harris 
              that “it is as yet undetermined what it means to be human, because every facet 
              of our culture -- and even our biology itself -- remains open to innovation and 
              in­sight” (2006). However, those of us familiar with the early Buddhist training 
              in moral virtue would know that to be human is to respect life, live it as 
              happily and freely as possible, valuing truthfulness, and keep­­ing the mind 
              truly calm and clear.[2]<br> <br>Not everyone, however, knows the workings of 
              the mind, even our own. But we know enough, Harris declares, “to say that the 
              God of Abraham is not only unworthy of the immensity of creation; he is 
              un­worthy even of man...  We need to understand how the mind can transform 
              itself from a mere reservoir of greed, hatred, and delusion into an instrument 
              of wisdom and compassion. Students of the Buddha are very well placed to further 
              our understanding on this front, but the religion of Buddhism currently stands 
              in their way.” (2006)<br><strong> <br></strong>Some might argue that the Buddhist 
              tradition is the richest source of contemplative wisdom that any civilization 
              has produced. In a world that has long been terrorized by fratricidal Sky-God 
              religions, the ascendance of Buddhism would surely be a welcome development. But 
              this will not happen. There is no reason whatsoever to think that Buddhism can 
              successfully compete with the relentless evangelizing of Christianity and Islam. 
              Nor should it try to, claims Harris. The reason is simple: it is a 
              self-destructive process, and we should avoid it at all cost. <br><br>It is true 
              that many exponents of Buddhism, most notably the Dalai Lama, observes Harris, 
              have been remarkably willing to enrich, even constrain, their world-view through 
              dialogue with modern science. “But the fact that the Dalai Lama regularly meets 
              with Western scientists to discuss the nature of the mind does not mean that 
              Buddhism, or Tibetan Buddhism, or even the Dalai Lama’s own lineage, is 
              uncontaminated by religious dogmatism.”<br> <br>Indeed, charges Harris, there 
              are ideas in Buddhism that are “so incredible as to render the dogma of the 
              virgin birth [of Christianity] plausible by comparison.” Even among Western 
              Buddhists, there are college-educated men and women who apparently believe that 
              Guru Rinpoche [Padmasambhava] was actually born from a <em>lotus!</em> Many 
              Buddhists even believe that merit or good can be transferred (what about demerit 
              and bad?). This is not the spiritual breakthrough that civilization has been 
              waiting for all these many centuries, laments Harris.<br> <br>The Buddha’s 
              wisdom is today trapped within the religion of Buddhism. Even in the West, where 
              scien­tists and Buddhist contemplatives now collaborate in exploring the effects 
              of meditation on the brain and on mental health, Buddhism remains “an utterly 
              parochial concern.” While it may be true enough to say (as many Buddhists 
              allege) that “Buddhism is not a religion,” most Buddhists worldwide simply 
              prac­tise it as such, in naive, petitionary, and superstitious ways as in any 
              other religion. To speak of “Buddh­ism,” as such, is to give a false impression 
              of the Buddha’s teachings, and will do little, even no­thing at all, to educate 
              or benefit civilization in our millennium. <br> <br><a name="_ftnref3"></a>The 
              Buddhism that we often see around us is mostly based on blind faith, like any 
              other religion. To be­come a genuine Buddhist, following the Buddha’s teaching, 
              then, is to accept Buddhism on sufficient evidence of wholesome benefits. [3]  
              The best way to do this is to be a Buddhist contemplative or meditator. Here, in 
              many respects, claims Harris, Buddhism is very much like science. We start by 
              avoiding certain negative behaviours and cultivating positive ones (moral 
              virtue), then using atten­tion in a prescribed way (medita­tion), we go on to 
              enjoy their benefits (wisdom and mental well-being). Buddhism is thus 
              scienti­fic inso­far as we are willing and able to question Buddhism itself, try 
              it for ourselves and enjoy its heal­thy and liberating bene­fits.<br> <br>Ours 
              is a shrinking world where a significant event in one location is within minutes 
              known and seen in other parts. We are so well connected today that our actions 
              are likely to have consequences well be­yond our society and time. What such a 
              world most needs right now is a means of embracing the whole human race as our 
              common moral community. <br> <br>For this, we need an open, non-tribal, 
              non-sectarian way of talking about the full range of human experi­ences and 
              aspirations. “We need a discourse on ethics and spirituality that is every bit 
              as unconstrained by dogma and cultural prejudice as the discourse of science is. 
              What we need, in fact, is <strong>a contemplative science</strong>, a modern approach to 
              exploring the furth­est reaches of psychological well-being.” It goes with­out 
              saying, argues Harris, that we will not develop such a science by attempting to 
              spread “American Buddhism,” or “Western Buddhism,” or “Engaged Buddhism.” Or, 
              any kind of prefixed Buddhism, we might add, because the prefix somehow 
              suppresses, even supplants, what it prefixes.<br> <br>If Buddhist methodology 
              (moral ethics and meditation) uncovers genuine truths about the mind and the 
              world -- truths like impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and non-self -- these 
              universal truths are not in the least “Buddhist” or religious in any way. (The 
              word “Buddhist” was never used by the Buddha or Buddh­ist scripture.) Most 
              informed meditators realize this, but most Buddhists do not. In clinging to 
              “Bud­dh­ism,” we miss what it is all really about. <br> <br><a name="_ftnref4"></a>Yet, only after being truly Buddhist first, can we let go of 
              Buddhism.<a name="_ftnref5"></a>[4]  It’s like us­ing a raft or boat to cross a 
              danger­ous river: once we’ve<a name="_ftnref5"></a> crossed over, we do not need 
              the vessel any more. Meantime we need to board the boat<a name="_ftnref6"></a>[5] 
              and keep rowing in the right and safe direction.[6]   <br> <br>R292 Revisioning

              we should seek to understand and accept the facts (1) that all things (incl our 
              selves) are impermanent, (2) that we are capable of self-salvation or 
              self-awakening, and (3) that any effort to find solace of salvation outside of 
              ourselves (such as through beliefs, rituals, or vows) is superstition. See Piya

              <p>Personally I do believe that science will eventually progress to the point that the truths in Buddhism will simply become broadly accepted scientific facts. Not holding my breath though.</p>
