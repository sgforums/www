              <p>Life continues as before, but not a 'me' who lives. Life without a center. No more suffering, no more sense of contraction and limitation of being 'inside the body mind'. Inner and outer becomes one, one feels weightless, boundless, free.</p>
              <p>Eating still happens, daily activities continue to happen, but without the sense of a 'I' or 'doership'... rather the whole universe is making this moment happen.</p>

              <p>Those who do not know Buddhism, their purpose of life can be selfish. Earn lots of money, have a good life, etc.</p>
              <p>Those who do not know Buddhism but have a sense of a higher purpose may want to work on the welfare of other fellow beings and that may be their purpose. People like Mother Theresa, Gandhi, etc...</p>
              <p>Those who knows Buddhism and seeks liberation, liberation and the highest bliss of Nirvana is their goal and purpose.</p>
              <p>Those who knows Buddhism but does not seek only the Hinayana aspiration (which is only to seek one's own liberation/salvation), but also has the Mahayana sort of aspiration (to attain Buddhahood for the sake of all sentient beings) -- their goal and purpose is not just to attain liberation but to seek enlightenment and liberation for all other beings and attain the highest, supreme, unsurpassed enlightenment of a Buddha.</p>
              <p>It should be noted that someone with a higher aspiration does not necessarily reject those of the lesser aspirations... there can be many.</p>
              <p>For example one who aspires for Buddhahood does not mean he cannot seek his own liberation, but at the same time he does not stop at his own liberation and enter his personal nirvana.</p>
              <p>Those who seek Nirvana also does not mean he cannot work on his worldly aspiration of helping other beings in the worldly sense.</p>
              <p>And those who seek to help other beings does not mean he necessarily neglects his own health, wealth, career, etc.</p>

              <p>seyKai, have you ever heard people described someone compassionate as selfless? Or some musicians and artists, when they are focusing on their masterpiece, they temporarily forget about their own existence? (å¿˜æˆ‘) So selflessness is not so scary after all.</p>
              <p>It is the habit of clinging to this concept of "I" that suffering arise. For example, if someone starts to attack me by words, it seems "natural" that I get hurt and I feel angry if I have very big ego. What Buddhism is saying is that you have a choice, you can choose not to get hurt, not to be angry, not clinging to your ego.</p>

              <p>It is not a belief, and I have friends and teachers who have already attained enlightenment and liberation.</p>

              <p>Lying and cheating is bad karma, so please try to refrain from that as much as possible. I don't think we can't make a living without lying and cheating.</p>
              <p>E.g. If you sell something at $1 per 100gm, please sell it at the correct amount. Don't cheat by giving only 95gm or less. Don't create immense bad karma for a bit more money.</p>

              <p>Also, if you ask these enlightened people to talk about their enlightenment, some or most of them would be willing to talk about it. Even if they don't announce it in public.

              <p>Buddhism is about the truth of suffering, the cause of suffering, the way and path out of suffering, and the end of suffering and attainment of the highest bliss. (4 noble truths)</p>
              <p>So it contains teachings/view, path (practice), and fruition.</p>

              <p>Wisdom comes from first learning the teaching, then practicing and realising it for yourself.</p>
              <p>One can admit one's enlightenment so that others feel confident that they can achieve it too. It's not an ego thing. The Buddha himself proclaimed that he was awakened and so did many other enlightened beings. If nobody proclaim his own awakening, then Buddhism might be mistaken as impossible or impractical and nobody will have confidence. Also it helps to know who is awaken: then you know who to share notes and learn from.</p>
              <p>Ignorance (not knowing our true nature, clinging to self) is suffering, but you don't know it. If you know that ignorance is causing suffering you'll let go... but this knowledge will not come through theory but through diligent bare mindfulness of our experience.</p>
