              <p>In <a title="Buddhism" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, <strong>anattÄ�</strong> (<a class="mw-redirect" title="PÄ�li" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C4%81li">PÄ�li</a>) or <strong>anÄ�tman</strong> (<a title="Sanskrit" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>) refers to the notion of "not-self". One scholar describes it as "meaning non-selfhood, the <a class="mw-redirect" title="Absence" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absence">absence</a> of limiting self-<a title="Identity (philosophy)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_%28philosophy%29">identity</a> in people and things."<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatta#cite_note-0"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> In the Pali suttas and the related Ä�gamas (referred to collectively below as the <a class="mw-redirect" title="Nikayas" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikayas">nikayas</a>), the agglomeration of constantly changing physical and mental constituents ("<a class="mw-redirect" title="Skandhas" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skandhas">skandhas</a>")
              comprising a human being is thoroughly analyzed and stated not to
              comprise an eternal, unchanging self (often denoted "Self"). In the <em>Nikayas</em>, the Buddha repeatedly emphasizes not only that the five <em><a class="mw-redirect" title="Skandhas" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skandhas">skandhas</a></em> of living being are "not-self", but that clinging to them as if they were an immutable self or <a title="Soul" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul">soul</a> (<em><a class="mw-redirect" title="Atman (Buddhism)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atman_%28Buddhism%29">Ä�tman</a></em>) gives rise to unhappiness.</p>
              <p>The <em>anatta</em> doctrine is not a type of <a title="Materialism" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialism">materialism</a>.
              Buddhism does not necessarily deny the existence of mental phenomena
              (such as feelings, thoughts, and sensations) that are distinct from
              material phenomena.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatta#cite_note-1"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Thus, the conventional translation of <em>anatta</em> as "no-soul"<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatta#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> can be misleading. If the word "soul" refers to a non-bodily component
              in a person that can continue in some way after death, then Buddhism
              does not deny the existence of a soul.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatta#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> Instead, Buddhism denies the existence of a permanent entity that
              remains constant behind the changing bodily and non-bodily components
              of a living being. Reportedly, the Buddha reprimanded a disciple who
              thought of consciousness as a permanent substance within a person.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatta#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> Just as the body changes from moment to moment, so thoughts come and go; and according to the <em>anatta</em> doctrine, there is no permanent conscious substance that experiences these thoughts, as in <a title="Cartesianism" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesianism">Cartesianism</a>: rather, conscious thoughts simply arise and perish with no "thinker" behind them.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatta#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>. When the body dies, the incorporeal mental processes continue and are reborn in a new body.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatta#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> Because the mental processes are constantly changing, the new being is
              neither exactly the same as, nor completely different from, the being
              that died.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatta#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>Although Buddhism rejects the notion of a permanent self, it does
              not reject the notion of an empirical self (composed of constantly
              changing physical and mental phenomena) that can be conveniently
              referred to with words such as "I", "you", "being", "individual", etc.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatta#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> Early Buddhist scriptures describe an enlightened individual as someone
              whose changing, empirical self is highly developed. According to
              Buddhist teachings, this <a title="Phenomenon" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon">phenomenon</a> should not, either in whole or in part, be <a title="Reification (fallacy)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reification_%28fallacy%29">reified</a>, either in affirmation or denial. The Buddha rejected the latter metaphysical assertions as <a class="mw-redirect" title="Ontological" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontological">ontological</a> theorizing that binds one to suffering.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatta#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>Some Mahayana Buddhist sutras and tantras present Buddhist teachings on <a class="mw-redirect" title="Shunyata" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunyata">emptiness</a> using positive language by positing the ultimate reality of the "true
              self" (atman). In these teachings the word is used to refer to each
              being's inborn potential to realize Buddhahood through Buddhist
              practices, and future status as a Buddha.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatta#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> This teaching, which is <a title="Soteriology" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soteriology">soteriological</a> rather than theoretical, portrays this potential or aspect as undying.</p>
              <p>Anatta, along with <em><a title="Dukkha" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukkha">dukkha</a></em> (suffering/unease) and <em><a class="mw-redirect" title="Anicca" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anicca">anicca</a></em> (impermanence), is one of the three <a class="mw-redirect" title="Dharma seals" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharma_seals">dharma seals</a>, which, according to Buddhism, characterise all <a class="mw-redirect" title="Sankhara" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankhara">conditioned phenomena</a>.</p>

              <div>The following article 'Anatta and Meditation' is an article that Thusness recommended me as being quite a good article on anatta. However, the author still sees Anatta as a stage of experience rather than a dharma seal/ever-present characteristic of reality. Nevertheless, the experience is there, which means the experience is non-dual... and for a beginner it is a good understanding and description. Until one realizes that it is a seal. For that to happen, insight must arise. What is the difference between seeing Anatta as a stage and as a seal? </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>When a person says that I have gone beyond the experiences from ‘I hear
                              sound’ to a stage of ‘becoming sound’, he is mistaken. When it is taken
                              to be a stage, it is illusory. For in actual case, there is and always
                              is only sound when hearing; never was there a hearer to begin with.
                              Nothing attained for it is always so. This is the seal of no-self.</div>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">This article aims 
                                          to describe how the central Buddhist doctrine of <em>anatta </em>or 
                                          ‘egolessness’ relates to meditative practice and experience, through 
                                          a survey of meditative teachings by medieval and contemporary meditation 
                                          masters across various Buddhist traditions – Theravada, Zen, and Tibetan 
                                          Buddhism. A personal account of how <em>anatta </em>and meditation are 
                                          related in the experience of the author follows. The twin approach 
                                          of contemporary textual study and personal phenomenological investigation 
                                          may prove to be a helpful methodology in the elucidation of this most 
                                          enigmatic, and perhaps, most controversial teaching of the historical 
                                          Buddha. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"><strong>Meditation 
                                          Teachers on <em>Anatta</em></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"><em>Anatta </em>often 
                                          translated in English as ‘non-self’ or ‘egolessness’, is regarded 
                                          by both Buddhist practitioners and scholars alike as being the essential 
                                          kernel of the vast edifice of Buddhist thought and practice. The title 
                                          of <em>Anatta-vadi</em> conferred upon the Buddha by Theravada Buddhists, 
                                          the elevated status accorded to the huge collection of <em>prajnaparamita</em> or<em> </em>‘perfection of wisdom’ texts, which focusses emphatically 
                                          on the idea of <em>sunyata </em>or ‘emptiness’, and the testimonies 
                                          of meditation teachers across the various Buddhist traditions, all 
                                          bear witness to the centrality of the doctrine of <em>anatta. </em>In 
                                          particular, Buddhist meditators have often described <em>anatta </em>as 
                                          the single most profound discovery of the Buddha, and that an insight 
                                          into <em>anatta </em>is crucial for attaining that utter liberation 
                                          of the mind which is the <em>summum bonum </em>of Buddhist praxis. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">In the Theravada 
                                          or ‘Way of the Elders’ tradition, a very important doctrine is that 
                                          of the Three Characteristics of Existence, namely <em>anicca </em>(impermanence), 
                                          <em>dukkha</em> (unsatisfactoriness), and <em>anatta </em>(non-self). 
                                          Both in theory and practice, insight into the Three Characteristics 
                                          is considered of paramount importance in the realization of <em>nibbana,</em> the ultimate state of freedom from all suffering. Nyanaponika describes 
                                          the heart of Buddhist meditation as the simple but effective method 
                                          of <em>bare attention</em>, which he defines as ‘the clear and single-minded 
                                          awareness of what actually happens to us and in us, at the successive 
                                          moments of perception’. Bare attention consists in the bare and exact 
                                          registering of the object of perception through the six senses (eyes, 
                                          ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind) before associative and abstract 
                                          thinking takes place. Sustained and diligent application of bare attention 
                                          to the four domains of mindfulness, namely the body, feelings, mind, 
                                          and mental objects, is thought to lead the meditator to the realization 
                                          that nowhere behind or within the psychophysical continuum can any 
                                          individual agent or abiding entity called the ‘self’ be detected. 
                                          Nyanaponika also emphasizes the usefulness of <em>anapanasati </em>or 
                                          mindfulness of breathing in enabling the meditator to see the conditioned 
                                          nature of the body, by virtue of the very fact that the breathing 
                                          process is dynamic, essentially linked to existence, and dependent 
                                          on the efficient functioning of certain organs. The nature of the 
                                          body as activated by impersonal processess, and thus without any substance, 
                                          thus becomes evident.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Dhiravamsa, another 
                                          contemporary meditation teacher in the Theravada tradition, advocates 
                                          the practice of non-attached awareness, which consists in the dynamic 
                                          and alert observation of all sensations, emotions, and thoughts. He 
                                          emphasizes the need to spontaneously observe and investigate one’s 
                                          experience free from the grip of authority – be they some teacher’s 
                                          words or one’s preconceived ideas. According to him, meditation can 
                                          be found by looking, listening, touching, tasting, talking, walking, 
                                          standing, in all movements and in all activities. For example, when 
                                          one is able to look or listen with great attentiveness, clarity, and 
                                          without a single thought, one can then experience the flow of awareness 
                                          that is without any reactivity, reasoning, and sense of self. In talking 
                                          about hearing with awareness, he says:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">If there were 
                                              myself acting as the hearer apart from the hearing, then "I am" 
                                              would be separated from "myself" which has no corresponding reality. 
                                              For "I am" and "myself" is one and the same thing. Hence I am 
                                              hearing.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">In this experience 
                                          of the non-duality of subject and object, there is a realization of 
                                          the absence of any permanent and independently existing ‘experiencer’ 
                                          apart from the experience. This state is characterized by tremendous 
                                          joy and bliss, a great clarity of understanding and complete freedom.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Ajahn Sumedho, 
                                          a foremost Western disciple of the famous Thai meditation master Ajahn 
                                          Chah, speaks about the silent observation of all that arises and passes 
                                          away in one’s body and mind in an open spirit of ‘letting go’. The 
                                          gentle calming and silencing of the mind is encouraged so as to create 
                                          a space in which to observe the conditions of the body and mind. In 
                                          particular, meditation on the body is done with a sweeping awareness 
                                          of all the various sensations that arise throughout the body, for 
                                          example the pressure of one’s clothes on the body or the subtle vibrations 
                                          on the hands and feet. This awareness can also be concentrated in 
                                          a gentle and peaceful way on any particular area of the body for further 
                                          investigation. The mind, consisting of perceptions (<em>sanna</em>), 
                                          sensations (vedana), mental formations (<em>sankhara</em>), and consciousness 
                                          (<em>vinnana</em>), is also observed with a silent awareness. As Ajahn 
                                          Sumedho says:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Investigate 
                                              these until you fully understand that all that rises passes away 
                                              and is not self. Then there’s no grasping of anything as being 
                                              oneself, and you are free from that desire to know yourself as 
                                              a quality or a substance. This is liberation from birth and death.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Another technique 
                                          advocated by Sumedho is that of listening to one’s thoughts. The meditator 
                                          is asked to allow mental verbalizations and thoughts to arise in the 
                                          mind without suppressing or grasping after them. In this way, what 
                                          is normally held below the threshold of consciousness is made fully 
                                          conscious. Verbalizations associated with pride, jealousy, meanness, 
                                          or whatever emotions are seen for what they are – impermanent, selfless 
                                          conditions arising and passing away. The thought "Who am I?" is purposefully 
                                          generated to observe its arising from and dissolving into the empty 
                                          space of the mind. By doing this, one realizes the lack of a substantial 
                                          and existing self within the processes of one’s thought. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Thich Nhat Hanh, 
                                          a Vietnamese Buddhist monk who represents a confluence of both the 
                                          Theravada and Mahayana (literally ‘Great Vehicle’) Zen tradition, 
                                          is a well-known peace activist as well as respected meditation teacher 
                                          who leads retreats worldwide on the ‘art of mindful living’. In his 
                                          teachings, Thich Nhat Hanh emphasizes the twin practices of ‘stopping’ 
                                          or concentration, and ‘observing’ or insight. In ‘stopping’, one practises 
                                          conscious breathing in order to come back to oneself and to regain 
                                          composure of body and mind. In ‘observing’, one illumines one’s body 
                                          and mind with the light of mindful awareness in order to see deeply 
                                          their true nature. Through the simple practice of consciously following 
                                          one’s breath and attending to one’s body in the process of breathing, 
                                          there comes a time when the breath, body, and mind very naturally 
                                          becomes unified. One is then ready to clearly observe and look deeply 
                                          into the feelings <em>(vedana), </em>internal formations <em>(sankhara</em>), 
                                          and mental objects (<em>dharmas)</em> that arise in the field of awareness. 
                                          In this process of looking, Thich Nhat Hanh says that to observe is 
                                          to be one with the object of observation. The subject of observation 
                                          is not one’s self, but the faculty of mindfulness which has the function 
                                          of illuminating and transforming. As Thich Nhat Hanh says:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Mindfulness 
                                              is the observing mind, but it does not stand outside of the object 
                                              of observation. It goes right into the object and becomes one 
                                              with it. Because the nature of the observing mind is mindfulness, 
                                              the observing mind does not lose itself in the object but transforms 
                                              it by illuminating it, just as the penetrating light of the sun 
                                              transforms trees and plants.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">This method of 
                                          penetrative observation leads one to realize deeply that the awakened 
                                          mind is not separate from the deluded mind, and that behind the illumination, 
                                          there is neither one who illumines nor one who is illumined. In short, 
                                          the observer is the observed:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">If we continue 
                                              in our mindful observation there will no longer be a duality between 
                                              observer and observed.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">In this respect, 
                                          Thich Nhat Hanh is articulating an insight essentially similar to 
                                          that of Dhiravamsa. But Thich Nhat Hanh goes further than that. He 
                                          says that there comes a point in time at which, when one’s observation 
                                          of this body and mind becomes sufficiently deep, one realizes directly 
                                          the essential interdependence of oneself with all beings and indeed, 
                                          with all things. In this experience of insight, which he calls ‘interbeing’, 
                                          there is no longer any separation between an independently-existing 
                                          self and all that is external to it – in fact, one <em>is</em> the world. 
                                          To experientially understand this profound truth is to have penetrated 
                                          into the core of <em>anatta.</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Shunryu Suzuki 
                                          (1905-1971), a direct spiritual descendant of the great thirteenth-century 
                                          Zen master Dogen, came to America from Japan in 1958. His teachings, 
                                          simple and direct, are focussed around the practice of the ‘beginner’s 
                                          mind’ – that innocence of first inquiry characterized by the attitude 
                                          which includes both doubt and possibility, and the ability to perceive 
                                          things always as fresh and new. Commenting on the practice of breathing 
                                          in <em>zazen </em>or sitting meditation, he says:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">The air comes 
                                              in and goes out like someone passing through a swinging door. 
                                              If you think, "I breathe", the "I" is extra. There is no you to 
                                              say "I". What we call "I" is just a swinging door, which moves 
                                              when we inhale and when we exhale. It just moves; that is all. 
                                              When your mind is pure and calm enough to follow this movement, 
                                              there is nothing: no "I", no world, no mind nor body. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Like Thich Nhat 
                                          Hanh, Suzuki emphasizes the correct practice of mindful breathing 
                                          in which there is no independent observer apart from the observed 
                                          – in other words, the experience of <em>anatta. </em>He goes on to say 
                                          that when one is fully concentrated on the breathing, there arises 
                                          the realization of the ‘completely dependent’ yet ‘independent’ nature 
                                          of existence, of which he says:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">When we become 
                                              truly ourselves, we just become a swinging door, and we are purely 
                                              independent of, and at the same time, dependent upon everything… 
                                              So when you practise <em>zazen, </em>your mind should be concentrated 
                                              on your breathing… Without this experience, this practice, it 
                                              is impossible to attain absolute freedom.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Suzuki also advocates 
                                          an attentive and focussed mind in everything that one does, without 
                                          being ‘shadowed by some preconceived idea’ or giving rise to ‘other 
                                          notions about other activities and things’. In the total engagement 
                                          of an activity with one’s whole body and mind, there is no room for 
                                          a sense of "I" or "other" – an experience of <em>anatta</em>. He describes 
                                          this kind of action rather poetically:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">When you do 
                                              something, you should burn yourself completely, like a good bonfire, 
                                              leaving no trace of yourself. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Yet another way 
                                          of practice which he teaches is what he calls a ‘smooth, free-thinking 
                                          way of observation’ wherein the mind remains soft, open and observant 
                                          of everything that arises in one’s experience. Whether an object arises 
                                          in the field of consciousness or not, the mind should remain stable 
                                          and undivided in its attention. In this way, there is no fragmentation 
                                          of experience and no clinging to one thing while rejecting the other 
                                          – an experience of ‘no mind’ or emptiness, in which the ‘self’ no

                                          for the realization of <em>anatta</em> or <em>sunyata</em> (literally 
                                          ‘emptiness’ or ‘voidness’) , as articulated in Mahayana Buddhism, 
                                          can be found in the different schools of Tibetan Buddhism. An intellectually-oriented, 
                                          analytical method is advocated by the <em>Gelug </em>school whereas 
                                          a direct, spontaneous awareness approach is taught and emphasized 
                                          by the <em>Mahamudra </em>and <em>Dzog-chen</em> traditions of the <em>Karma-Kagyu</em> and <em>Nying-ma</em> schools respectively. It is the opinion of the 
                                          author that while a discursive, intellectual analysis of the mind-body 
                                          complex and of the world, even when accompanied by strong concentration, 
                                          might result in a deep and refined understanding of the <strong><em>concept</em></strong> of <em>sunyata</em>, it nevertheless is a realization quite separate 
                                          from a direct <strong><em>insight</em></strong> into <em>anatta</em>, which involves 
                                          a non-conceptual <strong><em>seeing</em></strong> of <strong><em>what is</em></strong>. As 
                                          such, the <em>Mahamudra </em>and <em>Dzog-chen </em>approaches, rather 
                                          than that of the <em>Gelug</em>, will be discussed here.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Wang-ch’ug Dorje 
                                          (1556-1603), the ninth Karmapa or spiritual head of the <em>Karma-Kagyu</em> school, describes <em>Mahamudra</em> meditation as consisting of mental 
                                          quiescence (<em>samatha</em>) and penetrative insight (<em>vipasyana</em>) 
                                          practices. The two techniques advocated for settling the mind in mental 
                                          quiescence are the focussing of attention on an external object and 
                                          on one’s breath. A mastery of the above practices results in a state 
                                          of bliss, clarity, and bare non-conceptuality, which is then utilized 
                                          to investigate the mind. In penetrative insight practice, the settled 
                                          mind itself is scrupulously and silently examined to realize its true 
                                          nature. Following this, the meditator is asked to examine thoroughly 
                                          the moving mind or train of thought, and to recognize it for what 
                                          it is. If a fleeting thought does not arise, one is then asked to 
                                          deliberately emanate a thought for mindful investigation. Wang-ch’ug 
                                          Dorje further instructs:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">When you see 
                                              that the nature of thought is a bright, clear awareness, then 
                                              look to see whether there is any difference between the bright, 
                                              clear awareness you saw previously with respect to the settled 
                                              mind and the bright, clear awareness you see now with respect 
                                              to a thought. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Such an investigation 
                                          leads the meditator to realize the essential non-differentiation of 
                                          the settled mind, moving mind, and clear awareness, in which no inherently 
                                          existing self can be found. This allows full realization to be attained, 
                                          when thought-moments are consistently seen as ‘suchness’ and ‘emptiness’in 
                                          the course of one’s experience, thereby transcending their delusion-making 
                                          quality. The sense of an inherently existing ‘self’ dissolves with 
                                          this clear penetrating insight into the nature of both thoughts and 
                                          the quiet mind – the experience of <em>anatta.</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Another Tibetan 
                                          master, Sogyal Rinpoche, comes from the <em>Nying-ma </em>school which 
                                          had its origins in the great Tibetan saint Padmasambhava. In the <em>Nying-ma</em> tradition, the highest and quintessential practice is known as <em>Dzog-chen</em>, 
                                          a term which denotes both the simple yet profound practice for realizing 
                                          the intrinsic nature of the mind, as well as the state of primordial 
                                          awakening itself – the summit of one’s spiritual evolution. Sogyal 
                                          Rinpoche explains that the essential nature of the mind is a space-like, 
                                          radiant, pristine awareness, traditionally described as the state 
                                          of <em>Rigpa</em>. The whole point of <em>Dzog-chen </em>is ‘to strengthen 
                                          and stabilize <em>Rigpa</em>, and allow it to grow to full maturity’. 
                                          The essence of meditation practice in <em>Dzog-chen </em>is described 
                                          as follows: one mindfully and repeatedly attends to the space between 
                                          the arising of two thoughts, which eventually results in a luminous, 
                                          naked awareness that is free of conceptualizations and firmly rooted 
                                          in the present – that is the state of <em>Rigpa</em>. Following this, 
                                          another thought might arise out of that space, which is then immediately 
                                          recognized for what it really is without lapsing into further chains 
                                          of thought. In this way, ‘whatever thoughts that arise all automatically 
                                          dissolve back into the vast expanse of <em>Rigpa</em> and are liberated’. 
                                          The same spacelike awareness is cultivated with respect to emotions, 
                                          events in everyday life, and whatever activities one is engaged in. 
                                          Through a sustained and gradually deepening practice of <em>Dzog-chen </em>meditation, the state of <em>Rigpa</em> eventually becomes a continual 
                                          flow, ‘like a river constantly moving day and night without any interruption’. 
                                          In the state of <em>Rigpa</em>, be it continuous or momentary, all that 
                                          arises in the mind is seen to be the manifestation of its very energy. 
                                          In other words, the awareness and the object of awareness are no longer 
                                          separate and no subject called the ‘self’ can be found anywhere – 
                                          this is essentially an insight into <em>anatta</em>, perhaps in its 
                                          most subtle and mature form.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"><strong>Personal Glimpses 
                                          into Reality</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">In my personal 
                                          practice, the meditative technique that I have found to be most direct 
                                          and profound is what might be described as <em>choiceless awareness</em>. 
                                          In essence, it is no different from many of the aforementioned meditative 
                                          practices, especially those of <em>Mahamudra</em> and <em>Dzog-chen</em>. 
                                          It involves a whole way of living in which meditation, life, and activity 
                                          are meant to blend into one harmonious integrality. I do not claim 
                                          to have fully actualized this state but see myself as an earnest and 
                                          committed practitioner of this integral path. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">I have found, 
                                          over the course of my practice, the immense value of formal sitting- 
                                          meditation in initiating the momentum of stillness and observation, 
                                          which can then be made to continue throughout the day. Both during 
                                          formal sitting and in my daily rounds, I have found the practice of 
                                          awareness of thoughts to be greatly significant in yielding deep insights 
                                          into the nature of the self and experience. I compare this state of 
                                          awareness to an elusive guest that comes of its own accord and leaves 
                                          just as mysteriously, and that again emerges just as quietly as it 
                                          has left. Be that as it may, the presence of awareness is felt as 
                                          an ‘inner light’ which allows a diverse range of mental processes 
                                          to be ‘seen’ with clarity and openness. Thoughts are witnessed in 
                                          a subtle and undistracted manner to reveal their associative nature 
                                          and at times, their isolated randomness. At times, thoughts have been 
                                          observed to arise one after another in a continuous ‘stream’, each 
                                          image associated with the next, centred around a specific theme or 
                                          moving along in a specific direction. At other times, thoughts seem 
                                          to branch off in multiple directions through lateral connections between 
                                          seemingly unrelated images. And again, thoughts may arise in a slow 
                                          and discontinuous manner, with each image ceasing almost immediately 
                                          after it has arisen, to be followed after a pause by another related 
                                          or non-related image. Along with mental images is an almost ubiquitous 
                                          accompaniment of a running ‘commentary’ or ‘inner voice’. This somewhat 
                                          vague yet familiar voice appears to be ‘me’, the centre of ‘my’ being, 
                                          the place from where ‘I’ relate to the world. Perhaps the most important 
                                          discovery that I made in relation to this experience of meditative 
                                          awareness is this: while a strong sense of solidified ‘self’ separate 
                                          from the flow of experience is present in ordinary, unaware consciousness, 
                                          this very ‘self’ is starkly and refreshingly absent in the light of 
                                          awareness. It is as if there is only a luminosity in the midst of 
                                          experience, of thoughts and inner commentary, that defies reification 
                                          or solidification. Greater familiarity with this spacious state of 
                                          awareness allows me to contrast it to times when I have been unaware 
                                          or only partially aware. This act of contrasting and comparison resulted 
                                          in the realization that while in the state of unawareness, there is 
                                          strong volitional and emotional involvement in these images, in the 
                                          experience of awareness, this very involvement seem to be strikingly 
                                          absent. In their place is a quality of soft, relaxed equanimity. It 
                                          is as if the vortical interplay of thoughts, emotions, and volition 
                                          is the very source of this sense of ‘self’. In other words, the ‘thinker’ 
                                          <strong><em>is </em></strong>the thought(s), the ‘experiencer’ <strong><em>is </em></strong>the 
                                          experience!</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">The other practice 
                                          which I have found to be very beneficial is that of conscious breathing 
                                          as described by Thich Nhat Hanh. Conscious breathing has been of great 
                                          value in collecting the scattered energies of the mind prior to mindful 
                                          observation. Two distinct yet somewhat similar states of consciousness 
                                          that bear a relation to <em>anatta </em>have been experienced in the 
                                          course of this practice. The first resulted from intense concentration 
                                          on the sensations of moving air touching the tip of my nostrils as 
                                          I was breathing. With sustained attention, coarse contactual sensations 
                                          gradually gave way to subtle vibrations of rapid frequency. Persistent 
                                          concentration on these vibrations seemed to increase the intensity 
                                          and field of this experience; awareness of breathing seemed to have 
                                          totally dissolved into the ‘sea’ of vibration. In a sudden and unexpected 
                                          moment, however, the field of vibrations disappeared, leaving a pervasive 
                                          sense of ‘nothingness’ wherein no boundary between the ‘self’ and 
                                          the environment existed. I had lost all consciousness of bodily sensations 
                                          and thoughts, and awareness, which was initially clear and present 
                                          at the start of the practice, now became indistinct and blurred. It 
                                          was a state in which ‘I’ was not there at all, characterized by the 
                                          lack rather than presence of clear awareness. While this may be a 
                                          glimpse of <em>anatta</em>, albeit an imperfect and distorted one, it 
                                          never had the significance and clarity that the second experience 
                                          had.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">This experience 
                                          occurred, again, during the practice of conscious breathing. Following 
                                          a period of focussed attention on the breath, I started suffusing 
                                          the whole body with awareness, all the while keeping the breath at 
                                          the background of my mind. Awareness was light, open, and pervasive, 
                                          giving rise to a deepening sense of joy and ease. Gradually and gently, 
                                          it seemed as if the awareness, the breath, and the blissful sensations 
                                          of the body merged into one, leaving no solid ‘self’ or ‘experiencer’ 
                                          behind or within this flowing experience of clarity and non-thought. 
                                          It was a profoundly invigorating ‘non-experience’ which left a deep 
                                          and lasting impression on me. It made me think of its resemblance 
                                          to what Thich Nhat Hanh has described as the <em>anatta</em> experience. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Another interesting 
                                          experience that bear a relation to <em>anatta</em> occurred on a particular 
                                          occasion when I was at the beach. On this occasion, the sea breeze 
                                          was blowing with great strength and its extreme chill sent shivers 
                                          down my spine and through my entire frame. I felt myself tensing up 
                                          every single muscle I could find in my body. In that moment of need, 
                                          awareness arose in my mind and an immediate relaxation of the muscles 
                                          ensued. I decided to experiment with how far I could possibly relate 
                                          to this somewhat unpleasant experience with clear awareness. Gradually 
                                          I was able to let go of my resistance to the wind and to allow my 
                                          body to experience the strong sensations as they are, without interference. 
                                          It was as if the wind was allowed to sweep across and into my body 
                                          even as I stood there open, aware, and vulnerable. As I stayed with 
                                          it for some time, the separation between the wind and myself seemed 
                                          to vanish, and in a brief but unforgettable moment, I <strong><em>was</em></strong> the wind. The ‘self’ had merged into the wind, as it were, and my 
                                          sense of a separate ego had been forgotten.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">In conclusion, 
                                          the discovery of the lack of any permanent, inherent self that stands 
                                          apart from one’s experience is perhaps the most fascinating and freeing 
                                          insight that Buddhist meditators over the centuries have realized. 
                                          This insight contains many dimensions and varying degrees of profundity 
                                          and subtlety, which in a sense, can never be adequately described 
                                          with language. It is an understanding that has to come from personal, 
                                          existential realization. It is only when thought and all that is born 
                                          of thought, which is the self, has completely ceased to dominate and 
                                          to delude, that there comes the possibility of lasting, unconditioned 
                                          freedom – that is the aim, that is the goal, that is the culmination.</span></p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> I can relate to the statement "...the immense value of
                                      formal sitting- meditation in initiating the momentum of stillness
                                      and observation, which can then be made to continue throughout the
                                      day".  Just sharing some of my personal experience here and maybe you can share yours too.<br> </span></p>
              <p>My initial attempt in meditation practice is at best
              described as "on and off".  Continue for a week or two and then break
              for a month or two due to "no mood".  But for past two years or so,
              i've been able to cultivate the habit to practice almost every day
              (before bedtime in my case), with not more than 3 or 4 days of break
              per month due to tiredness, sleepiness after work.. etc. </p>
              <p>Due
              to more consistent practice, the "momentum" of the mindfulness or
              awareness seems to "spill over" into my post-meditation period. 
              Superficial physical meditative experiences like tingliing of the
              forehead/scalp/arms/jaw, slight pressure in ears needing release by
              "popping" .. etc can be felt randomly throughout the day as long as i
              have the chance to settle down and relax my mind even for a moment,
              compared with earlier days when such sensations only arise after going
              through the "attention to breath" process during formal meditation
              period. But i find the physical experiences can be quite
              annoying/distracting at times if it happens while performing mundane
              activities but i just try to let them be.  Wonder if anyexperienced meditator here can share their experience on how to deal with these?</p>
              <p>Mentally, from the "content" perspective, the mind seems to have
              longer intervals without being drowned out by internal chatter and
              random thoughts.  More frequency (but still not often enough) of
              "catching" thoughts as they arise but still not happening instinctively
              enough.  One big benefit of "catching" or be mindful of thoughts and
              subsequent actions for me personally is being able to recognize how
              bizarre, neurotic, destructive and self-righteous the ego can be. Which
              i sometimes feel like it's a "jekyll and hyde" inside one person, the
              "good" side observing the "bad" side.  But still, recognizing doesn't
              mean these habitual karmic propensities can be overcome easily, very
              intriguing indeed.  From the field of vision perspective, moment of
              relaxing the mind can sometimes result in literally increased
              brightness and starkness of those objects within the vision, like
              someone turning up the LCD screen is the closest analogy i can think of
              :-)  while there's a quiet awareness at the same time.</p>
              <p>I'm
              still figuring out these various experiences as a result of the
              "momentum" of formal meditation sitting but i think the best way is
              still to just let them be and not reify them to become obstacles.  I
              guess my 2cents worth is the most practical way to progress is still
              some serious sitting on the cushion.  Remember a teacher in a
              meditation class saying that even 5-10 mins of sitting everyday beats
              doing an hour in a single sitting a week.  Consistency is the key.</p>

              <p>Sorry I missed your reply initially.</p>
              <p>Habits are like that.... they have a certain momentum. They will keep coming up due to the force of that momentum, but only for so long.</p>
              <p>In my experience... when I rest in the state of awareness... awareness is like the host. It's not a real entity per se, more like a self-luminous open space that illuminates everything in it. Thoughts, habits, concepts, they come in. They are your guests. They want your attention. They want to make you think that they're your good friend, they want you to recognize and identify with them. They want you to follow them.</p>
              <p>If... as awareness.... we simply remain as such, not reacting to those guests, the guests have no choice but to leave on their own accord. We usually think that we're the controller and thinker of thoughts but really, each thought simply comes by its own accord, and also goes by its own accord if we let them. They're clearly seen and perceived but that's just it. Don't entertain those guests, they can only try to come back for so long before giving up.</p>
              <p>I'm trying to keep a routine meditation practice like you... and I certainly see the benefits of consistent practice in building up momentum in daily lives.</p>
              <p>About those tingling, pressure etc, I did have a number of strange experiences in meditation... though not exactly the same as yours. Like you I simply let them pass. Sometimes there's tingling and pressure in between my forehead. Sometimes there's a sort of very blissful tingles that spread around the body in intense waves. Sometimes the bliss is experienced in all sense doors when practicing mindfulness. Seeing and hearing itself becomes blissful. However I didn't really have "irritating experiences".</p>
              <p>Anyway I don't know what advice to offer you in this regards as I don't really have the same sort of experiences as you... maybe Thusness or Longchen can comment?</p>

              <h1>Sunyata</h1>
              <p>If love leads the devotee to the point of the extinction of 
                                  personality in the fire of truth, awareness can lead him to 
                                  the point of seeing that ego does not really exist, and hence 
                                  achieve the same goal of selflessness. Love melts the lover 
                                  into the ocean of truth, there remain no traces of an “I”. 
                                  Awareness, on the other hand, cuts through the illusion of 
                                  a separate identity. It exposes the lie of ego: that it exists 
                                  as a reality. Love melts ego away, while awareness is like 
                                  turning on the light and seeing that there is nobody there. 
                                  The outcome is the same in both cases, but the flavor of the 
                                  path is different. One is more emotional, the other more insightful. 
                                  The vocabularies of the two paths differ as a result. The 
                                  path of love seeks union with the Beloved, while the path 
                                  of awareness seeks the seeing of naked Reality. Just as prayer 
                                  is the central practice in the path of love, meditation is 
                                  the central practice in the path of awareness.</p>
              <p>Buddhism, more than any other spiritual discipline, has developed 
                                  meditation into a very fine art. Meditation is the center 
                                  and the heart of all Buddhist schools. Without meditation 
                                  there is really no Buddhism. And because of this Buddhism 
                                  has more of a mental flavor than most other religions. It 
                                  deals with the mind, and talks about the mind while the Sufis 
                                  talk more of the Heart. This does not mean that the Buddhist 
                                  Mind and the Sufi Heart are two different things. This is 
                                  because when Buddhists say Mind they don’t mean what 
                                  we usually understand to be mind. Also, when the Sufis mention 
                                  the Heart they don’t mean what we call heart. Still 
                                  the flavors of the two approaches are different because for 
                                  the lower levels of spiritual experience there is a distinction 
                                  between mind and heart.</p>
              <p>My experience with the Buddhist path starts with the practice 
                                  of Vipassana. It is the central practice in the Theravada 
                                  tradition. The practice is just bare attention, being mindful 
                                  of whatever my experience is. It is the main meditation practice 
                                  that I have done for years. This meditation is not an easy 
                                  practice by any means, although it sounds so. Just attending 
                                  to whatever I experience puts me right away in touch with 
                                  the first noble truth of Buddhism, the truth of suffering. 
                                  Almost all this time there is suffering in my experience, 
                                  whether in me or in the world around me. This suffering and 
                                  pain is a prime cause for the lowering of awareness in each 
                                  of us. We just want to avoid pain at any cost, and being asleep 
                                  and unaware is the most effective means. But we cannot avoid 
                                  pain without lowering our awareness. So cultivating awareness 
                                  brings me face to face with suffering, mine and everybody 
                                  else’s.</p>
              <p>But suffering and pain are not the only difficulties in the 
                                  practice of meditation. Beyond all the tricks and <a href="http://www.ahalmaas.com/Glossary/d/defense.htm">defenses</a> of ego lie levels of experience and consciousness that are 
                                  so subtle and so intangible that the meditator can be stuck 
                                  for years without even knowing it. An accomplished and experienced 
                                  meditation teacher is necessary, for this is a person who 
                                  knows the terrain from experience and can guide the person 
                                  who has never been to such places.</p>
              <p>Vipassana is called “insight meditation,” for 
                                  it develops and cultivates insight. At the beginning insight 
                                  is psychological in nature. I see my ego patterns, my ways 
                                  of handling my experience, my ways of avoiding reality, my 
                                  conflicts, my emotional problems, and so on. So it is awareness 
                                  of my personality or my ego. This is natural for this is what 
                                  is there at the beginning.</p>
              <p>However, awareness does not stop here. In fact, awareness 
                                  does not need an object. It can be just pure awareness. It 
                                  can be only aware of itself. So after a while, sometimes a 
                                  very long while, the content of experience starts to slow 
                                  and quiet down. With consistent practice my thoughts calm 
                                  down, my emotions quiet down, and I become very calm, very 
                                  still, very peaceful.</p>
              <p>The level of experience shifts now that there is enough stillness 
                                  for me to see more clearly. I become aware of this observer 
                                  in me who is paying attention. I cannot pay attention without 
                                  somebody paying attention to something. First I think this 
                                  is ordinary and okay. I learn, however, that this observer 
                                  is not really needed. The need for an observer is the need 
                                  for ego to have a center, to make itself into a center of 
                                  experience. So the observer is really none other than ego, 
                                  or part of ego. I start seeing that awareness cannot develop 
                                  more if it is centered. A center of awareness, an observer, 
                                  always limits awareness, for it is always aware through a 
                                  certain perspective, a certain point of view, from a certain 
                                  direction. This somehow has a cramping effect on me. I become 
                                  more tense instead of relaxed. An observer means there is 
                                  tension in my awareness, it’s not open and free. So 
                                  I turn my awareness backward and look at the observer. It 
                                  jumps around, and awareness keeps following it. But awareness 
                                  never finds any substantial reality to this observer. Regardless 
                                  of how much I look there is really no observer. Sometimes 
                                  it feels that it is only a thought, or an idea, or a place 
                                  in my body, or a belief in its existence, but never a consistent 
                                  identity. Not finding this observer makes it less real. The 
                                  center of awareness relaxes its tense grip on my awareness. 
                                  The ego-center, or the observer in this case, relaxes, spreads 
                                  thinner, and slowly dissolves into the stillness. There is 
                                  no more need for an observer.</p>
              <p>Only stillness is left—fresh, clear, crisp and empty. 
                                  Thoughts pass through it. Emotions pass through it. Experiences 
                                  pass through it. But the stillness stays immaculate, just 
                                  as the clear sky stays untouched as the clouds pass through 
                                  it.</p>
              <p>The winds blow<br> The rivers flow<br> The fires gnaw<br> But stillness is still still.</p>
              <p>There is a feeling of lightness, of joy, of freedom. There 
                                  is a sense of naturalness with a crystal kind of clarity, 
                                  just as snow-covered mountains feel natural and clear. Awareness 
                                  is no longer tense. It loses its attachment and active bent. 
                                  It becomes more passive, like a receptacle. Everything comes 
                                  to it. This is an important transition, for usually we exert 
                                  a lot of effort to pay attention, and <a href="http://www.ahalmaas.com/Glossary/l/letting_go.htm">letting 
                                  go</a> and just being feels scary. I always thought before 
                                  that I would miss seeing something if I did not actively look. 
                                  But I saw that I only created strain this way, and also this 
                                  active awareness is really more paranoia than anything else. 
                                  When I let go, and trust that awareness is naturally there 
                                  and I don’t have to make an effort, awareness becomes 
                                  bigger, brighter, and easier. It’s like seeing everything, 
                                  being aware of everything at the same time, effortlessly. 
                                  It’s like a panoramic view, but not from above, nor 
                                  from any direction. It’s like awareness is everywhere, 
                                  and nothing is missed or overlooked. There is no concern or 
                                  fear of missing something.</p>
              <p>All kinds of experiences happen. Many new regions and spaces 
                                  of the mind. Deep spaces, empty spaces, spacious spaces, soft 
                                  spaces, dark spaces, light spaces, joyous spaces. The space 
                                  itself, like stillness, becomes the object of awareness, and 
                                  awareness goes deeper and deeper into it. Sometimes there 
                                  is an uninterrupted space of stillness, or openness, without 
                                  thoughts or feelings or any kind of content. It’s like 
                                  a totally empty sky. Yet, slowly I discover that there is 
                                  something like an atmosphere when the experience is happening. 
                                  This atmosphere somehow colors the experience, gives it a 
                                  certain flavor, which is reminiscent of myself. This insight 
                                  cuts through the mental atmosphere and more openness manifests. 
                                  Awareness becomes sharper, brighter. There is a feeling of 
                                  less crowdedness, as if the atmosphere got thinner and lighter. 
                                  I learn that such mental atmospheres are the action of concepts. 
                                  I view reality through certain concepts. That’s what 
                                  I have been doing all my life, and so has everybody else. 
                                  We always experience reality through the filter of our concepts 
                                  of reality. Even when thoughts, feelings, and sensations subside 
                                  there remains the conceptual atmosphere through which I look 
                                  at reality. It’s like instead of reflecting reality 
                                  in a clear mirror, I do so using a colored mirror; so I believe 
                                  that reality has that color instead of seeing that it is my 
                                  mirror that is colored.</p>
              <p>At superficial levels the concepts are in words and thought. 
                                  Awareness can see through these easily. However, on subtler 
                                  levels there are mental concepts without even thoughts. They 
                                  are beliefs about reality taken as aspects of reality, so 
                                  they become imperceptible. They are very subtle for they are 
                                  all-pervading. It’s like being in a colored atmosphere 
                                  that colors everything in it with the same color, including 
                                  me. So I naturally believe that this color is an aspect of 
                                  reality. There is no way to discriminate this color, this 
                                  concept, this filter. The result is that reality is not seen 
                                  directly, perception is still veiled. Reality is still not 
                                  totally naked.</p>
              <p>Here prajna, or intuitive awareness starts to develop. It 
                                  is like a light that pierces through these concepts. Prajna 
                                  is sometimes called discriminating wisdom, for it has the 
                                  capacity to discriminate those subtle concepts that veil what 
                                  is. Development of prajna is really the aim of Vipassana. 
                                  Here, real insight starts to mature. It is no longer insight 
                                  into the dynamics of the personality. It is insight into the 
                                  nature of reality and the nature of consciousness. Gradually 
                                  prajna cuts through these concepts, like the sword of Manjusri 
                                  cutting through the veils, revealing reality as it is—naked 
                                  existence. No coloration, no filtering. It is direct perception. 
                                  It is the experience of Sunyata, the void.<br> Void does not mean empty of content like an empty container. 
                                  It is just what is without the conceptual framework on top 
                                  of it. It is direct perception without the naming or labeling 
                                  of reality. It is reality without the presence of ego, without 
                                  the presence of a center for experience. Experience is totally 
                                  open—it does not have a center or a boundary. Everything 
                                  is the same as before except that it is without my <a href="http://www.ahalmaas.com/Glossary/p/prejudice.htm">prejudices</a> or beliefs. It is itself now.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ahalmaas.com/Images/goldhub.gif" alt="Vispassana, Sunyata" width="30" height="29"></p>
              <p>I am sitting, meditating. Awareness of thoughts and feelings 
                                  is sharp. A thought or a feeling is seen the moment it arises. 
                                  It subsides quickly. Awareness intensifies. Not a thought, 
                                  regardless of how subtle, escapes it. Yet there is no effort, 
                                  there is no going after objects of awareness. There is a feeling 
                                  of tremendous energy in my body that shoots up to the crown 
                                  of the head. Here I open my eyes. Awareness is intense, clear. 
                                  No ego is left. Sunyata prevails. There is only what is. Everything 
                                  in the room looks as if I am seeing it for the first time. 
                                  It shines with its own essence. Everything is just what it 
                                  is, and it is totally complete in its nakedness. The lamp 
                                  is totally packed with lampness. The music is just music, 
                                  absolutely, and it is beautiful. Everything is as significant 
                                  as everything else. A drop of water, with its own intrinsic 
                                  nature, expresses the truth of reality.</p>
              <p>A hanging drop<br> On the verge of extinction<br> Ready for the infinite<br> Without expecting<br> Small and itself<br> Totally existing<br> Reality<br> And reality’s expression.</p>
              <p>Virgin freshness<br> Vibrant purity<br> Here now being<br> At the door of eternity.<br> Clear as a crystal<br> In stillness<br> Cleansing<br> The light.<br> An insignificant drop<br> Of ordinary water<br> A mudra<br> Of reality</p>
              <p>It is itself<br> Yet it is the truth<br> It is finite<br> Yet the eye of infinity.</p>
              <p>Totally empty<br> Totally full<br> A fair piece<br> Of the ineffable.</p>
              <p>Everything shines with its own <a href="http://www.ahalmaas.com/Glossary/s/suchness.htm">suchness</a>. 
                                  Just naked existence of what is.</p>
              <p>Every now and then “I” pops out, creates itself 
                                  as if out of nowhere and claims the experience. Ego materializes 
                                  as an identity, as a center. This interrupts the direct perception, 
                                  and sunyata is no longer pure. It becomes more like interrupted 
                                  intervals of sunyata, the interruption made by ego popping 
                                  its head out and saying, “Here I am.” So I start 
                                  writing.</p>
              <p>Everything I think or do is to create an “I” 
                                  that does not exist. Not that it is better if it did not exist, 
                                  but that is the reality: “I” does not exist. Reality 
                                  just is, nothing. If anything, then it is me which prajna 
                                  alone can cut away. What is left is a thought, or a thought 
                                  looking at a thought. A feeling. A car driving by.</p>
              <p>My friend Ron. I feel I want to tell Ron. It is important 
                                  for me. So back to me. From sunyata to me.</p>
              <p>So, no matter what I say, I will just come back to me, and 
                                  since me, as “me,” is only a creation of “me,” 
                                  .... who said that?</p>
              <p>So.</p>
              <p>This is funny. I want to say that I know what sunyata is, 
                                  but where? It’s all gone, the moment I have this thought.</p>
              <p>Sunyata has an infinite power to free, not to free somebody, 
                                  but to free freedom from somebody who wants or thinks of freedom.</p>
              <p>Ego = self = identity, is the opposite of sunyata.</p>
              <p>Sunyata has no limits. Its depth is unimaginable. I won’t 
                                  say I can’t imagine it, because there is nobody to imagine 
                                  anything anymore.</p>
              <p>It is amusing, this “I” that comes in and out 
                                  every now and then which seems to claim some sort of right 
                                  to be here. The thing, friend, is not that it is here or there; 
                                  it is that there is no you in the first place. So where does 
                                  this statement come from?!</p>
              <p>There is a tendency to glorify, but there is nobody to glorify. 
                                  There is only glory. Glory is golden with green haloes around 
                                  it.</p>
              <p>There are times when</p>
              <p>I am = zero</p>
              <p>That has the effect of an atom bomb. Who says so? Ego, of 
                                  course.</p>
              <p>Sunyata is there at the edge of ego, right at the zero edge 
                                  of identity.</p>
              <p>“The ‘I’ seems to have some sort of strength.”</p>
              <p>A thought! Another trick of ego.</p>
              <p>Sunyata is gone when ego tries to play a trick on itself 
                                  that it exists.</p>
              <p>The interesting thing is that I am not writing this for me; 
                                  for, frankly speaking, this me does not seem to be.</p>
              <p>Trying to capture sunyata, by writing about it, is always 
                                  at the edge of sunyata and self. It is very tricky. It is 
                                  very tricky—the moment there is an identity to an action 
                                  then there is no sunyata.</p>
              <p>We must not forget that ego, too, is sunyata, for sunyata 
                                  is.</p>
              <p>Sunyata is important, but not to me personally, for “I” 
                                  is more of an appearance than anything else. Right now, for 
                                  instance:</p>
              <p>“I” = “Belief that I know sunyata.”</p>
              <p>This “I” is mixed up with another bunch of “I”s, 
                                  all assuming that they exist. And so they create problems. 
                                  But, in fact, they are problems for nobody. And, in fact, 
                                  they are not problems. And, in fact, they are not. And, in 
                                  fact.<br> In the Heart Sutra, Avaloketisvara tells Shariputra, “Form 
                                  is emptiness, emptiness is form.” In sunyata, form is 
                                  empty. It is totally empty of any conceptual significance. 
                                  No association follows the perception. It is just what it 
                                  is, nothing. For making it a thing is the function of concepts. 
                                  On the other hand, each form assumes its full substantiality, 
                                  becomes full to the brim with itself. So this emptiness is 
                                  not really empty, it is quite full, but full with its own 
                                  reality and not what I lay on it. So the bed is full, is packed 
                                  with bedness. The dark is one hundred percent full with darkness. 
                                  Each form, because it is empty of concepts, takes the full 
                                  measure of its nature. The quality of beingness in sunyata 
                                  is of being awake: bodhi. It is not that I am awake. It is 
                                  more like reality is awake. Everything awakens to its own 
                                  nature. It is a sense of openness, brightness, naturalness. 
                                  My eyes are wide open, shiny. My face shines with an inner 
                                  light, so does everything else. A feeling of total presence, 
                                  of concreteness. Everything shines and is luminous, yet stays 
                                  just itself. There are no additions to reality. It is just 
                                  manifesting its intrinsic nature, now that it is free from 
                                  the tyranny of my beliefs and concepts about it. Everything 
                                  lightens up when ego relaxes its grip. Everything wakes up 
                                  when ego is gone, gate, gate. So the Heart Sutra says: Gate 
                                  gate, paragate, parasamgate, bodhi, swaha. So be it.</p>

              <p>to share some experiences, with everyday practice it becomes easier and easier to identify the 'guests' (as AEN describes).

              <p>Hi Buddha Bra,<br><br>You may also want to try the natural way of
              ‘letting whatever arises to manifest openly and unreservedly ’. For one
              that has experienced the non-duality of observer and observed and taste
              the sensate reality free from the sense of self, the way of ‘let
              manifest’ is a natural progression.<br><br>In order to do that, deeply
              understand that there are more problems when attempting to suppress
              your preferences, likes and dislikes. Therefore the first step is to
              experience and realize that ‘suppression’ is not the way. If we think
              that ‘suppression’ is way or when the arising upsets us, then
              unknowingly we will attempt to prevent their arising.<br><br>Second,
              understand clearly that letting “likes and dislikes” manifest is the
              first step towards liberation. We cannot prevent what that is hardwired
              from arising. As long as the seed is there, there will be
              manifestation. We may not be aware of these tendencies when they are
              latent but “let manifest” is the first step towards freedom. <br><br>Third,
              non-dual with whatever sensations that arise. When the sense of
              observer is gone and uninterrupted, that is the sense of freedom. It
              will also dissolve those tendencies eventually as all share the same
              taste.</p>

              <p>dear Herzog_Zwei,</p>
              <p>breathing is a natural bodily process that goes on without needing to "remember".  if the body receive a scare from external environment, like in your example, the heart will naturally beats faster without needing to "remember", the breathing may momentarily lapse for a second or two without needing to "remember", the body may produce cold sweat without needing to "remember", your mouth may be agape with surprise without needing to "remember", ppl may even shit in their pants if the scare is severe enough again without needing to "remember" and so on. its all just natural body reactions to internal and external stimulus, that's all.</p>
              <p>similarly, once the effect of the scare has worn off, the reverse of all these bodily process will naturally happen while things normalize back - heart beats slows down, normal breathing resumes, body stops sweating, mouth resumes back normal position, all happening without needing to "remember".</p>
              <p>i'm not a biological expert, spiritual expert nor quoting medical books, any buddhist scriptures here.  this is just my own simple personal experience while observing my own bodily experience.</p>
              <p>i'm interested to hear what your personal experience is?  while not quoting from books, beliefs or anything, can you share what  your own direct experience is when  you observe your own bodily processes?</p>

              <p>The joy and bliss found in the clarity free from all identifications is far more than you can ever imagine, you will have to experience it to know what I'm talking about. It is a bliss that is free from passions, it is unconditioned and not subject to arising and passing unlike mundane pleasures.</p>
              <p>It is the bliss of not feeling but awareness, which is that which knows all feelings and thoughts yet isn't separate from them.</p>
              <p>There never was a self, but that does not impede (but rather strengthens) compassion for all sentient beings equally, to guide others to liberation. This is the way of the Bodhisattva.</p>
              <p>Without letting go of the notion of self, there will not be liberation from sufferings.</p>
