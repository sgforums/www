              Attachment of "self"
              This morning, I woke up and I felt great. I greeted everybody I met and everybody returned in kind. Wow! What a great day! But,then I greeted this old man and he scowled at me and scream profanities at me in from of everybody. I made me so embarrased that I feel so everytime  I see the man I avoided him! Why is it so! Why am I making myself miserable!

                  is, already Anatta. I am not denying that realization is important,
                  but it is not the same as 'attaining a state of no-self' since
                  no-self is not a state, basically it is what Always Is, always has
                  been. </blockquote>
              <p>So can I say that no-self is a stateless state ?  Or if realisation of no-self is the merging with the universe then can I say that the no-self state is the mother of all states ;-) ?</p>

              <p>It is nonsense only when you haven't experienced it, while I know exactly what non-dual experience is by experience. That's sad, especially the attitude of close mindedness on something that one hasn't experienced and having made the conclusions (e.g. that those are meaningless verbiage is
                      filled with impressive nonsense) before finding out in one's experience. Just because you haven't experienced doesn't mean that it is not true and I hope you can be more open minded. How can anyone advance in practice with such attitudes which prevents the opportunity for direct experience? Are you here to learn or to argue with people for the sake of arguing before finding out for oneself? Do you think you can ridicule a direct experience that countless practitioners not limited to me have seen? I hope you don't take this personally, this is for everyone who is reading as I am aware that the experience of no-self when described in words can be quite unbelievable unless one has had some experiences with it.</p>

              <p>Back to topic.</p>
              <p>The eyes and the ears are not the seer or hearer, they are just one of the many conditions for a particular sight or sound to arise, and certainly not the only condition for sight and sound to arise. But when the sight arise, there is just that sight, there is no seer behind the sight. It is just the manifestation of pure awareness without separation into observer and observed, there is totally no distance at all.</p>
              <p><br>One must learn how to see Appearances as Awareness and all others
                                              as conditions. Example, sound is awareness. The person, the stick, the
                                              bell, hitting, air, ears...are conditions. One should learn to see in
                                              this way. All problems arise because we cannot experience Awareness
                                              this way. Awareness is NOT a separate observer experiencing an objective universe. The so called universe is itself the manifestation of Awareness according to conditions without duality.</p>
              <p>The notion 'who sees' is totally faulty as it presupposes some entity that sees. In Buddhism, no one sees, but there are conditions for manifestation, for sight. There is no denial of conditions (in fact this is emphasized in the teaching of Dependent Origination), but there is the denial of a separate agent or self behind or within manifestations.</p>

              <p>Non-dual experience is not a discernment from the perspective of knowledge or a separate observer.</p>
              <p>The experience and realisation of No-Self is beyond any mental
                              constructs that is perceivable from the mind. Therefore it is the
                              "Mystery" -- yet it is not in opposition to Forms or Manifestation. It
                              is not a form of subjective knowing. There is no person that perceives
                              or understands no-self, nor an inner knower or witness that is aware of
                              no-self, that would be contradictory. Rather, in the perceiving, just
                              shapes, colours, sounds, no perceiver.<br><br>When looking at bamboo
                              through the insight of no-self, we do not study a bamboo scientifically
                              as a subjective observer, nor do we even observe the bamboo carefully
                              from a distance as a separate self. Instead of experiencing bamboo from
                              the viewpoint of a 'me', rather, from the bamboo experience the bamboo:
                              totally no distance between me and bamboo. In other words, we enter
                              into the mode of being where the bamboo is the bamboo itself, and from
                              there to look at the pine tree and the bamboo. Everything becomes
                              manifest in their suchness. It is Mystery because there is no separate
                              observer studying it from a distance, rather, it is a mode of
                              everything being itself, or rather in a dynamic state of becoming.
                              There is no knower and it is not a form of subjective knowledge. Non-dual awareness is ultimately a Mystery since it cannot be made an
                              object of observation or study by a subject since there is no subject/object
                              relation.<br><br>The Satipatthana Sutta, a Buddhist sutra from the
                              Buddha which teaches awareness, uses expressions such as "observing the
                              body in the body," "observing the feelings in the feelings," "observing
                              the mind in the mind," "observing the objects of mind in the objects of
                              mind." repeatedly. This means not separating oneself from the object of
                              observation, and see/experience that the Observer and the Observed is
                              one. Or to use a quote by Guru Padmasambhava,<br><br><em>And when you look into yourself in this way nakedly (without any discursive thoughts),<br>Since there is only this pure observing, there will be found a lucid clarity without anyone being there who is the observer;<br>only a naked manifest awareness is present.</em></p>

              <p>It depends on what you mean by absorption. It is possible to be absorbed in a state of pure awareness.</p>
              <p>The notion that there is no clarity in absorption is also not in accords with what the Buddha taught, and is not the Buddhist kind of absorption, for example,</p>

                                  extend; even so, the monk sits, <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>permeating the body with a pure, bright awareness.

                                  related to the household life are abandoned, and with their abandoning his
                                  mind gathers and settles inwardly, grows unified and centered. This is how
                                  a contemplative develops mindfulness on the body."</strong></span></span></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However whatever the absorption is, even if it is non-dual absorption, even if one experiences clear bright all-pervasive awareness, it is still not the arising of insight that leads to liberation (the insight into anatta and emptiness), though it can become a support. It is only through insight that the bonds of 'self' can be removed. Otherwise, even if we can maintain nondual experience, it doesn't mean we are liberated.</p>
              <p>So, no, merging with universe is a state of absorption, it is not insight or liberation or enlightenment. The experience is the same, but what is more crucial is whether the insight into anatta as a seal has arisen.</p>

              <p>å¿˜æˆ‘ (forget about yourself) is a momentary relief from strong
                          attachment to self. It is a good state but a lesser state compared
                          to Annata (non-attachment to self) achieved by the Arhat /
                          others. If state of å¿˜æˆ‘ allow very high achievement of artistic
                          expression, imagine the power of being in Annata.</p>

              <p>You're right that forgetting self is not Anatta.</p>
              <p>However neither is Anatta non-attachment to self. Anatta is a dharma seal, it requires the arising of insights or realisation. When Anatta is realised as always so, then it is no longer mistaken a stage, and practice becomes effortless (no longer a sense of trying to reach a state of anatta since every experience is anatta), it is simply the ever present nature of reality.</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial;">When a person says that I have
                          gone beyond the experiences from ‘I hear sound’ to a stage of ‘becoming
                          sound’, he is mistaken. When it is taken to be a stage, it is illusory.
                          <strong>For in actual case, there is and always is only sound when hearing;
                          never was there a hearer to begin with. Nothing attained for it is
                          always so. This is the seal of no-self.</strong></span></p>

              <p>If thought of self arise, that too is anatta. There is no thinker apart from the thought.</p>
              <p>If attachment to self arises, that too is anatta. That attachment is merely a thought without a thinker, without substance.</p>
              <p>No coordinator controlling everything, things just emerge and subside on its own accord.</p>
              <p>When the illusion of controllership is seen through, the attempt to control and grasp these ephemeral manifestations (as insubstantial as the wind) may subside. Whether it is seen through or not, anatta is always the case. When anatta is realised, there is no one attaining anything, no one practicing anything,<strong> and no one letting go of anything, </strong>since there is only spontaneous manifestation and subsidance of thoughts, sounds, sights, smells, etc... all happening on its own accord without an agent behind them. There is no attempt to practice 'being aware' or 'be the watcher' -- the universe is already self-aware. 'Awareness' is already 'practicing itself'. Is there a 'you' becoming more aware or is awareness already the case and having nothing to do with a self? Without effort, the bird chirps, the words appear on the screen, if that isn't awareness what is? Is there a 'you' becoming one with sound or is there just the that sound from the beginning?</p>
              <p>All attempts and effort (to get rid of attachment, to be aware, etc) seems to be unnecessary, and if they arise, they are simply the manifestations of awareness without a center. You realise <em>you</em> can't do anything -- all actions, practice, and effort is what is 'being done' without a doer, all the manifestation of Buddha-Nature.</p>
              <p>However, if this is not clearly seen to the end, efforting have no choice but to arise, as it still occurs for me sometimes (and sometimes not).</p>

              <p>I have to add that spontaneous perfection or the insight of no-self, though must be understood, we cannot practice (or not-practice) this way (until we realise it). And anyway this is an insight, it is not about practicing or not practicing. Even though I have several glimpses of the experience of no-self or nondual even recently, I must state that 'spontaneous perfection' is quite beyond me now.</p>
              <p>Last night I had a dream. I was back to the old school days, where we sit in classes and there's a whiteboard (or blackboard) in front of us. It was just after the exams. We received back our exam papers, where we are told to review and DO CORRECTIONS for our mistakes. However, I and a few others were just copying the correct answers from the whiteboard which my friend had written for us. The teacher came into the room and asked, "So what's the use if you copy the answers? Will you learn anything?"<br><br>Even within that dream, I already immediately understood the lesson of it: It is no use to copy others' insights. That is solely their own. We have to go through the process of understanding and assimilating what is being taught (in this case realising those insights ourselves).</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>AEN is right. Anatta is not exactly non-attachment to self as that too is dualistic. However, it is probably a skillful mean to preach it to certain group of people. It is like in Pureland, it is normal to practise dualistic äº‹ç›¸å¿µä½› first. å®žç›¸å¿µä½› is beyond many people including myself.</p></div>

              <p>Without duality, not the notion of duality, we cannot discern or discriminate.</p>
              <p>Question: When you practice breathing as to focus starting with the your nose, putting away of the notion or concept of practise and focus on the act itself first. </p>
              <p>As you breathe, do "sense" the nose or "breath" as air flows in and out. As focus intensifies, does the breathing takes precedent as you feel it flowing into throat to within your chest cavity. Or the focus shift into involuntary and concious breathing.Remember, regardless of your focus, the act of breathing continues.</p>
              <p>Now, let's assume that prior to your practice, you applied some aftershave. The aftershave is on you, however, as it lingers, do you or do you not smell the fragrance. Why is sometimes you smell the fragrance, while at other time you are not?!  Assuming you wear perfume to work, the thing is others always smell whenever you come near them. The point is discernment come from the difference smelling and not smelling.  Does the notion then, associating and disassociating not arise? </p>
              <p>Do you direct your focus or do focus what naturally arises?  Also is there one awareness of the totality of everything in one instant, or does the awarenss comes in sequence, eg. chronological order?</p>
