              <p> Can or does an arahant have a sense of self ?   If not how could he/she operate within the realm of perception ?   False self is a product of mental factors (feelings, perception, mental formation). </p>
              <p>  If he/she a self but is not attached to it, wouldn't he/she be very forgetful ?   Perception and mental formation are also dependent on memory and memory like-wise depended on it.</p>

              <p>What is important is Arhats will not have a single selfish thought no matter what happens. For normal person like me, when someone scolds me, I feel hurt straightaway (becos somehow I fell there is an "I" that get hurt).</p>

              <p>Whether Arhants have mental factors is of no concern -- since whatever manifests just self-liberates on their own accord when there is Anatta, no Self to detach or attach to things -- there is only phenomena arising and subsiding with nobody behind doing or observing them.</p>
              <p>-----------------------------------<br><br>"...it seems that lots of effort need to be put in -- which is
                      really not the case. The entire practice turns out to an undoing
                      process. It is a process of gradually understanding the workings of our
                      nature that is from beginning liberated but clouded by this sense of
                      ‘self’ that is always trying to preserve, protect and ever attached.
                      The entire sense of self is a ‘doing’. Whatever we do, positive or
                      negative, is still doing. Ultimately there is not-even a letting go or
                      let be, as there is already continuous dissolving and arising and this
                      ever dissolving and arising turns out to be self-liberating. Without
                      this ‘self’ or ‘Self’, there is no ‘doing’, there is only spontaneous
                      arising. <img title="Smile" src="http://sgforums.com/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" border="0" alt="Smile">"<br><br>~ our forummer, Thusness (source: <a rel="nofollow" href="/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=225462">Non-dual and karmic patterns</a>)<br><br>"...When
                      one is unable to see the truth of our nature, all letting go is nothing
                      more than another from of holding in disguise. Therefore without the
                      'insight', there is no releasing.... it is a gradual process of deeper
                      seeing. when it is seen, the letting go is natural. You cannot force
                      urself into giving up the self... purification to me is always these
                      insights... non-dual and emptiness nature...."<br><br>~ Thusness<br>--------------<br><br>From
                      a pure insight practice point of view, you can’t ever fundamentally
                      “let go” of anything, so I sometimes wish the popularity of this
                      misleading and indifference-prod</p>
              <div class="msg-body">ucing admonition would decline, or
                      at least be properly explained. However, if you simply investigate the
                      truth of the Three Characteristics of the sensations that seemed to be
                      a solid thing, you will come to the wondrous realization that reality
                      is continually “letting go” of itself! Thus, “let it go” at its best
                      actually means, “don’t give a bunch of transient sensations an
                      excessive sense of solidity.” It does not mean, “stop feeling or
                      caring,” nor does it mean, “pretend that the noise in your mind is not
                      there.”<br><br>~ Theravadin teacher, Dharma Dan<br><br>--------------<br><br>...The
                      particular method of Dzogchen is called the Path of Self-Liberation,
                      and to apply it nothing need be renounced, purified, or transformed.
                      Whatever arises as one's karmic vision is used as the path. The great
                      master Pha Tampa Sangye [South Indian Yogin of the 11 century (ed.)]
                      once said: It is not the circumstances which arise as one's karmic
                      vision that condition a person into the dualistic state; it is a
                      person's own attachment that enables what arises to condition him. If
                      this attachment is to be cut through in the most rapid and effective
                      way, the mind's spontaneous capacity to self-liberate must be brought
                      into play. The term self-liberation should not, however, be taken as
                      implying that there is some 'self' or ego there to be liberated. It is
                      a fundamental assumption...at the Dzogchen level, that all phenomena
                      are void of self-nature. 'Self -Liberation', in the Dzogchen sense,
                      means that whatever manifests in the field of experience of the
                      practitioner is allowed to arise just as it is, without judgement of it
                      as good or bad, beautiful or ugly. And in that same moment, if there is
                      no clinging, or attachment, without effort, or even volition, whatever
                      it is that arises, whether as a thought or as a seemingly external
                      event, automatically liberates itself, by itself, and of itself.
                      Practicing in this way the seeds of the poison tree of dualistic vision
                      never even get a chance to sprout, much less to take root and grow.(p33)<br><br>So
                      the practitioner lives his or her life in an ordinary way, without
                      needing any rules other than one's own awareness, always remaining in
                      the primordial state through integrating that state with whatever
                      arises as part of experience -- with absolutely nothing to be seen
                      outwardly to show that one is practicing. This is what is meant by
                      self-liberation, this is what is meant by the name Dzogchen - which
                      means Great Perfection - and this is what is meant by non-dual
                      contemplation, or simply contemplation....<br><br>~ Dzogchen teacher, Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche<br><br>-------------------<br><br>Self-liberation
                      does not mean that a self liberates himself or herself from delusorily
                      valued thoughts or delusory experiences; what it means is that
                      delusorily valued thoughts and delusory experiences liberate themselves
                      spontaneously (which may take place in three main ways).

                      It is seen that all states, all experiences whether labeled as

              <p>Then the venerable Sariputra said to the goddess, "Goddess, how long
                      have you been in this house?"<br> <br> The goddess
                      replied, "I have been here as long as the elder has been in liberation."<br> <br> Sariputra said, "Then, have you been in this house for quite some                         time?"<br> <br> The goddess said, "Has the elder been in liberation for quite some                         time?"<br> <br> At that, the elder Sariputra fell silent.<br> <br> The goddess continued, "Elder, you are 'foremost of the wise!' Why do
                      you not speak? Now, when it is your turn, you do not answer the
                      question."<br> <br> Sariputra: Since liberation is inexpressible, goddess, I do not                         know what to say.<br> <br> Goddess: All the syllables pronounced by the elder have the nature of
                      liberation. Why? Liberation is neither internal nor external, nor can
                      it be apprehended apart from them. Likewise, syllables are neither
                      internal nor external, nor can they be apprehended anywhere else.
                      Therefore, reverend Sariputra, do not point to liberation by abandoning
                      speech! Why? The holy liberation is the equality of all things!<br> <br> Sariputra: Goddess, is not liberation the freedom from desire,                         hatred, and folly?<br> <br> Goddess: "Liberation is freedom from desire, hatred, and folly" that is
                      the teaching of the excessively proud. But those free of pride are
                      taught that the very nature of desire, hatred, and folly is itself
                      liberation.</p>

              <p>"Good sons, all hindrances are none other than ultimate enlightenment.
                      Whether you attain mindfulness or lose mindfulness, there is no
                      non-liberation. Establishing the Dharma and refuting the Dharma are
                      both called nirvana; wisdom and folly are equally prajna; the method
                      that is perfected by bodhisattvas and false teachers is the same bodhi;
                      ignorance and suchness are not different realms; morality,
                      concentration and wisdom, as well as desire, hatred and ignorance are
                      all divine practices; sentient beings and lands share the same dharma
                      nature; hell and heaven are both the Pure Land; those having
                      Buddha-nature and those not having it equally accomplish the Buddha's
                      enlightenment. All defilements are ultimately liberation. The
                      reality-realms's ocean-like wisdom completely illumines all marks to be
                      just like empty space. This is called 'the TathÄ�gata's accordance with
                      the nature of enlightenment.' "</p>

              <p>A nice post by someone called 'Kannada' (who clearly realised anatta in direct experience) from <a class="l" href="http://www.zenforuminternational.org/"><em><em>Zen Forum International</em></em></a>:</p>
              <p><br>Hi Carol,<br><br>Thanks for your comment.<br><br>Yes, the Hindus
                                  call it "Hridya Granthi" - The knot of the Heart... I no longer refer
                                  to 'realities' or 'absolutes' - there aren't any - for me anyway.<br><br>I
                                  hope you don't think I'm preaching... I used to think all this nirvana
                                  'no self' / 'no other' thing was so complicated, then oneday in the
                                  midst of 'doing' it occured to me that there was just a 'doing', it
                                  wasn't 'me' that was doing, it wasn't anything doing, just action -
                                  plain, pure and simple. The problem was that thought would jump into
                                  the activity. It would say that 'I' was sweeping the floors, or washing
                                  the dishes or whatever. Thought would not only define 'me' but it would
                                  define what was done and the process involved.<br><br>After learning to
                                  drop thought (by paying attention to the space between thoughts) all
                                  this naming ceased to be, no sweeper or washer, no sweeping or washing,
                                  no thing swept or washed, just peace where all activity continues
                                  unhindered and undefined. It seems to be a default setting for us
                                  humans to overlay existence or life with a continuous running
                                  commentary, an everlasting set of definitions just in case we may cease
                                  to be if the definitions fall silent.<br><br>I don't try to figure it
                                  out anymore, I don't think in terms of Dharma or nirvana or reality or
                                  work toward a goal - Buddhist or otherwise, it is far less of a hassle
                                  to drop it all, to give up the continuous mental machinations and
                                  simply leave it be - enough is enough. Of course the curse of
                                  over-thinking (uninvited thought) still arises but now there's an
                                  escape route, a knowing of what need be done when it all gets too much.<br><br>I wouldn't call it 'nirvana', Theravadin or Zen, but it is a cessation of sorts, and a very nice one at that... <br><br>Regards<br><br>k</p>
              <p>...............................</p>
              <p>Roughly speaking, the difference between Heart and Mind is that the
                              mind is the seat of conditionality whereby conceptuality subdivides
                              perceptions into 'subject' and 'object', 'this' and 'that', 'self' and
                              'other', it is Awareness with differentiation or conditionality. The
                              Heart however is that Pure Awareness with no differentiation - the
                              'unconditioned'. Living experience, without mind-created conditions,
                              without an imagined 'I' standing in contradistinction to the imagined
                              'other', allows the senses a clarity that is altogether absent through
                              the thick fog of conceptuality. The practitioner discovers for
                              him/herself a sense of lightness, clarity, freedom and peace that was
                              missing in the darkness of delusion.<br><br>The question "how can I not
                              attach to the experience" is somewhat misdirected (a common problem
                              indeed), for it assumes an 'I' to whom the experience occurs, an 'I'
                              (the product of delusion) that desires to manage attachment to an
                              experience whereby the fog of delusion temporarily lifts and delusion
                              temporarily ceases. Attachment to conditionality would be a more likely
                              candidate as a cause of suffering. The cessation of suffering is the
                              cessation of the 'I' (that wishes to manage meditation experiences).
                              The characteristics of this 'I' is of course greed, aversion and
                              delusion...</p>
              <p>...........</p>
              <p>Cessation is merely the cessation of that which never existed
                          except in the imagination. Dropping the self/other notions does not
                          leave a cold lifeless, emotionless shell. It simply removes the
                          imaginary ownership of arisings. Feelings of warmth, love, caring etc
                          still arise but as ownerless processes untill their antecedent causes
                          (as samskaras and vasanas) subside. The imaginary notion that a self is
                          responsible for these arisings is completely erroneous.</p>
              <p>...........</p>
              <p>Awakening is a delusory notion centred on the belief that there is someone to awaken.<br><br>Awakening is awakening to the fact that there is no-one to awaken.<br><br>Seeing without the seer<br><br>Hearing without the hearer<br><br>Tasting without the taster etc<br><br>Perception without the notions of seeing, hearing, tasting etc<br><br>Neither 'I' nor 'other'</p>

              <p>When Arhat listens to a beautiful song, it does not mean it is

              <p>What is important is Arhats will not have a single selfish

              <p>  Does it mean also that it is neutral ?  Many believed, wrongly, that an arahant do not have likes and dislikes or do not have experience of pleasant or unpleasant.  An incident will perhaps clarify the capacity of a Buddha or an arahant.</p>
              <p>  Buddha was walking with ananda one evening. When they reached the padi field Buddha exclaimed that it was indeed very beautiful and they stopped to appreciate the splendour of nature. Ananda then suggested that the image of the padi fields with the red setting sun reflected by the padi field be used as the image on the monks frock.</p>
              <p>   So if an Arahant do not have a single selfish thought and when they scolded you or being mean to you they are doing it out of compassion for you ?   Or do you think that an arahant is not capable of being "mean"  ?</p>
