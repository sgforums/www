              <p>From <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/DzogchenPractice/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/DzogchenPractice/</a></p>
              <div>Recently we have had several new members join our list...  Some 
                  have limited knowledge of Dzogchen and others have much experience.  I 
                  want to make clear that the approach to non-dual Awareness known as 
                  Dzogchen, is not a progressive approach that leads through a gradual 
                  step by step enhancement to one's understanding and experience of 
                  ones natural state or true nature.  Rather, through auspicious 
                  circumstances there occurs a sudden shift from relative self or ego 
                  viewpoint to the absolute Knowingness of Being.  This shift is 
                  the realization of Dzogchen.  Dzogchen means the Great Perfection.  One 
                  realizes that all and everything is and always has been perfect just as 
                  it manifests and needs no correction or clarification,
                  and that includes our thoughts, feelings, sensations and perceptions 
                  just as they appear in this moment, not in some future moment after 
                  things have been fixed-up a bit.  Another name for Dzogchen in the 
                  tradition is Ati or Ati Yoga.  When we refer to Ati we mean this 
                  realization of total perfection that becomes known directly through 
                  the intrinsic wisdom of Being/Awareness self-manifesting spontaneously. 
                   I wrote the text below during the summer as some of you may have 
                  already read.  I think it may prove useful to share and review this 
                  material again.  Please ask questions or share comments as desired...</div>
              <div> </div>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">In
                   the many recent months we have been discussing various ways and 
                  approaches to attain or come to an understanding of enlightened 
                  Awareness, to actually be in that Awareness as that Awareness.  But in 
                  all these discussions there has been some sense of there being a 
                  departure point and an arrival point, with the path being the bridge 
                  between these points.  But in real Ati Yoga of Dzogchen there is no 
                  notion of there being a starting point and an arrival point with some 
                  transitional process linking the two points.  Rather the departure point
                   is the arrival point in this moment...now, just as we are.<br><br>Let's
                   examine this a bit.  Your actual true nature and beingness is pure 
                  Awareness in all moments.  It does not require additional efforts or 
                  understandings to be what it already is.  What is this
                  Awareness?  It has no physical characteristics and has no location in 
                  space or time.  It has no sense of self nor any sense of identity.  
                  There is nothing personal about this Awareness such as my Awareness and 
                  your Awareness.  It is complete voidness or emptiness, yet it is fully 
                  cognizant.  There is no separation between it and the field of 
                  perception as they exist as one unity without parts.  In fact you can't 
                  even call it Awareness, because Awareness implies that there is a 
                  subject, such as Awareness, and objects such as external and internal 
                  forms and energies that Awareness is aware of...like a witness.  <br><br>But
                   in fact, our true nature is not even Awareness in that regard, as there
                   is nothing for Awareness to be aware of.  <em>Awareness is the field of 
                  experience, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not an observer of it.</span></em>  You may ask what 
                  Awareness looks like... whatever you see, feel, think, imagine, hear, 
                  taste, smell are
                  all the manifestations or appearances of Awareness and are therefore 
                  perfect just as they are.  There is no need to change your feelings, 
                  your thoughts, sensations, emotions or perceptions in any way.  Whatever
                   you are experiencing in each moment is Awareness appearing as that 
                  moment.  Even having the sense of being a limited and defined ego-self 
                  is also this Awareness appearing as that.<br><br>The most essential 
                  nature of Awareness is a totally empty Presence that just is.  That 
                  Presence is our own immediate awareness in the midst of whatever 
                  experience is arising.  That which hears a sound is this non-personal 
                  Presence as Awareness.  This is the same for sensory experiences and 
                  internal mental events as well.  So when we hear a sound, the awareness 
                  that is hearing the sound is inseparable from the sound.  Try it, close 
                  your eyes and just listen.  Notice how you cannot find a dividing line 
                  between the sound
                  and your perceiving awareness.  Actually you will discover that there is
                   no separation at all, just like waves being inseparable from the 
                  water.  This happens to be true for all your perceptions and thoughts, 
                  feelings and emotions as well.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Everything is Awareness appearing as 
                  those experiences. </span> To experience this directly is what is called 
                  the non-dual state or samadhi.  In Dzogchen we could call this non-dual 
                  state of Awareness and its energy field the experience of Ati.  But you 
                  cannot really call Ati an experience as there is no subject as a witness
                   of the experience.  Here is where words and concepts fail to convey the
                   reality of Ati.  Ati is never an experience...but is that which has 
                  experiences and yet appears as those experiences at the same time, and 
                  yet remains changeless and unmoving.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><br>Ati
                   is Reality as it is, however it appears in each moment.  There are no 
                  levels of Ati.  That is because Ati is everything just as you experience
                   it.  Even the sense of being a confused being looking for freedom from 
                  suffering is Ati appearing as that.  However, there is still an 
                  Awareness of that experience of there being a confused being, that 
                  Awareness is like a mirror, but is itself never the forms or reflections
                   that appear as a confused being.  We are never other than this 
                  non-personal Awareness as the unchanging mirror itself.<br><br>That 
                  means there is no need for meditation nor practice because whatever is 
                  your experience is already Ati.  All states of consciousness are Ati.  
                  There is no one to become enlightened as all there is, is only the 
                  unified field of Being.  The sense of being
                  a separate being is just an experience.  There has never been any 
                  separation at any time nor separate selves.  Ati is just being as you 
                  are in this and every other moment.  When you are sad, that is Ati 
                  sadness.  When you are crazy, that is Ati craziness.  This is true for 
                  all conditions and states.<br><br>How is the Ati experience brought 
                  about?  The essence of Ati is your cognitive knowingness present within 
                  all moments and as those moments.  There is a sense of being conscious 
                  within all experiences.  It is that pure cognitive consciousness that is
                   the living heart of Ati.  The essence of Ati is not thoughts, but is 
                  the awareness that appears as thoughts.  The essence of Ati is not your 
                  emotions, but is the awareness appearing as those emotions.  And so it 
                  is for all sensations and perceptions:  Ati is the awareness of all 
                  sensory and perceptual experiences yet is
                  inseparable from them, again like water and waves.<br><br>Even though 
                  Ati is really not possible to practice, whatever you think, say, feel or
                   do is already perfect Ati practice.  Whatever conduct you engage in, 
                  Ati is beyond any notion of virtue or vice.  So all conduct and actions 
                  are equal.  All thoughts, delusions, distractions are also left as they 
                  are as they too are perfect Ati practice. And when those delusions of 
                  mind are left as they are, they self-liberate or dissolve 
                  spontaneously. Since whatever state of mind you are in is fully the 
                  perfection of Ati as it is, what other practice is needed?  Even when 
                  you feel lost and confused, that too is the perfect Ati state 
                  manifesting as that harmless experience.  <br><br>The key is simply 
                  being Ati awareness, the Awareness present in each moment already.  It 
                  is empty, clear and undefined presence of Awareness.  Notice that 
                  Awareness has no
                  characteristics other than being a naked knowingness as a continuum of 
                  consciousness in each moment of experience.  Whatever arises internally 
                  or externally, its just the empty naked cognitive aspect attending each 
                  moment as a non-personal Awareness of whatever is as whatever is.  We 
                  enter Ati through the method of Direct Introduction.  There is no path 
                  of learning nor of practice in Ati.  Ati Awareness is always your 
                  default condition and it cannot be made more clear nor ever impaired.<br><br>For
                   those that wish to enter the experiential dimension of Ati... ask 
                  questions as needed.  But it might be easier to just simply notice that 
                  your current condition is Ati perfectly expressing itself exactly as you
                   are... as the pure noticing within all experiences.  However, 
                  in Dzogchen there are many exercises and secondary methods that can 
                  assist one to come to this Awareness that may be used as
                  necessary.<span>  </span>And when all of this is clearly seen from the 
                  viewpoint of Ati, mental events and ego-self dissolve into pure 
                  Awareness leaving no one to liberateâ€¦ and the natural bliss of Being 
                  saturates each moment as the arising of sheer delight...<br><br>Jax</span></p>

              <p>"Good sons, all 
                  hindrances are none other than          ultimate enlightenment. Whether 
                  you attain mindfulness or lose          mindfulness, there is no 
                  non-liberation. Establishing the Dharma and          refuting the Dharma
                   are both called nirvana; wisdom and folly are          equally prajna; 
                  the method that is perfected by bodhisattvas and false          teachers
                   is the same bodhi; ignorance and suchness are not different          
                  realms; morality, concentration and wisdom, as well as desire, hatred   
                         and ignorance are all divine practices; sentient beings and lands
                   share          the same dharma nature; hell and heaven are both the 
                  Pure Land; those          having Buddha-nature and those not having it 
                  equally accomplish the          Buddha's enlightenment. All defilements 
                  are ultimately liberation. The          reality-realms's ocean-like 
                  wisdom completely illumines all marks to be          just like empty 
                  space. This is called           'the TathÄ�gata's          accordance 
                  with the nature of enlightenment.'          "</p>
              <p>~ The Sutra of 
                  Perfect Enlightenment<br>-------------------</p>
              <p>Then the 
                  venerable Sariputra said to the goddess, "Goddess, how                  
                         long have you been in this house?"<br> <br> The goddess replied, "I have been here as long as the 
                  elder has                         been in liberation."<br> <br> Sariputra said, "Then, have you been in this
                   house for quite some                         time?"<br> <br> The goddess said, "Has the elder been in 
                  liberation for quite some                         time?"<br> <br> At that, the elder Sariputra fell silent.<br> <br> The goddess continued, "Elder,
                   you are 'foremost of the wise!' Why                         do you not 
                  speak? Now, when it is your turn, you do not answer the                 
                          question."<br> <br> Sariputra: Since liberation is inexpressible, goddess, I do not         
                                  know what to say.<br> <br> Goddess: All the syllables pronounced by the elder have the 
                  nature                         of liberation. Why? Liberation is neither
                   internal nor external,                         nor can it be 
                  apprehended apart from them. Likewise, syllables are                    
                       neither internal nor external, nor can they be apprehended anywhere
                                           else. Therefore, reverend Sariputra, do not 
                  point to liberation by                         abandoning speech! Why? 
                  The holy liberation is the equality of all                         
                  things!<br> <br> Sariputra: Goddess,
                   is not liberation the freedom from desire,                         
                  hatred, and folly?<br> <br> Goddess:
                   "Liberation is freedom from desire, hatred, and folly"                 
                          that is the teaching of the excessively proud. But those free of
                                           pride are taught that the very nature of 
                  desire, hatred, and folly                         is itself liberation.</p>

              <p>-------------------<br>...The particular method of Dzogchen is called the Path of 
              Self-Liberation, and to apply it nothing need be renounced, purified, or
               transformed. Whatever arises as one's karmic vision is used as the 
              path. The great master Pha Tampa Sangye [South Indian Yogin of the 11 
              century (ed.)] once said: It is not the circumstances which arise as 
              one's karmic vision that condition a person into the dualistic state; it
               is a person's own attachment that enables what arises to condition him.
               If this attachment is to be cut through in the most rapid and effective
               way, the mind's spontaneous capacity to self-liberate must be brought 
              into play. The term self-liberation should not, however, be taken as 
              implying that there is some 'self' or ego there to be liberated. It is a
               fundamental assumption...at the Dzogchen level, that all phenomena are 
              void of self-nature. 'Self -Liberation', in the Dzogchen sense, means 
              that whatever manifests in the field of experience of the practitioner 
              is allowed to arise just as it is, without judgement of it as good or 
              bad, beautiful or ugly. And in that same moment, if there is no 
              clinging, or attachment, without effort, or even volition, whatever it 
              is that arises, whether as a thought or as a seemingly external event, 
              automatically liberates itself, by itself, and of itself. Practicing in 
              this way the seeds of the poison tree of dualistic vision never even get
               a chance to sprout, much less to take root and grow.(p33)<br><br>So the
               practitioner lives his or her life in an ordinary way, without needing 
              any rules other than one's own awareness, always remaining in the 
              primordial state through integrating that state with whatever arises as 
              part of experience -- with absolutely nothing to be seen outwardly to 
              show that one is practicing. This is what is meant by self-liberation, 
              this is what is meant by the name Dzogchen - which means Great 
              Perfection - and this is what is meant by non-dual contemplation, or 
              simply contemplation....</p>
              <div class="msg-body"><br><br>~ Dzogchen teacher, Namkhai Norbu 
              Rinpoche<br><br>-------------------<br><br>Self-liberation does not mean
                                       that a self liberates himself or herself from 
              delusorily valued                         thoughts or delusory 
              experiences; what it means is that delusorily                         
              valued thoughts and delusory experiences liberate themselves            
                           spontaneously (which may take place in three main ways).

              <p>Wow... more Dzogchen stuffs. Thanks for sharing.</p>
              <p>Just a sharing and is certainly not definitive....</p>
              <p>When one has experienced the bliss when the mind rest down and is with few thoughts and emotions... one will want to go towards pleasant states. This is a kind of dualistic preference as well.</p>
              <p>So much so that we will view many things and emotions as negative and must be eliminated. This in itself is a form of desire and dualistic concepts. It is very very hard to let go of such a concept. For example, we alway think that we need to get rid of the defilements.. and this part is re-enforced in the teaching. .. or rather our assumption of the teaching. But the very concept of getting rid of the defilements is a dualistic concept leaning towards a wish for ever more blissful and pleasant state. This is a paradox.</p>
              <p>From my understanding that which are negative emotions or discomforts can exist simultaneously with the peaceful acceptance of them. At the 'heart' level there can be a release and allow the arising of the so-call negatives. It is easier to see the spaciousness and luminosity when the mind is not stirred by negative emotions and discomforts. But the acceptance/equanimity can allow the negatives to co-exist... and surprisingly the 'negatives' will dissolve faster through the allowance of their arising and existence.</p>
              <p>My experience is that by not regarding anything as particular important helps in smoothing things. When we view anything as particular important, the mind will pay extra attention to it and will 'drag' and slow down the release.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hi.. thanks for the sharing... yes I do notice for meditators theres a common tendency to eliminate 'negative' feelings and sensations especially having experienced certain states of bliss and clarity... but the practice is really about allowing the full spectrum of our experience to be experienced without any fleeing or manipulation. Awareness is truly all-inclusive. Sometimes it is described as 'unconditional love'.</p></div>

              <p>From <a rel="nofollow" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/DzogchenPractice/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/DzogchenPractice/</a></p>
              <div>Recently we have had several new members join our list...  Some have limited knowledge of Dzogchen and others have much experience.  I want to make clear that the approach to non-dual Awareness known as Dzogchen, is not a progressive approach that leads through a gradual step by step enhancement to one's understanding and experience of ones natural state or true nature.  Rather, through auspicious circumstances there occurs a sudden shift from relative self or ego viewpoint to the absolute Knowingness of Being.  This shift is the realization of Dzogchen.  Dzogchen means the Great Perfection.  One realizes that all and everything is and always has been perfect just as it manifests and needs no correction or clarification, and that includes our thoughts, feelings, sensations and perceptions just as they appear in this moment, not in some future moment after things have been fixed-up a bit.  Another name for Dzogchen in the tradition is Ati or Ati Yoga.  When we refer to Ati we mean this realization of total perfection that becomes known directly through the intrinsic wisdom of Being/Awareness self-manifesting spontaneously.  I wrote the text below during the summer as some of you may have already read.  I think it may prove useful to share and review this material again.  Please ask questions or share comments as desired...</div>
              <div> </div>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the many recent months we have been discussing various ways and approaches to attain or come to an understanding of enlightened Awareness, to actually be in that Awareness as that Awareness.  But in all these discussions there has been some sense of there being a departure point and an arrival point, with the path being the bridge between these points.  But in real Ati Yoga of Dzogchen there is no notion of there being a starting point and an arrival point with some transitional process linking the two points.  Rather the departure point is the arrival point in this moment...now, just as we are.<br><br>Let's examine this a bit.  Your actual true nature and beingness is pure Awareness in all moments.  It does not require additional efforts or understandings to be what it already is.  What is this Awareness?  It has no physical characteristics and has no location in space or time.  It has no sense of self nor any sense of identity.  There is nothing personal about this Awareness such as my Awareness and your Awareness.  It is complete voidness or emptiness, yet it is fully cognizant.  There is no separation between it and the field of perception as they exist as one unity without parts.  In fact you can't even call it Awareness, because Awareness implies that there is a subject, such as Awareness, and objects such as external and internal forms and energies that Awareness is aware of...like a witness. <br><br>But in fact, our true nature is not even Awareness in that regard, as there is nothing for Awareness to be aware of.  <em>Awareness is the field of experience, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not an observer of it.</span></em>  You may ask what Awareness looks like... whatever you see, feel, think, imagine, hear, taste, smell are all the manifestations or appearances of Awareness and are therefore perfect just as they are.  There is no need to change your feelings, your thoughts, sensations, emotions or perceptions in any way.  Whatever you are experiencing in each moment is Awareness appearing as that moment.  Even having the sense of being a limited and defined ego-self is also this Awareness appearing as that.<br><br>The most essential nature of Awareness is a totally empty Presence that just is.  That Presence is our own immediate awareness in the midst of whatever experience is arising.  That which hears a sound is this non-personal Presence as Awareness.  This is the same for sensory experiences and internal mental events as well.  So when we hear a sound, the awareness that is hearing the sound is inseparable from the sound.  Try it, close your eyes and just listen.  Notice how you cannot find a dividing line between the sound and your perceiving awareness.  Actually you will discover that there is no separation at all, just like waves being inseparable from the water.  This happens to be true for all your perceptions and thoughts, feelings and emotions as well.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Everything is Awareness appearing as those experiences. </span> To experience this directly is what is called the non-dual state or samadhi.  In Dzogchen we could call this non-dual state of Awareness and its energy field the experience of Ati.  But you cannot really call Ati an experience as there is no subject as a witness of the experience.  Here is where words and concepts fail to convey the reality of Ati.  Ati is never an experience...but is that which has experiences and yet appears as those experiences at the same time, and yet remains changeless and unmoving.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br>Ati is Reality as it is, however it appears in each moment.  There are no levels of Ati.  That is because Ati is everything just as you experience it.  Even the sense of being a confused being looking for freedom from suffering is Ati appearing as that.  However, there is still an Awareness of that experience of there being a confused being, that Awareness is like a mirror, but is itself never the forms or reflections that appear as a confused being.  We are never other than this non-personal Awareness as the unchanging mirror itself.<br><br>That means there is no need for meditation nor practice because whatever is your experience is already Ati.  All states of consciousness are Ati.  There is no one to become enlightened as all there is, is only the unified field of Being.  The sense of being a separate being is just an experience.  There has never been any separation at any time nor separate selves.  Ati is just being as you are in this and every other moment.  When you are sad, that is Ati sadness.  When you are crazy, that is Ati craziness.  This is true for all conditions and states.<br><br>How is the Ati experience brought about?  The essence of Ati is your cognitive knowingness present within all moments and as those moments.  There is a sense of being conscious within all experiences.  It is that pure cognitive consciousness that is the living heart of Ati.  The essence of Ati is not thoughts, but is the awareness that appears as thoughts.  The essence of Ati is not your emotions, but is the awareness appearing as those emotions.  And so it is for all sensations and perceptions:  Ati is the awareness of all sensory and perceptual experiences yet is inseparable from them, again like water and waves.<br><br>Even though Ati is really not possible to practice, whatever you think, say, feel or do is already perfect Ati practice.  Whatever conduct you engage in, Ati is beyond any notion of virtue or vice.  So all conduct and actions are equal.  All thoughts, delusions, distractions are also left as they are as they too are perfect Ati practice. And when those delusions of mind are left as they are, they self-liberate or dissolve spontaneously. Since whatever state of mind you are in is fully the perfection of Ati as it is, what other practice is needed?  Even when you feel lost and confused, that too is the perfect Ati state manifesting as that harmless experience. <br><br>The key is simply being Ati awareness, the Awareness present in each moment already.  It is empty, clear and undefined presence of Awareness.  Notice that Awareness has no characteristics other than being a naked knowingness as a continuum of consciousness in each moment of experience.  Whatever arises internally or externally, its just the empty naked cognitive aspect attending each moment as a non-personal Awareness of whatever is as whatever is.  We enter Ati through the method of Direct Introduction.  There is no path of learning nor of practice in Ati.  Ati Awareness is always your default condition and it cannot be made more clear nor ever impaired.<br><br>For those that wish to enter the experiential dimension of Ati... ask questions as needed.  But it might be easier to just simply notice that your current condition is Ati perfectly expressing itself exactly as you are... as the pure noticing within all experiences.  However, in Dzogchen there are many exercises and secondary methods that can assist one to come to this Awareness that may be used as necessary.<span> </span> And when all of this is clearly seen from the viewpoint of Ati, mental events and ego-self dissolve into pure Awareness leaving no one to liberateâ€¦ and the natural bliss of Being saturates each moment as the arising of sheer delight...<br><br>Jax</span></p>
