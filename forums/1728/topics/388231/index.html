              <h2>The Best Kept Secret 
              in the Universe</h2>
              <h3>by Ajahn Jagaro</h3>
              <p>The
              teaching on Anatta or non-self is one of the most fundamental aspects
              of Buddhism, and may be the most important feature which makes the
              Buddha's teaching quite unique. The other aspect of the teaching which
              is sometimes seen to be difficult to reconcile or explain, interms of
              anatta, is the teaching of kamma or the law of kamma, which is the law
              of cause and results. The causes we create through our actions of body,
              speech and mind, and the consequences that arise from these actions.
              The law of kamma states that as we sow so shall we reap, and whatever
              kamma we shall do, we will be the heirs that inherit it. This to many
              people seems some what of a contradiction. On the one part we have the
              teaching of anatta, that there is no self or a personal permanent
              constant entity. So how can there be someone who inherits the results
              of what they do now?</p>
              <p>So this evening I would like to speak on these
              two aspects of the teaching and also how they relate to each other,
              possibly illustrate how there is no contradiction at all. It is quite
              the opposite in fact, for to understand one it does require the other.
              Actually when the Buddha taught the teaching of anatta or non-self, it
              needed or required the law of kamma, the law of conditionality, and the
              law of dependent origination to fill in the gap.</p>
              <p>The concept of anatta or non-self is of great
              importance in Buddha's teaching, and it is the one aspect of the
              teaching which is quite often found by newcomers to Buddhism, or even
              traditional Buddhists, to be very difficult to understand. Elusive,
              abstract and foreign. These terms could be used to describe how we
              react to this teaching when we hear it, and rightly so. There is
              nothing from our experience - the way we experience life, perceive
              life, think and communicate - which would give the secret away. It is
              the best kept secret in the universe. Only a Buddha or someone with the
              qualities and perfections of a Buddha could possibly penetrate this
              mystery or the secret without the guidance of another. That is why it
              is rare for a Buddha to arise in the world to penetrate this particular
              fundamental truth. It is so difficult because their are no hints. Even
              Sherlock Holmes could not have solved this one. It is completely
              contrary to what the appearance seems to indicate, and this is the
              teaching of non-self.</p>
              <p>What the teaching says is, that within this
              human being, consisting of mind and body, or consisting of body and the
              mental attributes of feeling, perception, mental formations and
              consciousness, there is no permanent, personal entity which can be
              called a self or soul or ego. It does not sound right. Our experience
              seems to point back to someone in here, who is the experiencer, who
              owns "me" and "mine."</p>
              <p>This is the appearance which seems real. Even
              when people develop high states of meditation, as they did before the
              Buddha in India, where there were many different systems of religious
              teachers, spiritual seekers with their own systems of training of the
              mind, who were very accomplished, they simply were stuck on this
              appearance of a permanent self. There was a centre to all this
              subjective experience. There was a self, a centre point. Someone in
              there who is experiencing. Therefore every teaching that came out of
              India seemed to revolve around this one form or another dealing with
              this atman or atta or self or ego. In Christianity we have the soul. So
              there are many different notions about this core which is the real me,
              and everything else are attributes of me - my things, my body, my
              thoughts or my feelings. The me was the root of all these. So the
              Buddha in his teaching has burst the bubble and realised for himself
              that there was really no self, no real point that was a centre, and
              there was no self as such, and taught the teaching of no-self. But
              non-self is not meaning nothing, no personality. Of course you are you,
              the person sitting there. There is a mind and body, there is a
              personality, but there is no permanent entity. No aspect of that which
              you take yourself to be, which is permanent, or personal in the sense
              of being independent. And I will elaborate on this.</p>
              <p>What do we mean by what we call atta or self?
              What attributes should a self or soul have? A self or soul, if it is
              really you, should have, in order to have any significance or meaning
              so that it is really you, the following characteristics:</p>
              <ol>
              <li> It has to be independent; otherwise how
              could it be really you. If other things can make it change, how can it
              be really you? So it has to stand independently.</li>
              <li>If it is 
              really yours, it must be completely in your power.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>This
              is a reasonable definition of me, which must be fulfilled for me to be
              real. If this 'me' does not fulfil this definition or does not have
              these attributes, then it is a fantasy. An 'I' or soul or 'me'
              dependent on other things, which changes dependent on other things,
              cannot be much of a 'me'. How can it be mine if I cannot completely
              control it? For example, consider an object which I possess like a
              watch. You can speak about it and say that this is my watch. None of
              you will disagree with that. It's my watch. That is the appearance in
              conventional reality, but if you look more closely, is it true? Is it
              really my watch in an absolute sense, other than in a conventionally
              accepted sense or merely for normal usage? In an absolute sense, it is
              not my watch, because I am going to lose it one day. Something will
              happen to it or it will get stolen, or I will die and somebody will
              inherit it. So in an absolute sense it is not mine, but something that
              will be with me temporarily. It really belongs where it comes from -the
              resources of the planet. Where will it go back - to the resources of
              the planet, like the matter of the universe. That is where it comes
              from and it will go back there. It is mine temporarily. So it is not
              mine in an absolute sense. <br> <br>Let us apply the same analogy to internal
              phenomena. That which is closest to me, 'my body', and we find that in
              actual fact when you apply this analysis, it is no different than the
              watch. As far as where the body comes from and where it goes back to,
              it is the same as the watch. Because of its changeability you can't say
              that it is mine. If it is mine I would make it different to what it is.
              It does not behave as I want it to, neither does your body behave as
              you want it to. You would notice this when we apply the same standards.
              If it is mine, I must have complete power to make it as I wish and I
              would wish everything that is mine be just as I wanted always, and I
              would be perfectly happy. Of course no one has ever been able to do
              that. But we all try and we all feel tremendous frustration at our
              inability to succeed. <br> <br>So not mine are the emotional feelings,
              perceptions, mental formations, thoughts, consciousness itself and the
              way the mental process operates. We'll apply the same analysis and see
              whether you can make your feelings as you want them to be and your
              thoughts to be as you want them to be. How many times a day do you feel
              what you don't want to feel, and remember what you don't want to
              remember, and think what you don't want to think? Your consciousness
              may dwell on some state of mind you do not want to have. The more you
              do not want to have, the more it comes out. Is this I really yours? And
              what is it in there that is you? What is it in this being that is
              sitting here 'you'? Am I the centre 'me' standing independently of
              everything else or is there anything else? The Buddha said no, and he
              stated it in no confusing terms. He stated very clearly - anatta, not
              self over and over again. Somebody might try to reinterpret the
              teaching of the Buddha as if there is some other self. In the Buddha's
              teaching there is no self to be found in this mind and body, of any
              form or any shape either in it or out of it anywhere. No self - full
              stop. <br> <br>But this is not to be accepted through
              belief, but to be realised through careful investigation. It is a well
              kept secret and only a mind which is extraordinarily well trained and
              disciplined and also knowledgeable can break through to this truth. The
              signs are not so easy to read. The conditioning is so strong. However
              we are fortunatethat we have the seeds. The seeds are being planted in
              our minds through the Buddha's teaching. You have heard the
              possibility, rather than hearing over and over again that the real you
              is within you, the soul - and after it dies it will go to heaven or
              hell. That is the real self. You believe it whether you understand or
              not. Maybe actually there is nobody there, nobody at home at all. So
              you can't forget that now. So when your mind is strong enough, through
              the practice of meditation, this inquiry will start. What is it that is
              me? What is it that I take myself to be? Look with clarity and
              attention, and it is possible to realise directly the teaching of
              non-self. The only time that one can really understand is when you see
              it with insight. Until then we can appreciate logically and
              intellectually, think about it, but we cannot have that direct seeing.
              Until we have that direct seeing we do not have right view. We cannot
              have the right view with regard to the nature of the body and mind. So
              one needs to get this as a personal subjective experience through
              insight. However it is sufficient for now to dwell and point out what
              the Buddha taught about anatta. <br> <br>There is no self in this body or in the
              mind process. I stress the word process because the body and the mind
              is not one lump of stationary matter and stationary mental states. It
              is an ongoing process, dynamically moving, changing always, and
              becoming something else, and this is when we come to the other aspects
              of the teaching of the Buddha. When there is no self how can this
              continue, how can it keep going? What is there if there is no self, if
              there is no one there? How does this function? Here the Buddha mentions
              the fundamental laws that operate in the universe. They are not created
              by anybody. They are not dependent on somebody's power. The existence
              of samsara implies these laws. The laws imply samsara. This is what
              samsara is. These are the laws that control it. These fundamental laws
              can be broken down into several. The broadest one is the law of
              conditionality. Usually we say that this is the law of cause and
              effect. This is not a good terminology because it is much more
              complicated than that. It is the law of conditionality. Broadly
              speaking, what it means is that, whatever arises, arises from
              conditions. When the conditions are there the result comes about. When
              the conditions are not there the result cannot come about. The Buddha
              expressed in a very succinct statement:</p>
              <blockquote> When this is, that is.
                      <br>When this arises, that arises.
                      <br>When this is not, that is not.
                      <br>When this ceases, that ceases.
                      <br> </blockquote>
              <p>You
              can apply this to a whole range of phenomena, physical and mental,
              internal or external, animate or inanimate. It is just a fundamental
              law that operates all the time without somebody ruling over it. That is
              all inclusive. There is nothing outside it. According to the law of
              conditionality based on conditions the results come about. When the
              conditions are not there the results cannot come about. <br> <br>I often repeat this story - how a
              Buddhist and a Christian may perceive something. When I was in Perth
              monastery, it was raining and some people came to the monastery with
              some children. They were Christian children. Only the parents were
              Buddhist. I asked the children why it is raining, and they said because
              God makes the rain. I said I don't believe that. They asked me what I
              think about why it rains. I said because the conditions are right for
              it to rain - the atmospheric conditions, the temperature, wind and the
              clouds, and because everything is right for it to rain and it rains.
              Not because it is somebody's will to make it rain. This is an
              impersonal law, it is not biased. Completely unbiased and fair in its
              operation. It operates at the internal level too. <br> <br>The law of kamma basically is that
              dependent on what we intentionally do, through body, speech and mind,
              there will be results. The nature of these results will be determined
              by the nature of the intention. If the intention behind the action is
              wholesome, the result will be pleasant or wholesome. If the nature of
              the action is unwholesome, the result will be unpleasant. This is the
              specific application of the law of conditionality. Dependent on the
              causes the result will come about. <br> <br>Volition is one area of consciousness
              where the human mind has the ability to will. We can will the body to
              action, we can will our speech or thought. Quite often this is the
              mental attribute that people identify most strongly with as mine. If
              you have been meditating for some time you will probably know what I
              mean. When you look into yourself or listen to yourself, what does me
              identify mostly with? I 'will', so it must be me. I am the one who is
              doing this. I am the one who is asking and I am the one who is
              answering. I can choose to stand up or sit down. This must be me. We
              identify strongly with our will, intention or volition, because it
              appears to be the centre. But this is also no-self, and this is where
              you have to apply your attention very carefully. Even the volition is
              conditioned. Why do you will something? Why do you choose something?
              Why do you choose to come to the BSV and not go somewhere else? You
              have a choice. There is a volition there. That volition was conditioned
              by previous experience, thoughts, feelings and previous volition etc.
              So that volition or choice is not an independent thing. The choice that
              we make is also conditioned. Why do you think, why do you act, and
              speak the way you do, the choices you make? It is the result of past
              conditioning. <br> <br>So even our choice (cetana),
              intention, or volition is kamma. This aspect of our mind is conditioned
              by the past. The fundamental force that drives us to make choices is
              the quest for happiness. Your volition comes from the quest for
              happiness. Your experience in the quest for happiness helps to shape
              your volitions, and in what directions they will drive you. So when you
              have this volition, intention to do, to speak and think, it is a force.
              Having spoken, having acted, having thought, is a force set in motion.
              It will have its consequences. It will shape something in the future.
              Immediately it will shape the state of your mind psychologically. You
              think an angry thought, or speak angrily, you will feel associated with
              it a negative state of mind. Psychologically you get a reaction almost
              immediately. But there will probably be other results, which can come
              later on, because you have set something in motion, and that will or
              intention is like sowing a seed. It will bring some growth with results
              and fruits. This is the law of kamma. Each volitional act will bring
              results which psychologically may be very quick, but quite often may
              take some time, to come about. The Buddha said that some results come
              in this life and some in future lives. The nature of the volition will
              determine the nature of the result. <br> <br>Now at the time of death what will
              happen? Imagine how strong this force is. See it now in your life while
              you are living. This will or force that animates this body to walk
              around, drive it for how many years, to do this and that. Do you think
              at death this force will just expire and go into nothingness? The
              Buddha said it does not. This force, this volition which is kamma, at
              the time of death will in itself, just like any other force, cause the
              arising of a new conscious moment, as it does in the present existence.
              Consciousness is an arising and a ceasing. It is flowing, but that does
              not mean it is smooth. It is always arising and ceasing. Every
              conscious state of mind is flicking into existence and passing away. If
              you pay attention you can see that. <br> <br>At the time of death as the mind
              ceases, the last ceasing consciousnessin this body causes the arising
              of consciousness in a new body, with a new physical base. And what
              arises is determined by the quality of the consciousness at the time of
              death. The quality of the previous consciousness conditions the arising
              of the new consciousness. <br> <br>Now if there is no self, if there is no
              one there, can this process really continue like this on and on? The
              question that is often put is, if there is no self, the person who is
              going to inherit the kamma is a different person than that who he now
              is. Is it not? Why should I care? I am not going to get the results. I
              can do what I want. That poor guy down the road is going to get all the
              results. <br> <br>It is interesting as an abstract
              thought. You can contemplate what you are experiencing now. Who is
              experiencing if there is no self? There is still experience. There is
              pleasure and pain, pleasant and unpleasant experience. There is no
              self, but the feeling is real, the state of mind is real, the happiness
              and unhappiness is real. These are real states of the mind though there
              is no self experiencing them. These states come about from past causes.
              The person who caused those conditions for the present state was you,
              or someone else. It does not matter. You are experiencing it now and it
              is a reality. <br> <br>The Buddha's teaching is that there is
              an individuality in this process. The individuality of the process is
              there, the continuity of the mind and body in this life, conventionally
              speaking. You are the mind and the body process and there is a
              continuity and an individuality of the process. It's your mind and body
              and not my mind and body which continues from birth to death in this
              life. But there is the same continuity and individuality into the next
              life. You don't get cross wires. Your stream of mind and body does not
              get mixed up with my stream of mind and body. My state of mind and body
              does not get mixed up in what is in your account and vice versa. It
              stays in each person's account. There is a continuity in this stream of
              mind and body and this is the law of kamma. The individuality is there
              but there is no individual in it. So what you do now will bring about
              results down the road.</p>
              <h4>Who will experience it?</h4>
              <p>You
              will be there just as much as you are here now. You are here now just
              as much as you were present in this stream 100 years ago or a thousand
              lifetimes ago. You were just as much you then, as you are now. And as
              long as you are this stream now you will be the same stream a thousand
              lifetimes in the future.</p>
              <h4>What is the experiencing?</h4>
              <p>There
              is the pleasure, there is pain, there is suffering and happiness. How
              do you feel about pain and suffering now? It is not liked by anyone,
              whether it is you or another. It is the same a thousand lifetimes
              before, as now. The relationship with the experience is the same. No
              one likes pain. Even though there is no you like a constant personal
              entity in this stream, still there is this relationship that pain and
              unhappiness is not wanted. It is difficult to bear. So we don't create
              conditions that bring about this suffering. The person who is sitting
              here now is not completely different from the person who came here last
              week, but not completely the same person either. Dependent on the past
              the present is, dependent on the present the future will be. So the
              idea of kamma simply implies that the way we live, what we do
              intentionally, volitionally, will have consequences. <br> <br>Not as punishment, not as reward. There
              is none who punishes, and none who rewards. That is because it is a law
              of nature, the law of conditionality. Volitional action will bring
              about results, and the nature of the results is determined by the
              nature of the volitional action. If it is positive it will bring about
              positive results, and of course if negative, unhappy results will
              follow and our relationship to the pleasant or unpleasant experience
              will be the same in the future as it is now. We do not want to be with
              that which is unpleasant. So the Buddha encourages over and over again,
              to cultivate good kamma. <br> <br>Feel what you feel now, and you will
              know the importance of planting the right seed for the future. There is
              no contradiction at all in the teaching of anatta and kamma. They flow
              together very well because of the law of dependent origination and the
              law of kamma. That is why it works the way it does, without anybody
              ordering it. It is orderly by its very nature. Any teaching that has
              got the teaching of kamma could be expected to sow the seeds of
              goodness. Any teaching which denies the law of kamma would open the
              door to irresponsible selfishness because you can get away with it. <br> <br>So this is considered the basic
              quality of a religion or philosophy, which will bring about good social
              structure and personal relationship, good moral standards, good
              virtuous upright living. It does not matter whether people have
              different religious beliefs, if they have the law of kamma by whatever
              word they call it, they can live together. It does not contradict with
              the law of anatta. Because there is no one driving, no one in the
              driver's seat, the laws operate and everything is orderly. No
              punishment, no reward, on favours, just orderly.</p>

              <p>It is certainly true that consciousness is holographic and non local. Otherwise how can you explain things like telepathy, clairvoyance, remote viewing, etc. However in Buddhism we do not talk about a common source, a supreme consciousness.</p>
              <p>However at a certain stage of experience, it will certainly appear that there is an ultimate supreme consciousness that is the common source of all things. This is not yet the Buddhist level of enlightenment, but can be anywhere up to Stage 4 of <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">Thusness/PasserBy's

              <p><em><br> When we look at Buddhism, Buddhism is very 
                  consistent. Why do I say
                                          that Buddhism is very consistent? Not because I 
                  like Buddhism. You
                                          see, a person saying that I have experienced 
                  Presence, and I AM the
                                          Eternal Witness, I AM God, I AM all powerful and
                   I AM the First
                                          Cause, and yet, they see a dualistic world. This
                   is in total
                                          conflict; this has totally no logic at all. 
                  Because, you see, in
                                          Buddhism when we talk about Non-Duality, we are 
                  saying something
                                          like the Dependent Origination. Because of This,
                   That Is. This
                                          arises, That arises. This ceases, That ceases. 
                  We look at the
                                          entire formation, there is no Â“Who?Â” Where is 
                  the Â“Who?Â” When we
                                          ask Â“Where?Â”, there is no Â“Where?Â”. When we ask 
                  Â“When?Â”, there is
                                          no Â“When?Â” It can be 10 million miles away. It 
                  can be in another
                                          planet. The teaching is consistent. It does not 
                  require a Â“WhoÂ”, a
                                          Â“WhereÂ”, a Â“WhenÂ”. Condition arises, it is 
                  there. It is not stored
                                          in any place, or anywhere. This is the teaching.
                   The entire
                                          teaching is consistent when it comes to the 
                  practise. They didnÂ’t
                                          say Concentration can lead to Insight. They tell
                   you, Vipashyana
                                          Meditation can lead to Insight of what Reality 
                  is all about. It
                                          does not teach that there is a Self. The Buddha 
                  taught the three
                                          dharma seals: there is No-Self. So the teaching 
                  is consistent in
                                          terms of philosophy, in terms of meditation 
                  practice, and in terms
                                          of the truths that is being preached.<br><br> And also in terms of spiritual powers. When I 
                  say something like
                                          Clairvoyance... I can see, not bounded by 
                  distance. I can hear, not
                                          bounded by distance. How come? Why? If we were 
                  to take other
                                          religions, they canÂ’t explain. But if you were 
                  to take Buddhism,
                                          Buddha had never told you, has never taught, 
                  something of an Ego,
                                          something of a Where, something of a When. It is
                   not bounded by
                                          Time and Space at all in the entire philosophy. 
                  Never has he taught
                                          anything like that. And therefore, when we talk 
                  about spiritual
                                          powers, it is consistent. It is knowing without 
                  the need for a
                                          Space and Time, not bounded by Space and Time, 
                  because the entire
                                          teaching is so. And what is being said about 
                  this? It is the
                                          Nature. This is your nature. Reality is like 
                  that, it is so.
                                          Therefore, when we understand the teachings, we 
                  understand that
                                          yes, it is not right to be attached, therefore 
                  we cannot say we
                                          want to seek spiritual powers, like Nub. But we 
                  have to understand,
                                          this is our Nature, this is our Reality. Because
                   the teaching has
                                          never contradicted itself. If you want to know 
                  about your reality,
                                          you have to practise. That is the teaching. And 
                  the practise has
                                          always been telling you to observe these 3 
                  universal
                                          characteristics. So when we see the link between
                   the practise, the
                                          philosophy, even something spiritual and 
                  something that is not
                                          scientific. This is important.</em></p>
              <p><em>..............</em></p>
              <p><em><br> Because there is nothing that is telling them 
                  there is a kind of
                                          understanding or there is a kind of experience 
                  that is not like
                                          that. You were taught like that. You get it? 
                  Like in Buddhism they
                                          teach you otherwise. They teach you not to see 
                  things in terms of
                                          Â“IÂ”, not to see things in terms of a Â“whereÂ” and
                   a Â“whenÂ”. LetÂ’s
                                          say something very simple. When I say that 
                  things happen, it is not
                                          like those people that subscribe to think that 
                  anything is just
                                          taking by itself, itÂ’s nature. Mainly what is 
                  important is
                                          conditions. You must have the conditions, then 
                  things can surface.
                                          When the conditions is there, they just 
                  surfaces, and manifest. If
                                          there is cause in ten million miles away or ten 
                  million light years
                                          away, or whatever it is, or in other realms, as 
                  long as there is
                                          conditions, it WILL surface, it is not 
                  travelling {inaudible}. Can
                                          you understand this part? Condition is there, 
                  they just manifest.
                                          This is one thing.</em></p>

              <p><strong>The End of Suffering<br> (Running time = 36 mins)</strong><br> <br> Regina first interviewed Russell Targ almost 21 
                  years ago just
                                          before he was leaving for the Soviet Union to 
                  take part in an
                                          experiment with Brezhnev's psychic healer, in 
                  what was to become a
                                          well known documentation on the efficacy of 
                  remote viewing for
                                          military purposes.<br> <br> Russell Targ is a physicist and author who has 
                  devoted much of his
                                          professional career to the research of the human
                   capacity for
                                          psychic ability. In 1972, he co-founded the 
                  Stanford Research
                                          Institute's federally-funded program that 
                  investigated psychic
                                          abilities in humans. The program provided 
                  invaluable information
                                          and techniques to various government 
                  intelligence agencies,
                                          including the DIA, the CIA, NASA, and Army 
                  Intelligence. In his ten
                                          years with the program, Targ co-published his 
                  findings in some of
                                          the most prestigious scientific journals. He is

                                          Recently retiring from his position as senior 
                  staff scientist at
                                          Lockheed Martin, Russell now devotes his time to
                   ESP research and
                                          offering workshops on remote viewing and 
                  spiritual healing.<br> <br> In an abstract from a research paper, Russell 
                  said, "Since ancient
                                          times spiritual teachers have described paths 
                  and practices that a
                                          person could follow to achieve health, 
                  happiness, and peace of
                                          mind. A considerable body of recent research 
                  indicates that any
                                          kind of spiritual practice is likely to improve 
                  ones prognosis for
                                          recovering from a serious illness. Many of these
                   approaches to
                                          spirituality involve learning to quiet the mind,
                   rather than
                                          adhering to a prescribed religious belief. These
                   meditative
                                          practices are inherent aspects of Buddhism, 
                  Hinduism, mystical
                                          Christianity, Kabalistic Judaism, Sufism, and 
                  other mystic paths.
                                          What is indicated in the subtext of these 
                  teachings is that as one
                                          learns to quiet his or her mind, one is likely 
                  to encounter
                                          psychic-like experiences or perceptions. For 
                  example, in The Sutras
                                          of Patanjali, the Hindu master tells us that on 
                  the way to
                                          transcendence we may experience many kinds of 
                  amazing visions, such
                                          as the ability to see into the distance, or into
                   the future; and to
                                          diagnose illnesses, and also to cure them. 
                  However, we are
                                          admonished not to become attached to these 
                  abilities - that they
                                          are mere phenomena standing as stumbling blocks 
                  on the path to
                                          enlightenment. In this paper, I will describe my
                   recent experience
                                          in teaching remote viewing at three workshops in
                   Italy, in which we
                                          emphasize expanded awareness of who we are, 
                  rather than an ability
                                          to find car keys and parking spaces. Our 
                  spiritual approach, did
                                          not interfere with all three of these groups 
                  demonstrating highly
                                          significant remote viewing in a double-blind 
                  setting."</p>

              <p><br> The metaphor of Indra's Jeweled Net is 
              attributed to an ancient
                                      Buddhist named Tu-Shun (557-640 B.C.E.) who asks
               us to envision a
                                      vast net that:<br> <br> * at each juncture there lies a jewel;<br> * each jewel reflects all the other jewels in 
              this cosmic
                                      matrix.<br> * Every jewel represents an individual life 
              form, atom, cell or
                                      unit of consciousness.<br> * Each jewel, in turn, is intrinsically and 
              intimately connected to
                                      all the others;<br> * thus, a change in one gem is reflected in all 
              the others.<br> <br> This last aspect of the jeweled net is explored 
              in a
                                      question/answer dialog of teacher and student in
               the Avatamsaka
                                      Sutra. In answer to the question: "how can all 
              these jewels be
                                      considered one jewel?" it is replied: "If you 
              don't believe that
                                      one jewel...is all the jewels...just put a dot 
              on the jewel [in
                                      question]. When one jewel is dotted, there are 
              dots on all the
                                      jewels...Since there are dots on all the 
              jewels...We know that all
                                      the jewels are one jewel" ...".<br> <br> The moral of Indra's net is that the 
              compassionate and the
                                      constructive interventions a person makes or 
              does can produce a
                                      ripple effect of beneficial action that will 
              reverberate throughout
                                      the universe or until it plays out. By the same 
              token you cannot
                                      damage one strand of the web without damaging 
              the others or setting
                                      off a cascade effect of destruction.<br> <br> Source: Awakening 101<br> <br> ...One of the images used to illustrate the 
              nature of reality as
                                      understood in Mahayana is The Jewel Net of 
              Indra. According to this
                                      image, all reality is to be understood on 
              analogy with Indra's Net.
                                      This net consists entirely of jewels. Each jewel
               reflects all of
                                      the other jewels, and the existence of each 
              jewel is wholly
                                      dependent on its reflection in all of the other 
              jewels. As such,
                                      all parts of reality are interdependent with 
              each other, but even
                                      the most basic parts of existence have no 
              independent existence
                                      themselves. As such, to the degree that reality 
              takes form and
                                      appears to us, it is because the whole arises in
               an interdependent
                                      matrix of parts to whole and of subject to 
              object. But in the end,
                                      there is nothing (literally no-thing) there to

              <p>When I was trying to come to a decision regarding the look and feel 
              of my new web site, 
              I wanted to employ a background image that had universal import and 
              could point the way to an adequate
              description of the nature or reality. A tall order, if not impossible, 
              but the choice was clear: Indra's Net.</p>
              <p>There are several aspects of Indra's Net, as described in the 
              above quote, that signify it as a crystal
              clear allegory of reality:</p>
              <p><strong>1. The Holographic Nature of the Universe</strong></p>
              <p>Long before the existence of the hologram, the jeweled net is an 
              excellent description of 
              the special characteristic of holograms: that every point of the 
              hologram contains information
              regarding all other points. This reflective nature of the jewels is an 
              obvious reference to this.</p>
              <p>This kind of analogy has been suggested by science as a theory 
              for an essential characteristic
              of the cosmos, as well as as the functioning of the human brain, as 
              beautifully described in
               <a id="normlink" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060922583/o/qid=989291952/sr=8-1/ref=aps_sr_b_1_1/104-6271871-0654346"> The Holograpic Universe</a> by Michael Talbot.</p>
              <p><strong>2. The Interconnectedness of All Thingss</strong></p>
              <p>When any jewel in the net is touched, all other jewels in the 
              node are affected. This speaks
              to the hidden interconnectedness and interdependency of everything and 
              everyone 
              in the universe, and has an indirect reference to the concept of 
              "Dependent Origination" in 
              Buddhism. Additionally, Indra's Net is a definitive ancient correlate of
               Bell's Theorum, 
              or the theory of non-local causes.</p>
              <p><strong>3. Lack of a substantive self</strong></p>
              <p>Each node, representing an individual, simply reflects the 
              qualities of all other nodes,
              inferring the notion of 'not-self' or a lack of a solid and real 
              inherent self, as seen in
              the Advaita Vedanta school of Hinduism and Buddhism in general.</p>
              <p><strong>4. Non-locality</strong></p>
              <p>Indra's Net shoots holes in the assumption or imputation of a 
              solid and fixed universe
              'out there'. The capacity of one jewel  to reflect the light of another 
              jewel from the other edge 
              of infinity is something that is difficult for the linear mind, rational
               mind to comprehend. The
              fact that all nodes are simply reflections indicates that there is no 
              particular single source 
              point from where it all arises.</p>
              <p><strong>5. Innate Wisdom</strong></p>
              <p>The ability to reflect the entirety of all light in the universe 
              attests to the inherent 
              transcendant wisdom that is at the core of all nodes, representing all 
              sentient  beings,
              and to the inherent Buddha Nature.</p>
              <p><strong>6. Illusion or Maya</strong></p>
              <p>The fact that all nodes are simply a reflection of all others 
              implies the illusory nature of
              all appearances. Appearances are thus not reality but a reflection of 
              reality.</p>
              <p><strong>7. Universal Creativity</strong></p>
              <p>A familiar concept in various high dharmas is one of an 
              impersonal creative
              intelligence that springs forth into reality through the instruments of 
              all living beings.</p>
              <p><strong>8. The Mirror-like Nature of Mind</strong></p>
              <p>The capacity to reflect all things attests to the mind being a 
              mirror of reality, 
              not its basis. This is a common thesis among various schools and 
              religions.</p>
              <p>And Indra's Net has been used as a defining metaphor for the 
              Internet. One major
              web hosting site is <a id="normlink" href="http://www.indra.com/">www.indra.com</a>.</p>
              <p>The following are some quotes and interesting web sites regarding
               Indra's Net:</p>
              <hr>
              <p>Indra's Net is a core metaphor of HuaYen.</p>
              <p>Stephen Mitchell, in his book The Enlightened Mind, wrote:</p>
              <p>"The Net of Indra is a profound and subtle metaphor for the 
              structure of
              reality. Imagine a vast net; at each crossing point there is a jewel; 
              each
              jewel is perfectly clear and reflects all the other jewels in the net, 
              the
              way two mirrors placed opposite each other will reflect an image ad
              infinitum. The jewel in this metaphor stands for an individual being, or
               an
              individual consciousness, or a cell or an atom. Every jewel is 
              intimately
              connected with all other jewels in the universe, and a change in one 
              jewel
              means a change, however slight, in every other jewel."</p>
              <p>(It's also interesting to note that contemporary physicists are 
              in general
              agreement that this ancient metaphor is indeed a good description for 
              the
              universe.)</p>
