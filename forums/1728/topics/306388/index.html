              <p>I wish:</p>
              <p>1) For myself to quickly become a non-regressing Bodhisattva in wisdom and compassion, so that I can teach different people according to their capabilities and power of understanding. I want to 'teach and explain Buddhist concepts in a customised way like Buddha. I don't want to teach Buddhist concepts in a general way, for it does not benefit slow learners like myself.</p>
              <p>2) For Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva to manifest as a capable, wise and kind young man with strong leadership, passionate in his aims to spread the Dharma in Singapore and throughout the world.</p>
              <p>We need leadership of the wise and saintly. We need people who can truly understand the different learning capabilities of every man and woman. We need people who can totally understand and help solve the various root defilements in each person, Buddhist or non-Buddhist.</p>
              <p>Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva would be able to truly empathise with all of us as he can see and understand perfectly with his spiritual insight the various mental and emotional defilements accumulated in every person through countless rebirths.</p>
              <p>A mere human can't do it. No matter how compassionate or wise he/she is, he cannot truly empathise and understand how that person became what he/she is now.</p>
              <p>If he's a bad-tempered person, why? Due to his present environment and personal choices alone? If he's a person who likes to manipulate people for his own gains, how did he become such a person? We can at most tell fellow men and Buddhists to practise Vipassana to attain super-clear awareness of mind and heart, but that's about it. Unlike the Buddha and high level Bodhisattvas, who can teach according to each person's level of understanding and unique inclinations towards certain dharma doors.</p>
              <p>In the sutra of Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva Original vows, those who wholeheartedly recite the name of Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva or does the following things as provided in the quote from the sutra below, they will undoubtedly be able to recall their previous lives and would hence be able to see the root causes of their suffering and joy.</p>

              <p>3) The final one would be to eventually see a <span style="color: #993366;"><strong>unified</strong></span> Buddhist movement in the near future. Unity is strength. By pooling together all human and logistical resources, we can spread the dharma better to the masses. Buddhism should have a clear message; something that even a kid could easily understand or a stubborn man/woman can grow to respect and eventually accept.</p>

              <p>Though I must reiterate what Thusness said:</p>
              <p><strong><br> Of all teachings, no teaching is more important then a direct
                                          ‘touch’ of our Buddha essence; but of all dangers, none is more
                                          dangerous than misinterpreting our essence after the ‘touch’. </strong></p>
              <p><strong> The ‘touch’ of the pure sense of existence is often wrongly
                                          understood due to our karmic tendencies.  Use the doctrine of
                                          Anatta and Emptiness as antidote. </strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In Longchen's article which he wrote the realisations he gained from his spiritual journey, <a title="http://www.dreamdatum.com/enlightenment-state.html" href="http://www.dreamdatum.com/enlightenment-state.html">http://www.dreamdatum.com/enlightenment-state.html</a></p>
              <p><br> <strong>Also, during the earlier stages we may mistaken another state to
                  be the pure pristine presence. For example, we may mistaken 'I AM' or
                  the Eternal Witness for pure presence. This is because the thinking
                  mind has created a seemingly constant image of Pure Presence. This
                  image is the I AM or Eternal Witness, as it is commonly described.
                  Basically, at this stage, the true characteristic of Presence is not
                  being clearly understood.</strong></p>
              <p>Longchen further wrote in <a title="http://www.dreamdatum.com/nondual-experience.html" href="http://www.dreamdatum.com/nondual-experience.html">http://www.dreamdatum.com/nondual-experience.html</a> :<br> <br> <strong>Non-duality is NOT the same as a state of Witnessing Presence observing Phenomenality.</strong> An Eternal Witnessing Presence that is apart from Phenomena cannot be
              said to be non dual as there are two components here (witness and
              phenomena). This experience is characterised by a non-judging watcher
              observing the world and mind. I had this experience before. And now, I
              must say that true non-duality is distinctively different from this.
              The witness/watcher is really not separated from the rest of the world
              . It (this witness) is not unchanging, but is simply a knowingness that
              is not apart from the flow of phenomenality. <br> <br> Non duality
              can only be stably experienced when the 'sense of self' and the
              'Eternal Witness' are correctly understood for what they are.</p>

                  is constantly seeking happiness in this world. However, no matter how hard it tries, it is
                  somehow unable to find happiness. Instead, it encounters calamities and more calamities.
                  In fact, all these calamities are the creation of the mind.</strong></span>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000a0; font-size: x-small;">In the beginning of this earth, there were only the
                  heavenly and human realms of existence. The realms of hell, hungry ghost, animal and asura
                  did not exist. But, as humanity progressed through time, the human mind began to change.
                  They developed more and more affinity for evil - greed, anger, ignorance, delusion and
                  foolish thoughts which gave rise to the acts of killing, stealing and sexual misconduct.
                  Happiness gradually diminished and the six realms of cyclic existence evolved out of
                  humanity’s evil mind.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000a0; font-size: x-small;">In today’s society, the
                  unhappiness of human beings largely results from the countless evil deeds that he has
                  committed. These evil deeds stem mainly from three karma - our bodily action, speech and
                  thought. Thoughts are basically our thinking. If our thoughts are filled with evil
                  thinkings, these will be manifested in our actions. For example, our unkind thoughts of
                  someone may translate into harsh words from our mouth or even into a painful action with
                  our hands. When we do these, we are creating evil karma.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000a0; font-size: x-small;">Our thoughts generate greed, anger
                  and delusions. Through our speech - in the form of telling lies, frivolous talk,
                  slandering and rude or harsh speech; and through our bodily actions by way of killing,
                  stealing and sexual misconduct. This is just a simple explanation. It would be endless to
                  go into details. These three karma bring upon ourselves a lot of sufferings and
                  unhappiness. Therefore, if humanity wants to achieve happiness in life, then he should try
                  to eradicate all these evil deeds which stem from greed, anger, ignorance, killing,
                  stealing and sexual misconduct.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000a0; font-size: x-small;">Many religions teach us to do good
                  and avoid doing bad. Buddhism, in particular, besides teaching us to refrain from all evil
                  deeds and to do all good deeds, also teaches us to purify our minds. Once we have a
                  healthy mental culture, naturally our minds will not be filled with greed, anger,
                  ignorance, and other evil thoughts and actions. We must be aware that the mind controls
                  our speech and actions, it all arises from our minds. Minds are also our thoughts. It is
                  because humanity lacks wisdom and awareness that we are constantly deceived by our minds.
                  We fail to understand the real meaning of karma, or cause and effect. We do not know if
                  our actions will hurt ourselves or others; or if they are beneficial or harmful. Hence,
                  unhappiness and sufferings follow.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000a0; font-size: x-small;">Humanity wants happiness and
                  dislikes sufferings. But, due to the lack of wisdom, we do not know how to free ourselves
                  from our sufferings. However, if we learn from Buddha’s teachings - practise to
                  purify the three karma of bodily actions, speech and thoughts, our wisdom can be
                  cultivated. Once we have wisdom, whatever we think, speak and do, the actions will be
                  beneficial to ourselves, to others and to the world. These eventually lead to happiness
                  and the world will be filled with brightness and hope. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000a0; font-size: x-small;">Henceforth, we can say that the
                  culture of Buddhism is also Blissful Culture.</span></strong></p>

                  then it is very vulnerable to falling and breakage. To replace the broken cup means having
                  to sacrifice twice. If a child places the tea cup at the edge of the table, then the
                  mother will quickly exhort him to move it to the centre. Adults understand the need to put
                  it at the centre of the table, but young children don’t. In fact, this is a precept.</strong></span>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000a0; font-size: x-small;">The regulations about what can or cannot be done are
                  precepts. In fact, everyone needs to observe precepts and be good citizens. Good citizens
                  need to abide by the laws, and that is observing the precepts. Therefore, Jen Chen
                  Buddhism refer to precepts as ‘means of safeguarding blessings’.
                  ‘Safeguarding blessings’ means safeguarding our own blessings, the blessings
                  which resulted from the virtuous deeds committed in the past. This is analogous to putting
                  the tea cup in the proper place. In fact, all the </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #800040; font-size: x-small;"><em>*Dharma Doors</em></span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000a0; font-size: x-small;"> taught by Buddhism is the Voice of Bliss. This Voice of Bliss is spoken by Buddha for all
                  of us. All the teachings of Buddha are meant for we, human beings, to attain the highest
                  order of bliss. If everyone comes to learn Buddhism, cultivate and achieve the pure
                  Nirvana, then, of course, that is the highest, fullest and most complete, and most
                  ultimate bliss. Therefore, the culture of Buddhism is Bliss Culture.<br> <br> In many countries, particularly Europe and America, people generally understand what is a
                  Bliss Culture. But, they do not necessarily know what is Buddhism Culture. Therefore, we
                  refer to ‘Buddhism Culture’ as ‘Bliss Culture’. The sutras expounded
                  by Sakyamuni Buddha is the standard for Bliss Culture. And, when promoted in this manner,
                  in time to come the entire humanity of the world will be able to pursue the principles

                  or how to have a good wife in order for the family to have bliss. In this manner, the

                  happiness means going to the Western Pure Land. In fact, it is not only this. When we
                  distance from suffering and attain happiness, we have to instantaneously distance from
                  suffering, instantaneously attain happiness and liberation. Some people may be suspicious;
                  how can liberation be attained so easily? In fact, it is very simple. If someone scolds
                  you, and you apologize to him, then that is a small liberation. If someone hits you, and
                  you retaliate; an eye for an eye, then isn’t that very miserable? What happen if that
                  results in loss of life? Even though you are rude to me, I will still apologise very
                  politely to you. Isn’t that being liberated? This is Jen Chen Buddhism’s
                  teaching of liberation. If whilst alive, we cannot even attain small liberation’s
                  like this, then what more to say of liberation after death? In the course of our daily
                  lives, if we are liberated at every moment, then in time to come we will be able to attain
                  the great liberation. Please think it over, isn’t this a very blissful? This is but
                  to use a small matter to illustrate the path of liberation. If we are able to understand
                  more of the Buddha-Dharma and apply them in our life, family, society, country, and to the
                  extent of the entire humanity of the world, then isn’t this a great bliss culture?

                  bad conduct and habits. Our conduct is manifested in our physical actions, speech and
                  thoughts. If we often have wild thoughts, then we have to cultivate mental purity; if our
                  words often harm others, then we have to cultivate purity in our speech; if we are always
                  getting into fights, then we should cultivate purity in our physical actions. Some people
                  have the notion that cultivation is a matter only for monks and nuns. In fact, cultivation
                  is for the entire humanity; all human beings need to cultivate. So long as our conduct is
                  poor, we need to cultivate. Just like a vehicle that has broken down, it needs to be

                  means meditating in high mountains, and praying to the Buddha. This is not true. We need
                  to cultivate amidst our activities. What is most important is to get rid of our self
                  serving and evil habits. Just like "One who respects others shall receive respect
                  himself; one who abuses others shall be abused himself; one who hurt others shall be hurt
                  himself", if we will treat others with respect, others will accord us with the same

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000a0; font-size: x-small;"><strong>The monks of the Sangha have to observe two hundred and fifty
                  precepts while the nuns have more than three hundred. Lay Buddhists of the society,
                  however, do not really require so many precepts. They only need to observe Five Precepts:
                  refrain from killing, stealing, lying, sexual misconduct and the consumption of
                  intoxicants. If as a human being you cannot observe these Five Precepts, then you really
                  have to examine yourself. On the other hand, if your conduct does not violate these Five
                  Precepts, then what hinderances are these to you? In addition, one needs to take refuge in
                  the Three Treasures: the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha, and be a disciple of the Three
                  Treasures. As for observing the Five Precepts, it is a separate matter. One can either
                  observe them fully or even partially.</strong></span></p>

                  feel that you need to say things that are not true, then for a start you need not observe
                  the precept of not lying. But, later when your friends find you untrustworthy and begin to
                  avoid you, then you will realize that it is good to observe the precept of not lying.
                  Then, you can begin to put it into practice.</strong></span></p>

                  intoxicants such as alcholic drinks, if you feel that as a businessman you need to
                  entertain your business associates and drink with them, then it is permissible. However,
                  you should not over indulge to the extent that you become intoxicated and terminate your
                  wisdom. Thus, precepts uphold our bliss. According to Jen Chen Buddhism, precepts are
                  "methods of safeguarding blessings". When we know that observing the precepts
                  will uphold the bliss, blessing and well being of the family, I believe each and everyone
                  of us will observe them.</strong></span></p>

                  misconduct, surely there should not be any other sexual relationships besides that between
                  husband and wife. If one does not observe his role and flirts with other women, there will
                  be a lot of trouble in the family when the wife finds out about it. Worse still, the
                  consequences would be unthinkable should one contracts sexually transmitted diseases
                  through his sexual misconduct. Thus, observing these precepts can indeed enable one’s

                      wayward superstitious ways of the ghosts and deities. Thus, they descended to the ghost
                      realm when they died. Some of them may be better off then others. They may be more
                      intelligent, had performed good deeds before and had more blessings. They become deities
                      and are called blessed ghosts and deities. Similarly, some human beings are better off
                      than others; they hold high offices or they may be very wealthy. However, ghosts and
                      deities live in darkness. They do not have brightness. On the other hand, human beings
                      belong to one of the three good realms. Because in their previous lives they practised the
                      Five Precepts and performed the Ten Virtuous Deeds, therefore in their present lives they

                  Buddha at every moment. In this way, the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas will naturally shelter
                  us. Our wisdom will unfold, and with wisdom naturally bliss will follow. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000a0; font-size: x-small;">It is hoped that every Buddhist
                  will be able to apply the principles of Buddhism in their daily lives and practise
                  diligently. Furthermore, we should not only seek the assistance of the Ksitigarbha
                  (Ti-Zhang) Bodhisattva in reducing our negative karma, the Avalokitesvara (Kuan-Yin)
                  Bodhisattva in reducing our suffering and difficulties, but also to pay reverence to
                  Manjusri (Wen-Shu) Bodhisattva to cultivate according to the Dharma and to seek to unfold
                  our wisdom. When we have wisdom, regardless of what we do or whom we deal with, be it our
                  school works, occupation or bringing up our children, we will always be successful. At the
                  same time we need to widely perform virtuous deeds, and nurture our blessings and

                  may feel working hard for a living and to raise and support their family is most
                  meaningful. Thus, due to the differences in an individual’s outlook, experience and

                  living. But to live meaningfully, we must pursue bliss. I believe that is also our common
                  objective. What Buddhism teaches is a bliss culture, so let us promote this bliss culture

              <p>Thanks for the encouragement. I still don't really understand the concept of 'Anatta' and Emptiness. And my main worry is as mentioned by you, misinterpreting the Buddha essence after the 'touch'.</p>

              <p>The experiences that you have mentioned could be what practioners of meditation would encounter as they advance in their practice. It may indeed be too real and blissful to discard. I used 'may' cos I have not practised and hence no experience of it.</p>
              <p>I have no idea at all why these experience are distorted, but a simple reason would be that due to our ignorance of the different types of samadhi (states of single-pointedness and non-ego achieved during deep meditation), we become attached to the blissful meditative states and are unable to progress further to understand and experience true emptiness - our Buddha nature.</p>

              <p>There are a few points I would like to highlight...</p>
              <p>The first is, that even glimpse after glimpse of our non-conceptual nature, we are still unable to rid ourselves of the subtle influence of our deeply held dualistic and inherent views. This is Thusness's point number 2.</p>
              <p>The second is the method of practice... whenever we ask "Who am I?" The natural answer is "I Am". The method itself is already a product of this tendency of seeing things inherently and dualistically. That tendency is "ignorance". (Regarding this, I wrote an article before: <a title="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/07/spell-of-karmic-propensities.html" href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/07/spell-of-karmic-propensities.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/07/spell-of-karmic-propensities.html</a>)</p>
              <p>Hence... the right view of Anatta (No-Self) and Emptiness, the Method and the Experience must go hand in hand.</p>

              <p>Well, I know about the above benefits of the six word mantra too. But unfortunately this is not to be. If it is, everyone would be better off and there would be no suffering in this world.</p>
              <p>As much as I hope for it be true for everyone, karma is the deciding factor, not mantras. Something I even wonder what mantras are for as it depends very much on the person's faith. And a person's faith is partly dependent of his past karma; good karma means he can understand and believe more sincerely in the goodness of Dharma, bad karma means the exact opposite or something near to that opposite. So bad karma may mean he has the opportunity to just hear the mantra with his ears, and not really believing in or practise reciting the mantra and cultivating his spiritual wisdom at the same time.</p>

              <p> hmm....... To be frank . i seldom chant. <strong>Sometimes</strong> i also raised my eyebrows when i think that just by seeing buddhist images or chanting mantra , one is able to reduce bad karma significantly. But you see , buddhas dont lie to us. They dont 'exaggerate '  the benefits of seeing or chanting the mantras . Faith and repentance are important.</p>
              <p>Sometimes we just cant see the true benefits with our ordinary minds. And i believe that karma can be changed in every minute and every second if there are determination and awareness.</p>
              <p>I know that reality is real and can be cruel , thus i made a ' practical ' wish , wishing Buddhist organisations and buddhists ( since this is a buddhism forum ) will <strong>always</strong> have the financial means to help the needy ones and to spread dharma. This is something that is achieveable , even though does not lead us to enlightenment.</p>
