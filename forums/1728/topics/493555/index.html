              with an influential Buddhist sect</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Feb 23rd 2017 | PATHUM
              THANI | The Economist</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify;">SOME
              people think he has fled abroad. Others say he may have died. For more than a
              year the authorities in Thailand have been trying to get hold of Phra
              Dhammachayo, the reclusive former leader of a controversial Buddhist sect who
              is wanted for questioning in a fraud case. On February 16th a group of officers
              finally gained access to the vast religious complex which his Dhammakaya
              movement maintains on the outskirts of Bangkok. Instead of locating the
              septuagenarian monk—often pictured in signature sunglasses—they found an empty
              bed stuffed with pillows.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">By
              February 22nd more than 4,000 police and soldiers were lingering outside the
              Dhammakaya compound—waiting to complete a full sweep of the massive site but
              apparently hindered by monks and devotees who had blocked its dozen entrances.
              A spokesman for the sect claimed that 30,000 people were still inside the
              property, having ignored orders to leave; there have been scuffles at its
              gates. Apiradee, a retired civil servant helping to feed Dhammakaya followers
              who had gathered in support outside the police cordon, said she has never seen
              anything like it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Founded
              in the 1970s, the Dhammakaya movement claims about 3m followers around the
              world. It is by far the most influential temple in Thailand. It bears a loose
              resemblance to the evangelical mega-churches that increasingly beguile the
              world’s Christians. Dhammakaya’s mostly middle-class adherents complain that
              older Buddhist temples have grown complacent and materialistic. They insist, rather
              grandly, that the Bangkok compound, with its vast stadium, is meant to become a
              kind of Buddhist Vatican.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">But
              Dhammakaya has fierce opponents both within the Buddhist establishment and
              outside it. Critics denounce it as a cult that peddles wacky theology, and warn
              that it misleads wealthy urbanites into thinking that they can purchase
              religious merit. (The most serious of the several allegations against Phra
              Dhammachayo relates to a case in which an acolyte funded a donation with cash
              embezzled from a credit union.) Thailand’s ruling junta worries that the
              movement’s leaders are sympathetic to the cause of Thaksin Shinawatra, a
              populist former prime minister toppled in 2006 whose lingering influence the
              generals and their backers are determined to stamp out.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Last
              year the junta abandoned several attempts to drag Phra Dhammachayo out for
              questioning, fearful of the outrage that might follow were soldiers to be
              pictured manhandling monks. The latest effort looks more concerted. It may not
              be a coincidence that the operation began shortly after the installation of a
              new Supreme Patriarch (Thai Buddhism’s most senior monk). That job is usually
              filled according to a strict hierarchy but had been held open for several years
              after conservative clergy refused to endorse the expected successor—in part
              because of worries that he was too close to Dhammakaya. The junta took the
              unusual step of asking King Vajiralongkorn, who succeeded his father in
              December, to solve that dispute; he anointed a less controversial alternative,
              Somdet Phra Maha Muniwong, who hails from the smaller and more orthodox of
              Thailand’s two main Buddhist orders.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Monks
              at the Dhammakaya temple say that they have not seen their former abbot for
              months. They say the real aim of the raid is to shut the entire temple down.
              The generals may yet decide to back away from the fight, as they have done
              previously. They could perhaps claim that the searches they have already
              conducted are enough to declare the operation complete. That might look like a
              defeat, but it is hard to escape the conclusion that the Dhammakaya movement is
              running out of powerful friends. With the royal succession—which some had
              feared would be tumultuous—safely behind it, Thailand’s conservative
              establishment is reasserting itself, in religion as in politics.</span></p>
