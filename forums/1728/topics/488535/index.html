              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Today I am giving a short talk at a nearby
              Zen center as a visiting teacher. I asked ahead of time what they wanted me to
              talk about and one of the suggestions was “How to Realize Your Own Buddha
              Nature.”</span><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Oh heck. The Buddhist concept of buddha nature
              is a doozy. “Buddha” means awakened, and in Buddhism it is a central
              teaching that all beings have buddha nature whether they realize it or
              not. The father of Soto Zen Buddhism, Dogen, turned that teaching on its head
              and said, “Living beings are all buddha nature.”(1) (Get that? They <em>are</em> buddha nature?)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">And then I’m supposed to instruct people about
              how to realize their own buddha nature? Who am I to…</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">And yet. Something must be said. A response must
              be given, and the whole reason I’m a “Zen teacher” is because, presumably, I
              have <em>some</em> response to offer.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">So I look within and ask myself: What do I know
              about buddha nature? Have I realized my own buddha nature? When did I do that,
              and how? Am I still in contact with it right now? For a little while I flounder
              and go back to check whether I’ve actually committed to speaking on this topic,
              or whether I might be able to wriggle out of it and speak about something much
              more innocuous and down-to-earth.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">But no, this is the value of having to teach.
              You have to keep learning and deepening what you know. So I will say something
              about How to Realize Your Own Buddha Nature.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Oh, how we long to know for sure we have a
              “buddha” – or awakened – nature somewhere deep inside us. For most of us, this
              means some kind of redemptive quality – some innate goodness or wisdom that is
              a truer definition of us than our limitations and mistakes are. Even when we
              feel very low and out of touch, we try to cultivate faith that our case
              isn’t hopeless. We strive to uncover our pure inner nature in order to be a
              better person. We sustain ourselves with the hope that someday we can perceive
              our buddha nature directly and those sad, nagging doubts about ourselves will
              finally fall away.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The thing is, buddha nature is far beyond you
              and me, having and not having, pure and impure. As long as we want to <em>have</em> it, direct perception of it eludes us.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Direct perception of <em>what</em> eludes
              us? What <em>is</em> buddha nature? It is so easy to get lost in a thicket
              of words and forget that words can only <em>point</em> in the
              direction of experience, not provide it or explain it. Right here, right now,
              buddha nature is what manifests as soon as I stop looking anywhere for it. My
              fingers pause, coming to rest on the keyboard. Then I think, “Is that it?!” and
              its gone. But when I leap to that place of no doubt, awakened nature <em>is</em> breathing and sound and light and growing plants and sad people and struggling
              Zen teachers. Tears of pure joy spring into my eyes.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">To call it buddha nature is completely
              unnecessary. Don’t think it is something special that special people have
              managed to experience by doing special things. In his essay “Bussho,” or
              “Buddha Nature,” Zen master Dogen quotes an even more ancient Zen master,
              Nagarjuna, as saying, “If you want to see buddha nature, first let go of your
              pride.”(1)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Our pride? Is <em>that</em> what is getting
              in the way? Not our lack of intelligence, spiritual ignorance, character flaws,
              bad habits, mental illness, or laziness?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">In this case, I don’t think pride is about
              arrogance – that is, having an inflated view of our own merits. Arrogance is
              good thing to get rid of too, but it’s not the main obstacle for most of us.
              The kind of pride that prevents us from realizing buddha nature is about not
              being willing to surrender. It’s about trying to make it on our own – to find
              the answers and fix our life. It’s about making ourselves <em>worthy</em> of
              buddha nature  (or, to put it in Christian terms, of Christ’s
              unconditional love). It’s like we insist on earning our buddha nature
              somehow, because <em>then it will be ours.</em> <em>We</em> will be
              redeemed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Of course, as the buddha said, “Living
              beings <em>are</em> all buddha nature” (emphasis mine). It is our very effort
              to grab a piece of the divine pie for ourselves that keeps us separate from it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">However – and this is very important – the
              refuge and reward of buddha nature does not exclude the personal. This is
              fortunate because longing to have a buddha nature is perfectly natural and
              human. This longing drives and inspires us. We can’t willfully get rid of it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Eventually we see how buddha nature manifests in
              and through our unique life. Of course, it also manifests in rocks, trees,
              cars, stars, and our aunt Mabel. But it very definitely shines throughout our
              particularity; it could not and does not reside anywhere except in particular
              manifestations. It is not obstructed by, constrained by, or dependent upon our
              details. I look around at my life: These hands, this room, this house, this
              little sphere of reality I call mine – shining with buddha nature.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">We <em>do</em>, in a sense, have a “deeper”
              awakened nature that defines us more than our limitations and mistakes do. We
              can experience it and rely on it as long as we don’t try to hold on to it
              – and sometimes we even end up trying to hold on to it as some <em>thing</em> we are willing to share with others, like a giant, pure,
              communal soul. Even this noble image takes an <em>experience</em> and
              makes it into a concept. There’s no sin in this except that it tends to make
              the experience itself more elusive.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">It’s amazing that the personally redemptive
              quality of buddha nature is nonetheless real, despite how subtle the experience
              of buddha nature is. A growing conviction that buddha nature pervades the
              universe – and doesn’t stop when it reaches the boundary of our personal bag of
              skin – is profoundly healing to our sad, wounded, and doubtful selves. We
              are <em>not</em> denied buddha nature, no matter who we are. Without
              losing our individuality, we get to partake of boundless, luminous being-ness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Although, again, once you conceive of some
              awesome <strong><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif";  '>“</span></strong>boundless,
              luminous being-ness” that some lucky people have experienced, you’re lost in
              thought and miss the radiance right before your very (real) eyes.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">And in case you think it’s just modern folks
              with low self-esteem who doubt their buddha nature and long for it? In one of
              the oldest and well-loved Buddhist scriptures, the <em>Lotus Sutra</em> (which
              dates back at least as far as the 3rd century CE), there are
              several chapters in which various disciples of the Buddha ask him for
              their own, personal predictions of buddhahood. Get this: the Buddha himself has
              just lectured at length about how all beings will eventually attain buddhahood
              (although it may not be for many lifetimes to come), but still his disciples
              stand up and ask him, “You mean <em>me</em>?”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The Buddha then proceeds to call each
              disciple by name and describe how, many eons in the future, he or she will
              be born as a practitioner with such-and-such a name, and how he or
              she will attain complete enlightenment and be called such-and-such buddha,
              and what the special features of their buddha realm will be. Even after he does
              this repeatedly and his disciples should be catching on the to the pattern, the
              sutra says:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">“Then the mother of Rahula, the nun Yashodhara,
              thought: ‘In his assurances, the World-Honored One has left only my name
              unmentioned.’ The Buddha said to Yashodhara: ‘In future lives, in the midst of
              the Dharma of hundreds of thousands of billions of buddhas, by doing
              bodhisattva practice you will become a great Dharma teacher, gradually fulfilling
              the Buddha way…”(2)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Who has not thought, at times, that only their
              name will be left off the list of those with buddha nature – or at least those
              fortunate enough to be certain they have it?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">It’s an inexplicable irony that realizing our
              buddha nature requires letting go of pride and accepting that we already have
              it. It’s also ironic that such surrender can actually require a great deal of
              effort. We struggle, let go, struggle again, and let go again. We find our way,
              slowly but surely, inspired by the promise of buddha nature.</span></p>
