              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Bhikkhu P.A. Payutto<br><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">The problem of good and evil</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Because kamma is directly concerned with good and evil, any discussion of kamma must also include a discussion of good and evil. Standards for defining good and evil are, however, not without their problems. What is "good," and how is it so? What is it that we call "evil," and how is that so? These problems are in fact a matter of language. In the Buddha's teaching, which is based on the Pali language, the meaning becomes much clearer, as will presently be demonstrated.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">The English words "good" and "evil" have very broad meanings, particularly the word "good," which is much more widely used than "evil." A virtuous and moral person is said to be good; delicious food might be called "good" food; a block of wood which happens to be useful might be called a "good" block of wood. Moreover, something which is good to one person might not be good to many others. Looked at from one angle, a certain thing may be good, but not from another. Behavior which is considered good in one area, district or society might be considered bad in another.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">It seems from these examples that there is some disparity. It might be necessary to consider the word "good" from different viewpoints, such as good in a hedonistic sense, good in an artistic sense, good in an economic sense, and so on. The reason for this disparity is a matter of values. The words "good" and "evil" can be used in many different value systems in English, which makes their meanings very broad.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">In our study of good and evil the following points should be borne in mind:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">(a) Our study will be from the perspective of the law of kamma, thus we will be using the specialized terms kusala and akusala or skillful and unskillful, which have very precise meanings.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">(b) Kusala and akusala, in terms of Buddhist ethics, are qualities of the law of kamma, thus our study of them is keyed to this context, not as a set of social values as is commonly used for the words "good" and "evil."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">(c) As discussed in Chapter One, the operation of the law of kamma is related to other laws. Specifically, insofar as the inner life of the individual is concerned, kammaniyama interacts with psychological laws (cittaniyama), while externally it is related to Social Preference.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">The meaning of kusala and akusala</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Although kusala and akusala are sometimes translated as "good" and "evil," this may be misleading. Things which are kusala may not always be considered good, while some things may be akusala and yet not generally considered to be evil. Depression, melancholy, sloth and distraction, for example, although akusala, are not usually considered to be "evil" as we know it in English. In the same vein, some forms of kusala, such as calmness of body and mind, may not readily come into the general understanding of the English word "good."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Kusala and akusala are conditions which arise in the mind, producing results initially in the mind, and from there to external actions and physical features. The meanings of kusala and akusala therefore stress the state, the contents and the events of mind as their basis.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Kusala can be rendered generally as "intelligent, skillful, contented, beneficial, good," or "that which removes affliction." Akusala is defined in the opposite way, as in "unintelligent," "unskillful" and so on.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">The following are four connotations of kusala derived from the Commentaries:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">1. Arogya: free of illness, a mind that is healthy; mental states which contain those conditions or factors which support mental health and produce an untroubled and stable mind.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">2. Anavajja: unstained; factors which render the mind clean and clear, not stained or murky.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">3. Kosalasambhuta: based on wisdom or intelligence; mental states which are based on knowledge and understanding of truth. This is supported by the teaching which states that kusala conditions have yoniso-manasikara, clear thinking, as forerunner.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">4. Sukhavipaka: rewarded by well-being. Kusala is a condition which produces contentment. When kusala conditions arise in the mind, there is naturally a sense of well-being, without the need for any external influence. Just as when one is strong and healthy (aroga), freshly bathed (anavajja), and in a safe and comfortable place (kosalasambhuta), a sense of well-being naturally follows.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">The meaning of akusala should be understood in just the opposite way from above: as the mind that is unhealthy, harmful, based on ignorance, and resulting in suffering. In brief, it refers to those conditions which cause the mind to degenerate both in quality and efficiency, unlike kusala, which promotes the quality and efficiency of the mind.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">In order to further clarify these concepts, it might be useful to look at the descriptions of the attributes of a good mind, one that is healthy and trouble-free, found in the Commentaries, and then to consider whether kusala conditions do indeed induce the mind to be this way, and if so, how. We could then consider whether akusala conditions deprive the mind of such states, and how they do this.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">For easy reference, the various characteristics of kusala found in the Commentaries can be compiled into groups, as follows:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">1. Firm: resolute, stable, unmoving, undistracted.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">2. Pure and clean: unstained, immaculate, bright.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">3. Clear and free: unrestricted, free, exalted, boundless.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">4. Fit for work: pliant, light, fluent, patient.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">5. Calm and content: relaxed, serene, satisfied.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Having looked at the qualities of a healthy mind, we can now consider the qualities which are known as kusala and akusala, assessing to see how they affect the quality of the mind.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Some examples of kusala conditions are: sati, mindfulness or recollection, the ability to maintain the attention with whatever object or duty the mind is engaged; metta, goodwill; non-greed, absence of desire and attachment (including altruistic thoughts); wisdom, clear understanding of the way things are; calm, relaxation and peace; kusalachanda, zeal or contentment with the good; a desire to know and act in accordance with the truth; and gladness at the good fortune of others.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">When there is goodwill, the mind is naturally happy, cheerful, and clear. This is a condition which is beneficial to the psyche, supporting the quality and efficiency of the mind. Goodwill is therefore kusala. Sati enables the attention to be with whatever the mind is involved or engaged, recollecting the proper course of action, helping to prevent akusala conditions from arising, and thus enabling the mind to work more effectively. Sati is therefore kusala.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Examples of akusala conditions are: sexual desire; ill will; sloth and torpor; restlessness and anxiety; doubt[a], anger, jealousy, and avarice.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Jealousy makes the mind spiteful and oppressive, clearly damaging the quality and health of the mind. Therefore it is akusala. Anger stirs up the mind in such a way that rapidly affects even the health of the body, and thus is clearly akusala. Sensual desire confuses and obsesses the mind. This is also akusala.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Having established an understanding of the words kusala and akusala, we are now ready to understand good and bad kamma, or kusala kamma and akusala kamma. As has been already mentioned, intention is the heart of kamma. Thus, an intention which contains kusala conditions is skillful, and an intention which contains akusala conditions is unskillful. When those skillful or unskillful intentions are acted on through the body, speech or mind, they are known as skillful and unskillful kamma through body, speech and mind respectively, or, alternatively, bodily kamma, verbal kamma and mental kamma which are skillful and unskillful as the case may be.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Kusala and akusala as catalysts for each other</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">An act of faith or generosity, moral purity, or even an experience of insight during meditation, which are all kusala conditions, can precipitate the arising of conceit, pride and arrogance. Conceit and pride are akusala conditions. This situation is known as "kusala acting as an agent for akusala." Meditation practice can lead to highly concentrated states of mind (kusala), which in turn can lead to attachment (akusala). The development of thoughts of goodwill and benevolence to others (kusala), can, in the presence of a desirable object, precipitate the arising of lust (akusala). These are examples of kusala acting as an agent for akusala.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Sometimes moral or meditation practice (kusala) can be based on a desire to be reborn in heaven (akusala). A child's good behavior (kusala) can be based on a desire to show off to its elders (akusala); a student's zeal in learning (kusala) can stem from ambition (akusala); anger (akusala), seen in the light of its harmful effects, can lead to wise reflection and forgiveness (kusala); the fear of death (akusala) can encourage introspection (kusala): these are all examples of akusala as an agent for kusala.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">An example: the parents of a teenage boy warn their son that his friends are a bad influence on him, but he takes no notice and is lured into drug addiction. On realizing his situation, he is at first angered and depressed, then, remembering his parents' warnings, he is moved by their compassion (akusala as an agent for kusala), but this in turn merely aggravates his own self-hatred (kusala as an agent for akusala).</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">These changes from kusala to akusala, or akusala to kusala, occur so rapidly that the untrained mind is rarely able to see them.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Gauging good and bad kamma</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">It has been mentioned that the law of kamma has a very intimate relationship with both psychological laws and Social Preference. This very similarity can easily create misunderstandings. The law of kamma is so closely related to psychological laws that they seem to be one and the same thing, but there is a clear dividing line between the two, and that is intention. This is the essence and motivating force of the law of kamma and is that which gives the law of kamma its distinct niche among the other niyama or laws. Cittaniyama, on the other hand, governs all mental activity, including the unintentional.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Human intention, through the law of kamma, has its own role distinct from the other niyama, giving rise to the illusion that human beings are independent of the natural world. Intention must rely on the mechanics of cittaniyama in order to function, and the process of creating kamma must operate within the parameters of cittaniyama.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Using an analogy of a man driving a motor boat, the "driver" is intention, which is the domain of the law of kamma, whereas the whole of the boat engine is comparable to the mental factors, which are functions of cittaniyama. The driver must depend on the boat engine. However, for the "boat engine" to lead the "boat," that is, for the mind to lead life and the body, in any direction, is entirely at the discretion of the "driver," intention. The driver depends on and makes use of the boat, but also takes responsibility for the welfare of both boat and engine. In the same way, the law of kamma depends on and makes use of cittaniyama, and also accepts responsibility for the welfare of life, including both the body and the mind.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">There is not much confusion about this relationship between the law of kamma and cittaniyama, mainly because these are not things in which the average person takes much interest. The issue that creates the most confusion is the relationship between the law of kamma and Social Preference, and this confusion creates ambiguity in regard to the nature of good and evil.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">We often hear people say that good and evil are human or social inventions. An action in one society, time or place, may be regarded as good, but in another time and place regarded as bad. Some actions may be acceptable to one society, but not to another. For example, some religions teach that to kill animals for food is not bad, while others teach that to harm beings of any kind is never good. Some societies hold that a child should show respect to its elders, and that to argue with them is bad manners, while others hold that respect is not dependent on age, and that all people should have the right to express their opinions.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">To say that good and evil are matters of human preference and social decree is true to some extent. Even so, the good and evil of Social Preference do not affect or upset the workings of the law of kamma in any way, and should not be confused with it. "Good" and "evil" as social conventions should be recognized as Social Preference. As for "good" and "evil," or more correctly, kusala and akusala, as qualities of the law of kamma, these should be recognized as attributes of the law of kamma. Even though the two are related they are in fact separate, and have very clear distinctions.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">That which is at once the relationship, and the point of distinction, between this natural law and the Social Preference is intention, or will. As to how this is so, let us now consider.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">In terms of the law of kamma, the conventions of society may be divided into two types:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">1. Those which have no direct relationship to kusala and akusala.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">2. Those which are related to kusala and akusala.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Those conventions which have no direct relationship to kusala and akusala are the accepted values or agreements which are established by society for a specific social function, such as to enable people to live together harmoniously. They may indeed be instruments for creating social harmony, or they may not. They may indeed be useful to society or they may in fact be harmful. All this depends on whether or not those conventions are established with sufficient understanding and wisdom, and whether or not the authority who established them is acting with pure intention.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">These kinds of conventions may take many forms, such as traditions, customs or laws. "Good" and "evil" in this respect are strictly matters of Social Preference. They may change in many ways, but their changes are not functions of the law of kamma, and must not be confused with it. If a person disobeys these conventions and is punished by society, that is also a matter of Social Preference, not the law of kamma.[b]</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Now, let us consider an area in which these social conventions may overlap with the law of kamma, such as when a member of a society refuses to conform to one of its conventions, or infringes on it.[c] In so doing, that person will be acting on a certain intention. This intention is the first step in, and is therefore a concern of, the law of kamma. In many societies there will be an attempt to search out this intention for ascertaining the quality of the action. That is again a concern of Social Preference, indicating that that particular society knows how to utilize the law of kamma. This consideration of intention by society is not, however, in itself a function of the law of kamma. (That is, it is not a foregone conclusion -- illegal behavior is not always punished. However, whether actions are punished or not they are kamma in the sense that they are volitional actions and will bring results.)</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">As for the particular role of the law of kamma, regardless of whether society investigates the intention or not, or even whether society is aware of the infringement, the law of kamma functions immediately the action occurs, and the process of fruition has already been set in motion.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Simply speaking, the deciding factor in the law of kamma is whether the intention is kusala or akusala. In most cases, not to conform with any Social Preference can only be said to constitute no intentional infringement when society agrees to abandon or to reform that convention. Only then will there be no violation of the public agreement.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">This can be illustrated by a simple example. Suppose two people decide to live together. In order to render their lives together as smooth and as convenient as possible, they agree to establish a set of regulations: although working in different places and returning from work at different times, they decide to have the evening meal together. As it would be impractical to wait for each other indefinitely, they agree that each of them should not eat before seven pm. Of those two people, one likes cats and doesn't like dogs, while the other likes dogs and doesn't like cats. For mutual well-being, they agree not to bring any pets at all into the house.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Having agreed on these regulations, if either of those two people acts in contradiction to them, there is a case of intentional infringement, and kamma arises, good or bad according to the intention that instigated it, even though eating food before seven pm., or bringing pets into a house, are not in themselves good or evil. Another couple might even establish regulations which are directly opposite to these. And in the event that one of those people eventually considers their regulations to be no longer beneficial, they should discuss the matter together and come to an agreement. Only then would any intentional nonconformity on that person's part be free of kammic result. This is the distinction between "good" and "evil," and "right" and "wrong," as changing social conventions, as opposed to the unchanging properties of the law of kamma, kusala and akusala.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">The conventions which are related to kusala and akusala in the law of kamma are those conventions which are either skillful or unskillful. Society may or may not make these regulations with a clear understanding of kusala and akusala, but the process of the law of kamma continues along its natural course regardless. It does not change along with those social conventions.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">For example, a society might consider it acceptable to take intoxicants and addictive drugs. Extreme emotions may be encouraged, and the citizens may be incited to compete aggressively in order to spur economic growth. Or it might be generally believed that to kill people of other societies, or, on a lesser scale, to kill animals, is not blameworthy.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">These are examples where the good and evil of Social Preference and kusala and akusala are at odds with each other: unskillful conditions are socially preferred and "good" from a social perspective is "bad" from a moral one. Looked at from a social perspective, those conventions or attitudes may cause both positive and negative results. For example, although a life of tension and high competitiveness may cause a high suicide rate, an unusually large amount of mental and social problems, heart disease and so on, that society may experience rapid material progress. Thus, social problems can often be traced down to the law of kamma, in the values condoned and encouraged by society.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Social Preference and the law of kamma are separate and distinct. The fruits of kamma proceed according to their own law, independent of any social conventions which are at odds with it as mentioned above. However, because the convention and the law are related, correct practice in regard to the law of kamma, that is, actions that are kusala, might still give rise to problems on the social level. For example, an abstainer living in a society which favors intoxicating drugs receives the fruits of kamma dictated by the law of kamma -- he doesn't experience the loss of health and mental clarity due to intoxicating drugs -- but in the context of Social Preference, as opposed to the law of kamma, he may be ridiculed and scorned. And even within the law of kamma there may arise problems from his intentional opposition to this Social Preference, in the form of mental stress, more or less depending on his wisdom and ability to let go of social reactions.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">A progressive society with wise administrators uses the experience accumulated from previous generations in laying down the conventions and laws of society. These become the good and evil of Social Preference, and ideally they should correlate with the kusala and akusala of kammaniyama. The ability to establish conventions in conformity with the law of kamma would seem to be a sound gauge for determining the true extent of a society's progress or civilization.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">In this context, when it is necessary to appraise any convention as good or evil, it would best be considered from two levels. Firstly, in terms of Social Preference, by determining whether or not it has a beneficial result to society. Secondly, in terms of the law of kamma, by determining whether or not it is kusala, beneficial to mental well-being.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Some conventions, even though maintained by societies for long periods of time, are in fact not at all useful to them, even from the point of view of Social Preference, let alone from the point of view of the law of kamma. Such conventions should be abandoned, and it may be necessary for an exceptional being with pure heart to point out their fault.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">In the case of a convention which is seen to be helpful to society and to human progress, but which is not in conformity with the kusala of the law of kamma, such as one which enhances material progress at the expense of the quality of life, it might be worth considering whether the people of that society have not gone astray and mistaken that which is harmful as being beneficial. A truly beneficial custom should conform with both Social Preference and the law of kamma. In other words, it should be beneficial to both the individual and society as a whole, and beneficial on both the material and psychic levels.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">In this regard we can take a lesson from the situation of society in the present time. Human beings, holding the view that wealth of material possessions is the path to true happiness, have proceeded to throw their energies into material development. The harmful effects of many of our attempts at material progress are only now becoming apparent. Even though society appears to be prosperous, we have created many new physical dangers, and social and environmental problems threaten us on a global scale. Just as material progress should not be destructive to the physical body, social progress should not be destructive to the clarity of the mind.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">The Buddha gave a set of reflections on kusala and akusala for assessing the nature of good and evil on a practical level, encouraging reflection on both the good and evil within (conscience), and the teachings of wise beings (these two being the foundation of conscience and modesty).[d] Thirdly, he recommended pondering the fruits of actions, both individually and on a social basis. Because the nature of kusala and akusala may not always be clear, the Buddha advised adhering to religious and ethical teachings, and, if such teachings are not clear enough, to look at the results of actions, even if only from a social basis.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">For most people, these three bases for reflection (i.e., individually, socially, and from the accepted teachings of wise beings) can be used to assess behavior on a number of different levels, ensuring that their actions are as circumspect as possible.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Thus, the criteria for assessing good and evil are: in the context of whether an action is kamma or not, to take intention as the deciding factor; and in the context of whether that kamma is good or evil, to consider the matter against the following principles:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Primary Factors</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Inquiring into the roots of actions, whether the intentions for them arose from one of the skillful roots of non-greed, non-aversion or non-delusion, or from one of the unskillful roots of greed, aversion or delusion.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Inquiring into the effects on the psyche, or mental well-being, of actions: whether they render the mind clear, calm and healthy; whether they promote or inhibit the quality of the mind; whether they encourage the arising of skillful conditions and the decrease of unskillful conditions, or vice versa.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Secondary Factors</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">1. Considering whether one's actions are censurable to oneself or not (conscience).</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">2. Considering the quality of one's actions in terms of wise teachings.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">3. Considering the results of those actions:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">a. towards oneself</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">b. towards others.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">It is possible to classify these standards in a different way, if we first clarify two points. Firstly, looking at actions either in terms of their roots, or as skillful and unskillful in themselves, are essentially the same thing. Secondly, in regard to approval or censure by the wise, we can say that such wise opinions are generally preserved in religions, conventions and laws. Even though these conventions are not always wise, and thus any practice which conflicts with them is not necessarily unskillful, still it can be said that such cases are the exception rather than the rule.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">We are now ready to summarize our standards for good and evil, or good and bad kamma, both strictly according to the law of kamma and also in relation to Social Preference, both on an intrinsically moral level and on a socially prescribed one.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">1. In terms of direct benefit or harm: are these actions in themselves beneficial? Do they contribute to the quality of life? Do they cause kusala and akusala conditions to increase or wane?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">2. In terms of beneficial or harmful consequences: are the effects of these actions harmful or beneficial to oneself?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">3. In terms of benefit or harm to society: are they harmful to others, or helpful to them?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">4. In terms of conscience, the natural human reflexive capacity: will those actions be censurable to oneself or not?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">5. In terms of social standards: what is the position of actions in relation to those religious conventions, traditions, social institutions and laws which are based on wise reflection (as opposed to those which are simply superstitious or mistaken beliefs)?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Prior to addressing the question of the results of kamma in the next chapter, it would be pertinent to consider some of the points described above in the light of the Pali Canon.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">"What are skillful (kusala) conditions? They are the three roots of skillfulness -- non-greed, non-aversion and non-delusion; feelings, perceptions, proliferations and consciousness which contain those roots of skillfulness; bodily kamma, verbal kamma and mental kamma which have those roots as their base: these are skillful conditions.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">"What are unskillful (akusala) conditions? They are the three roots of unskillfulness -- greed, aversion and delusion -- and all the defilements which arise from them; feelings, perceptions, proliferations and consciousness which contain those roots of unskillfulness; bodily kamma, verbal kamma and mental kamma which have those roots of unskillfulness as a foundation: these are unskillful conditions."[12]</span></p>
