Besides selling coffins, urns and funeral clothes, these one-stop death supermarkets also package in a death certificate, a wake and a cremation slot - for a fee, of course.<br><br>Ten years ago, there were about 40 casket shops here.

They could be char kway teow sellers or cabbies, basically anyone with a funeral parlour contact, hoping to earn a $500 commission for each successful referral.<br><br>Direct Funeral Services owner Roland Tay, 58, who has been in the business for 22 years and is often in the news for sponsoring the funerals of murder victims such as Huang Na and Liu Hongmei, says: 'Every day there are about 40 deaths. There are more funeral companies than deaths.'<br><br>Many have seen their business shrivel up and - sometimes - die.

They forgot about pantang (superstition in Malay) and reason that everyone has to die.'<br><br>Many of the new entrants are former casket company employees striking out on their own, or those in related industries such as suppliers of chairs or tidbits at wakes.<br><br>Many are drawn in by the promise of 'easy money'.<br><br>Mr Victor Hoo, 37, funeral director of Singapore Funeral Services (SFS), adds: 'In Singapore, more and more people are looking for a job that can give them fast cash. Three to five days' funeral, fast cash.'<br><br>There is now no lack of Singaporeans willing to take up odd jobs in the funeral line, including teenagers on school vacations to those in their 40s.<br><br>Mr Freddie Choo, 52, chairman of Trinity Casket, says: 'It's good money in the sense that an outing carrying a coffin can earn them $40 to $50...They just carry it, then put it down.'<br><br>Another industry veteran Olivia Stravens, 43, formerly Trinity's operations manager, adds: 'It's better than working at a fast-food joint where you only earn $5 an hour.'<br><br>With deaths going up from about 10,000 a year in the 1950s to almost 16,000 now in tandem with population growth, the future looks bright for the gloom trade... ... ...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>To: Editor<br>Forum Page<br>I refer to the article Â“Stiff CompetitionÂ” in the Straits Times dated 3 June 2006</strong>.<br><br>Many Chinese practices have been mistaken to be Buddhist funeral rites. Many such rites are not deemed to be a necessity but a cultural preference.<br><br>In a Buddhist funeral, a simple and inexpensive casket is sufficient. There is no need to have elaborate caskets as they will be either buried or burnt in the cremation. It is important to evaluate the options a funeral service company offers and even shop around if the charges are high. DonÂ’t allow your grief to be taken advantage of. It is not Â“bad luckÂ” to negotiate a sensible package.<br><br>Inviting monks or nuns (Â“sanghaÂ”) to preside over the last rites is a common practice at Buddhist funerals. In return, requisites could be offered to the sangha or donations given to the temple. Buddhists are not encouraged to hire professional chanters who charge fees for chanting. Instead, they could request chanting services from Buddhist temples or organizations that do not charge a specific fee.<br><br>Making donations to temples or charities in the name of the departed will result in greater merit to the deceased and the family than spending on an expensive funeral or columbarium space.<br><br>Resources are better used to make the funeral dignified, loving and positive than performing wasteful or superstitious actions. Burning paper or effigies is not a Buddhist practice.<br><br>At Buddhist funerals, family members are not required to wear all black. They can also wear white, plain or sober-coloured attire to reflect the mood of the occasion.<br><br>Buddhism promotes practicality and sensibility when making decisions in life and this applies equally when dealing with matters of death.<br><br><span class="large"><strong>Angie Monksfield<br>President<br>Buddhist Fellowship<br><br>Dated: June 3, 2006<br><br>P/S Â“MonksÂ” are usually associated with Buddhism, in Taoism, the equivalent are referred to as Â“Priests</strong>Â”.</span><br></div>
