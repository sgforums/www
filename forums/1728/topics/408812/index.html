              <p>Hi Positron,</p>
              <p>1. Better to chant aloud with sound. No need to be very loud in volume, just softly with sound would also do. </p>
              <p>2. Can light some incense</p>
              <p>3. Before start, should check your motivation, why you do this recitation of sutra? it should be motivated for all sentient beings to attain Buddhahood. Not just your own interests.</p>
              <p>4. Make sure all your things prepared, no one can come and disturb you during your session. Inform your family that you in prayer. Go toilet first, switch off your handphone... etc.  Don't talk in between and also don't interrupt it if possible. (NB: But sometimes can't be helped, some interruptions come then it's also ok, no need to be irritated. But try to preempt any interruptions)</p>
              <p>5. Sit up straight, if want also can kneel down (this is for more sincere people, if you don't feel like it also can).</p>
              <p>6. Mind should be with respect and faith as this is the words of Buddha</p>
              <p>7. Diet best no garlic or onion before one start.  That's why good to do in the morning.</p>
              <p>8. If sutra is not so long, try to finish in one seating. If really can't, can also break up into more sessions.</p>
              <p>9. One master said when chanting, just concentrate on chanting, don't think about meaning... meaning can be contemplated after the session or when you attend talks that explain the sutra etc.  One can enter into a meditative state while chanting the sutra if you are mindful and concentrated. This is the best.</p>
              <p>If you want more practical experience, recommend join any Buddhist temple for their chanting sessions. After some sessions would know what to do well.</p>
              <p>If you want to uphold a certain sutra, can also make a vow, say you want to recite this sutra 108 times, or 1000 times everyday until i finish. Or how many years, or whole life.  With vow, merit is stronger.</p>
              <p>Consistency is very important. Doing everyday, not just whenever you like.</p>
              <p>After finish everything must dedicate merit, usually end of the sutra would have some verses for dedication. Also make aspirations and dedications that you and all sentient beings take rebirth in pureland with no obstacles upon the end of this life.  Make this dedication strongly.</p>
              <p>All these just my opinion, please feel free to adapt to your needs. Hope it helps!</p>

              <p>Let chanting sutra be chanting sutra, pondering the meaning of the sutra be the pondering the meaning of sutra.</p>
              <p>Deligate different times/sessions to each: chanting, and trying to understand the meaning.</p>
              <p>Why? Because if you contemplate the meaning during chanting, you will get distracted from the chanting and the chanting will lose it's purpose and power which is to create a positive momentum in your consciousness and help you develope samadhi and calmness.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, understanding the content of the sutra is important, and that should be done separately - e.g. listening to dharma talks, reading commentaries and explanations, etc.</p>

              <p>Sitting meditation has two types: samatha, and vipashyana. Chanting belongs to the samatha category, which is to develope one pointedness and enter into samadhi - there are other sitting samatha practices that leads to entering of samadhi. However, Vipashyana meditation is different as it is done to gain insight into the nature of our mind. And these insights are what are known as awakening, and that is what leads to liberation from sufferings.</p>
              <p>Samadhi may not necessarily be Jhana. There are many kinds of samadhis, of which jhana is only one type. There is momentary samadhi, access samadhi, jhanas, and other kinds of samadhis not mentioned.</p>
              <p>In Zen, the samadhi that is emphasized is the samadhi of self-nature. It requires you to realise your own Buddha-Nature, and then abide in/as IT. This is not a form of jhana, but simply an abiding in your ever-present nature. Whereas jhana states are temporary and not feasibly maintained in ordinary living, your Buddha-nature is your ever-present nature and is available and present at any moment, as your very essence/nature.</p>

              <p>it has alot of important topics about Buddhism. My suggestion is: First build up your knowledge and understanding then later you can go deeply into meditation.  It is important to study first, otherwise half-way through your meditation many doubts can arise and so on...</p>
              <p>You can start reciting sutras and doing some chanting at the same time as reading / attending talks etc... Reciting sutras can build up your merit which will in turn give you the ability to digest the teachings on a deeper level. It also purify bad karma so that one will have less obstacles on the path.</p>
              <p>Meditation best to do with teacher's guidance.  No guidance, easy to waste alot of time and sidetrack.  And how to choose a teacher, one also need to have enough understanding of the teaching so that one can choose a good teacher.  So first of all, should read up more and spend time to understand the dharma. </p>
              <p>Don't rush and make all kinds of mistakes. Better take your time, develop strong understanding and then progress step by step.</p>

              <p>For this scenario of rooted beings, my opinion is that in order to one stone saves 2 birds, recite on Pureland sutra like Amitabha Sutra and Sutra of Infinite Life. It provides truth scenes on the ultimate collections of beauty, bliss, joys and serenity of all worlds. It also reminded us to be compassionate and respectful even towards the animals as the animals teaches Bodhisavattas its truth nature in the most highest Buddhism tradition tradition (å¯†). It applies the expediency of imagination of external beauty at first, and subsequently develop your mind into truth beauty and bliss. Eventually, when the "yuan" arises, you are brought there by yourself sitting on the lotus flower you had cultivated yourself. It is also in line with sutra recitation technic of "precept", until the yuan arises of stillness development, and fruition of wisdom, it's 3 is 1 and 1 is 3, and not one at a time.</p>

              <p><br>i think be it loudly or silently, it have to depend on different situations, the key is <strong>listen</strong> <strong>clearly</strong> to what u are reciting. this is because when we are listening to something, the mind is also occuplied together with the hearing faculty. if u don't believe, u can experiment. recite silently can also listen. </p>

              <p>to ancient Patriarch Dade handed down experience, we will be summed up in three points: regulating body, suction, self-aligning.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Polls identities on two aspects: the sutras, the body is to sit, obedient decorum will let us have a sense of focus; chant picked, interval, and not always in place, it may be to walk outdoors, breathe the fresh air. Not necessarily been just allow yourself to be quiet, to get rid of giddy. If the interval, speech disorder, disorder of climbing, will make the heart very far off, but not when you full chant concentration. Therefore, we should note that their words and deeds, it is best to always is in a quiet, peaceful State, which will be conducive to the sutras.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Increase absorption refers to the chanting of the former, you can take a deep breath, then go to the core. Air transfer, will allow us to recite a smooth feeling tight, tight.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Self-aligning is the most important, is divided into two points: first, we present, chanting to rise to devotion. We will be there in the sutras and scattered condition is dawning, fruit, because we have disrespect for the law and the illustrations of the master, wrong views, do not believe in Buddhism, which led to the chant is now. Therefore, we have to start from the top, there is a distinction in balance, there will be. In the sutras, the Buddha, humbly pray that forbore, to lift up our hearts in heart and hope to be pious, Yin weight dependent prayer, reading all the obstacles can be removed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Second, we want to have Thanksgiving, cherish this chant. On the one hand to Thanksgiving the Dojo, the Mage's boot, all volunteers behind pay; on the other hand, also thanks to the support of the family, the family will be able to understand us, let us chant peace of mind in the temple, it is also very worthy of our thankful; also, we would also like to thanks Dragon days among the law, although we can't see them, but that they had been who supported us. For example, here the winter spring water is frozen, but now the winter mountains and flowing water, let us with no need for public drinking water problems and headache.</p>

              Hi Positron 
              
              Glad to see that U r keen to take up the recitation practice. Is a good step of faith. Of course, people choose to do recitation for a number of reasons such as accumulate merits for oneself due to sickness, career, monetary and etc or others such as deceased love one, family well being and etc. All these motivation factor is condition(åŠ©ç¼˜). In fact very few people are motivated to do recitation for all sentient beings. However, that is the kind of Bodhi heart one needs to cultivate in the long run. So whateve is one motivation for the recitation, the key is SINCERITY ( è¯šå¿ƒè¯šæ„�). 
              
              1) Loud/Silent Recitation
              
               It depends on the place and circumstances. In a temple, MRT or one home will affect the recitation methodology. Some people can do silent recitation with sufficent concentration even in the MRT however some can't. Some would prefer audible recitation in order to maintain certain level of pace and concentration. 
              
              2) Posture 
              
              Any posture where one is comfortable. Of coure, in asia context some people will deem kneeling as the best humble position however some people could not due to artheritis. Whatever posture one choose is still an outward expression, the importance is what is going on in the heart. 
              
              3) Analysing the sutra meaning during recitation 
              
              Recitation require a certain amount of concentration. The tendency of the mind is to be inquisitive about what one is reading. Therefore, it is good to segregate both activities, as it is different in its nature. When one is reciting the sutra , one is recollecting, appreciating the buddha 's word with a certain amount of concentration. When one doing analysing , one will need to set aside a seperate time with a proper commentary to study the underlying meaninng of the sutra for better understanding.
              
              4) Reading Dharma books and merits 
              
              Generally speaking reading dharma books will gen erate good merits because one is exposing our ignorance mind to positive influence. If one can repent and reform one way of living then it will become a meritous act. Otherwise, it is still a book knowledge. 
              
              Well I hope these pointers together with the blogger advice will assist you in starting your practice. A word of advice begin the recitation practice with your heart inclination.

              <p>I think that depends on which dharma door you choose. If you are practising Pureland, you may start with ä½›è¯´é˜¿å¼¥é™€ç»� or Goddess of Mercy's æ™®é—¨å“�. I'm not too sure about other teachings. May be other forumers can advise you.</p>

              <p><br>We need to know more about buddhism when we evengelise. Sometimes we met buddhists who are well versed in buddhism not those who blindly follow their parents.</p>

              <p>I recommend first start with Heart Sutra. It is short and increases your wisdom!  Later on, you can go on to Lotus sutra æ™®é—¨å“�ï¼ŒAvatamsaka sutra æ™®è´¤è¡Œæ„¿å“�ï¼ŒDiamond sutra, åœ°è—�sutra, Amitabha sutra etc.  It depends mainly on your time available as they are of varying lengths so to fit them into your schedule depends on your commitment... also if you like Guan Yin, you can recite æ™®é—¨å“�, If you feel closer to Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva, can also recite åœ°è—�sutra.  As each sutra is linked to different bodhisattva.</p>
              <p>Also you can recite NAMO GUAN SHI YIN PU SA , NAMO AMITUOFO... it is short and easy to practice in daily life.</p>
