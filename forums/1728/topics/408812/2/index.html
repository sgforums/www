              <p>I recommend first start with Heart Sutra. It is short and
              increases your wisdom!  Later on, you can go on to Lotus sutra
              æ™®é—¨å“�ï¼ŒAvatamsaka sutra æ™®è´¤è¡Œæ„¿å“�ï¼ŒDiamond sutra, åœ°è—�sutra, Amitabha sutra
              etc.  It depends mainly on your time available as they are of
              varying lengths so to fit them into your schedule depends on your
              commitment... also if you like Guan Yin, you can recite æ™®é—¨å“�, If you
              feel closer to Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva, can also recite
              åœ°è—�sutra.  As each sutra is linked to different
              bodhisattva.</p>
              <p>Also you can recite NAMO GUAN SHI YIN PU SA , NAMO AMITUOFO...
              it is short and easy to practice in daily life.</p>
              <p>Really recommend that you do a small basic practice to begin
              with.</p>

              <p><br>When u engage well learned buddhist.</p>
              <p>Singapore many is blindly follow parent's religion dunno abt buddhism at all.</p>
              <p>Some buddhist are well learned. They know alot one. They shoot out buddhism technical terms/jargon like bullets when u share with them.</p>
              <p>So we need some understanding of buddhism.</p>
              <p>Yes,I lastime gt  go AEN dharma centre for sometime to learn abt those basics lor triple gems 5 precepts all those,ten virtous deeds. I joined youth group one. But never learn anything much one.</p>
              <p>I gt go to AEN dharma centre for abt 4 months. I also gt take refuge there.I shui bain shui bain go and take refuge since it's vesak day. I abit enthusiatic only.</p>
              <p>. My refuge cert have been torn into 2 but still at my house. I gt the proof. I gt meet outside with him also.</p>
              <p>Then I never go his buddhsit centre cos no more interest anymore. Dun really like it.</p>
              <p>Then I go church afterwards and become believer and gt baptised. Then later serve as evangelist.</p>
              <p>Then I find out I forget much of wad I learn abt buddhism. I got no more knowledge.</p>
              <p>At first I was not serious abt learning buddhism so I din absorb much in the first place.</p>
              <p>Now as a street evangelist who sometimes meet well learned buddhsit,must learn more abt buddhism mah.</p>
              <p>Out of 100 ppl u evengelise sure gt one expert in buddhism one. Most blindly follow dunno anything one lah. Follow family tradition.</p>
              <p>We one month save quite alot of blind followers. happy !!!</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> In christianality salvation is on faith alone. But faith without deeds is dead means u say u believe u must go church lor,read bible lor.gathering lor etc etc</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Means ur true faith will result in good works. If ppl claim he believe but no works one maybe is fake believer.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Trust me,gt christian say they believe but never go church for many years one,a high chance is a fake believer unless he really busy cannot go.</span></strong></p>

              <p>Hi Stardust</p>
              <p>Is good that you come clean about your motivation about gathering information about Buddhism! As the Q &amp; A information might in a way or another open door for you to preach the gospel.</p>
              <p>Well, I do understand how you feel as a Born Again Christian. You are full of zeal to share your new found faith to others. When people embraced your faith, you are more convinced that your faith is real.</p>
              <p>Of course, your Faith is real within a certain premises and it does have a role to play in the society. At least, it will keep most people away from drug, bad deeds and etc. However, we could not undermined other people belief as unreal and its religious role in the society. By shuffling the gospel down people throat and making a mockery of people belief will not achieve much good. In fact, you should consider understand other people points of view. As Paul has said in <em>1 Corinthians 8:1 </em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up. </span></p>
              <p>Preach the gospel with love as Paul has taught rather with a," I am right you are wrong attitude."</p>
              <p><em>1 Corinthians 13:1-7</em><em> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames, but have not love, I gain nothing. </span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. </span></em></p>
              <p>Alrite, I shall leave you with a Christian FAQ link written by an angmo buddhist priest <a href="/forums/1728/topics/written%20by%20a%20angmo%20buddhist%20priest">http://nichirenscoffeehouse.net/Ryuei/ChristianFAQ.html</a> on Buddhist thought about God. Enjoy your reading.</p>

              <p>So we need some understanding of buddhism.</p>
              <p>Yes,I lastime gt  go AEN dharma centre for sometime to learn abt those basics lor triple gems 5 precepts all those,ten virtous deeds. I joined youth group one. But never learn anything much one.</p>
              <p>I gt go to AEN dharma centre for abt 4 months. I also gt take refuge there.I shui bain shui bain go and take refuge since it's vesak day. I abit enthusiatic only.</p>
              <p>. My refuge cert have been torn into 2 but still at my house. I gt the proof. I gt meet outside with him also.</p>
              <p>Then I never go his buddhsit centre cos no more interest anymore. Dun really like it.</p>
              <p>Then I go church afterwards and become believer and gt baptised. Then later serve as evangelist.</p>
              <p>Then I find out I forget much of wad I learn abt buddhism. I got no more knowledge.</p>
              <p>At first I was not serious abt learning buddhism so I din absorb much in the first place.</p>
              <p>Now as a street evangelist who sometimes meet well learned buddhsit,must learn more abt buddhism mah.</p>
              <p>Out of 100 ppl u evengelise sure gt one expert in buddhism one. Most blindly follow dunno anything one lah. Follow family tradition.</p>
              <p>We one month save quite alot of blind followers. happy !!!</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> In christianality salvation is on faith alone. But faith without deeds is dead means u say u believe u must go church lor,read bible lor.gathering lor etc etc</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Means ur true faith will result in good works. If ppl claim he believe but no works one maybe is fake believer.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Trust me,gt christian say they believe but never go church for many years one,a high chance is a fake believer unless he really busy cannot go.</span></strong></p>

              <p>If you say works mean going to church and read the bible. I wonder why Jesus must use the words like fear and trembling. Why there are 10 commandments for you to follow if good works just mean going to church and read the bible. I saw the similarities of what æ…§å¾‹æ³•å¸ˆsaid, every actions we make  must be with fear and trembling.</p>
              <p>I mention all these  for fear you are misleading those that you convert and lead them to hell instead of heaven.</p>

              <p>Hi Stardust,</p>
              <p>Shui Bian Shui Bian take refuge also a merits, just continue to take refuge lah. In Buddhism, there is no restriction on the number of times in taking refuge. For the "weaker" Buddhists, plse encourage with your understanding and knowledge on Buddhism so that weaker Buddhists who lack informed knowledge can climb up the ladder the same as you in Buddhism :)</p>
              <p>If you want to plant enormous blessing, explore Amitabha pureland and plse evangelises lah :))</p>
              <p>This is very helpful :)</p>

              <p>old Master Chin Kung society when living in USA, their neighbor are Christian. They were curious why all the ppl in the society are so happy everyday, so oneday they asked them what the society do. MCK told them they learn Buddhism, especially Pureland, a.k.a. and Land of Utimate Bliss. Yes we learn to be happy/blissful, purity, healthy and longivity.  When we think about this, every people wanted all this. so MCK welcome them to learn.  He said, "since you all go to church on Sunday, you are welcome to learn on Saturday. as they say God and you all are father and son relationship, while Buddha and you all are teacher and student relationship, no conflict. They are pretty happy with it. Buddhism is more like teaching and a school. :)</p>

              <p>actually, i don't mind, other religion wishing to know about Buddhism. they are free to ask, this is Singapore, multi-religion under one roof, it's a good thing, not a bad thing. on the contrary, i think it's unhealthy not to understand others. conflicts arises due to misunderstanding not because of understanding. with understanding then got tolerance.</p>
              <p>i think it's quite rate to get a new comer of Buddhism in Singapore who ask a lot of basic questions. when i was a mod in esangha(which was down), there were a lot from the west.</p>

              <p>Thought from your earlier thread 'Apology to this Forum' you are dropping the ID Positron? Anyway, go ahead and asked as many questions as you want on Buddhism for your street Evangelism purposes. What you are doing do help other Buddhists to know more and understand the religion better as well. Blessed you for been honest with your intention.</p>
