              <p>I'm not against followers from other religions learning Buddhism provided they are sincere. I've come across Christians who distort Buddhism and do it on purpose to mislead others.</p>
              <p>There are many examples, let me just quote  you guys one of them. This Christian said åœ°è—�çŽ‹è�©è�¨ said : åœ°ç‹±ä¸�ç©ºï¼Œèª“ä¸�æˆ�ä½›. She distorted it and went round telling people that this verse is obviously telling people nobody can become Buddha because it is impossible that hell will be empty. If you are a true Buddhist, you will know that this is åœ°è—�çŽ‹è�©è�¨'s vow, it is not referring to all the Buddhists. New Buddhists may not understand and mislead by this Christian.</p>
              <p>I can tell you guys this Christian knows exactly what is happening but she did it on purpose. I have every reasons to believe she knows it is åœ°è—�çŽ‹è�©è�¨'s vow. May be she thinks it is ok to tell lies and distort because she is saving others.</p>

              <p>huh..... really.......? that's very misleading....</p>
              <p>but by the way... there is one part of the hell that Di Zang Sutra describe that there are excrement, urine all over the places and it really stinks like "hell"</p>
              <p>I was very shocked to read that....</p>
              <p>my curiosity for Hell increases... at first only know 18 lvl from tv shows... and then the 8 hot, cold hells from this forum... but now from Di Zang sutra... and many kinds of Demon Lords too....</p>

              <p><br>I believe every word that is written in Di Zang Sutra. Last time I  had doubts because some parts in the sutra can be quite disgusting but ever since someone told me what she saw (very disgusting ghosts, more disgusting than excrement and urine) and what she saw tallied with what is written in the sutra. Since then, I believe every word that is written in Di Zang Sutra.</p>

              <p>I think most imortant when choosing a sutra is depending on the purpose that you have in life. In all, Sutras have an effect for reducing negative karma.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For a start, one may chant om mani padmi hum, tathyata om bekandze, benkandze maha benkandze....... (medicine buddha sutra), Sakyamuni Mantra, or Great compassion mantra.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lots of people have heard "stories" about chanting mantra. If you are feeling uneasy or afraid, I heard that it is because you are not up to the level or compassionate enough to chant. That's why one will feel that way</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But remember all buddhas and boddhisvatas are compassionate and want to help all sentient beings :)</p>
