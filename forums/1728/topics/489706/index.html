              change, social justice, and saving the world</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>American scholar and Theravada monk Venerable Bhikkhu Bodhi might not
              receive the same high-profile press coverage as the Roman Catholic Church’s
              charismatic standard-bearer Pope Francis, but it is becoming evident to
              Buddhism watchers and commentators that his message is every bit as bold, eloquent,
              and sophisticated. The recent focus on Bhikkhu Bodhi and other courageous
              Buddhist leaders who are highlighting imminent threats such as climate change
              and global hunger might well be influenced by the popular resonance with the
              urgency with which Pope Francis speaks about the issues. Whatever the reasons,
              Bhikkhu Bodhi’s actions speak loudly for themselves. As the founder and chair
              of the humanitarian organization Buddhist Global Relief (BGR), his activist
              work centers specifically on the issues of climate change (he is a spiritual
              ambassador for the interfaith climate change movement Our Voices) and hunger
              relief.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>“When we started BGR, we initially set our mission to help those
              afflicted with poverty, disaster, and societal neglect,” he says.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>But after a short time we realized that this was too vague and not
              practical. Even large, well-established humanitarian organizations like CARE
              and Oxfam have more precisely defined missions. As a tiny Buddhist
              organization, we could not tackle the whole range of human challenges on this
              planet without dissipating our energies.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>I thus drew on my own experience in Sri Lanka and India, where I knew
              many people were suffering from malnutrition—though this problem is not as
              acute in Sri Lanka as it is in other countries. I also had read about the
              extent of global hunger, and it boggled my mind to realize that close to a
              billion people were suffering from food insecurity and that some six million a
              year died from hunger and hunger-related illnesses. I learned that it would
              take only about $40 billion a year to eliminate global hunger. Yet worldwide,
              governments pour perhaps a few trillion dollars annually into military budgets,
              while millions die of hunger. This struck me as a tragedy and pulled at my
              heart. The Buddha, in the </span><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>Dhammapada</span></em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>, had said:
              ‘There is no illness like hunger,’ and he often stressed the merits of
              providing food to the hungry. Thereby I saw a close fit between traditional
              Buddhist values and a more precise mission for BGR.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Bhikkhu Bodhi’s visibility in American public discourse over the past
              several years, especially as a representative of a “minority” religion in the
              US, is already impressive. In May this year, he was at George Washington
              University and the White House to discuss Buddhist civic engagement and the
              types of policies that Buddhists would like to see implemented. From a
              long-term perspective, however, Bhikkhu Bodhi doesn’t believe that the small
              number of Buddhists in the US as a discrete movement can have a significant
              impact on civic life.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>We are just a few ripples on the surface of the lake. Rather, in my
              view, our best prospects for giving Buddhist values a role in public
              affairs would be to join hands with other faith-based organizations that share
              these values. Rooted in our respective faiths we can present a collective
              front, advocating for greater social justice, ecological responsibility, a more
              peaceful foreign policy, and an end to racism and police violence against
              people of color.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>“This is especially necessary in the US,” he suggests, “since
              fundamentalist Christians have grabbed the moral high ground, advocating an
              agenda that seems driven more by bigotry and religious dogmatism than by true
              benevolence and care for the less fortunate.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Many Buddhist leaders as well as voices from other faiths recognize that
              divided, the religions cannot form a united front on mitigating and
              transforming many of the selfish and destructive interests that are threatening
              to exhaust the planet’s resources.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>“The major threat that I see today lies in the ascendency of a purely
              utilitarian worldview driven by a ruthless economic system that rates
              everything in terms of its monetary value and sees everything as nothing more
              than a source of financial profit,” he warns, echoing many similarly dire
              warnings from other religious public figures.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Under this mode of thinking, the environment turns into a pool of
              “natural resources” to be extracted and turned into profit-generating goods,
              and people are exploited for their labor and then disposed of when they are no
              longer of use.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>To resist these trends, I believe, we as Buddhists can be most effective
              by networking with others who regard human dignity and the integrity of the
              natural world as more precious than monetary wealth. By joining together, a collective
              voice might emerge that could well set in motion the forces needed to
              articulate and embody a new paradigm rooted in the intrinsic dignity of the
              person and the interdependence of all life on Earth. Such
              collaboration could serve to promote the alternative values that offer
              sane alternatives to our free-market imperatives of corporatism,
              exploitation, extraction, consumerism, and toxic economic growth.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>This will be no mean feat, and might be the greatest moral challenge
              posed to Buddhism and humanity as a whole in our time. To muster the energy to
              even begin building this united interfaith front, Bhikkhu Bodhi believes that
              Buddhists in the East and West alike need to nurture stronger humanitarian
              concern in their hearts.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Western Buddhists—and I think this is probably largely true among
              educated Buddhists in Asia—take to the dharma primarily as a path of inward
              development that bids us look away from the conditions of our societies. If
              this trend continues, Buddhism will serve as a comfortable home for the
              intellectual and cultural elite, but risks turning the quest for enlightenment
              into a private journey that offers only a resigned quietism in the face of the
              immense suffering which daily afflicts countless human lives.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>He believes there are two primary moral principles involved in this
              effort. “One is love, which arises from empathy, the ability to feel the
              happiness and suffering of others as one’s own. When love is directed toward
              those afflicted with suffering, it manifests as compassion, the sharing of
              their suffering, coupled with a determination to remove their suffering,” he
              says.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>The other principle that goes along with love is justice. Some of my
              Buddhist friends have objected to this, saying that justice is a concept
              foreign to Buddhism. I don’t agree. I think the word <em>dhamma</em>, in one of
              its many nuances, can be understood to signify justice, as when the
              “wheel-turning monarch” is described as </span><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>dhammiko dhammaraja</span></em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>, which I would render “a righteous king of righteousness,” or “a just
              king of justice.” In my understanding, justice arises when we recognize that
              all people possess intrinsic value, that all are endowed with inherent dignity,
              and therefore should be helped to realize this dignity.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Bhikkhu Bodhi finally joins the two concepts to form a distinct ethical
              ideal.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>When compassion and justice are unified, we arrive at what I call </span><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>conscientious compassion</span></em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>. This is compassion, not merely as a beautiful inward feeling of
              empathy with those suffering, but a compassion that gives birth to a fierce
              determination to uplift others, to tackle the causes of their suffering, and to
              establish the social, economic, and political conditions that will enable
              everyone to flourish and live in harmony. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>He invokes the idea of dependent origination to explain the need to see
              the interdependence between states of mind (particularly those governed by
              greed and delusion) and an economic system built on the premise of unlimited
              growth on a finite planet. Bhikkhu Bodhi concludes that if humanity is to avoid
              a horrific fate, a double transformation is necessary. First, we must undergo
              an “inner conversion” away from the quest to satisfy proliferating desires and
              the constant stimulation of greed or craving. But change is also needed in our
              institutions and social systems. Bhikkhu Bodhi suggests people turn away from
              an economic order based on incessant production and consumption and move toward
              a steady-state economy managed by people themselves for the benefit of their
              communities, rather than by corporate executives bent on market dominance and
              expanding profits.</span></p>

              is to be realized through the complete renunciation of craving. But few are
              capable of such a degree of detachment. To make the message more palatable, we
              have to stress such values as contentment, simplicity, the appreciation of
              natural beauty, and fulfillment through meaningful relationships, and the
              effort to control and master the mind.</span></p>
