              <h1>Regard all phenomena as dreams.</h1>
              <p>The word "dharma," here translated as "phenomenon," is used 
                                  in many different contexts. Sometimes it refers to teachings 
                                  and sometimes to a particular practice or a specific quality 
                                  that we try to cultivate in our practice. But in this particular 
                                  context, the word "dharma" doesn't mean the teachings, rather 
                                  it means any perceivable object or entity, such as an external 
                                  sight, sound, smell, and so forth. These are not as they seem: 
                                  they are visible or perceivable but not truly existing, just 
                                  like dreams. Therefore, first understand that all phenomena 
                                  are dream-like and then train in regarding them as being so.</p>
              <p>I don't feel that it is necessary to spend a lot of time 
                                  in this teaching discussing emptiness and whether things are 
                                  real and concrete or do not exist as real and solid as they 
                                  seem. As a matter of fact, they can be taken apart into smaller 
                                  and smaller parts until they are atoms. However, even the 
                                  smallest particles cannot be established to truly exist as 
                                  something concrete and real. This can be arrived at through 
                                  intelligent reasoning from the Middle Way philosophy. Using 
                                  Middle Way logic, it is possible to show that all phenomena 
                                  are not as real as they seem. This method proceeds by proving 
                                  that every view we hold about reality can be disproved. Another 
                                  approach is to establish how things are, rather than disproving 
                                  their reality.</p>
              <p>The nature of the emptiness of phenomena can be illustrated 
                                  with the example of a dream. Every one of us dreams at night, 
                                  and while we dream, it seems that there are objects, sounds, 
                                  and so forth, which are exactly the same as they are while 
                                  we are awake. We see hills, forests, houses, people, and so 
                                  forth, during our dreams, but these phenomena are not as they 
                                  seem. They appear to us, but they are not solid even though 
                                  we can hit them, fall off them, and so on. Is everything we 
                                  see in our dreams there? No. When we dream of a house or mountain, 
                                  there is no real house or mountain in the room. In other words, 
                                  while not existing, these phenomena still appear. How is it 
                                  possible that something that doesn't really exist still appears 
                                  to us? The answer is that it is like a dream, when we see, 
                                  hear, feel textures, taste, smell, and so forth though these 
                                  things are not really there. How should we regard the phenomena 
                                  in our waking state? As empty just as in a dream. We, therefore, 
                                  should "Regard all dharmas as dreams."</p>
              <p>Sometimes we contemplate that all outer phenomena--trees, 
                                  houses and mountains-- are not real, but resemble appearances 
                                  in a dream. We also contemplate that the inner phenomenon 
                                  of our mind, which perceives all outer phenomena, is also 
                                  not real. Rather, our mind is empty of inherent existence. 
                                  To engage in the two contemplations that outer and inner phenomena 
                                  resemble a dream, we first think that everything we see in 
                                  the animate and inanimate world is like the appearances arising 
                                  in a dream and that our sensations of these phenomena--smell, 
                                  taste, touch, sight, hearing, and feeling--are also like the 
                                  sensations felt in a dream.</p>
              <p>To repeat, we think that everything we perceive outside of 
                                  us is not real; it is like a dream or an illusion. If everything 
                                  out there is just a dream or illusion, then these phenomena 
                                  must come from the mind. The next thought is, "Well, is the 
                                  mind itself real?" To determine if mind is a real, solid entity 
                                  or empty just like outer phenomena, we can, employ the Mahamudra 
                                  or Dzogchen instructions to look directly at our mind.</p>

              <h1 id="instruction">Investigate the nature of unborn awareness.</h1>
              <p>Looking nakedly at the essential nature of mind, we 
                                        find that mind is not established as any "thing" at 
                                        all. This means that if we look for the mind, we find 
                                        it has no color or shape, or any other definable characteristic 
                                        which an object does. Since objects have a beginning, 
                                        we may wonder, "Where does the mind start? Is there 
                                        a point of origin for the mind?" Again if we look, we 
                                        cannot find a point of origin for the mind. Other than 
                                        thinking that it is like the wind moving in the sky, 
                                        there is nothing to indicate what it is like. Since 
                                        there is no place where it begins, it is said that mind 
                                        is unborn.</p>
              <p>If mind is unborn, we may then ask, "So where is it 
                                        now?" Examining the present mind to see whether it is 
                                        somewhere outside the body, we find that there is no 
                                        place where it resides in the objects that we sense 
                                        or see. It is not separate from the body, so we ask, 
                                        "Well, is it inside?" But we cannot find a particular 
                                        place where it is located in the body. Since mind does 
                                        not have a color or a location, we therefore say that 
                                        it is by nature empty.</p>
              <p>Finally we wonder, "Where does mind stop when thoughts 
                                        stop? And where do thoughts go?" Again, there is no 
                                        place we can find where thoughts end. The mind does 
                                        not attach itself to an outer object and stop there. 
                                        There is no origin of mind, it does not dwell anywhere, 
                                        and it does not end anywhere because it is empty. So 
                                        the mind is without birth, abiding, and cessation. This 
                                        awareness can't be found. This contemplation of looking 
                                        for the mind, trying to find if it has any reality or 
                                        not, is a very important practice to do over and over 
                                        again until we are convinced that the nature of mind 
                                        is emptiness.</p>
              <p>So, first we examine outer phenomena to establish that 
                                        they are like a dream ; then we look at mind itself 
                                        and see that it is without birth, abiding, and cessation. 
                                        From this we establish that the inner phenomena of mind 
                                        are also empty. But this thought that mind and phenomena 
                                        are empty is just another thought, so now we must look 
                                        at the person who has that thought with the next instruction.</p>
              <p>Let us examine what the perceiver is, what we call 
                                        "me." Actually, when we look for it, we cannot find 
                                        it anywhere; we fail to find it, and yet at the same 
                                        time it seems that there is someone. This lack of finding 
                                        is here called "unborn," which means it doesn't come 
                                        about nor does it exist right now; it didn't arise and 
                                        it doesn't abide anywhere in the present. This is exactly 
                                        what we need to look into in order to find that this 
                                        also does not really exist, which is called "empty of 
                                        essence" or "empty of identity."</p>
              <p>Earlier, two different types of meditation were mentioned: 
                                        analytic meditation, and resting meditation. Analytical 
                                        meditation which uses rational thinking, is not the 
                                        method meant in "investigate the nature of unborn awareness." 
                                        Here, the instruction means to look at unborn awareness. 
                                        This is like observing birds, just seeing what they 
                                        are doing. Where do they live? How do they get there? 
                                        How do they fly about? What do they eat? Inquiry is 
                                        simply taking a look by observing. In exactly the same 
                                        way, we take a look at the mind and ask: Where does 
                                        it dwell? How does it behave? What does it look like? 
                                        What color does it have? What shape does it have? And 
                                        where is it? How does it move? How does it stay? And 
                                        so forth. This type of inquiry is not intellectual.</p>
              <p>From time to time we have the feeling that the mind 
                                        is steady and remains calm. Then when we take a close 
                                        look at it, what is it really that remains calm now? 
                                        We fail to find that there is someone or something that 
                                        remains. In the same way, sometimes we notice that there 
                                        is thinking, and when we look into the identity of what 
                                        is it that thinks, we fail to find that there is a thinker, 
                                        someone or something actually thinking the thought. 
                                        This is not some kind of rationalization, but something 
                                        we see when we look. This is what is being taught here 
                                        in the statement: "Investigate the nature of unborn 
                                        awareness." Unborn here is a synonym for absence of 
                                        identity.</p>

              <p><strong>Even the antidote is released in its ground.</strong></p>
              <p>We begin with the belief that everything is solid and real. Then 
                              we develop the belief that this is incorrect and everything is 
                              just emptiness or like a dream. This second belief, however, developed 
                              by the previous instruction, is not real either. To illustrate 
                              this point, Shantideva gave the following example: If you were 
                              dreaming that you had a son and the son died, you would think, 
                              "I had a son and now he is gone." You might think that the thought 
                              that he is gone is an antidote to the thought that he existed. 
                              But in fact this can't be correct because none of it is real: 
                              it is all like a dream. So the thought that you had a son was 
                              not real, and the thought that your son had died was also unreal. 
                              That is what "the antidote released in its ground" means. When 
                              you begin to believe that everything is emptiness, then you have 
                              to let that thought go, too. You have to look at the one who is 
                              thinking that thought and realize that this one, too, is not real.</p>
              <p>In his commentary on The Seven Points of Mind Training, called 
                              The Great Path of Awakening, Jamgon Kongtrul said that this teaching 
                              is explained as conceptual meditation because examination of outer 
                              objects as having no birth, no abiding, and no cessation is done 
                              through using our intellect.</p>
              <p>As previously mentioned, there are two ways of meditation training: 
                              the analytical meditation of a scholar, a pandita, and the resting 
                              meditation of a kusulu, a simple meditator. Analytical meditation 
                              of a pandita involves questioning, inquiring, and quoting the 
                              scriptures from masters of the past. To gain some certainty about 
                              how things are, we need to look at external things to see how 
                              they are, and we need to look within to see how our mind is. We 
                              even look at the remedies against the usual belief about outer 
                              and inner phenomena. As we reach some kind of conviction, all 
                              we can see is direct experience.</p>

              <h1>Seeing delusive appearances as the four kayas is the unexcelled
                                      protection emptiness gives.</h1>
              <p>The way to see confusion as the four kayas (four bodies or four
                                      dimensions) is to regard any difficulties and troubles we may
                                      experience as a dream, a magical illusion, because the true nature
                                      of external phenomena has no inherent nature: external phenomena of
                                      samsara are like phenomena in a dream: they do not exist and the
                                      realization of this absence of true existence is the dharmakaya.
                                      While phenomena do not exist ultimately, on a relative level, due
                                      to mere dependent origination, they arise like appearances in a
                                      dream and this is the nirmanakaya. These two qualities of being
                                      non- existent and yet perceived or experienced are an indivisible
                                      unity which is the sambhogakaya. The unity of all three kayas or
                                      dimensions is the svabhavikakaya. In this way, we can train in
                                      treating confusion as the four kayas, which is how they actually
                                      are. This method is called "the unexcelled protection of shunyata
                                      or emptiness."</p>
              <p>If we have developed some stability in our meditation we may be
                                      capable of dealing with problems and mishaps by regarding
                                      everything as an illusion, the nature of the four kayas. Otherwise,
                                      we will have to train in the relative level of dealing with
                                      difficulties by bringing them into the path of enlightenment,
                                      diminishing self-cherishing and increasing cherishing others.</p>
