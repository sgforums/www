              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 18.55pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #3c3c3c;'>Some
              550 years ago, so a story goes, the poet-sage Kabir was on a silt island in
              India’s Narmada River. He was brushing his teeth with a twig. When he flung his
              toothbrush to the ground, up sprang a gigantic tree whose crown spread so wide
              it cast shade over a whole hectare of land. Today, Kabir’s tree is one of the
              biggest plants on the planet. Its true story is no less extraordinary than the
              myth.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 18.55pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #3c3c3c;'>It is a
              banyan (<em><span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">Ficus benghalensis</span></em>), one of hundreds of species of fig
              trees. No other plants feature in so rich a mix of folklore and faith stories
              as the figs. And none is as awesome to behold as the banyan. Walk beneath
              Kabir's tree’s crown and you will see the illusion of a forest, a tight mass of
              thousands of trees. But look closer and you will see that everything is
              connected. There is just one tree. The banyan’s Sanskrit names —<em><span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">nyagrodha</span></em>, ‘the
              down-grower’ and<span> </span><em><span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">bahupada</span></em>, ‘the one
              with many feet’— hint at its secrets.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 18.55pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #3c3c3c;'>Many
              years earlier, another tree had occupied the spot where Kabir’s banyan grows.
              That tree’s fate shifted when a bird, or perhaps a bat or monkey, passed by
              having fed earlier on ripe<em><span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">Ficus benghalensis</span></em><span> </span>figs.
              The animal pooped on the tree and condemned it to a slow death by smothering.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 18.55pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #3c3c3c;'>The
              animal’s droppings delivered a banyan seed to a moist nook. Within weeks, the
              fig seed split open. It sent up a firm stalk with a collar of two tiny green
              leaves. It sent down tiny roots that hugged the host tree as they stretched
              earthwards in search of soil. In time, these roots would expand and enlace.
              They would encase the host tree and erase all trace of it. </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 18.55pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #3c3c3c;'>As the
              banyan grew, its branches also sent out roots. They dangled like strands of
              unkempt hair. When they reached the ground, these roots grew thick and woody
              and merged to form what looked like new tree trunks. The massive branches
              reached ever outwards, sending down yet more and more prop roots. These pillars
              formed increasingly wide circles around the banyan’s core, enclosing it in
              nested cloisters.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 18.55pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #3c3c3c;'>When
              British historian Thomas Maurice wrote about Kabir's banyan in 1794, he said it
              had more than 350 of these false trunks, each one thicker than an English oak
              tree, and another 3000 smaller stems. He noted that locals said the tree was
              3000 years old, suggesting it existed long before Kabir himself. This raises
              the possibility that it was the same banyan Alexander the Great and his army
              encountered on the Narmada River when they arrived in India in 326 BCE.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 18.55pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #3c3c3c;'>Alexander’s
              men were certainly the first Europeans known to have seen a banyan. They were
              amazed. The vivid descriptions they wrote down would inform Theophrastus, the
              father of modern botany, back home in Greece. But local people saw banyans as
              much more than impressive trees. The banyans had long been part of the cultural
              fabric. More than a thousand years earlier, the people of the Indus Valley
              Civilization adopted a stylized banyan as a symbol in their script. Later
              Vedic, Jain and Buddhist and Hindu scriptures and stories mention banyans
              often.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 18.55pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #3c3c3c;'>To
              bodies, these trees provided shelter, food and medicines to treat dozens of
              disorders. To minds, they formed bridges to the supernatural. Gods and spirits
              moved among their leaves and pillar roots. By 500 BCE, Hindu texts described a
              cosmic ‘world tree’, a banyan that grew upside down with its roots in the
              heavens. Its trunk and branches reached to Earth to bring blessings to
              humankind. </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 18.55pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #3c3c3c;'>The
              banyan became a potent symbol of fertility, life and resurrection. It features
              in Hindu stories of the universe’s periodic death and rebirth, when everything
              that exists dissolves into a ceaseless sea. One story says an ‘undying’ banyan
              is the only thing to survive the deluge. Another says that to ride the sea’s
              currents, the god Vishnu assumes the form of a baby, lying on his back on a
              raft formed of a banyan leaf. With one breath, the baby swallows all that
              surrounds it, taking the turbulent universe into the safety of his stomach
              before exhaling it into fresh existence. </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 18.55pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #3c3c3c;'>After
              the British arrived in India, these symbols of life became agents of death; the
              British began to use banyans as gallows to execute rebels who resisted
              their rule. By the 1850s, there had been multiple occasions when they hanged
              over a hundred men to death from a single banyan. India restored dignity to
              these trees when it gained independence and made the banyan its national tree.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 18.55pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #3c3c3c;'>While
              the British knew these trees by name, Alexander’s army would not have heard the
              word banyan. The name only arose more than a thousand years later when
              Portuguese visitors to India modified the Gujarati word<span> </span><em><span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">vaniyan</span></em>, meaning merchant. They named the tree banyan
              after the traders who set up their stalls in its shade.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 18.55pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #3c3c3c;'>A
              banyan is a natural meeting place, a vast umbrella of dark green leathery
              leaves that blocks out the sun or showers of rain. These trees form the
              centerpiece of many villages. Entire cities have even grown up around these
              trees. The city of Vadodara in Gujarat, western India is one example. It is
              thought to derive its name from the Sanskrit word<span> </span><em><span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">vatodar</span></em>, meaning ‘in the heart of the banyan tree’.
              Asia’s oldest stock exchange, the Bombay Stock Exchange, was also born beneath
              a banyan in Mumbai where stockbrokers </span><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #3c3c3c;'></span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 18.55pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #3c3c3c;'>In
              cities today, the banyans are curtailed by construction or cut down to make way
              for roads. But if left in peace, there is little to stop a banyan expanding.
              The biggest one on record exceeds even Kabir’s tree. It is said to have begun
              life in 1434 at the spot where a woman called Thimmamma died when she threw
              herself onto her husband’s funeral pyre. The tree, in Andhra Pradesh, now
              covers two hectares. Twenty thousand people can shelter beneath its crown.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 18.55pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #3c3c3c;'>All
              this from a seed that is just a couple of millimeters in length. Crack one open
              with your thumbnail and you won’t find much inside, yet the genetic material
              within has the power to create a tree vast enough to resemble a small forest.
              Ancient Hindu sages employed this paradox in a parable, which used the
              imperceptible power within a banyan seed as a parallel of Atman, the invisible
              essence Hindus say permeates and sustains the universe and all it contains.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 18.55pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #3c3c3c;'>The
              banyan’s power reaches deep into our world. Like all fig species, these trees
              depend on specific wasps to enter their figs and pollinate the flowers hidden
              within. A side effect of this relationship is that banyan figs are available
              all year round. They offer a lifeline to birds, fruit bats, monkeys and other
              creatures, which in turn disperse the seeds of hundreds of tree species,
              planting the forests of the future. The banyans truly are trees of life.</span></p>
