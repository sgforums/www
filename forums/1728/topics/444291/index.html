              <p>(11:53 PM) Forummer X: this reasonable.atheist guy <br>(11:53 PM) Forummer X: reminds me of INS<br>very into argument<br>but he's also chasing his own tail... just that he doesn't realise it <br>(11:55 PM) An Eternal Now: haha <br>(12:18 AM) Forummer X: let me "test" you<br>i may be wrong, but i hv had this suspicion for some time<br>who do u think Jacky Woo is?<br>(we know him as another username) <br>(12:22 AM) An Eternal Now: i know jacky woo<br>met him before<br>but i forgot his previous nick<br>he is very into ajahn brahm<br>he's ok, but fireice don't like him for some reasons<br>maybe he messed up in other forums<br>oh and he has skepticism of mahayana <br>(12:23 AM) Forummer X: oh, so my guess is wrong then <br>(12:23 AM) An Eternal Now: why<br>who u guess <br>(12:23 AM) Forummer X: i thot he is Rooney <br>(12:23 AM) An Eternal Now: is rooney lah <br>(12:23 AM) Forummer X: see, i am right<br>ha! <br>(12:24 AM) An Eternal Now: yeah<br>these people ah<br>if only they had the sort of interest in dharma<br>as in<br>interest in real practical transformation and insight<br>like those in dharmaoverground<br>kenneth folk forum<br>etc<br>i just dont know how to build that kind of community... it wld be great<br>rather than dwelling in issues that are really side issues<br>including that reasonable atheist<br>i think the analogy of <br>the poison arrow is apt <br>(12:26 AM) Forummer X: becos sgforums is an open community<br>doesn't consist only of Wisdom Bliss <br>(12:26 AM) An Eternal Now: i know.. but i mean.... how does daniel ingram do such a good job<br>thats pretty amazing <br>(12:27 AM) Forummer X: i think it has to do with Asians already having wrong concepts... built up over the years of practising the folk stuff and not the authentic Buddhism<br>Westerners can get very serious about whatever they get into <br>(12:27 AM) An Eternal Now: not really<br>i mean<br>reasonable atheist<br>or dun talk about atheist la<br>i mean<br>ppl like jacky woo<br>their interest in dharma is only very shallow<br>even tho they have right concepts<br>its very surface understanding <br>(12:28 AM) Forummer X: which is why i mentioned to you about the need to simplify the way you write about insights<br>you don't hv to compromise anything, but think of a way to get people interested first<br>(12:29 AM) An Eternal Now: actually if jacky woo sincerely wants to discuss dharma, he should create a new nick<br>and dont let other ppl (esp fifi) know he is rooney and dont screw up this time<br>haha<br>ic <br>(12:29 AM) Forummer X: i been telling AK that he should think about stream entry<br>i feel he has more potential than me  <br>but ... he told me he cannot digest the cheem stuff u write<br>he actually one of the more serious ones around (regarding learning Dharma)<br>but i feel he has a keen interest in Dharma<br>wants to learn, wants to understand <br>(12:32 AM) An Eternal Now: i see... <br>yeah <br>(12:34 AM) Forummer X: lately, i've been reading and trying the practice the non-duality stuff<br>take moments out in a day to rest in awareness<br>trying to* <br>(12:39 AM) An Eternal Now: thats great.. i think there was another website that has a similar approach. its not similar to my approach bcos mine is self inquiry and direct path, hers is a little more gradual. u can read this: http://www.saieditor.com/stars/odenver.html <br>(12:41 AM) Forummer X: oh yeah, i encountered this before<br>ok back to what we were talking about <br>(12:43 AM) Forummer X: what do u think is the reason why DHO can have so many serious practitioners and we can't seem to do it here?<br>u must hv considered b4 <br>(12:43 AM) An Eternal Now: i think partly due to daniel ingram's charismatic ability to teach the dharma in a very down to earth manner<br>im not a teacher and i never wrote books.. haha<br>he became famous in the west... i think even ppl in singapore also know him liao <br>(12:44 AM) Forummer X: becos u intro his book mah <br>(12:44 AM) An Eternal Now: hahaha<br>hope kenneth can also write something as great as daniel's<br>it would be damn interesting<br>and the path wld be more related to mine<br>even tho not exactly.. cos he focused many years on 1st gear also <br>(12:46 AM) Forummer X: i think Asians are attracted by what benefits them<br>if u wanna convince Asians to reach for enlightenment, u gotta dangle a carrot<br>sad but true, we need to know what's in it for us <br>(12:47 AM) An Eternal Now: yeah but so do westerners right <br>(12:48 AM) Forummer X: Westerners, the more educated ones ... are more philosophical and altruistic<br>they may do spiritual searching just for the sake of it<br>not to say they don't hv dissatisfaction to begin with, but they generally hv loftier ideals <br>(12:49 AM) An Eternal Now: i see<br>i get what u mean now <br>(12:50 AM) Forummer X: i just came back from a 4-day Mani recitation retreat <br>(12:50 AM) An Eternal Now: when?<br> <br>(12:50 AM) Forummer X: just lor... past 4 days <br>(12:50 AM) An Eternal Now: huh i tot u online yest<br>lol <br>(12:51 AM) Forummer X: i was running fever yesterday... skipped one day   <br>(12:51 AM) An Eternal Now: ooh... hope u're well now<br>hows ur retreat <br>(12:51 AM) Forummer X: what i wanted to say is, <br>altho' enlightenment was mentioned in all the prayers and dedications<br>i can assure u that 95% of ppl there didn't know what enlightenment means <br>(12:52 AM) An Eternal Now: very true<br>they just want to pray for peace for family... very worldly stuff <br>(12:53 AM) Forummer X: u may think it's so elementary... why do i hv to tell ppl what enlightenment means<br>but u know, sometimes really hv to just give it to ppl so they know enlightenment is not some far-out mystical experience<br>spell it out for them... what awakening means<br>awaken to what<br>and of course, also dangle the carrot<br> <br>(12:54 AM) An Eternal Now: thats very true<br>how do u dangle the carrot<br>haha <br>(12:55 AM) Forummer X: lol<br>i give an example<br>when i tried dangling the carrot to AK<br>i forwarded him an email u sent me a while back<br>it was the one where u talked to Kenneth about your emotional transformations since Anatta <br>(12:56 AM) An Eternal Now: aiyo... dun let too many ppl know these kind of things haha... i'm far from finishing my path <br>(12:56 AM) Forummer X: i felt that it would interest AK to know that he can be less fearful, less bad tempered, more at peace <br>(12:57 AM) An Eternal Now: i see <br>(12:57 AM) Forummer X: dun worry, i only sent to him... he's discreet <br>(12:57 AM) An Eternal Now: haha ok <br> <br>(12:57 AM) An Eternal Now: haha ok <br>(12:57 AM) Forummer X: i deleted out Thusness email in there too... u left it in there accidentally... lol <br>(12:57 AM) An Eternal Now: thusness email what <br>(12:58 AM) Forummer X: u forwarded to thusness then forwarded to me <br>(12:58 AM) An Eternal Now: oo<br>icic <br>(12:58 AM) Forummer X: u prolly didn't realise<br>so yeah, i think ppl need to know why enlightenment is a good idea<br>and it's not against principle<br>Buddha did say he teaches cessation of dukkha<br>like when i read some of Scott Kiloby's articles, i was attracted to trying out his methods<br>becos he talked about how life became "better" for him <br>(1:00 AM) An Eternal Now: yeah<br>scott kiloby and candice are very similar</p>
