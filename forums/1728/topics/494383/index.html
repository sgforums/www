              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Wency Leung The Globe and
              Mail Jul. 20, 2017 </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Can
              people warm or cool their bodies using only their thoughts? Wency Leung
              investigates the physiological effects of meditation and breathing techniques
              in extreme environments</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Vitina
              Blumenthal rolled out her yoga mat on the back patio of the Nicaragua hotel,
              where she was recently leading a wellness retreat. Seeking relief from the
              35-degree Celsius heat, she sat down, cross-legged, with her hands in
              her lap. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              Toronto mindfulness coach straightened her spine, closed her eyes and took
              three deep breaths. Then, curling up the sides of her tongue and sticking it
              out, she slowly inhaled through the tunnel she had formed, and exhaled. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">After
              repeating this several times, she could feel herself becoming calmer, lighter
              and less bothered by the oppressive heat. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“I
              get really overwhelmed sometimes when I’m super-heated and I can feel
              frustrated,” says Blumenthal, founder of the luxury wellness travel company
              WanderfulSoul. “That breath is a nice way to kind of trick the mind that you’re
              now cool.” </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Blumenthal,
              who has been practising yoga for more than a decade, explains she learned the
              meditative breathing technique, called sitali, while living in an ashram in
              India. Whenever she feels unbearably hot, she uses the technique to make
              herself feel cooler, whether she’s travelling abroad or riding out a humid
              Toronto heat wave. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Meditative
              techniques for regulating body temperature are part of ancient
              spiritual practices. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Yoga
              practitioners, for instance, refer to sitali and the similar sitkara, which
              involves positioning the tongue just behind the teeth, as breathing exercises
              that lower one’s body temperature. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Other
              yoga breathing exercises such as kapalbhati, which involves forceful breaths
              using the diaphragm, are meant to increase body heat. Tibetan Buddhist monks
              and nuns are known to practice tummo meditation, which is believed to create
              “inner fire,” allowing them to withstand frigid temperatures. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Similarly,
              Wim Hof, a daredevil from the Netherlands, is renowned for incredible feats
              such as submerging himself in ice for more than an hour at a time and climbing
              Mount Everest clothed in only a pair of shorts. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">He
              attributes his seemingly superhuman resilience to his eponymous method of breathing
              and meditation exercises. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Such
              phenomena have prompted researchers to investigate the physiological effects of
              meditation on body temperature. Can people actually think their way to becoming
              hotter or cooler?  </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Inner fire</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">One
              of the first Western scientists to examine this type of meditative practice is
              Dr. Herbert Benson, a mind body professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School
              and now director emeritus of the Benson-Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine
              at Massachusetts General Hospital. In February, 1981, Benson and his team
              travelled to the Himalayan town of Upper Dharamsala in India to study monks as
              they practised tummo meditation. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">As
              they reported in a 1982 paper published in the journal Nature, the only
              descriptions of this esoteric practice that existed previously were
              unscientific eye-witness accounts. These depicted novice monks sitting naked
              and cross-legged on the ground, then wrapping themselves with sheets dipped in
              icy water. The men were then said to have dried the sheets with their
              body heat. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Benson
              says he observed seasoned monks practising tummo meditation in temperatures of
              4 C to 10 C. He noticed they first entered what he calls a “relaxation
              response” state, which he describes as the opposite of the “fight or flight”
              stress response, slowing their breaths and settling into a deep rest. Then,
              they visualized their bodies being heated by fire, which they explained comes
              from “the scattered consciousness,” he says. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“The
              purpose of that is to burn away the harmful effects of stress,” Benson says,
              noting that at such low environmental temperatures, “You and I would go into
              uncontrollable shivering. [But] here, they were able to actually have the
              sheets steam on their bodies. That was for them, a sign of
              successful meditation.” </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Benson
              and his team took a number of measurements of three monks, aged 46 to 59,
              including temperatures of various parts of their body. They recorded no change
              in their rectal temperature, but found the monks were able to increase the
              temperature of their fingers and toes by as much as 8.3 C. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“This
              was fascinating,” Benson says. He noted the monks were able to keep their
              peripheral body temperature raised for as long as they were visualizing heat
              generated in the body. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              question, though, is how? Benson never found the answer. After the study was
              complete, he didn’t end up researching tummo further. The financial costs of
              returning to India were too high, he says, and instead, he turned his attention
              to examining the impact of meditation on health issues such as high
              blood pressure. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Mental imagery</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Dr.
              Maria Kozhevnikov has since picked up where Benson and his team left off. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Kozhevnikov,
              an associate professor of psychology at the National University of Singapore,
              has studied the physiological effects of Vajrayana techniques (Vajrayana is
              another name for Tantric Buddhism), including tummo meditation, on
              practitioners in Nepal, the Chinese province of Qinghai (also known as eastern
              Tibet) and Bhutan. Unlike mindfulness practices that induce relaxation, Vajrayana
              techniques elicit an arousal response controlled by the sympathetic nervous
              system, she explains. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Practitioners
              “use stress to go to a higher state of consciousness, not a relaxed state of
              mind,” she says. So contrary to what Benson believed he observed, practitioners
              of tummo and other Vajrayana techniques don’t dial down the stress response
              during meditation; they actively crank it up, she found. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Kozhevnikov,
              who is also a visiting associate professor of radiology at Harvard Medical
              School and specializes in the neural mechanisms of visual imagery, believes the
              answer to how tummo practitioners raise their body temperature consists of two
              parts: breathing and intense visualization. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              breathing, which in tummo practice is forceful and involves abdominal and
              pelvic muscle contractions, “is not that interesting,” she says. Rather, it’s
              just one of a few mundane techniques, such as engaging in physical exercise,
              that allow people to increase their core body temperature to a certain point.
              Typically, once they hit 37 C, the body’s cooling mechanisms automatically kick
              in. They start to sweat, their blood vessels dilate and they’re unable to raise
              their body temperature any further. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">This
              is where she believes intense visualization comes in. In tummo meditation,
              practitioners conjure mental images, such as flames, and imagine sensations of
              intense heat. Kozhevnikov suggests this visualization allows practitioners to
              override the body’s automatic cooling response, allowing them to push past
              their typical threshold. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“By
              using the visualization, apparently, the body doesn’t understand what’s
              happening and they can go on and on and on, and higher … than 37” degrees,
              she says. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Kozhevnikov
              says she’s still trying to figure out how visualization may produce this
              overriding effect. This summer, she has been recording the brain activity of
              nuns in Bhutan using electroencephalography as part of her efforts to
              understand the mechanisms at work. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Acclimatization training</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Some
              scientists are skeptical that this kind of body-temperature regulation can be
              explained by the powers of the mind. Dr. Maria Hopman, professor of integrative
              physiology at Radboud University in the Netherlands, thinks the answers are
              likely more physical than mental. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Hopman
              has performed several highly publicized experiments on Hof, also known as “The
              Iceman,” whose training method has gained followers around the world. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">One
              of her most “amazing” findings, she says, was Hof’s ability to maintain his
              core body temperature at close to 37 C, even after an hour and a half of being
              submerged in ice water, while his skin temperature plummeted. Hopman believes
              the main factor behind his resilience appears to be his vasoconstriction ability,
              or his ability to reduce blood flow to the skin in response to cold, so that he
              doesn’t lose too much heat. She suggests he has acquired this ability over many
              years of training. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Even
              though Hof’s method involves meditation and breathing exercises and is
              described as similar to tummo and yogic breathing, Hopman says she has
              witnessed him perform stunts in extreme cold without much time to meditate
              in preparation. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“I
              don’t know that the meditation is so important,” she says. “I think the most
              important thing is the training and the adjustment of the body.” </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">If
              you were to take daily minute-long cold showers, for instance, and gradually
              increase the length of your showers over time, you’d likely be able to
              withstand a 15-minute cold shower by the end of a year, Hopman says. “I really
              think it’s an adaptation of the body as you exposure yourself to
              it regularly.” </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Hopman
              notes Hof’s extraordinary abilities do not extend to tolerating heat. One of
              her colleagues once studied him as he ran a marathon in the heat of a desert in
              Namibia, she says, noting, “He was not extremely good at it. He really was not
              any better than anyone else with some strength and a fit body.” </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Cooling down</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">If
              these hypotheses provide possible explanations for how one might keep warm in
              cold temperatures, what could be behind yoga and meditation techniques that are
              meant to cool you down? </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Indeed,
              it’s possible to improve your tolerance to heat through similar repeated
              exposure. For instance, Bikram yoga, which is practised in a heated room, can
              be considered a form of heat training, says Dr. Jessica Mee, a lecturer and
              researcher in the school of sport, health and exercise sciences at Bangor
              University in Wales. Typically, after 15 sessions over four weeks, people start
              to experience certain physical adaptations that allow them to better cope in
              heat, such as an increase in sweating, more dilute sweat, and lower
              cardiovascular strain, she says. These adaptations may, over time, help you
              feel less uncomfortable in heat and become more efficient at cooling
              yourself down. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              acute effects of specific cooling postures and breathing techniques, however,
              such as the sitali breathing that Blumenthal practices, are not well studied.
              While they’re widely recognized and practised in yoga, there’s a lack of
              scientific literature on the effects of these techniques on body temperature,
              Mee says. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">But
              ultimately, Mee explains, our body temperature is dictated by our heat storage,
              which is determined by our heat production, or metabolic rate, and our ability
              to lose heat, which is typically through the evaporation of sweat. She suggests
              certain meditation and breathing techniques may help relax the body, reducing
              one’s metabolic rate to resting levels. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“So
              when we’re rested or calm and in a meditative state, you would likely expect a
              lower heat production,” she says, noting this is likely achieved through
              multiple responses including a lower heart rate, a lower respiratory rate and
              less skeletal muscle activity. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Psychological resilience</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">None
              of these practices for consciously controlling one’s body temperature are
              particularly mystical, says Dr. Norman Farb, an assistant professor of
              psychology at the University of Toronto Mississauga. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">But
              he suggests our bodies may be capable of more than we think. How we interpret
              our state of being hot or cold can contribute to how well we tolerate extreme
              temperatures, he says. For example, he explains, if we feel as though the
              summer heat is unbearable, the stress of that discomfort can itself affect our
              physiology, such as causing our heart rates to increase and our metabolism to
              speed up, thus making us even hotter and making the situation feel worse. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“That’s
              going to create a vicious cycle, like, ‘Oh, it’s too hot, and now I’m getting
              stressed about getting too hot and so I feel even hotter and I get more
              stressed,’” Farb says, noting many meditation practices are aimed at helping
              people distinguish between the primary sensation of what they’re experiencing
              and the interpretive layer they add on top. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“If
              you can stay with the primary sensation, it lends itself to psychological
              resilience because the things that often make people quit or or panic or fail
              are appraisals that they can’t cope,” he says. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Blumenthal,
              the Toronto mindfulness coach, believes this is what sitali enables her to do.
              While it may not actually change her body temperature, it calms her nerves and
              relieves her frustration over the heat, allowing her to better deal with the
              sweltering weather, she says. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Farb
              warns, however, that the body still has its physical limits. People who are
              good at breaking away from their concerns about the heat or cold may actually
              put themselves at risk of becoming overheated or making themselves vulnerable
              to hypothermia. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“It
              isn’t always just mind over matter,” he says. “You could get to the point where
              you still freeze to death or overheat. And in fact, this is a practice that
              would let you get to that place.”</span></p>
