              <p>Having meal in foodcourt while chanting for the well beings of others planted enormous blessings. Most importantly, chanting carried out in front of meal is firstly, to dedicate merits to all sentient beings that have prepared and made the delicious meal possible for your consumption to satisfy the body, an immeasureable kind gesture of demonstrating sincere gratefulness. Chanting can be done sincerely in the heart/mind or while bringing the food to the table and/or while eating it. Yes, you can chant and dedicate to animals. haha! as you mentioned it's more easier to chant near the ears of the animals before it is dead or to put it, a form of communication of love with them. They will feel your warmness personally, though they could not understand your language, but spiritually, they understand the language of your chant.</p>
              <p>Chanting does help them and it corresponds to the achievement of your chant. This is in accordance with Di Zang Jing - "filial piety sutra". In fact, all living beings sure to practice dharma in future and become Buddha of happiness :)</p>

              <p>if it represent a reminder of practicing Buddhadharma to the person, then there's a bit of giving dharma. then after practice dharma already, the person go and help more people, then there's a bit of giving fearlessness.</p>
              <p>on the other hand if they misuse also no good.</p>
              <p>of all the giving, teaching/giving Dharma is the best of the best. u are teaching people to plant they own crop, rather than feeding them.</p>
              <p>Buddha uses an example comparing giving wealth and dharma, that say if the world is to grin into dust. all that dust of the world is the merit of giving dharma. the merit of giving wealth is less than a spark of dust!</p>

              <p>It is good that you are mindful  when you order and eat meat dishes, that these animals have suffered death to fill your stomachs. You are then mindful of their sufferings and the sufferings of all sentients beings going through the process of being slaughtered.</p>
              <p>You are not dedicating to a piece of flesh, but to consciousness previously belonging to that pieces of meat, their suffering. </p>

              <p>old MCK always do 3 kind of giving/dana.</p>
              <p>one is print dharma material as much as he can afford and distribute them all around the world. it's better than curving onto a rock.</p>
              <p>two is free life by chance(sui yuan). this is to purify the karma of hunting when He was young.</p>
              <p>third is donate to old folks, charity, hospital and religious organisation. there was one X'tian hospital which allow all other religion to use what every they believe within their religion to do their own departure services. MCK thought they are so open minded and hence when they approach him for financial help, He donated alot to them every year.</p>
              <p>He quite vexing, everytime so many money donated to him around the world, and he need to think of ways to use. all ask him to use it to accumlate merit. it's visible, every year he say got around 100 million(?) dollar! don't know where they come from. the more he give away, the more it keep coming in. he said if no money, he'll be happier.</p>

              <p>That is ok, but show compassion and do good deeds is only a very limited part of Buddhism. In fact, it is not what Buddhism is in essence. It can ensure them to have good karma and rebirth, but not any more.</p>
              <p>All religions, and even non-religious teachings (even an atheist or free thinker should know this!) teaches these basic things.</p>
              <p>But as I said previously...  Buddhism is not just about morality, doing good,
                                          getting good karma etc... if these were the only things to
                                          Buddhism, then actually there would be no need for Buddhism at all.
                                          All the other religions already cover these things... and in fact
                                          morality is not the monopoly of religions, religion cannot claim to
                                          be the authority of morality. Morality is something even
                                          non-religious people should know.</p>
              <p>So what is special about Buddhism? It is the profound insight
                                          into human nature, the nature of suffering and grasping, the cause
                                          of it, the cessation of it, the way out of it... (aka the four
                                          noble truths)... It is the profound insight into the luminous
                                          essence and empty nature of experience... It is these insights that
                                          liberate us from bondage. All Buddhists should therefore start
                                          contemplating on these things so that they can achieve what the
                                          Buddha set out to achieve - lead sentient beings to the end of
                                          suffering.</p>
              <p>So ultimately what we want to lead all sentient beings to.. is enlightenment, the end of suffering, Buddhahood.</p>

              <p><br>Hi Beautiful951,</p>
              <p>Yes, this is also giving the dharma.  The dharma is that which brings benefit both temporary and ultimate to sentient beings... first teach them compassion and kindness because not everyone is ready for the ultimate teachings on wisdom straight away... don't even mention the ultimate teachings on wisdom, if you ask someone not to be so attached to his/her partner or children, it is almost impossible or already very difficult for them to drop such attachments and grasping.</p>
              <p>So starting with loving-kindness and compassion, one develops a more spacious mind.  Love and compassion in Buddhism is quite different from other religions or worldly perspective, our love is not limited to any objects ie, it is extended to all beings, friends and enemies and also to animals, spirits, even very negative beings... there is no-sentient being who is excluded... for this reason, the love and compassion that Buddhism expounds is all-pervasive compared to limited love in worldly life. </p>
              <p>Second difference, love and compassion in Buddhism has no sense of requiring a return.  Even if a person to whom you have been kind, returns you with ingratitude and even harm.  A bodhisattva regards such a person equally as one who is returning his help with gratitude and positive feedbacks. </p>
              <p>Third difference, love and compassion in Buddhism has no higher or lower, all objects are regarded with equanamity, family or relatives do not get a higher regard, enemies do not get less love. </p>
              <p>Fourth difference, in buddhism, the notion of bodhichitta can place others interest on a higher scale than oneself such that even the notion of seeking Buddhahood for oneself or self salvation from the delusions of samsaric mind can take second place to saving other beings first...  one can see this from many instances in our practices, for eg, we always give away all our merits to beings, not holding it back for ourselves.  This is to prevent self-centredness and grasping onto the merit.  But more importantly, it is in accord with the notion of bodhichitta which is that others are more important than oneself.  In many higher bodhisattva practices or even in the past lives of Buddha, he has repeatedly sacrificed his life, wealth, merits and everything for others... it is said that although the Buddha has always thought for others, but he attained Buddhahood first; although sentient beings always seek their own benefit, but they are still revolving in samsaric existence. </p>
              <p>These are the four differences between the unique viewpoints of love and compassion in Buddhism and in external sects.  It can be said that our notions of Bodhichitta in Buddhism cannot be found anywhere else outside Mahayana Buddhism and is the sole cause of attaining Buddhahood.  So it would be very important for anyone who wants to attain Buddhahood to train well in this.</p>
              <p>When one has set a good foundation in love, compassion and bodhichitta, the conditions for realising emptiness is already there and very easily accomplished.  For most of us, the teachings on compassion can be put into practice in our daily life right now and used to assess our relationships with others without the need for any further prerequisites.  It is ready to be used immediately and will have very strong effects on your life and dharma practice if you use it properly. </p>
              <p>One who practices well bodhichitta will never harm others, and will think only of benefitting others... in such a way, even his worldly life will be better because others will like him more, if he is doing business in a way that benefits others, definitely it is a better way to attract customers.  There will be harmony in his family because he knows how to accept harm and give benefits to others...</p>
              <p>On a dharmic level, the practice of bodhichitta gives rise to vast merits. It is said, one who practises bodhichitta generates merits even in his sleep.  With the accumulation of merits present and with little or no anger, selfish desire or pride/jealousy... due to wishing only to benefit others, one's mind is freer from the disturbing emotions and morality is naturally pure, which lays a very strong basis for developing shamatha and vipassana, meeting a genuine teacher, receiving the teachings and completing the other parts of the path.  One is not in a hurry to complete the path for oneself, instead one's bodhichitta is the courage and fuel for oneself to try to liberate beings from samsara...</p>
              <p>In future lives, if you do come back again, bodhichitta will soak your mindstream as a natural tendency.  Buddhas are most pleased when one tries to benefit other sentient beings... i can tell you this most definitely. No matter what chanting you do, you can't really connect to the deity / Buddha on the deepest level if your motivation is lacking bodhichitta.  There is really no better dharma than giving rise to bodhichitta and benefitting beings...</p>

              <p>Let's say the Buddha accepted Devadatta's advice and imposed the rule. If a person who wants to join the order and has the potential to be an Arhat, but because he couldn't relinquish meat, he decides not to join the order. What will happen? This rule will cut off this person's path to liberation.</p>
              <p>That's why he didn't impose this rule. The Buddha is most compassionate and has to consider all sentient beings, not only sentient beings who are willing to give up meat, so he came up with the 3 kinds of pure meat rule instead.<br><br>The Buddha promoted vegetarianism in several Sutras, so it's not that he supported eating meat.</p>
