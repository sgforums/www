              <div class="post-header"></div>
              <div class="post-body entry-content">The other day I saw a workshop advertised called "Dzogchen without 
              Buddhism". I have, over the years seen a number of suggestions that 
              Dzogchen practitioners can dispense with Buddhism, or that it is not 
              essential to be a Buddhist to practice Dzogchen. I would like a spend a 
              little time examining that claim.<br> <br> The first question I am led to ask is this: just what is a Buddhist? At 
              the most basic level a Buddhist is someone who believes in the awakening
               of a fellow named Gautama (the son of a petty tribal chief of the ÅšÄ�kya
               clan on northern plains of India, also known as "The Buddha"), and 
              wishes to follow that path.<br> <br> This leads to our next question: do Dzogchen texts mention the Buddha? 
              It would seem, from textual evidence, that they do. Disparate Dzogchen 
              tantras such as the rang 'byung chen po rgyud, the rig pa rang shar and 
              the kun byed rgyal po mention a person called Teacher ÅšÄ�kyamuni. <br> <br> I suppose this is not completely convincing evidence, since it can be 
              pointed out that merely mentioning the name Buddha does not make a 
              tradition Buddhist. After all, Manichaeism, Baha'i and Hinduism accord 
              recognition to the Buddha as a great teacher of humankind. So there must
               be something a bit more.<br> <br> How about by goal? Dzogchen, like other Buddhist traditions proposes not
               only is there a person called the Buddha, but that everyone who so 
              wishes can achieve that same result, known in Buddhism as byang chub, 
              bodhi awakening and buddha, sangs rgyas, full awakening. These two terms
               appear by the thousands in Dzogchen tantras and texts.<br> <br> So how does Dzogchen define "buddhahood"? Dzogchen is not a gradual 
              path, so it does not completely define full awakening in terms common to
               the paths of cause and result i.e. as the result of the accumulation of
               merit and wisdom. However, what Dzogchen does share with the lower 
              paths of the cause and result is the definition of full awakening, 
              buddhahood, as the permanent state of being completely free from the 
              afflictive obscuration and being endowed with full omniscience.<br> <br> Like all Buddhist paths, Dzogchen sets out to solve the questions of 
              what constitutes suffering, the cause of suffering, and how we free 
              ourselves from that suffering. It may be objected that the answer to 
              that question is quite different from how it is answered in Hinayana and
               Mahayana, and in the lower tantras — nevertheless, the fact that it 
              engages these questions in a Buddhist context shows that the context of 
              Dzogchen is entirely Buddhist. In fact, there are numerous Dzogchen 
              tantras that review the whole of the non-Buddhist and Buddhist tenet 
              systems in ascending order from non-Buddhist materialists, Samkhya, 
              Vedanta, and so on; then Vaibhashika, Sautrantika, Pratyekabudha, 
              Cittamatra, Madhyamaka and so on.<br> <br> Perhaps the principle difference between Dzogchen and other schools is 
              the pairing of two states: vidyÄ� and avidyÄ�, rigpa and ma rigpa, 
              knowledge and ignorance. Whereas other schools propose that affliction 
              is the cause of suffering, and engages in scrubbing afflictions, 
              Dzogchen sees the cause of suffering in the knowledge obscuration of 
              avidyÄ�, ignorance. Dzogchen suggests that ignorance can only be removed 
              by knowledge or rigpa. That knowledge, vidyÄ�, rigpa, is direct personal 
              experience of our actual state. But the terms with which Dzogchen 
              explores these issues is entirely grounded in Buddhist discourse, among 
              Buddhists.<br> <br> What about Dzogchen in Bon? This is a highly contentious issue. There 
              may or may not have been a teacher called Ston pa Shenrab. He may have 
              come from Western Tibet, from the vicinity of Kailash, or "Tajik" to the
               west. He may have lived eighteen thousand years ago, or he may have 
              lived four thousand years ago, and so on. We have no reliable documents 
              about him as a person that date before the 10th century. This shows 
              however that there is a tradition about him that predates this period. 
              But we can't really know how old it is. Everything we know about him 
              dates from the tenth century onward. Tibetans scrubbed their own history
               pretty thoroughly after the imperial period, so all we have left are 
              visionary accounts from tenth century onward.<br> <br>  In the end, Bon more closely resembles Buddhism than it differs from it. So my point remains the same.<br> <br> Finally in terms of the path: Chogyal Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche has clearly
               enunciated many times the following point: there are three sacred 
              principles without which a given practice that one is doing is not 
              Dzogchen: these principles are going for refuge, developing bodhicitta 
              motivation, and dedicating merits. Going for refuge is not defined by 
              reciting some words; it is defined by the recognition of problems with 
              one's own understanding and knowledge, and a desire to find the solution
               to these problems in Buddhas, such as Samantabhadra, Vajrasattva, 
              ÅšÄ�kyamuni, Garab Dorje and so on, their teachings, the Dzogchen 
              teachings, which include the meaning of all yÄ�nas; and the Sangha of 
              Dzogchen, the vidyÄ�dharas such as ÅšrÄ« Siá¹…gha, Padmasambhava and so on 
              and bodhisattvas such as MañjuÅ›rÄ«, AvalokiteÅ›vara and Vajrapani.<br> <br> Motivation does not mean mouthing words about saving all sentient 
              beings, here it means that it is not sufficient to merely seeks one's 
              own liberation, whether through Dzogchen or any other vehicle, one must 
              have compassion and loving kindness as one's basis for entering 
              practice.<br> <br> Dedication here means that we dedicate all our practice to others, in 
              the usual MahÄ�yÄ�na way, not necessarily with words, but with our 
              intention, so that all others will reach the state of the adibuddha, 
              Samantabhadra, quickly.<br> <br> Without these, whatever practice we are doing cannot be considered Dzogchen practice let alone Buddhist.<br> <br> Dzogchen without Buddhism therefore is "Ati Lite™". It may sound good, 
              it may look good, it might have a nice package, but in the end, it has 
              no value. It is not spiritually nourishing, it is spiritually depleting.<br> <br> Ati Lite™ will have the exact opposite effect of Dzogchen: instead of 
              becoming a more open, more humble person, one will become more 
              self-involved and afflicted. Instead of developing a broader mind, free 
              and flexible, able to accommodate changing conditions, one will become 
              more and more constricted, selfish and narrow. And in the end, one will 
              have nothing worth giving to anyone.<br> <br> The refreshing taste of Ati Lite™.</div>
