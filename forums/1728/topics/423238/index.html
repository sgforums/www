              <p>The major practice traditions are often referred to in Tibetan 
              literature as the Eight Chariots of the Practice Lineages of Tibetan 
              Buddhism. The Eight Chariots refer to the eight major practice lineages 
              of Tibetan learning and attainment, traditions which can be traced 
              directly back through the centuries of the history of Tibet and beyond 
              that into India. These traditions encompass the major schools and 
              lineages within Tibet:<br> <br> 1. The main doctrinal lineage of  Kama, the Ancient Translation School known as Nyingmapa<br> 2. Atisha's lineage, the Old Kadampa School, and the New Kadampa<br> 3. The lineage of the glorious Sakyapa<br> 4. The Four Major Schools and Eight Minor Schools of the lineage of the Marpa Kagyü Tradition<br> 5. The Shangpa Kagyü<br> 6. Phadampa Sangye's and Machik Lapdron's lineage<br> 7. Vajra Yoga Instruction Lineage<br> 8. The Great Yogi Orgyenpa Rinchenpal's Lineage<br> <br> Each of the Eight Chariots of the Practice Lineages of Tibetan Buddhism 
              has developed its own individual terminology within the context of 
              specific practices, oral explanations and regional understandings. An 
              image of Padmasambhava, the originator of many of the oral traditions 
              and written texts used by one of the Eight Chariots, the Nyingma 
              schoolSimilar or identical terms are used differently within the 
              contexts of each tradition's systems, and carry different meanings. 
              Accordingly, there is enormous confusion among research scholars and 
              translators in explaining and translating terms from different 
              traditions. <br> <br> The Tibetan tradition, which continued and developed Indian 
              philosophical and soteriological traditions begun over 2500 years ago, 
              is highly nuanced and complex, and the vocabulary of the written works 
              which embodies those traditions is commensurately difficult to 
              understand outside Tibetan traditions. Moreover, oral explanations and 
              practical experience are a necessary accompaniment to any living 
              tradition of scholarship and practice. In Tibet, these oral traditions 
              are even more necessary for understanding Tibetan texts, for each text 
              is interpreted within the context of a living lineage which passes down 
              its critical understanding and applications of the text. Thus, the 
              Tibetan traditions cannot be preserved merely by reading Tibetan books 
              -- the next generation must be taught how to read and understand the 
              terms found in those books.<br> <br> The Compendium of Buddhist Terminology will provide analytic 
              explanations and comparisons of the key terms used by the major practice
               traditions of Tibet. Though these traditions share similar goals and 
              outward clothes, each tradition provides a discipline and vocabulary 
              specific to the tradition. The vocabulary used to transmit the wisdom of
               the tradition has been finely honed over thousands of years by great 
              scholars and practitioners of the tradition. These terms are used in 
              specific ways, and the traditions cannot be understood without a precise
               understanding of the nuances of the terms.<br> <br> The abilities to use computers to digitize the Tibetan corpus and use 
              electronic search and data extraction techniques provides a scholarly 
              resource that was unavailable in classical Tibet. Thus, we have a unique
               opportunity to create reference works today that were not available in 
              Tibet. But these advances will be misdirected if they are not commenced 
              by scholars familiar with traditional Tibetan methods as well as modern 
              resources. Nitartha international, through its combination of scholarly 
              and technical resources, it thus in a unique position to make major 
              advances in Tibetan scholarship. <br> <br> Nitartha international was founded by The Dzogchen Ponlop, Rinpoche to 
              aid in the support of Tibetan educational systems, and to preserve the 
              precious heritage of Tibet, which is in such great danger of being lost.
               Under his leadership, Nitartha international has amassed an extensive 
              digital library of Tibetan texts that can be searched electronically to 
              assist in creating references for the Compendium. Nitartha has completed
               over 80,000 pages of text input at its input center in Nepal, and 
              edited several thousand pages of text so far, despite limited manpower 
              and resources.</p>
