              <p>to form a gate, it need principle rule of discipline(of mind/body), concentration and transcendent wisdom. æˆ’å®šæ…§. any 84000 method that lead to discipline(of mind/body), and lead to concentration, and lead to transcendent wisdom is a good gate.</p>
              <p>Story of Culapanthaka is an example. sweeping the floor and focus reciting "Sweeping broom" is the method or door/gate.</p>
              <p>Culapanthaka who is toward lacking of understanding but reach enlightenment through body/mind discipling.</p>
              <p><em>Cudapanthaka, The Door Watching Arhat (16): (Also called Culapanthaka, or Pantha the Younger) This is the younger brother of Panthaka above; his name means "Little Panthaka," or Road-born. There are two famous stories about him. One is that he was slow-witted, and unable to learn even a single verse. But the Buddha, using skillful means, taught him to sweep (in some versions, to wipe) and repeat a simple verse, such as "Sweeping broom," to focus his mind. This simple method led him to Enlightenment. Another story says that he used to knock roughly on people's doors to beg for food. Once, he knocked on an old, rotten door, and it fell to pieces! So the Buddha gave him a ringed staff (like that held by Bhadra next to him) and told him to pound the ground with it, instead of pounding on the door with his fist. Through this (and the sweeping association) he came to be thought of as one who guards the doors of the senses, letting only pure things in.</em></p>
              <p>we also have walking, eating, drinking, breathing. and countless ways. but principle rule æˆ’å®šæ…§ should be the same.</p>

              <p>to form a gate, it need principle rule of discipline(of
              mind/body), concentration and transcendent wisdom. æˆ’å®šæ…§. any 84000
              method that lead to discipline(of mind/body), and lead to
              concentration, and lead to transcendent wisdom is a good gate.</p>
              <p>Story of Culapanthaka is an example. sweeping the floor and
              focus reciting "Sweeping broom" is the method or door/gate.</p>
              <p>Culapanthaka who is toward lacking of understanding but reach
              enlightenment through body/mind discipling.</p>
              <p><em>Cudapanthaka, The Door Watching Arhat (16): (Also called
              Culapanthaka, or Pantha the Younger) This is the younger brother of
              Panthaka above; his name means "Little Panthaka," or Road-born.
              There are two famous stories about him. One is that he was
              slow-witted, and unable to learn even a single verse. But the
              Buddha, using skillful means, taught him to sweep (in some
              versions, to wipe) and repeat a simple verse, such as "Sweeping
              broom," to focus his mind. This simple method led him to
              Enlightenment. Another story says that he used to knock roughly on
              people's doors to beg for food. Once, he knocked on an old, rotten
              door, and it fell to pieces! So the Buddha gave him a ringed staff
              (like that held by Bhadra next to him) and told him to pound the
              ground with it, instead of pounding on the door with his fist.
              Through this (and the sweeping association) he came to be thought
              of as one who guards the doors of the senses, letting only pure
              things in.</em></p>
              <p>we also have walking, eating, drinking, breathing. and countless
              ways. but principle rule æˆ’å®šæ…§ should be the same.</p>
