              <p>  I stumbled upon the discussion in "Buddhism under siege" and I can't help but notice how ironic it was that Herzog's view was trampled upon by a group of stampeding buddhist. Instead of engaging him/her constructively and finding out why he say the things he said many just threw into the pot canned replies without any insight or understanding.  Herzog's view is a lot closer to Buddha's view than many of your view. I do not know herzog and I do not know any of you. Here is sharing a bit of my take and if you decide to stampede all over my post that would be fine as well 8-).  Here's one of Eternal Now's reply.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>   Meditation and chanting done correctly is not a mere ritual but
                                      helps calm the mind and in gaining wisdom. Bare attention,
                                      mindfulness and observation, results in insights.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>   You can't lump meditating and chanting together. Each has its own characteristic. You can never gain insight from chanting. Chanting dulls the mind. Likewise meditation will not gain insight if you are going for jhana. Insight only emerge very much later.  Only insight meditation can lead to insight prior to jhana.</p>
              <p>   What is "bare attention" ?  You use that phrase a lot and you always throw in a whole bunch of words and phrases.</p>
              <p>    Many people do meditation and chanting as a matter of daily routine and it became ritualistic in nature. Such approach to buddhist spirituality doesn't get anyone anywhere.  The sum total of buddhistic's path is confronting your delusions. When Herzog's use some "vulgarity" you should ask yourself why you thought it was vulgar ? Where does the meaning come from ?  That's confronting your delusion.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Being aware of each moment in a fresh, unconditioned manner (by
                                      any sort of external/internal habitual programming), is not the
                                      same as mindlessly acting out something out of routine and habit.
                                      Even brushing teeth is no longer a routine habitual activity but
                                      something you are aware of in each moment.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>   That's what the book said.  What do you understand by it ?  Won't you get a headache ?  Does this mean you know which teeth you are brushing at any moment ? What is the difference between concenctration and "bare attention" ?</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Practicing in this way, wise actions spontaneously arise not due
                                      to conforming with rules but due to natural wisdom and
                                      awareness.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>  So if the wise action called for using vulgarity would you in your not-so-wise state say that the wise action is not wise ?  Now I am getting a headache 8-) .  Or was it in your conditioned state, which you thought were wise and pure, cast your own delusions on the action ?</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Rituals cannot lead to liberation and blindly following of
                                      rituals without awareness (which is a form of cultural/religious
                                      conditioning) is known as a fetter and obstruction in Buddhism and
                                      cannot lead to the unbinding and freedom from all
                                      conditionings.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>  Rituals - whether it is done blindly or with awareness - cannot lead to liberation. Those who are not aware, rituals will not help them to be more aware. Those who are aware, rituals have no meaning or value. But why do Buddha still follow customs and culture as shown by many of his actions ? </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>From your posts, it is clear you have no idea what Buddhism is
                                      about, so it is best you stop making ridiculous comments and start
                                      learning Buddhism from authentic sources and teachers seriously
                                      instead of following your false ideas of it.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>  On the contrary. He knew the substance and spirit of buddhism while you have not even smelt the flesh of buddhism.  Can a deluded person know what is authentic and what is not ?  If you have to decide based on popularity or the opinion of others isn't this also taking in other people's delusion as your own ?</p>
              <p>   What was Buddha's advice in Kalama Sutta ?</p>

              <p>Chanting alone is shamatha. It does not dull the mind, it just focuses and calms the mind. However after gaining strength through chanting we can practice awareness. Being aware of the process of chanting itself, not on the words or meaning but on reality itself.</p>
              <p>Personally, I just do meditation, not much on chanting. But chanting can be helpful for some. However insight meditation can be practiced at any single moment. Why? Because reality is available whatever you are experiencing or doing. Whether chanting, sitting, or washing dishes. When we are practicing mindfulness, then nothing is mechanical, everything is alive, fresh. This has to be experienced.</p>

              <p><a href="/forums/1728/topics/262408">http://buddhism.sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/262408</a><br> <br> <span style="color: blue;">Thusness</span>: Ok. I think when we
                                      view consciousness, we have to understand that there are a few
                                      things. We cannot keep on thinking about the objective world first.
                                      We must see how consciousness reacts. That is if we react very
                                      intensely, strongly towards symbols, then whatever reactions will
                                      go back deep into your consciousness. This is one thing. My
                                      perspective is that when you chant, you are not dealing with our
                                      luminous clarity. We're dealing with propensities deep in your
                                      consciousness. Insight meditation itself deals directly with this
                                      clarity. That is the luminous clarity. But if we were to continue
                                      to chant, you are actually focusing more on the deeper layers of
                                      consciousness that deals with propensities and the power of
                                      concentration. Do you see what I mean? It's not so much of the
                                      luminosity. However, the chanting itself, when it takes strength,
                                      it creates a kind of momentum. A momentum that synchronises not
                                      only with your sub-conscious or the deeper layers of your
                                      consciousness, but also your conscious level. This means it can
                                      sync the two layers into one. This syncing the two into one clears
                                      your mind, clears your thoughts. And then at this time, you ask who
                                      you are, that is, not letting the momentum take place, but just
                                      feel and sense... then you ask what is it. At that moment, you
                                      might see your reality. But your mind must be able to settle down
                                      first. But you must know there is a difference between working at
                                      the concentration level, dealing with the karmic propensities and
                                      creating new momentums, and practicing insight meditation that
                                      touch directly the clarity and the luminous nature, are two
                                      different things. You see what I mean or not?<br> <br> <span style="color: red;">Participant 1</span>: Yeah I think so.
                                      This means that I still need to do insight meditation?<br> <br> <span style="color: blue;">Thusness</span>: Yes you have to do
                                      insight meditation. Even if you attain calmness you still have to
                                      do insight meditation. You must feel the awareness... You must
                                      sense it everywhere... That is very important for liberation. Now
                                      when we talk about awareness, we don't call it Self or we don't
                                      call it Mind. Why people call it Awareness is because they do not
                                      want to call it Self, because there is no Self. The reason they
                                      said Awareness, is because Awareness is not an entity. It is not a
                                      thing. It is just a point of luminous clarity. It is just clarity.
                                      But because we are so accustomed to thinking things in terms of
                                      object and subject, we always take Awareness as something. It must
                                      be somewhere inside, residing somewhere. Even if it is not residing
                                      inside the body it must be somewhere, someplace. This is the
                                      problem, you see. So when you say that letÂ’s be aware. We always
                                      think of Â“how?Â” How to be aware? When we say Â“where is awarenessÂ”,
                                      they always look for a place, they always look for a something.
                                      This is how the mind react, this is what I call a momentum. They
                                      always behave this way. They do not know how to say Â“Just do
                                      nothing. Everything is expressing itself by clarity.Â” They always
                                      want to react, you see what I mean?</p>

              <h3><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif; color: #ff0066;">Concept or Ultimate Reality?</span></h3>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">What
                  we should know is that the object of samatha meditation can be either
                  paññatti or paramattha. Paññatti means concept, paramattha means
                  absolute or ultimate reality. The object of samatha meditation may be
                  concept or ultimate reality. When we take a kasina as the object of
                  samatha meditation, the object is just concept, not absolute reality.
                  How?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">To
                  use a red kasina as the object of meditation, you have to draw a red
                  circle about the size of a plate on a wall or tree, about two feet from
                  the floor so that your eyes can look at it easily. That red must be
                  pure without mixing any other colour. When you focus on the red circle,
                  you have to focus on the whole red circle, not half or quarter of the
                  circle. So it is called kasina. Why? Because you want to concentrate on
                  the form of the circle. You need not know the red, the colour. You need
                  not know the texture. What you should do is concentrate on the form of
                  the circle very well, very deeply. You have to look at the whole circle
                  and focus your mind on it. Then when your concentration is good enough,
                  though you close your eyes, you can see that red circle in your mind,
                  that is the form of the circle. You concentrate on the red circle you
                  see in your mind. The circle that you see in your mind is called the
                  ‘PatibhÄ�ga Nimitta’. It means the nimitta that is similar to the circle
                  on the wall. Some scholars translate it as ‘counterpart sign’. This is
                  samatha meditation so you need not realise any physical or material
                  processes of the circle.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">What
                  you need to do is to concentrate your mind on the whole circle and
                  absorb the mind in it. That is why you see the red circle in your mind
                  when your concentration is good enough. The red circle is a form, it is
                  just a concept. The form is just concept, not ultimate reality. The
                  circle you see in your mind is not absolute reality. it is just
                  something which is created by your mind; so it is just a concept. In
                  this case the object of samatha meditation is just concept, not
                  ultimate reality.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">When
                  you practise BuddhÄ�nussati, it is recollection of the chief attributes
                  of the Buddha such as Araham, SammÄ�sambuddho, VijjÄ�carana sampanno,
                  Sugato, LokavidÅ«, Anuttaro purisadamma sÄ�rathi, Sattha devamanussÄ�nam,
                  Buddho, BhavagÄ�. Here the object is reality, paramattha. Say you
                  reflect on the attribute, ‘Araham’. It means the Buddha is worthy of
                  honour because he has totally destroyed all mental defilements. So to
                  destroy these mental defilements he has the fourth stage of
                  enlightenment, Arahatta Magga and SabbaññutÄ�, that is Omniscience. Then
                  you have to concentrate on those qualities of the Buddha which destroy
                  all mental defilements. These qualities are enlightenment and
                  omniscience; so they are absolute realities, not concepts. If you
                  repeatedly concentrate on these attributes, whenever the mind goes out
                  you bring it back and reflect on these attributes. Then gradually you
                  get concentrated. In this case, absolute reality, paramattha, is the
                  object of samatha meditation.</span></p>

              <h3><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif; color: #ff0066;">Insight Meditators Must Know Realities</span></h3>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">However
                  in vipassanÄ� meditation every object of meditation must be absolute
                  reality, ultimate reality, paramattha. In vipassanÄ� meditation no
                  concept can be the object of meditation. Concept cannot be the object
                  of vipassanÄ� meditation because vipassanÄ� meditators need to realise
                  the specific characteristics and general characteristics of mental and
                  physical phenomena, which are absolute realities. So the object must be
                  either mental or physical processes which are ultimate realities. If
                  concept is the object of vipassanÄ� meditation, vipassanÄ� meditators
                  cannot realise any characteristics of mental and physical processes
                  because you cannot find any real characteristics in concepts. Concepts
                  are created by the mind.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Say
                  your name is PaññÄ�nanda. Even though you might have died, if I memorise
                  your name as PaññÄ�nanda, the name is there in my mind (though the
                  actual PaññÄ�nanda has gone). Why? Because my mind memorises it, and
                  makes it exist. This shows that a name is just a concept because it is
                  created, memorised or made to exist by the mind. So concepts are not
                  realities. They are things made up by the mind, so they do not have any
                  characteristics to realise.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">If
                  the red circle is the object of meditation, we see the form of the
                  circle in our mind and concentrate on it. Gradually our mind becomes
                  more and more concentrated on the red circle that we see in our mind.
                  When the mind is totally absorbed in that circle, then we say we have
                  attained jhÄ�na. However, that red circle is not reality, because the
                  mind makes the object; so it is just a concept. It hasn’t any
                  characteristics to realise. Even though you concentrate your mind on it
                  for a hundred years continuously, you cannot realise any
                  characteristics; because it is not an absolute reality, it is a
                  mind-made thing — just a concept.</span></p>

                  the concept regarding respiration, then it will be <em>samatha</em> meditation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">So
                  the Visuddhimagga mentions the method of concentrating on the touching
                  sensation whenever you breathe in and breathe out. When you concentrate
                  your mind on the coming in and going out of the breath, then it is
                  samatha meditation because you have to concentrate on the coming in and
                  going out, not on the wind or air. When it is coming in you note ‘in’;
                  when it is going out you note, ‘out’. ‘In, out, in, out’. Your mind is
                  not on the breathing air but on the ‘coming-in’ and the ‘going-out’.
                  ‘Coming-in’ and ‘going-out’ are not ultimate realities.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Say
                  you come into the room through the door and go out of the room through
                  the door. We may ask, “What is this coming in and going out?” it is
                  neither you, nor a person. It is just ‘coming-in’ and ‘going-out.’ It
                  is just concept. In the same way, when you concentrate on the coming in
                  and going out of the breath, it is just a concept. Since  concept is
                  the object of meditation, it is <em>samatha</em> meditation. You cannot realise any specific characteristics or general
                  characteristics of ‘coming-in’ and ‘going-out’ because they are not
                  realities, just concepts, so that’s <em>samatha</em> meditation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">However,
                  if you focus your mind on the point where the breath touches whenever
                  it comes in or goes out, it touches the nostrils. When you observe this
                  touching sensation and are mindful of it, then it is (ultimate)
                  reality. That touching point is composed of the four primary material
                  elements: <em>pathavÄ« dhÄ�tu,</em> hard or soft; <em>Ä�po dhÄ�tu,</em> liquidity or cohesion; <em>tejo dhÄ�tu,</em> hot or cold; <em>vÄ�yo dhÄ�tu,</em> movement or vibration. These four elements are there whenever you focus
                  your mind on the touching sensation. So the object is absolute reality.
                  What can we call it — samatha or vipassanÄ� meditation? It is vipassanÄ�.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">That is what the Venerable MahÄ�si SayÄ�daw wrote about the distinction between the samatha and <em>vipassanÄ�</em> aspects of respiration meditation. I appreciate it very much. So then
                  we can say respiration meditation is vipassanÄ� meditation in accordance
                  with the MahÄ�satipatthÄ�na Sutta. We can also say that respiration
                  meditation is samatha in accordance with the Visuddhimagga. It is very
                  subtle and profound to differentiate between these two aspects of
                  respiration meditation, but I think those who have practised meditation
                  very well can differentiate between these two aspects</span></p>

              <p>let me start by saying i'm not here to stamp on anyone,
                  just here to share my 2cents and hopefully enhance my own understanding
                  from these exchanges.</p>
              <p>what many ppl feel are rituals are actually
                  merely tools that help to lead one to insight. the teachings prescribe
                  so many skillful means (meditation, chanting, visualization, logical
                  analysis.. etc) just for purpose of benefiting ppl of varying
                  dispositions.  no one tool will universally works for all the ppl in
                  the world.  some ppl will gravitate towards chanting while others to
                  meditation, and as long as there is beneficial outcome from that
                  person's perspective i think its still a positive thing to do. </p>
              <p>for
                  example, to force chanting exclusively onto a person who's not suitable
                  to benefit from that tool is obviously not skillful at all, because
                  maybe it puts him/her to sleep.  but to say that, therefore, chanting
                  is not a good tool for anyone in this world is also not an accurate
                  statement, because maybe it may attract someone to leave a prior
                  decadent life to be interested in chanting and perhaps starting living
                  a more wholesome life, which then leads to other spiritual practises as
                  well.  so i feel its just a matter of the right medicine for the
                  appropriate illness.  no one pill can cure all illnesses in this world.</p>
              <p>though we typically like to label everything in this world (in
                  this case, chanting) to be black and white, 1 and 0, good or bad, but
                  in reality, the world do not work that way and hence we end up
                  struggling and arguing to make sense of why things are not like the way
                  we say they are.  for me, i've learnt from buddhism to think more in
                  terms of grey shades rather than black and white, and hopefully
                  enabling me to be more open and accepting to all the diversity in this
                  world.</p>

              <p>i happen to have experience from both perspectives.  during my younger days of following my elders to temple for chanting, it actually puts me to sleep without fail because i didn't understand why/what i'm doing :-) </p>
              <p>more recently after having some stability in meditation practises for few years, i experimented by using chanting as an object of my meditation instead of the usual breath. interestingly, chanting as a meditational object serves the same purpose of bringing the mind to rest just like using the breath. </p>
              <p>so yes, chanting with a reasonably stable mindfulness  is a means leading to shamatha and certainly does not dull the mind.  but chanting with a dull mind is no doubt a good cure for imsomnia :-]</p>

              <p>It is always revealing something unless you are in deep sleep. In that state, awareness remains in a state of potential but temporarily not aware of objects. However, if someone wakes you up, awareness reflects immediately the world, again, without a moment's notice.</p>

              <p>But do you realised that your mind is now reconditioned to

                  things from a null standpoint and not from a biased standpoint.</p>

              <p>i understand where you're coming from.  my take on this is that in reality, it is impossible to consider or opine about anything from a null or purely unbiased standpoint because we are conditioned since birth to lean towards a certain "bias-ness" depending on our upbringing and environment, whatever that may be.  an opinion is itself a conditioned and biased response.  believing in spiritual practise is a conditioned bias.  disbelief in spiritual practise is also a conditioned bias.  i don't think there is such thing as a totally unconditioned, unbiased standpoint.</p>
              <p>because we live in a relative world, without one thing compared against the other, without any "bias-ness", there would be no relative meaning, nothing to discuss or talk about.  no long stick without comparing to a short stick, no left side without comparing to right side.  so in a strange way, by saying "my truth", i'm also taking into consideration "your false", vice versa.  one has no meaning without the other.  there is no standalone "truth" existing by itself in a relative world like the way we usually tend to believe.  interesting point for me to contemplate indeed...</p>
              <p>but back in the relative world of my own opinions and views about budhism, it is certainly not blind acceptance.  its more like a science experiment.  i read the texts, think and analyse about it, and in the end check if it is consistent with my direct experience.</p>
              <p>as a rough example, it is like telling a caveman that there is this thing called the Internet today.  while it may be very real and absolutely the truth for us modern ppl, this is not so for the caveman.  the right conditions has not manifested for the caveman to enable him/her to experience the Internet in direct experience.  so from a subjective experience per se, both are equally valid experiences, and you can't say one is true while the other is false.</p>
