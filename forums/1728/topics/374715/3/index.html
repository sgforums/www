              <p>We are now venturing into an area known as epistemiology. It is a mouthful.

              <p>  However quite a few eastern religion had a different view. One story that hindus like to use is the story of 2 persons living in the jungle. One is blind and deaf but could walk about. The other could see and hear but was dumb and a paraplegic and barely could move but slightly.  The person could see know that the blind man is around but the blind and deaf man doesn't know that the other person was around. The blind and deaf tended to make a lot of noise, scolding, and shouting most of the time to reassured itself that it is alive.</p>
              <p>  One day there was a forest fire and the one with sight and hearing called out to the one who was blind and deaf. No matter how he gesticulated the blind and deaf could not respond. </p>
              <p>Both eventually died and reborned in samsara.</p>
              <p>Our rationale, our thinking faculty, our logic and reasoning are the blind and deaf man. It tended to be noisy and self assured of its "reality".  While the intuitive self really know what is around us but could not speak and is often very silent.</p>
              <p>While our heart, the intuitive and insightful part of our being "knows" it seldom expresses itself. Our logic and reasons, while blind, are often very assertive.</p>
              <p>Do you know why it is well known by scientists that "science is blind" ? </p>
              <p>I understand that harvard business school is now encouraging meditation as they had found from their research that top business leaders could make very good and profound decision because they often have very good insight and invariably these are the ones that meditated.</p>
              <p>Insights and intuition is a whole new field of experience and investigation and to reject it would be basically thinking with half a brain.  Why not give it a go. You have nothing to lose except your delusions.</p>

              <p>I really don't know where to begin.  "In the multitude of words
              there is delusion" said a wise person.  Let then clarify some key
              points rather than to go through point by point. </p>
              <p>_Direct Perception_</p>
              <p>   "Thusness reply to djhampa :</p>
              <p>As Thusness wrote to djhampa last time:</p>
              <p> <em>Hi djhampa,</em></p>
              <p><strong><em>Diect experience does not imply consciousness being
                                      detached from whatever arises. Experiences are "direct" because the
                                      common misunderstanding of an agent that can be attached or
                                      detached from whatever arises is thoroughly seen through; thefore
                                      nothing to divide to begin with, thus, direct.  That is why it
                                      is an "insight" and it is this arising of anatta insight that leads
                                      a practitioner to direct seeing.  Even the complete cessation
                                      of thoughts or perceptions do not make experience direct without
                                      the arising of this anatta insight.</em></strong></p>
              <p>--------------------</p>
              <p>  I believe that was a misrepresentation of what djhampa said or understand.</p>
              <p>  The false self as represented in the skandhic model could be
              lumped under "mental factor" which consisted of feelings, perceptions
              and mental formation. The sense of false self and all that emanates
              from it and also how we see and interpret the world arise essentially
              from the "mental factor".   The detachment of the consciousness skandha
              from contact and mental factors does not imply cessation of thoughts or
              perceptions.  Looking at the model as derived from MN109 there are
              still two arrows (the red and green-to the left) that flows into
              vinnana.   The red arrows allow us to watch our feelings(pleasant,
              unpleasant and neutral), perception and mental formation with
              detachment without having to engage all that arises - our delusions.</p>
              <p>   The green arrow demonstrated an ability of Buddhas and arahants
              of directly knowing - beyond words, concepts and ideas - what went on
              in the environment. This often come complete and not linearised as it
              would be required of any conceptual interpretation.</p>
              <p>   Insights can only arise when there is little or no engagement with our mental factors.</p>
              <p>   So thusness was wrong in believing that detachment implies
              separation.  However detachment does imply the dissolution of false
              self where the sense of separation exist.</p>
              <p>   Notice also the arrow indicated by Bgh A ?   That arrow had 6
              elements. Which of these we wish to detach from Phassa is within the
              practitioner's ability when he had comfortably withdrawn from the
              world.  Again withdrawal from the world does not imply a cut off from
              the world but a highly developed sensitivity to the world , a merging
              with reality. This is again indicated by both the red and green arrow.</p>
              <p>  Becareful of canned phraseology that often doesn't mean much nor have any value.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>_Your diagram_</p>
              <p>  The diagram you presented has one vital element missing. The very
              element that allowed for a neurotic attachment to cravings. Our
              cravings are part of the mental factors which actually fed back onto
              phassa or contact. This give rise to feelings etc. It is this obsession
              with pleasantries that is the basis of cravings.  Cravings cannot be
              stopped but we can develop our ability to detach from our conscious
              engagement with phassa.   I had often use a tree for this example. 
              When the image of a tree came into our eye, we could choose not to
              engage with it. No thoughts, feelings, idea or associated ideas etc.
              will develop when we successfully disengaged from the sense input.</p>
              <p>_Notional no-self_</p>
              <p>  You like to use the phrase seeing without seer, hearing without
              hearer etc. Do you really understand what this meant or imply ?  Where
              does this "seeing" and "hearing" happening when false self is dissolved
              ?   Is our physical eye and ear involved ?</p>
              <p>_Vipassana as Buddha taught it__</p>
              <p>   A naughty grin just went across my face ;-) </p>
              <p>   This was what you wrote :</p>
              <p>I was just writing yesterday at another forum, that Vipassana
                                      <em>is not a form of dissociative witnessing (though some might
                                      practice this way, but I'm talking about the way the Buddha taught
                                      it) such that by observing impermanent sensations one then lets go
                                      of the 'not selves' and discovers a true self as an eternal
                                      observer.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>       Was this what was taught in satipathana sutta ?   If not all
              these are really a sophisticated means of wrapping - pardon my words -
              cow dung ;-) and it just smelt as bad.  Oh no I am not been
              confrontational but do you really believe or understood or even know
              what it entailed in some of the things you wrote ?</p>
              <p>    Satipathana sutta (or please don't dump a whole load of other
              material on 4 foundation of mindfullness) is a masterpiece work by
              Buddha.  Few hundred years after this was published very few people
              really knew how to practice insight meditation and as a result many
              started adding a lot of "other stuff".  In the beginning many monks in
              thailand went crazy and when it got to sri lanka it was modified.  The
              system of practice we have today either from sri lanka, myanmar or
              thailand is nothing like what Buddha talked about in satipathana
              sutta.  We have to also understand that satipathana sutta is NOT a
              manual for practice. It is couched in words that pointed at the
              practice and not the practice itself.  It is like a teaser.  We are
              presented with glimpses of what to expect and if you haven't reach a
              particular stage such glimpses will escape you. </p>
              <p>What does "body in body" meant ?  To you it meant that there is no
              observer.  Again where is this observer to begin with ?  You may then
              reply no where, like what a lot of zen master taught or used but this
              sense of self or being an observer must arise from somewhere. We know
              that this sense of self is false but where does it arise within our
              being ? </p>
              <p>  To understand what Buddha meant by body in body, feelings in
              feelings etc. When we sit in a particular posture we know that we are
              sitting and as soon as it becomes uncomfortable we feel pain. Before
              long we started thinking why don't I shift or perhaps you would tell
              yourself that my teacher taught me to grit my teeth and bear with it -
              the pain is only our delusions etc.  When enough thoughts on the pain
              had arised a kind of sadness, silliness or anger arise.  Now what I
              have just described are the things that went on within our mental
              factor. One stage became the cause and condition for the next stage to
              arise. </p>
              <p>    If we have a pleasant or unpleasant feelings and there is no
              associated thoughts or interpretation etc. then these feelings are then
              within feelings.  If we tell ourselves "now that is delicious" then the
              feeling is in perception.  The literal "stopping" of the flow can only
              come about if we stop engaging with what flowed into our consciousness.
              In this case mostly from the red arrow.  Similarly for body posture.
              Most of the postures recommended by Buddha in the body mindfulness such
              as standing, walking, sleeping and sitting will "trigger" neutral
              feelings and it would be good practice for us to "know" body in body.
              It is a good and healthy way to condition and train the consciousness.</p>
              <p>   We could similarly use eye or hearing (very difficult) in this
              practice. We will "know" that "eye in eye" . Eye being the eye
              sensation.</p>
              <p>   So what has false self got to do with all these ?   Nothing and that's what we want to train and conditioned our mind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>  I think this is getting very long-lah... I will talk about subject-object dichotomy maybe in a day or two.</p>

              <p>To Sgforumposter, first I apologies for unable put my thoughts or questions into context, as I has am poor with texting. It like learning photography, remember one thing forget the next. </p>
              <p>Now to my question proper, I hope you heard about sleep paralysis. One suddenly "awakes" in his sleeps finds himself unable to move. In this dream state, he is "aware" of himself in his surrounding where he has sleep. Thus restrained he goes in a panic state. Now I has managed to wake up by concentrating on breathing, and forcefully breathing myself awake.</p>
              <p>Now the crux of the matter is that when from  the moment we are born, we start breathing. And as we breathe our last breath, we die. Our breath is sole clinging to this very existence and assuming we have the lucidity to realise we are no longer breathing. Where do you put focus conciousness?!!</p>
              <p>We can eludcidate for all we want, but can you  lower your knowledge to the mundane where ordinary people like me  living a day a time can benefit?</p>
              <p>I am what I am, if you can relate to my experience, hopefully, even manage to teach someone like me to effectively apply your wisdom on a day to day basis. If it pleases you you can call me full of shit or load of crap so that I am be able to learn from you, please do so!   </p>

The other could see and hear but was dumb and a paraplegic and barely could move but slightly.  The person could see know that the blind man is around but the blind and deaf man doesn't know that the other person was around. The blind and deaf tended to make a lot of noise, scolding, and shouting most of the time to reassured itself that it is alive.</p>
              <p>  One day there was a forest fire and the one with sight and hearing called out to the one who was blind and deaf. No matter how he gesticulated the blind and deaf could not respond. </p>
              <p>Both eventually died and reborned in samsara.</p>
              <p>Our rationale, our thinking faculty, our logic and reasoning are the blind and deaf man. It tended to be noisy and self assured of its "reality".  While the intuitive self really know what is around us but could not speak and is often very silent.</p>
              <p>While our heart, the intuitive and insightful part of our being "knows" it seldom expresses itself. Our logic and reasons, while blind, are often very assertive.</p>
              <p>Do you know why it is well known by scientists that "science is blind" ? </p>
              <p>I understand that harvard business school is now encouraging meditation as they had found from their research that top business leaders could make very good and profound decision because they often have very good insight and invariably these are the ones that meditated.</p>
              <p>Insights and intuition is a whole new field of experience and investigation and to reject it would be basically thinking with half a brain.  Why not give it a go. You have nothing to lose except your delusions.</p>

              <p>I hope nobody will bother wasting time and effort to reply to Herzog's insanity here. Please remember off topic posts will be removed, and keep posts practical, constructive and within the range of reason. I will be restricting pointless arguments. No point wasting time on people who are not interested in learning or practicing Buddhism and making bad karma by expressing all sorts of negativities about dharma.<br><br>-------------<br>To Sgforumposter:<br><br>Yes, pretty long (can't blame you for that because I also have that habit of writing long posts) and I also don't know where to begin. Anyway I am curious, do you have a particular inclination towards a particular tradition of Buddhism or are you a non-sectarian?</p>
              <p>As to your post: I am not disagreeing that when we practice bare attention, vipassana, we are not engaging with contents, mental perception or formations or volition -- just bare sensate reality. In fact I have reiterated this a few times in my previous posts. However not engaging in the contents and stories of thought, the 'me' story, does not mean we become disassociated with our senses -- instead we experience all sensations intensely with full clarity, without subject and object division. We sense bare sensations, which is all the manifestation of pure awareness without subject-object division, and not get involved with attachment to the contents of our thoughts.</p>
              <p>There is just pure seeing which is not other than scenery, pure hearing not other than sounds, and all these are the manifestation of awareness without a seer, hearer, observer. Is eyes and ears involved? Of course, without eyes and ears there cannot be the manifestation -- the manifestation are dependently originated along with causes and conditions in which eyes and ears are part of them. However neither the 'eyes' or the 'ears' are the 'hearer' or 'seer' -- they are just a condition for a non-dual manifestation without seer-seen division.</p>
              <p>Which also brings me to your question, where does the sense of self arise? In Buddhism the Buddha never taught anything about a locality, you'll never read a passage saying 'the Dharmas arise from where', nor an Ultimate Source where-in all dharmas are occuring, instead he only taught empty appearances that are dependently originated manifestations along with causes and conditions. And contrary to the usual misunderstanding, this is not really the exclusive teaching of Mahayana, Prajnaparamita, or Madhyamika teachings -- for example check out Phena Sutta in Pali Canon (<a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn22/sn22.095.than.html">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn22/sn22.095.than.html</a>). <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2008/01/ajahn-amaro-on-non-duality-and.html">Ajahn Amaro was also very clear</a> that apart from Anatta (No 'Who'), other aspects such as 'No Where' (non locality), 'No When', etc are also very important. All these are discussed in Stage Six of <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">Thusness/PasserBy's Seven Stages of Experience on Spiritual Enlightenment</a></p>
              <p>An analogy: when we look at a red flower, that redness appears to be truly 'out there' existing in an outer location with inherent existence. However a dog wouldn't agree, because to the dog he only sees a black flower, while other animals and realms can see something totally different in shape and colour. If you look with quantum eyesight you'll see mostly empty space, where's the form? So seeing this, all the apparent characteristics of the 'red' 'flower' is merely an illusion-like appearance that is dependently originated, there is no substance located 'out there' nor is there an inherent redness located 'in here' -- merely a dependently originated mirage.</p>
              <p>Similarly if you look at a thought, and observe where does it arise, where does thought arise, how does it arise, you will realise that though vividly appearing there is no substance or locality to thought -- it's nature is empty. Similarly the sense of self is just made of sensations (such as being bounded to a location within the head) and thoughts that dependently originate -- nothing inherent, nothing locatable, no 'where', no 'when', no 'who'. Empty yet vivid.</p>
              <p>When we realise emptiness, we will realise that all our notions of things being located 'out there', 'in here', or any where, is simply a manifestation of our deeply rooted views of inherent existence. It is the manifestation of our karmic propensities/conditioning that can only be de-constructed through insights into the two emptinesses (of self and phenomena).</p>
              <p>At an earlier phase like the I AMness you're experiencing now, Awareness is mistaken as an Ultimate Source that is like a vast container in which manifestation pops in and out of it, and the vast container-like Awareness remains unaffected, unchanged. Further insights are required to see that there is no Source/Manifestation dichotomy: All manifestations themselves are Source, and there is no other Source or Witnessing background to sink back to. There is no 'sense of self' or 'thoughts arising and subsiding within Awareness' because all thoughts, all phenomena themselves are none other than Awareness.</p>
              <p>The Buddha criticized the view of Awareness as metaphysical substratum and essence, and as Thanissaro Bhikkhu said in a commentary on this sutta <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.001.than.html">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.001.than.html</a>:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>Although at present we rarely think in the same terms as the Samkhya
                  philosophers, there has long been — and still is — a common tendency to
                  create a "Buddhist" metaphysics in which the experience of emptiness,
                  the Unconditioned, the Dharma-body, Buddha-nature, rigpa, etc., is said
                  to function as the ground of being from which the "All" — the entirety
                  of our sensory &amp; mental experience — is said to spring and to which
                  we return when we meditate. Some people think that these theories are
                  the inventions of scholars without any direct meditative experience,
                  but actually they have most often originated among meditators, who
                  label (or in the words of the discourse, "perceive") a particular
                  meditative experience as the ultimate goal, identify with it in a
                  subtle way (as when we are told that "we are the knowing"), and then
                  view that level of experience as the ground of being out of which all
                  other experience comes.</em></p>
              <p><em>Any teaching that follows these lines would be subject to the same
                  criticism that the Buddha directed against the monks who first heard
                  this discourse.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And anyway, interesting fact, as Rob Burbea (very enlightened teacher at Insight Meditation Society) said in the very good talk <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/07/realizing-nature-of-mind.html">Realizing the Nature of Mind</a>:</p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><em><span style="font-size: 100%;">One
                  time the Buddha to a group of monks and he basically told them not to
                  see Awareness as The Source of all things. So this sense of there being
                  a vast awareness and everything just appears out of that and disappears
                  back into it, beautiful as that is, he told them that’s actually not a
                  skillful way of viewing reality. And that is a very interesting sutta,
                  because it’s one of the only suttas where at the end it doesn’t say the
                  monks rejoiced in his words. </span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"><em><span style="font-size: 100%;">This
                  group of monks didn’t want to hear that. They were quite happy with
                  that level of insight, lovely as it was, and it said the monks did not
                  rejoice in the Buddha’s words. (laughter) And similarly, one runs into
                  this as a teacher, I have to say. This level is so attractive, it has
                  so much of the flavor of something ultimate, that often times people
                  are unbudgeable there. </span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"> </p>
              <p>Yes, I finally found the sutta he was talking about, it was the one above. And indeed at the end of the sutta it's stated <em>"That is what the Blessed One said. Displeased, the monks did not delight in the Blessed One's words."</em></p>
              <p>Thusness also warned about holding onto an ultimate source or ground of being at  <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/mistaken-reality-of-amness.html">Buddha Nature is NOT "I Am"</a></p>
              <p>I would also appreciate if you point out what I said that you thought was in disagreement with Satipatthana Sutta. Perhaps you were misreading me. I was simply saying Satipatthana Sutta never taught anything about a true self as an eternal observer.</p>
              <p>However, I do have a problem with your term 'false self'.</p>
              <p>As I and Thusness was telling djhampa (or you, since your writing style and paragraphing is so similar to djhampa) -- there is no false and true self. There is just five skandhas including the mental factors which you are talking about, but nothing about false self vs true self.<br><br>The Buddha in its exclusive Anatta teaching only found in Buddhism was adamant in teaching that there is no self substance within nor apart from the five skandhas (check out the Anatta Doctrine section in <a href="http://www.kktanhp.com/Theravada%20Buddhism.htm">http://www.kktanhp.com/Theravada%20Buddhism.htm</a>). There is no false self vs true self, what he meant is that there is simply the five skandhas -- and everything including mental perceptions and volition are simply the mental factors and components of the five skandhas, it is not a 'false self' in contrast with a 'true self'. All the five skandhas are anatta, not self, but there is also no existing self beyond the skandhas. No inherent self at all.</p>
              <p>Also some Hindu non-dual traditions, especially Kashmir Shaivism but also some of the Advaita teachers were pretty clear that Brahman and the world are not separated much like the screen and the contents are one/unified, nevertheless they are still reifying the mirror-like awareness into a permanent substance (i.e. the screen), an ultimate Subject that is one with all objects. Even though non-duality of subject and object is experienced, this is still not the same as Anatta because of the reification of Consciousness as an ontological essence. So be careful of reifying any substance even though subject-object are unified. Stage 4 is the phase where we can't sync our dualistic view with direct experience. This is the difference between Thusness Stage 4 and Thuness Stage 5 in <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">Thusness/PasserBy's Seven Stages of Experience on Spiritual Enlightenment<br></a></p>
              <p>In the Pali suttas, Buddha never talk about non-duality of subject and object, but it is already a 'given', it is implied. There is no subject and object are one sort of teaching -- when there is absolutely No Subject, there is no unification of Subject with Objects either. In the suttas there is never was there a split of subject and object<strong></strong> from the beginning, there is always anatta and phenomena self-liberates because it dependently 
                                                                                  orginates. The phenomena itself is the mirror (awareness), there is no ultimate mirror which is 'one' with contents.<br><br>If however you are talking from a Mahayana true self/buddha-nature point of view, then to prevent falling into the extremes of eternalism (which is the Hindu view that there is a transcendental eternal substance or atman-Brahman apart from the impermanent five skandhas), the Mahayana teachings and teachers state clearly that Impermanence is Buddha-Nature (Zen Master Dogen, Zen Patriarch Hui-Neng).<br><br>This does not mean Buddha-Nature is impermanent in the sense that it has a beginning and end -- it is eternal, but it is not a permanent eternal but a changing eternality -- which means it is a flow and continuum that never ceases like river flowing ceaselessly. Being like the flow of water it is lacking in any substantial permanent essence. There is no inherent self. And as Mahayogi Shridhar S.J.B. Rana Rinpoche says:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><br><a href="http://www.byomakusuma.org/Ved%C3%A0ntavis%C3%A0visShentong/tabid/87/Default.aspx">Vedànta vis-à-vis Shentong</a><br><br>The Buddha said that he taught something that had been lost for a long time. But the Vedas and the Vedic Bràhmaõa-s of the Buddha’s time, whom the Buddha met, had been and are still teaching the existence of true âtmà, and ‘eternal non-dual cognition’ as the Ultimate Reality.<br><br>If we glance through the Jain literature, we again find that no Jain scholar mentions that the Buddhists believed in an eternal / permanent non-dual cognition as the ultimate reality. At least, those Jain scholars after Asanga should have done so, if that was how the Uttara Tantra had been interpreted in India.<br><br>If we analyze both the Hindu Sankaràcàrya’s and the Buddhist Sàntarakùita’s refutation, we find that both agree with the view of the Hindu Advaita Vedànta, which is that the ultimate reality (âtmà) is an unchanging, eternal non-dual cognition and that the Buddhists as a whole do not agree that the ultimate reality is an eternal, unchanging non-dual cognition, but rather an changing eternal non-dual cognition. These statements found in the 6th century Hindu and the 9th century Buddhist (both were after the Uttara Tantra and Asanga), show that the ultimate reality as an unchanging, eternal non-dual cognition is a Hindu view and is non-existent amongst the Buddhists of India. Not only was such a view non-existent amongst Buddhists of India, but also it was refuted as a wrong view by scholars like Sàntarakùita. He even writes that if and when Buddhists use the word ‘eternal’ (nitya), it means ‘pariõàmi nitya’, i.e., changing eternal, and not the Hindu kind of eternal, which always remains unchanged.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><br>Also sutras such as Shurangama Sutra is also very clear that the Five Skandhas are all Buddha-Nature, there is no distinction between the 'false self of skandhas' vs an eternal unchanging 'true self'. This is the meaning of non-duality.</p>
              <p>If your view is that Buddha-Nature is a permanent background substance in which thoughts and phenomena arise from and subside to, then unfortunately this is the eternalist Hindu view (and the view of other monist contemplative traditions) and not the Buddha's insight. In Buddhism we teach Anatta and Dependent Origination, not an Ultimate God that is the source of all cosmic beings and worlds. There is no denying of Awareness, but we must not experience duality, we have to experience non-dual awareness. And even though if we experiece non-dual awareness, we must not fall into the subtle wrong views (like a universal cosmic consciousness) -- so keep the experience, but refine the views, as Thusness, Rob Burbea, and other teachers have said.</p>

              <p>  I think he provided a good and important perspective. We seldom could see our delusions and worst yet think that our deluded understanding is correct. His "cookie wisdom" post can be thought of as refreshing in that it challenges our understanding. Remember that Buddha recommended that we continually test the gold. </p>
              <p>_____ This lead me to my next point and i.e. "knowing".______</p>
              <p>    Vipassana as it is taught now claimed that knowing is only possible if we engage our perception. This basically meant that when we are lifting our leg, in walking meditation, we consciously tell ourselves "lifting,lifting,forward,forward, down,down".  We often forget that "knowing" is actually a function of our consciousness and not our perception. Without our consciousness skandha there will be no knowing from all sensate input.</p>
              <p>      The mundane existence basically consisted of just consciousness and content of thoughts and this is our reality and therein also lies our "truth".  We will fight tooth and nail and today we have a few nuclear missles as well, to defend these "truths".</p>
              <p>      Herzog is no different.  The challenge is to understand and then know for ourselves that reality exist beyond the content of thoughts. The content of our thoughts are merely the map of the terrain and this is not the terrain itself.  The terrain is beyond our actual perception (content of thought). </p>
              <p>_____This lead me to "subject-object dichotomy". ________</p>
              <p>     Our false self lies within the mental factor (MN109). It is there that our sense of worth and value is validated and affirmed on a daily basis. Psychologists argued that a healthy sense of self is needed for us to be sane but it is precisely that that will make us insane because this "healthy sense of self" needed constant validation. Is it any wonder that ALL of us unless you are an arahant or Buddha constantly go out to seek affirmation and validation from others ?   When that is no longer available like when a powerful leader retires, researches had shown that such a person literally went bonkers and they would try all manner of ways to distract themselves.  The sense of loneliness experienced by the elderlies all over the world is a result of this supposedly "healthy sense of self."</p>
              <p>       When I talk to "eternal now" or Herzog I am actually not talking to "eternal now"  or Herzog. I am actually talking to an impression I have of "eternal now" and Herzog in my mind.  This impression is the "object" that we hold in our mind and we always thought that this "object" is really the person out there.  All the petty hatred and deluded silliness is directed at this "object" in our head.  This object exist in our head because of the false self, the subject we beheld in our head. This subject or the impression that we have of ourselves is the basis of how we see and engage with the world. Basically, we are talking to ourselves all the time ;-)</p>
              <p>    For most of us this subject and objects are frozen in space and time once it enters our mindstream. When we hated someone we continue to hate someone until one day we realised the silliness and stupidity of such an exercise.  The subject or false self for all intents and purposes are gelled after our teenage years. As we go through life many objects continue to fill up our map in our head. Instead of growing in understanding and wisdom we grew more and more bitter and prejudicial. At every turn of our life the subject, our false self, has to be validated or else it would be rejected.</p>
              <p>    When we start to have the capacity of not engaging with our delusions or the contents of our thoughts (Bhn A in the picture I posted) the "energy" that feeds our delusions through our engagement is now become a lot less. </p>
              <p>    Stream entry is achieved when the emotive aspect, the mental formation skandha is very weak.  One good practice to achieve this is to just "watch" your thoughts without engaging it.  The moment you engage it  you will feed the delusion and these delusions have a "life" of its own.  Buddha recommended some practice on this. For example contemplating on the goodness of Buddha. If you are not overcome by gratitude etc. it meant that the "perception" had self-liberated. And this is "perception in perception" and it went no where - lah 8-) </p>

                                          perception or formations or volition -- just bare sensate reality.
                                          In fact I have reiterated this a few times in my previous posts.
                                          However not engaging in the contents and stories of thought, the
                                          'me' story, does not mean we become disassociated with our senses
                                          -- instead we experience all sensations intensely with full
                                          clarity, without subject and object division. We sense bare
                                          sensations, which is all the manifestation of pure awareness
                                          without subject-object division, and not get involved with
                                          attachment to the contents of our thoughts.</p>
              <br></blockquote>
              <p>It is not the disassocation from the senses but from the sense objects.  Sense objects(the objects that flowed from phassa - contact - into mental factors)  are a product of sense input(the actual object out there) and contact with our consciousness. It is the nutriments for the arising of sense objects.</p>
              <p>object --&gt;   sense organ --&gt;  phassa(contact) ----&gt;  Sense object ---&gt; Mental factors</p>
              <p>--&gt;consciousness------------------------^     ^------------------------------------------------------ |</p>
              <p>     ^-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>   This is based on MN109.  Notice also how mental factors flowed back into phassa and consciousness.</p>
              <p>    Vipassana is to help us weakened the consciousness engagement with phassa. The flowing back from mental factors into consciousness is our meta-cognition and this ability of our consciousness has to be cultivated. It is our ability to stand back.It is also the ability that gave us insights into our false self.  The liberating insight of false self came through this path.</p>
              <p>     The direct flowing from object into our consciousness is where our insights of the universe arises.  This is where insights of the universe arise from - the insight of the emptiness of reality.</p>

                                                  consciousness as you put it. The ‘noting’ however can be a very useful tool, and 
                                                  is emphasized in the Myanmar style Vipassana of the Mahasi Sayadaw tradition.

                                      seer. Sound hears, no hearer. As Guru Padmasambhava said: only a naked
                                      manifest awareness without an observer. There is a good article on the
                                      topic of true self and no self by Daniel Ingram, called <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2008/08/no-self-vs-true-self.html"><span style="color: #0000ff;">No-Self vs. True Self</span></a>. However if by ‘false self’ you

                                                  non-dual awareness.</strong> Because we are so habituated to subject-object experiencing, 
                                                  when we experience Awareness, the Awareness becomes experienced as a separate 
                                                  disassociated Subject/Observer/Witness. In fact it is always the case at the 
                                                  beginning to experience awareness as observer. One who have glimpses of this 
                                                  awareness may have the sense of awareness as being the passive Eternal Watcher 
                                                  which remains unmoved and indifferent while things just pass by. This is not the

                                                  dualistically, as an inner witness ‘In Here’ while objects arise and pass away 
                                                  externally. At this phase the practitioner will want to practice ‘standing back’ 
                                                  to disassociate from everything and enter the state of mere witnessing. There is

                                                  further insights into consciousness will reveal that what consciousness is is 
                                                  not a detached witness, but rather it is a manifestation that dependently 
                                                  originates. Not engaging/getting lost in the contents of thoughts does not mean 
                                                  standing back as a detached Witness of thoughts. It simply means experiencing 
                                                  sensate reality as it is without subject/object perception and thinking. Even if 
                                                  thoughts arise we simply observe or experience them as the energy, the 
                                                  manifestation of Awareness – not as an observer observing it. Actually sensate 
                                                  reality is already non-dual by nature, and is spontaneously manifesting 
                                                  according to conditions. All sensations, thoughts, manifestations, have the 
                                                  quality of knowingness – it is pervaded by the clear luminous cognisant nature, 
                                                  and is not other than it. That knowingness is not external to those

                                      of all, any form of disassociation is illusory since it presupposes an
                                      ultimate Subject (Witness/Observer/etc) that could disassociate from
                                      'objects' seen as external to himself. There is no such subject-object
                                      dichotomy. In Buddhism, all sense consciousness are Not the agent that observes external
                                      objects -- rather consciousness IS itself a
                                      manifestation of cognizance inseparable from the conditions which
                                      support that manifestation, which I will explain below. The view that
                                      consciousness is a Witness that is experiencing an objective universe
                                      is false, since in Buddhism consciousness IS the experiential reality
                                      of the so called objective universe (which isn't really objective) --
                                      the 'universe' is in fact consciousness itself. And the entire manifest
                                      display of the universe is dependently originated. As such consciousness cannot disassociate from objects, because consciousness is not a subject and the universe not an object -- there is just the phenomenal universe which is itself awareness.<br></span></p>

                      is not our consciousness of the world; instead, Awareness is the
                      phenomenal world. This seems to be counterintuitive because of the way
                      we presume awareness operates. We see it as being like seeing, or
                      hearing, or any of our other senses, somehow mirrored by the organs
                      within our bodies. We take it to be a kind of sensing or percipiency.
                      Thus some thing must be aware, sensing the world, like a brain which
                      somehow ‘sees’ what the eyes see and ‘hears’ what the ears hear. It is
                      easier to place this 'something' in the physical body – even if we
                      cannot locate it with any assurance, explain how it works, or why it
                      arises – than it is to say that Awareness is the existence of the
                      world. Deriving the world from Awareness is much harder for us to
                      contemplate. Some try to get free of the idea of consciousness being
                      locked-up in our heads by erroneously proposing that the universe
                      itself is aware. Others reduce awareness to some phantom-like add-on to
                      our neurological processes. As you will discover reading through this
                      book, Awareness is not sensing, it is doing. It is this activity of
                      Awareness that we call "being" that gives rise to consciousness of
                      ourselves and the phenomenal world.</em></p>

                                                  essence empty and dependently originated, ungraspable. And hence, realising 
                                                  there is no separate ‘self’ to detach (or attach) from those pleasures or 
                                                  displeasures, those feelings are simply left as they are to arise and subside on 
                                                  their own accord without leaving traces like the flight path of a bird or the 
                                                  drawing of pictures on a pond. In other words: they self-liberates. A watcher 
                                                  standing back watching thought arise and pass is not the self-liberation that 
                                                  Dzogchen masters are talking about. In observing thoughts and sensations as it is, there 
                                                  is no observer and observed divisions, just clear awareness expressing as all 
                                                  manifestations. There is no clinging, but also no detached Witness.<br></span></p>

                                                  would like to go deeper into a point I made earlier, “what consciousness is is not a 
                                                  detached witness, but rather it is a manifestation that dependently originates” 
                                                  – this is a very special and unique teaching to be found in Buddhism only. All 
                                                  other traditions talk about Consciousness as a kind of metaphysical essence, as 
                                                  an all powerful God like entity that is the unchanging source of everything. 
                                                  Though Buddhism does not deny the presence of clear vivid consciousness, we do 
                                                  not hold the view of a universal Consciousness or Source (only individual 
                                                  mindstream/consciousness/source). That means, we do not deny that precious 
                                                  experience of the pure presence, being, awareness, that Witnessing (not Witness) 
                                                  that is non-dual without subject/object division. However we do not reify such 
                                                  experience into an all-powerful ontological essence or Being or God/Brahman, 
                                                  some sort of unchanging inherent existence/essence.</span></p>

                                                  suttas, Buddha reprimanded the monk Sati who thought of Consciousness as the 
                                                  watcher and experiencer of things and as some kind of inherent essence that 
                                                  moves from one body to another (the atman, soul view) – and instead taught that 
                                                  Consciousness is simply manifestation of cognizance that dependently originates,

                                                  Aggregates I posted earlier. Consciousness as defined by Buddha is not an entity 
                                                  that feels and experiences but is simply the manifestation of

                                                  clear and vivid. It happens naturally due to conditions – and you have no choice 
                                                  about it! If you don’t like garbage smells, but when the wind blows you have no 
                                                  choice but to smell that, because that is what the conditions are there at the 
                                                  moment to give rise to a particular manifestation of unpleasant smell. Awareness 
                                                  is happening effortlessly and choicelessly as all these 
                                                  sensations/manifestations due to dependent origination and it has nothing to do 
                                                  with an inherent self or an observer. We cannot separate Awareness apart from 
                                                  those dependently originated (empty) manifestations, hence we see that there is 
                                                  nothing substantial and inherent about consciousness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">However
                                      we will not be able to truly realise and experience the full
                                      significance of dependent origination until we have deep realisation of
                                      non-duality and Anatta. Why? Because it is impossible to realise the
                                      dependent origination of consciousness unless we are able to transcend
                                      the view of Consciousness as a detached Witness, or an Inherent Self,
                                      some kind of ontological essence. In other words we will not be able to
                                      see dependent origination until we are able to overcome the bond of
                                      duality/separation, and the bond of inherency (e.g. viewing
                                      consciousness as an inherent self). There is nothing ontological about
                                      consciousness -- it is dependently originated. However to realise the
                                      D.O. fully we have to go step by step as Thusness told me many times:
                                      First is the experience of I AMness or the Witness, then we realise
                                      that the Witness is really a non-dual Witnessing not divided into
                                      subject and object, then we realise that this non-dual reality is in
                                      fact Anatta, empty of a self, nothing ontological -- only
                                      manifestations, process, events. No universal Brahman or a mirror that
                                      is unified with its contents. Then finally we can realise the dependent
                                      origination and empty nature of consciousness, and that is the Stage 6 out of Thusness's 7 stages.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span lang="EN-SG">Nothing
                                      is denied about our luminous aware nature -- only an ever deepening
                                      refinement of insights about the nature of awareness. So again, first have direct experience of the dissolution of subject-object duality into non-dual awareness first, then keep        the experience, but refine the view.</span></p>

              no dharmas (phenomenon) can. It’s also called the King of Great Freedom
              Tathagata, the Incomprehensible, the Holy Essence, the Immortality, the
              Great Immortal. Its names vary but its essence is one. Sages vary, but
              none are separate from his own mind. The mind’s capacity is limitless,
              and its conditional functions are inexhaustible. With the condition of
              eyes, forms are seen, With the condition of ears, sounds are heard,

              It is important to know that mind is itself liberation. That is why
              knowing the nature of our mind is the way of liberation. If Liberation
              is not experienced, then the clarity is still not there. There is no
              true understanding of what mind is.<br><br>Liberation is this Pristine
              Awareness itself in its natural state. That is why understanding this
              Pristine Awareness is the direct path towards liberation. If we cannot
              see that the 5 aggregates are themselves our Buddha Nature, then we
              will not understand there is nothing to shunt from the transience.
              Thought liberates, sound liberates, tastes liberates. The transience
              liberates. If we do not see that, then we are taking a gradual path. It
              is also not advisable to speak too much about spontaneous arising or
              self liberation. It can be quite misleading.<br><br>----------------<br><br>åº”çœ¼è§�è‰²ï¼Œåº”è€³é—»å£°ï¼Œåº”é¼»å—…é¦™ï¼Œåº”èˆŒçŸ¥å‘³ï¼Œä¹ƒè‡³æ–½ä¸ºè¿�åŠ¨ï¼Œçš†æ˜¯è‡ªå¿ƒã€‚<br><br>A better way to translate should be:<br><br>With

              are all one's Mind.<br><br>Thusness/Passerby's comments:<br><br>Here
              there are 2 important points to take note. First is that Buddha Nature
              is the transience. Second it is more of 'åº”'. Means with the condition
              of the eye, forms arise. With ears, sound arises.<br><br>Awareness is
              not like a mirror reflecting but rather a manifestation. Luminosity is
              an arising luminous manifestation rather than a mirror reflecting. The
              center here is being replaced with Dependent Origination, the
              experience however is non-dual.<br><br>One must learn how to see
              Appearances as Awareness and all others as conditions. Example, sound
              is awareness. The person, the stick, the bell, hitting, air, ears...are
              conditions. One should learn to see in this way. All problems arise
              because we cannot experience Awareness this way.<br><br>Conventionally
              we experience in the form of subject and object interaction taking
              place in a space-time continuum. This is just an assumption.
              Experientially it is not so. One should learn to experience awareness
              as the manifestation. There is no subject, there is only and always
              manifestation, all else are conditions of arising. All these are just
              provisional explanations for one to understand.<br><br>Further comments:<br><br>What's
              seen is Awareness. What's heard is Awareness. All experiences are
              non-dual in nature. However this non-dual luminosity cannot be
              understood apart from the ‘causes and conditions’ of arising. Therefore
              do not see ‘yin’ as Awareness interacting with external conditions. If
              you see it as so, then it still falls in the category of
              mirror-reflecting. Rather see it as an instantaneous manifestation
              where nothing excluded. As if the universe is giving its very best for
              this moment to arise. A moment is complete and non-dual. Vividly
              manifest and thoroughly gone leaving no traces.<br><br><br>Other comments:<br><br>Phrase
              like “everything arises from Emptiness and subsides back to Emptiness”
              is equally misleading. By doing so, we have made ‘Emptiness’ into a
              metaphysical essence; similarly not to make the same mistake for
              “causes and conditions”, not to objectify it into a metaphysical
              essence. All are provision terms to point to our insubstantial,
              essence-less and interdependent nature.</div>

              <p>    I asked a simple question of where DO YOU THINK the sense of FALSE SELF ARISE from and you cited works after works, comments after comments about anatta and where it did not arise from. And then venture into emptiness of how wrong some phrases were and so on and so forth.</p>
              <p>    My question is very simple. Within the skandhic model WHERE does your sense of FALSE SELF arise from ?  Remember it is the SENSE of FALSE SELF I am talking about.</p>
              <p>    Your position is that the FALSE SELF do not exist only the skandha. But again where does your SENSE of SELF (FALSE) came from ?  I am not splitting hair. You seem fixated with the idea that just because thusness said that false self do not exist and you argued with voluminous articles on the non-existence of FALSE SELF.</p>
              <p>   Btw. you can never prove the non-existence of anything. </p>

              <p>The sense of self lies in perception and volition. The sense of self is just a sense of self... not a false self vs true self. Those mental factors arise without an observer or thinker and are anatta. There is no separate observer of mental factors that is the 'true self'.</p>

              <p>Our sensate reality (not the mental perception of it) which includes sights, sounds, thoughts, and so on are the reality itself. They are the Buddha-Nature itself.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>There is no other reality than the sensate reality. I wonder if you have read what I have posted above including the Buddha's teachings on consciousness. If you think that reality is a detached witness or some sort of inherent essence then that is still under the illusion of subject/object duality and the illusion of inherency. There is no such divisions or inherency to consciousness. Awareness is a manifestation.</p></div>
