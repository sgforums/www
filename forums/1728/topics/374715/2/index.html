              <p>But rituals, I imply something I do on a regular basis. For example, I  do prostrations everyday. This was the first hardest for me even though I was reading up on Buddhism for 20 to to 30 years. it was hard to let go of my pride and ego. Only after notion  "surrendering myself" was overcomed, it was then I took the Three Refuges. It is a daily reminder to be humble and mindful, not to be too full of myself.  Offering of food, incense is also a cultivation of generosity. The Sadhanas and the recitations, though difficult initially, helped stilled my agitation. Over the years, suppressed events with strong emotional arose, and is still arising. I am now still emptying and manage recognise my indulgence or clinging.Mindfulness did not come in one day.However,applying made me a more effective person.</p>
              <p>Buddhist "rituals" are full of symbolism, they are there to remind us and to be mindful.  What are considered consider "rituals" are really methods to the initiated. I hope tht I am not offended anybodys' sensibilities(too muc! heh! heh!) I  hope!  </p>

              <p>Chanting alone is shamatha. It does not dull the mind, it just
              focuses and calms the mind. However after gaining strength through
              chanting we can practice awareness. Being aware of the process of
              chanting itself, not on the words or meaning but on reality
              itself.</p>

              <p>With awareness, chanting will not dull the mind and this can also be proven in the lab.</p>
              <p>So, which came first ?</p>
              <p>Being aware is a choiceless state where there is no engagement between the consciousness of the person and his environment and hence no impose or projected images and ideas. Even if words and meaning arises there is still awareness.  The separation between words,meaning and reality is not awareness.</p>

              <p>Personally, I just do meditation, not much on chanting. But
              chanting can be helpful for some. However insight meditation can be
              practiced at any single moment. Why? Because reality is available
              whatever you are experiencing or doing. Whether chanting, sitting,
              or washing dishes. When we are practicing mindfulness, then nothing
              is mechanical, everything is alive, fresh. This has to be
              experienced.</p>

              <p>So vulgarity is based on some social mores and standard or as one fellow said conventionally vulgar (gosh! the play on words).  If all these are conventionally established than according to the "teachings" in buddhism wouldn't this be false ?  If it is false then why get upset ? Isn't it because you are trying to live up to some conditioned conventional and false reality or to put it in another way to live up to your delusions ?</p>
              <p>Btw. I am not defending Herzong_zwei. Just hoping that you could see a bit of your own delusions - we seldom could do that on our own ;-)</p>

              <p> </p>
              Concentration is to concentrate on a single unmoving point,
              through solidifying an experience or state, and this leads to
              jhana. Awareness is awareness of the flow of sensations.</blockquote>
              <p>   Don't you know that there is also a thing call "moving concentration" ? It is called the access state of the mind.  For those with very active mind moving concentration meditation chould lead to access state much faster than jhana and we all know that with access state insights will arise. Now that's what visuddhimagga said but then again what do I know ;-) .</p>

              <p>Let me begin by giving an account of the use of chanting. Btw. I am not against chanting. Herzog_Zwei's objection was unfounded as his knowledge, view and understanding was imcomplete. He is like a blindman who proclaimed to the world that he has seen the light when he found or thought he had found the door knob.</p>
              <p>Some years ago I had a conversation with a person who practiced the namo amituofo chanting. I asked her whether she would chant at night just before she sleeps. She said "oh no, Buddha forbid !!! that would be rude. When you chant you are actually inviting these holy beings to your presence."</p>
              <p>I am thinking that the best time to actually chant namo amituofo is actually when we start to fall asleep.  We must remember that when we are dying our physical energy is very weak and if our mind energy is still very strong all manner of delusions will arise and this is exactly what happened when we start to fall asleep.  The mahayanist, particularly the tibetan buddhists, know that dying is actually same/similar to falling asleep. Wouldn't this be the best time to condition our mind for the final cross over ? I don't know I never have a teacher ;-)  this is why my understanding is so "flawed."</p>
              <p>Thusness use of "synchronicity" as an effect of chanting was actually based on a study of sound/music's effect on the brain. Such syncrhonicity or whole brain can take place when it is presented with pink or white noise that has no rhythmic pattern. The physical brain has the tendency to try to find pattern and order and after a while when the physical brain failed to find any pattern it shuts down and both sides of the brain start to pulsate together. You can plug a headphone into the tv stereo and tune it to an empty channel (without the blue screen) and you should be able to get enlightened ;-)  .</p>
              <p>There are also studies that showed certain sounds frequencies and coloured light could actually affect certain energy centers in the body. The study was initially done on acupuncture points.  In tantra - where many of the teachings of mahayana teachings originated - different sound frequences and intonation can affect different part of the body/mind/spirit.  These sound patterns have a powerful effect on our energy system if done correctly and intone correctly.  It can even heal or unlock stucked energy flow.  That is the power of mantras.</p>
              <p>If our purpose is to gain calm abiding through the use of sound then chanting would be less effective.  If it is use with visualisation and chanting to effect certain changes within our energy system than mantras is a great way to fly ;-)  .</p>
              <p>If it is use to help us keep presence of mind under distressful situation then such chanting has great emotive appeal and value.</p>
              <p>There, a deluded, teacherless take on chanting !!!</p>

              <p>  What were these "illogical weakness" ?  Would you care to list some of these out ?  The dependent origination as flawed and do not conform to "natural laws" was a very limited and misunderstood of what Buddha taught.  What you had said did not invalidate what Buddha taught but merely revealed your ignorance.  I had replied to your point.

              <p>It quiets and stills the mind, it does not dull the mind.

              <p>I can't see how chanting can lead to dullness unless one allows the mind to wander off the chanting (which is to chant in mouth only without the presence of mind) or chant without mindfulness or awareness. In other words, practicing chanting in the wrong way.</p>

              <p>There is a difference between the contents of thoughts and reality itself, the thought itself, the sensation itself. When we practice something like Vipassana/insight meditation, we do not engage with the contents, just vivid clarity of all sensations (including thoughts), and this is awareness -- observing naked reality as it is not through a layer of concepts, but bare attention.</p>
              <p>Reality includes thought, but when we are practicing something like Vipassana, we are sensing reality and not the concepts, as I have previously pasted an article distinguishing concepts and ultimate reality. We can use concepts as a tool, but it must not be mistaken as reality, and also we should not get lost in it (worrying about past present future, daydreaming, etc) An example of mistaking thought as reality: "I used to experience Awareness, and now I have lost it" and this thought then leads to frustration, sense of loss due to a sense of self, while reality is more like Awareness is experiencing the thought including the thought of 'having lost awareness', and the notion a separate experiencer, an "I" is merely a thought and not reality. Of course this is just an example, there are other countless examples in which we experience suffering due to the notion of a separate self, taken to be real. In reality the "I" thought is just a story, it has no reality, no substance. The story has no actuality, the 'I' cannot actually be found in real-time sensate reality, it is just a story, a concept! -- in actuality there is simply arising sensations and the activity of thinking which are all the manifestations of Awareness, and there is no separate self or experiencer that can be found within or apart from these manifestations. So when we practice Vipassana we disregard the content aspect of the thought, the story of 'me', or whatever imagined story or concept -- and just observe the thought for what it is, an arising and subsiding thought as part of the ongoing sensate reality.</p>
              <p>However, when we engage and get lost in thinking about the content of the thought, we are not seeing the thought in itself, we are not being mindful or aware of the activity of thought in itself (we are thinking about something, imagining, fabricating and conjuring up images and concepts about things instead of being aware of what is actually present here and now, i.e. the thought and all sensations as it is) --</p>
              <p>As Zen teacher Barry Magid says,</p>
              <p><em>Our usual way of thinking is to think about something - we sit and think about something out there that our thoughts are descibing or imagining. This kind of thinking is characterized by its descriptive content - what it's about. But what if instead of focusing on the content of thought, we see thought as an activity on its own right?</em></p><p><em><br>As something that we, or our body, does? Our foot itches, our knee hurts, our head thinks. It is just this perspective that labeling our thoughts come about. When we repeat the thought "thinking about 'the cat on the mat,'" our attention is no longer on the cat but on ourselves having a thought, engaging in the activity of thinking. Often in Zen literature we find the words not-doing used to refer to a not-separate mode of cuntioning. No thinker having a thought. Just the activity of thinking.</em></p><p> </p><p>And Bhante Gunaratana states:</p><p> </p><p><em><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">If you are

Ingram states:</p><p><em>Another reason that students often fail to make progress is that they confuse content and insight. I suspect that they are confused because they have spent their whole lives thinking about content, learning about content, and dealing with content in a context where content matters, i.e. when one is not doing insight practice. You can’t take a spelling test in first grade and say that all that is important is that words come and go, don’t satisfy and aren’t you. This just won’t fly and wouldn’t be appropriate. Just so, when practicing morality, the first and most fundamental training in spirituality, content is everything, or at least as far as training in morality can take you. You can’t be a mass murderer and rationalize this by thinking, “Well, they were all impermanent, unsatisfactory and empty, so why not kill ’em?” This just won’t fly either, and so content and spirituality get quite connected. This is good to a point: see the chapter called Right Thought and The Aegean Stables.</em></p><p><em><br>Fixation on content even works well when practicing the second training, training in concentration. When meditation students are learning to concentrate, they are told to concentrate on specific things, like the breath, a Green Tara (a tantric “deity”), or some other such thing. This is content. There is no such thing as the breath or a Green Tara from the point of view of insight practices, as these are just fresh streams of impermanent and absolutely transitory sensations that are crudely labeled “breath” or “Green Tara.” But for the purpose of developing the second training, concentration, this is ignored and these impermanent sensations are crudely labeled “breath” or “Green Tara.” Thus, even for pure concentration practice, what you are concentrating on, i.e. content, matters. Thus, the idea that content is everything is reinforced.</em></p><p><em>However, when it comes to insight practice, content will get you nowhere fast. In insight practice, everything the student has learned about being lost in the names of things and thoughts about them, i.e. content, will be completely useless and an impediment. Here the inquiry must turn to impermanence, suffering and no-self. These characteristics must be understood clearly and directly in whatever sensations arise, be they beautiful, ugly, helpful, not helpful, skillful, not skillful, holy, profane, dull, or otherwise. Anything other than this is just not insight practice, never was and never will be.</em></p><p><em><br>It doesn’t matter what the quality of your mind is, or what the sensations of your body are, if you directly understand the momentary sensations that make these up to be impermanent, unsatisfactory and not self, then you are on the right path, the path of liberating insight. However, as mentioned before, off the cushion the quality of your mind, your reactions, your words and deeds all matter. These are not in conflict. Insight practice is about ultimate reality, the ultimate nature of reality, and thus the specifics don’t matter. Morality and concentration are about relative reality, and thus the specifics are everything. Learning to be a master of both the ultimate and the relative is what this is all about.</em></p><p>Chanmyay SayÄ�daw states:</p><p><em><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">However

Hence this is also important. That is, what is described above is the way to apply the insight of Anatta when dealing with contents, instead of phenomena. I should also note that many people see this as a practice, however what Thusness is talking about is really about applying the anatta and dependent origination insight and experience to flow to the content level itself. So far, I and Thusness have not come across any writings that talk about this aspect.</p><p>I have not experienced this myself, and for the moment Thusness told me there is no need to focus on this yet, just practice non-dual (with bare sensate reality) and dropping first, then give rise to insight.</p><table border="0" cellspacing="0">

              <p>I also know you do not know what I am talking about. Reality, is always present, and available. There is absolutely no state that we cannot practice insight meditation. Even if we enter into shamatha jhanas, we can practice awareness and vipassana within that shamatha jhana. Awareness/reality is always available at all circumstances.</p>
              <p>Concentration is the focusing of mind on a single point to the exclusion of other things. In practices such as anapanasati, there are two ways to do it: either shamatha, or vipassana. In shamatha we simply focus on the concept, the content, the breathing in and out, or the visualized mental image, and fix our mind on that specific content alone. This leads to shamatha absorptions and jhanas but not insight.</p>
              <p>However, if we concentrate on the breathing sensations, and sense the qualities of the breathing sensation, the contact with the air, the coldness, warmness, softness, hardness, etc, that is Vipassana because we are observing reality itself, not our concept of it. While observing reality itself we then observe its three characteristics (impermanence, suffering, not-self) and this is the practice of Vipassana. This is the practice of mindfulness, not concentration. There is some element of attention or concentration involved here when practicing anapanasati, that is we focus awareness on the breathing sensations, or there can be a more wide open, less focused way of practicing vipassana or naked awareness -- i.e. choiceless awareness practice. However meditation with support (e.g. the breathe) is useful and easier in the beginning, though at certain phase there will be a preference for awareness without a particular object. It's all fine, it's all the different ways of experiencing awareness.</p>

              <p>It is fine to use thoughts, however in my experience I naturally avoid things without the need to contemplate. I simply walk without the need to think "left, right, left, front" -- it is totally natural and effortless. In actuality there isn't a 'doer' -- things simply emerge spontaneously. When one experiences or realises this, wisdom emerges spontaneously and not through a lengthy process of thinking, but as an immediate response to circumstances. If thoughts arise, it arises without a thinker, and if action arises, it arises without an actor. In any case as I stated -- we can use concepts, but not to mistake it as reality, and also we should not get lost in it (worrying about past present future, daydreaming, etc). Simple.</p>

              <p>Yes. Some amount of moving concentration is needed in Vipassana. Like the breathing sensations are moving, but there is momentary concentration on every arising sensations, which does not solidify anything into something fixed (that would be shamatha). Unless you are practicing in a choiceless, relaxing into wide open awareness, then the type of concentration or focus is a bit different. There isn't the sense of effort or attempt to fixate on anything, rather one rests in wide open and spacious presence that reflects everything spontaneously. I am not very familiar with Visudhimagga terms.</p>

              Just a note: I have updated my previous post.<br><blockquote>
              <p>I am thinking that the best time to actually chant namo amituofo
                      is actually when we start to fall asleep.  We must remember
                      that when we are dying our physical energy is very weak and if our
                      mind energy is still very strong all manner of delusions will arise
                      and this is exactly what happened when we start to fall
                      asleep.  The mahayanist, particularly the tibetan buddhists,
                      know that dying is actually same/similar to falling asleep.
                      Wouldn't this be the best time to condition our mind for the final
                      cross over ? I don't know I never have a teacher ;-)  this is
                      why my understanding is so "flawed."</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>This is ignorance. Obviously that person does not know that when a dedicated practitioner reaches a certain stage, the momentum he creates will allow him to chant effortlessly throughout his day and continue into his night and dreams. The Buddhas and Bodhisattvas will be more than happy since this is a sign that his practice is successful.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Thusness use of "synchronicity" as an effect of chanting was
                      actually based on a study of sound/music's effect on the brain.
                      Such syncrhonicity or whole brain can take place when it is
                      presented with pink or white noise that has no rhythmic pattern.
                      The physical brain has the tendency to try to find pattern and
                      order and after a while when the physical brain failed to find any
                      pattern it shuts down and both sides of the brain start to pulsate
                      together. You can plug a headphone into the tv stereo and tune it
                      to an empty channel (without the blue screen) and you should be
                      able to get enlightened ;-)  .</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I've never heard about the study and don't think this is what Thusness is saying. In any case, any form of synchronicity that clears the mind simply serves a pre condition for effective vipassana or self-inquiry practice to discover one's nature. It by itself cannot cause awakening.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>There are also studies that showed certain sounds frequencies
                      and coloured light could actually affect certain energy centers in
                      the body. The study was initially done on acupuncture points. 
                      In tantra - where many of the teachings of mahayana teachings
                      originated - different sound frequences and intonation can affect
                      different part of the body/mind/spirit.  These sound patterns
                      have a powerful effect on our energy system if done correctly and
                      intone correctly.  It can even heal or unlock stucked energy
                      flow.  That is the power of mantras.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Interesting.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>If our purpose is to gain calm abiding through the use of sound
                      then chanting would be less effective.  If it is use with
                      visualisation and chanting to effect certain changes within our
                      energy system than mantras is a great way to fly ;-)  .</p>
              <p>If it is use to help us keep presence of mind under distressful
                      situation then such chanting has great emotive appeal and
                      value.</p>
              </blockquote>

              <p>Experience is a product of our senses which, according to Buddha included our mental sense. This basically meant that history, conditioning, memory, past experiences etc. all became part and parcel of this "experience".  Since all of us have different history, conditioning etc we will all have different experiences given the same set of sense(the 5 sense input - minus the mental sense) input.  Our experiences then became a product of our own projections.</p>
              <p>Having said this then what you cannot experience is far more important than what you could.  You may say how could I experience what I cannot experience. All our life all we do is to have one experience after another - non stop even when we sleep.  The key to go beyond your habitual experiencing of events and sensate input is to first reduce the sensate impact on your experiences.  There are ways to do this.  The traditional way is of course to meditate. A faster way would be to use sex(tantric practices) and literally drown out your sense input except one.</p>
              <p>   Another way due to modern technology is to use a sense-deprivation chamber.  This last method does bring with it some "dangers".  When our 5 senses are literally deprived of sense input it shuts down and for most of us we will just fall into a deep sleep.  But for some, those with greater awareness, the only sense object available would be the mental object.  What predominates in our waking life or even from some childhood or past-life imprint could now arise and manifest itself.  Our other sense consciousness now "detached" from the physical sense organ takes its input from the mental objects that arise from our mental imprinting of past experiences.  So what you see, hear, feel etc. all now could take on a scary proportion.</p>
              <p>This is also the same situation when we die.  How many of us are ready for death ?</p>
              <p>To prevent bad imprinting from arising one way is to anchor one of your consciousness to an energy center.  A good energy center to use is the third eye. Your sense consciousness now detached from the sense organ is now directed to a safe energy center.</p>

              <p>On the issue of dependant origination, I suggest contemplating on the Ten Suchness first,when applied to the mundane, you may be able to relate to collective human karmic influences on out environment. </p>
              <p>Meditation is akin to sense-deprivation chamber, except it is self induced. As the distraction of the physical  senses are removed, mental thoughts are magnified. The main difference is presence or absence of emotion. I realise when one is not mentally or physically tired, you tend to be able to maintain composure. If one is physically or mentally drained, emotions tend to run strong. From what I experienced are there awareness of grosser and subtler mental inprints. Grosser are easier to pick up.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I have a question regarding death, when one in a sleeping state,if there arises the sense of immobility, one could awaken to conciousness by focusing on breath, avoiding panic .However, how  does one remain composed when we could no longer breath ?!!</p>

              <p> I don't disagree with your analysis. Actually, perhaps my ignorance, I have never heard a Pure Land teacher teaching people that they cannot chant during sleep. Also, even if one does not practice purposely before sleep, as long as he keeps practicing in the day someday the momentum will become effortless and extend into sleep.</p>

              <p>No, Vipassana does not lead to sense deprivation. All senses are experienced in full clarity instead. You feel, see, sense everything fully. Without sensations there is no Vipassana, you cannot do Vipassana apart from observing sensations.</p>
              <p>Unless you are talking about the moment of cessation (such as fruition or nirodha samapatti), otherwise no, sense deprivation is the area of shamatha jhanas, or some other sort of absorption (not emphasized in Buddhism) where the knowing faculty is temporarily suspended.</p>
              <p>Teachers tell you what characteristics to observe, then of course if you do as said you will be able to experience for yourself. Therefore this has nothing to do with indoctrination, just simple practical instructions.</p>
              <p>For example the statement "our breathe is impermanent", that's an obvious statement, nobody would reject that. But that is only a very surface level of understanding, not penetrating to the true experience of the sensate reality.</p>
              <p>An example of experientially observing impermanence: experiencing the breathe, we see that it is made up of sensations arising and subsiding on its own accord, and you could see perhaps say 5-10 sensations per seconds. Just observing these sensations as precisely as possible, not missing anyone of them. Nobody can teach you this, you have to practice it yourself, like piano. They can only guide you but to gain the skills you have to learn and practice. And if you keep seeing sensations happening by itself you'll begin to see that the breathe is quite an impersonal (anatta) process, those sensations are just happening, arising on its own accord, without pertaining to a 'self', a controller, an observer.</p>

              breath will pose less problems later on.</p>
              <p>   In satipathana
              sutta the contemplation on things such as ugliness of the body etc. are
              to condition the mind and ready it for the actual insight meditation
              where "perception is seen in perception" and nowhere else - the
              beginning of disassociation of our consiousness.</p>
              <p>  Dependent origination will only be discerned upon the arising of liberating insight.</p>

              <p>Originally posted by the Great Pretender Weychin:</p>
              <p>Meditation is akin to sense-deprivation chamber, except it is
              self induced. As the distraction of the physical  senses are
              removed, mental thoughts are magnified. The main difference is
              presence or absence of emotion. I realise when one is not mentally
              or physically tired, you tend to be able to maintain composure. If
              one is physically or mentally drained, emotions tend to run strong.
              From what I experienced are there awareness of grosser and subtler
              mental inprints. Grosser are easier to pick up.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Emotions are found within the realm of "mental
              formation" skandha. This skandha is dependent on causes and conditions
              that arose from within the "perception" skandha. So it has little to do
              with your physical state. In fact when the physical state is weak
              chances of emotive response is a lot less.</p>
              <p>Mental tiredness is
              a different kettle of fish.  Mental tiredness arose from the excessive
              flow of energy within the "mental factors" (MN 109). This tiredness is
              a result of emotion and not the other way round.</p>
              <p>Once ananda
              was fraternising with a whole group of nuns. They were having a lot of
              fun together. Then came sour-puss maha-kasyapa who saw them having such
              a nice time.  Maha-kasyapa scolded ananda with very harsh words in
              front of all the nuns. Ananda was very embarassed and upset and so were
              the nuns. The nuns encouraged ananda to report maha-kasyapa's bad
              behaviour to Buddha. Ananda did so and asked Buddha why maha-kasyapa
              was so mean and hateful with him. </p>
              <p>The point I am making is
              this ;  was Maha-kasyapa acting out of emotion or was it a skillful
              means ?   Would you be able to distinguish one from the other ?  Ananda
              and all the nuns couldn't.</p>

              <p>You can't !</p>
              <p>Focusing onto 3rd eye is a practice by itself - mostly from tantra but had since be adopted and adapted by many people. It is a good object of meditation - the 3rd eye.</p>
              <p>In the teaching of anapanasati many buddhists were told to focus on the tip of the nose and "notice" the sensation. From the sensation one then know or think to oneself one is breathing in, breathing out, long breath in, long breath out etc.  A few problems as observed by a non-practisioner without any realisation ;-) :</p>
              <p>a.  When you focus at the tip of one's nose, in tantra we know that this will stimulate the muladhara and this will cause sexual feelings and even sexual dreams.  I was amused when I read of how many people at a 10-day vipassana course had such sexual thoughts and dreams. The teacher explained it as their bad karma (you know lah karma is the mother of all explanation).  But in truth they were stimulating their own sexual centers.</p>
              <p>    If the mind needed a place to anchor as a stabilising tool then the 3rd eye center could be used very effectively and one of the good result is a deep calm will arise as well.</p>
              <p>b.  In satipathana sutta and also the anapanasati sutta Buddha spoke of "when breathing in know that you are breathing in". I asked a thai monk once why does one need to have the sensation at the nose to "know" one is breathing in ?  He said that without sensation we will never know.  If it is just sensation only then the entire rib cage would provide a better basis for the sensation. Some zen master taught the use of one's tummy. Why no one, as far as I know, uses the "sensation" from the chess cavity to "know" we are breathing in or out I do not know. </p>
              <p>But the "knowing" is actually beyond bodily sensation.  If you could detached your consciousness form the bodily sensations a sense of calm and liberation will arise. Your breathing will be easy and natural and it would not feel like it was been controlled.  This is what you want to aim for. Even when the breathing had become shallow the "knowing" remain.</p>

              <p>Since you are more familiar with the dissociated state similar to that of the Eternal Witness it's hard for you to comprehend what I mean by non-dual at the moment.</p>
              <p>Still I have to corect some of the misconceptions here. First of all,</p>
              <p><img src="http://img30.imageshack.us/img30/4339/palisixsextetscircled.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Contact is the contact between sense faculty, sense object and sense consciousness which then serves as condition for feeling, perception and formation.</p>
              <p>This other diagram I posted above states contact is the condition for feelings (the pleasant, unpleasant and neutral sensations that occur when our internal sense organs come into contact with external sense objects and the associated consciousness) which is then the condition for craving.</p>
              <p>In either case, the point here is, contact is always occuring, and feelings will always occur. Note that it does not mean emotions.</p>
              <p>Regarding the relationship between <em>vedanÄ�</em> and "emotions," American-born <a title="Theravada" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theravada">Theravada</a> teacher Bhikkhu Bodhi has written:</p>
              <dl><dd>"The Pali word <em>vedanÄ�</em> does not signify emotion (which
                                                  appears to be a complex phenomenon involving a variety of concomitant
                                                  mental factors), but the bare <a title="Affect (psychology)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affect_%28psychology%29">affective</a> quality of an experience, which may be either pleasant, painful or neutral."<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedana#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup></dd></dl>
              <p>Similarly, <a title="University of Oxford" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford">Oxford</a>-trained <a title="Vajrayana" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vajrayana">Vajrayana</a> teacher Trungpa Rinpoche has written:</p>

                                                  the feeling we take so seriously as, for instance, when we say, 'He
                                                  hurt my feelings.' This kind of feeling that we take so seriously
                                                  belongs to the fourth and fifth <a title="Skandha" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skandha">skandhas</a> of <a class="mw-redirect" title="Sankhara" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankhara">concept</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" title="Vijnana" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vijnana">consciousness</a>."<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedana#cite_note-12"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup></dd></dl>
              <p>Craving for and attachment to feelings (vedanÄ�) leads to suffering; reciprocally, concentrated awareness and clear comprehension of feelings (vedanÄ�)<strong> to realise its nature (impermanence, suffering, no-self)</strong> can lead to Enlightenment and the extinction of the causes of suffering. Mindfulness of vedana is one of the four foundations of mindfulness.</p>
              <p>The point here is not to stop feelings or contact, but to stop craving, at the point I circled.</p>

              <p><strong>However this is not done through dissociation but  through insights.</strong> Insights into the non-dual, into the three seals, into dependent origination. When we experience bare sensations as it is without grasping, naturally there won't be perception and mental formation or volition.</p>
              <p>However it is not what you think. You are thinking in terms of dissociation, however, what is important is non-dual wisdom. No subject-object division. At this point in time, you are experiencing pure awareness but this pure awareness is experienced as the Subject, the Witness, that is apart from all objects.</p>

              <p>This means that 'direct' experience of everything as it is without colouration means, without colouration by our mental perception, and <strong>without the sense of subject-object split</strong>. When we realise and experience non-dually, craving or aversion can't arise, why? There is just bare sensation as it is, no sense of a 'me' seeking to get an object, no sense of a 'me' trying to chase away an object, or a 'me' trying to ignore an object.</p>
              <p>In seeing there is just scenery, no seer, in hearing just sounds, no hearer, direct experience - nothing in between, no separation, no mental perceptions. Full clarity as the senses themselves. This is what Buddha meant by observing the body in the body, observe the body in the body, observe the feelings in feelings, observe
                                                                                                      the mind in the mind. In other words not observe the mind as a separate
                                                                                                      watcher, but rather it is thought watching thought or the watcher is
                                                                                                      the thought. Not an ultimate observer observing sensations, but just sensations itself,
                                                                                                      transient, not-self, not-other-than-self (i.e. not an object opposed to
                                                                                                      an ultimate witness), and dissatisfactory.</p>
              <p>I was just writing yesterday at another forum, that Vipassana <em>is not a form of dissociative witnessing (though some might practice
                                                      this way, but I'm talking about the way the Buddha taught it) such that
                                                      by observing impermanent sensations one then lets go of the 'not
                                                      selves' and discovers a true self as an eternal observer.</em></p>
              <p>This is not the true understanding of Anatta and there is still the grasping onto an ultimate Knower.</p>
              <p>I am not sure if you're into Thai Buddhism, but misunderstanding and attachment to 'Poo Roo' itself can become an obstacle to non-dual insight at some point, it is the self's final stand as Ajahn Brahmavamso states (he also states that this is the Hindu sort of experience or understanding, yet many Buddhist practitioners even high monks have the same sort of misunderstandings), and thus fails to see that there is no knower apart from the known, that the knowing itself is anatta, dependently originated and there is simply a non-dual undivided knowing. Ajahn Maha Boowa has also warned about the very subtle attachment to Poo Roo as a knower (he called it after Ajahn Mun the 'Ultimate Danger') which he only overcame at a later phase to realize the non-dual nature.</p>
              <p>There is always this awareness or more accurately this (verb) awar-ing, witnessing... this is not to be denied. It is our luminous, cognizant nature. However it is the divided sense (between subject and object) that one has to get rid of. At an earlier phase it is usually mistaken as a dissociative Witness, but as we progress in practice (with the right views) we will realize that
                                                                                          there is in fact no separate observer, the observer cannot be separated
                                                                                          from the process of observation. As Padmasambhava said, <em><br>And when you look into yourself in this way nakedly (without any discursive thoughts),<br>Since there is only this pure observing, there will be found a lucid clarity without anyone being there who is the observer;<br>only a naked manifest awareness is present.<br>...<br>And with regard to this, the observer and the process of observing are not two different things.<br>When you look and observe, seeking the one who is looking and observing,<br>since you search for this observer and do not find him,<br>At that time your view is exhausted and overthrown.</em></p>
              <p>It may be very hard for me to explain because you are more familiar with the dissociative state or Eternal Witness. Maybe you may want to read the <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">Thusness/PasserBy's Seven Stages of Experience on Spiritual Enlightenment</a></p>

Ingram):<br><br><span id="textNode_20648116" class="threadText">Dear Mark,<br><br>Thanks for your descriptions and analysis. They are interesting and relevant.<br><br>I
              think of it this way, from a very high but still vipassana point of
              view, as you are framing this question in a vipassana context:<br><br>First, the breath is nice, but at that level of manifesting sensations, some other points of view are helpful:<br><br>Assume
              something really simple about sensations and awareness: they are
              exactly the same. In fact, make it more simple: there are sensations,
              and this includes all sensations that make up space, thought, image,
              body, anything you can imagine being mind, and all qualities that are
              experienced, meaning the sum total of the world.<br><br>In this very
              simple framework, rigpa is all sensations, but there can be this subtle
              attachment and lack of investigation when high terms are used that we
              want there to be this super-rigpa, this awareness that is other. You
              mention that you feel there is a larger awareness, an awareness that is
              not just there the limits of your senses. I would claim otherwise: that
              the whole sensate universe by definition can't arise without the
              quality of awareness by definition, and so some very subtle sensations
              are tricking you into thinking they are bigger than the rest of the
              sensate field and are actually the awareness that is aware of other
              sensations.<br><br>Awareness is simply manifestation. All sensations are simply present.<br><br>Thus,
              be wary of anything that wants to be a super-awareness, a rigpa that is
              larger than everything else, as it can't be, by definition. Investigate
              at the level of bare sensate experience just what arises and see that
              it can't possibly be different from awareness, as this is actually an
              extraneous concept and there are actually just sensations as the first
              and final basis of reality.</span><br><br>As you like the Tibetan stuff, and to quote Padmasambhava in the root text of the book The Light of Wisdom:<br><br><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">"The mind that observes is also devoid of an ego or self-entity.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">It is neither seen as something different from the aggregates</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Nor as identical with these five aggregates.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">If the first were true, there would exist some other substance.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">This is not the case, so were the second true,</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">That would contradict a permanent self, since the aggregates are impermanent.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Therefore, based on the five aggregates,</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The self is a mere imputation based on the power of the ego-clinging.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">As to that which imputes, the past thought has vanished and is nonexistent.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The future thought has not occurred, and the present thought does not withstand scrutiny."</span></blockquote>I
              really found this little block of tight philosophy helpful. It is also
              very vipassana at its core, but it is no surprise the wisdom traditions
              converge.<br><br>Thus, if you want to crack the nut, notice that everything is <a href="http://www.buddhistdoor.com/OldWeb/bdoor/archive/nutshell/teach11.htm">5 aggregates</a>,
              including everything you think is super-awareness, and be less
              concerned with what every little type of consciousness is than with
              just perceiving them directly and noticing the gaps that section off
              this from that, such as rigpa from thought stream, or awareness from
              sensations, as these are golden chains.</div>
