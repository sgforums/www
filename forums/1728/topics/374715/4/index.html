              <p>      Dhamma meant truth. So all are true ;-)</p>
              <p>      It is common  to use the word dhamma to describe any religious teaching in india. So those that were taught by Buddha is now called Buddha dharma. By the same token we can describe christ's teaching as christ dharma.</p>
              <p>      There is also this thing called dharma seal. This is basically the characteristics of buddha dharma that is authentic. Any teachings that do not conform to this dharma seal of emptiness(non-self) is not considered as authentic Buddha teaching.</p>
              <p>     For me dhamma is any teachings that can help us reduce our delusions. This basically mean any teaching that open up space in our hearts to be more accepting and more understanding.  Compassion can never arise from a heart that is filled with ideas and notions of kindness of right and wrong which resulted in judgement and notional compassion.  Notional compassion is one whereby we TELL OURSELVES in our mind that "THIS IS THE RIGHT AND KIND THING TO DO".  It is self-delusion.</p>
              <p>     So when we beat our brothers and sisters over the issue of vegetarianism and judging them harshly for their dietary preferences, that is not compassion. That is idiocy.  In whatever we do and think there must be proper understanding and clarity.</p>
              <p>An open heart allows for that to happen.</p>

              <p>Hello Sgforumposter!                                                                                                                         I read the posting with interest especially the one under: This leads to subject- object dichotomy. What you have expounded is of relevance to me. I do not enjoy much in formal schooling or read a lot of sutras, so indulge meby letting me put things in my own context.       Your first point of sense of value and worth is important. The mechanism reinforces the sense of "identity", it  determines the path of thought an d action. If you are a school clown, chances are you will act out the role of school clown to validate you existence. Or if you fashion yourself an intellect, you validate yourself through affirmation of people you consider of worthy of being your peers. Opposite may be true if are "validated" by someone beneath you class.                                                                                                              When referring to "Eternal" and "Herzog", objects of your mind, if what I termed point of referencing or keyholing. You attached you assessment through you impressions of them. Them you attach various degrees of emotional labelling or sensation in terms of neutral, positive, and negative. Neutral borders irrelevance, while dislike is easier and most commonly affirmed and reinforced.                                              I will continue in another posting so that I don't lose this one!                                             </p>

              <p>How frozen or entrenched one's perception of the object, depends on the amount of emotional labelling. it allow start of reference, arules of engagement, so to speak pertaining to that person or object. However, once there is a strong emotional labelling, it is usually self feeding when incorporated into our mind stream. This emotional aspect becomes part of your "mental map", You become addicted to sensation and subsist by transferring itself to another object once original object loses relevance!                                 This is the difficult part. One being "comfortable" to the emotive sensation, one actually clings to it! The first step, for me anyway, is realising the emotion is not neccessary an integral part of me!                                                                                                I will not refer to the stream entry part as at this point, I do not relate. However, your"watching" your thoughts without "engaging" deserves further contemplation. I would love to see you elaborate further. My point being the emotion sensation being "self"  perpetuating, watching without engaging may be counter productive! Personally, once I realise I am "indulging" is then I can isolate it as an problem.                                                 Are you able to put your" watching thought without engaging" into context or scenario form?</p>
              <p>Thank you in advance! </p>

              <p>  Now let's see if we can get somewhere with this.</p>
              <p>  So you acknowledge that the SENSE OF SELF exist in the PERCEPTION AND VOLITION (MENTAL FORMATION) skandha. </p>
              <p>   Does this SELF exist ?  If the SELF does not exist then the SENSE OF SELF must then necessary be FALSE.  Don't you agree ?</p>
              <p>   I had never talked about False vs True self. </p>
              <p>   If that is out of the way (hopefully) let us examine the next point.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>AEN wrote :</p>
              <p>Those mental factors arise without an observer or thinking and are

                                      'true self'.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>   Now that is certainly a mouthful. </p>
              <p>   In Buddha's teaching on thoughts and thinking ,  thinking is part of the mental factors.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>   Mental factors arise dependent on causes and conditions and do not depend on or caused by a PERMANENT SELF. That's emptiness of self. It was Buddha's way of helping practitioners to develop wisdom.</p>
              <p>  You and thusness had found yourself within a conceptual trap. Just because a subject and object do not truly exist, by a corollary assumption a separate observer do not exist. This is mere logical imputation and does not come from realisation.</p>
              <p>   You must understand and appreciate that whenever we need to express ourselves and to convey our realisations - if it is authentic - there is a need to use some form of conceptual framework. This conceptual framework is always FALSE and is a poor representation of what was realised. When a person started playing around with words and ideas within this conceptual framework it is not difficult to see the contradiction and quandary the person will find himself in.</p>
              <p>    Such notion of subject/object dissolution or the observer and observed are one etc. are not the actual realisation. There are mere words to convey just ONE aspect of the realisation.  At the moment where liberating insight arose trees will not be trees, stones will not be stones - like so many claimed to have realised.  The wholeness of the realisation is beyond words or ideas and how could trees be trees when there is no tree ? </p>
              <p>     The skandhic model is an excelleng model to guide and help us see and appreciate the various teachings of Buddha.  When I was travelling down the river from Mandalan to Bagan in Myanmar I meditated most of the time throughout the journey. It was a wondrous experience to travel along the vast expanse of the river.  Some where along the river I had an insight. An insight into the 4 noble truth and 5 skandha. At that time I had very little knowledge or understanding of Buddhism.  After the holiday I did some background reading and research and found that the insight was validated by what Buddha taught except for one aspect.  I mentioned this to two or 3 people and they thought I was crazy. One fellow even said that how could so many monks, highly accomplished monks could be wrong. I must be an arrogant fool to think I knew more than them.  I was silent for quite a few years now.</p>
              <p>    Then a few days back you posted a scripture, I can't remember the name now. It started with a P. And the final piece of the insight now have scriptural support.  It was the key to liberation.  I never had any doubt but to convince others I needed authority. And our believe in authority is so ingrained that we are often fooled by personalities and the stuff they write and yet in the kalama sutta and in other suttas the order of value are : </p>
              <p>   a.  experiences</p>
              <p>   b.  knowledge</p>
              <p>   c.  scripture.</p>
              <p>  Notice how far down scripture was according to Buddha sakyamuni.</p>
              <p>  And sensate reality is one of those clever phrases to mask the contradictions in all that you had written and talked about.  Sensate reality is an oxymoron. Does that mean that if anything that is not sense-based does not exist or if exist is not real ?</p>
              <p>  In the sutra you quoted(the one starting with P ;-)) what actually will be reborned ?  Read that part and you will have an idea of the part of the consciousness that transmigrate and it is that "observer" which is not permanent but dynamic and ever changing. That "observer" had stopped and had no need or desire in engaging with the world and just remain. If it wanted to it can reach out. Remember the Bhg A ?  Instead of connecting with his own 6 sense organ such a being could direct it within another person's 6 sense organ.  This is basically your mind reading.  This is not explained in any of the sutras ;-)  so you don't have to believe me.</p>
              <p>   To get an idea of what Buddha meant by a non-self and impermanence it would be instructive to read what Buddha said to ananda when they were walking along the river. Buddha saw a lot of soap bubbles forming and breaking apart. And this he equated with our mental self where he said doesn't really exist because it is not permanent but is always changing sometimes quickly and other times slowly.</p>
              <p>   Does an observer exist ?  No because this observer is always changing, moment to moment. Does being exist ? Yes. Does a permanent being exist ?  No. Why ? Because it is ever changing.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>I have corrected that mis-spelling much earlier on before you posted but I think you didn't see -- I meant that the sense of self arise without an observer and a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>thinker</strong></span>. I don't mean thinking. Thinking happens, thoughts arise, but without a thinker and observer. There is just the process of thoughts, perception, volition.</p>

              <p>This is not a conceptual theory. This is a direct experience. Since you have not experienced it it will not be easy to convince you. You just have to have faith that I, and countless others, have experienced it -- when you experienced it statements such as this will appear to be extremely obvious. You'll see that there is no seer, the scenery sees, the sound hears, there is no center of observation or an observer. This is not a theory at all, it is not a logical conclusion through analysis but the most direct experience in the world ever (and in fact is the ONLY way to directly experience anything) -- and you cannot argue with it, because it is a direct experience. This is the nature of consciousness. Only those who never experienced it will argue with it. In this case you're just like the friends who thought you're crazy when you told them your insights.</p>

              <p>     The skandhic model is an excelleng
                                      model to guide and help us see and appreciate the various teachings
                                      of Buddha.  When I was travelling down the river from Mandalan
                                      to Bagan in Myanmar I meditated most of the time throughout the
                                      journey. It was a wondrous experience to travel along the vast
                                      expanse of the river.  Some where along the river I had an
                                      insight. An insight into the 4 noble truth and 5 skandha. At that
                                      time I had very little knowledge or understanding of
                                      Buddhism.  After the holiday I did some background reading and
                                      research and found that the insight was validated by what Buddha
                                      taught except for one aspect.  I mentioned this to two or 3
                                      people and they thought I was crazy. One fellow even said that how
                                      could so many monks, highly accomplished monks could be wrong. I
                                      must be an arrogant fool to think I knew more than them.  I
                                      was silent for quite a few years now.</p>

                                      others I needed authority. And our believe in authority is so

              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>  In the sutra you quoted(the one starting with P ;-)) what

                                      an idea of the part of the consciousness that transmigrate and it
                                      is that "observer" which is not permanent but dynamic and ever
                                      changing. That "observer" had stopped and had no need or desire in
                                      engaging with the world and just remain. If it wanted to it can
                                      reach out. Remember the Bhg A ?  Instead of connecting with
                                      his own 6 sense organ such a being could direct it within another
                                      person's 6 sense organ.  This is basically your mind
                                      reading.  This is not explained in any of the sutras ;-)

              <p>The sutta which I believe you are refering to, Phagguna Sutta: To Phaggun, clearly states that there is no agent or self that is transmigrating.</p>
              <p>The question 'who feels?' or 'who transmigrates' is false since it implies a self or observer that transmigrates, whereas the Buddha said one should be asking 'with what condition does birth arise'? 'With what condition does feeling arise?'</p>

                                      Having rejected the question he would then inform the questioner of

                                      taught as the continuation of a process, and not as the passing on

                                      and impermanence it would be instructive to read what Buddha said
                                      to ananda when they were walking along the river. Buddha saw a lot
                                      of soap bubbles forming and breaking apart. And this he equated
                                      with our mental self where he said doesn't really exist because it
                                      is not permanent but is always changing sometimes quickly and other
                                      times slowly.</p>
              <p>   Does an observer exist ?  No because this
                                      observer is always changing, moment to moment. Does being exist ?
                                      Yes. Does a permanent being exist ?  No. Why ? Because it is
                                      ever changing.</p>

              <p>It may not be easy to convince you now. What is needed for you is to first experience non-duality. Then your understanding of observer will turn into one observation, dissolving the observer and observed dichotomy. From there, move on to Buddhism idea of action and karma.</p>
              <p>Like what Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh said:</p>
              <p>"</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial;"><strong>"..The
              most universal verb is the verb 'to be'': I am, you are, the mountain
              is, a river is. The verb 'to be' does not express the dynamic living
              state of the universe. To express that we must say 'become.' These two
              verbs can also be used as nouns: 'being", "becoming". But being what?
              Becoming what? 'Becoming' means 'evolving ceaselessly', and is as
              universal as the verb "to be." It is not possible to express the
              "being" of a phenomenon and its "becoming" as if the two were
              independent. In the case of wind, blowing is the being and the
              becoming...."</strong></p>
              <p style="font-family: arial;">"When
              we say I know the wind is blowing, we don't think that there is
              something blowing something else. "Wind' goes with 'blowing'. If there
              is no blowing, there is no wind. It is the same with knowing. Mind is
              the knower; the knower is mind. We are talking about knowing in
              relation to the wind. 'To know' is to know something. Knowing is
              inseparable from the wind. Wind and knowing are one. We can say,
              'Wind,' and that is enough. The presence of wind indicates the presence
              of knowing, and the presence of the action of blowing'."</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial;">"In
              any phenomena, whether psychological, physiological, or physical, there
              is dynamic movement, life. We can say that this movement, this life, is
              the universal manifestation, the most commonly recognized action of
              knowing. We must not regard 'knowing' as something from the outside
              which comes to breathe life into the universe. It is the life of the
              universe itself. The dance and the dancer are one."</p>

              <p style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Sunshine and Green Leaves</span><br><br>Beginning
              meditators usually think they must suppress all thoughts and feelings
              (often called "false mind") in order to create conditions favorable to
              concentration and understanding (called "true mind"). They use methods
              such as focusing their attention on an object or counting their
              breathes to try to block out thoughts and feelings. Concentrating on an
              object and counting the breath are excellent methods, but they should
              not be used for suppression or repression. We know that as soon as
              there is repression, there is rebellion -- repression entails
              rebellion. True mind and false mind are one. Denying one is denying the
              other. Suppressing one is suppressing the other. Our mind is our self.
              We cannot suppress it. We must treat it with respect, with gentleness,
              and absolutely without violence. Since we do not even know what our
              "self" is, how can we know if it is true or false, and whether or not
              what to suppress? The only thing we can do is to let the sunlight of
              awareness shine on our "self" and en-lighten it, so we can look at it
              directly.<br><br>Just as flowers and leaves are only part of a plant,
              and just as waves are only part of the ocean, perceptions, feelings,
              and thoughts are only part of the self. Blossoms and leaves are a
              natural manifestation of plants, and waves are a natural expression of
              oceans. It is useless to try to repress or stifle them. It is
              impossible. We can only observe them. Because they exist, we can find
              their source, which is exactly the same as our own.<br><br>The sun of
              awareness originates in the heart of the self. It enables the self to
              illuminate the self. It lights not only all thoughts and feelings
              present. It lights itself as well.<br><br>Let us return to the apple
              juice, quietly "resting." The river of our perceptions continue to
              flow, but now, in the sunlight of awareness, it flows peacefully, and
              we are serene. The relation between the river of perceptions and the
              sun of awareness is not the same as that of an actual river and the
              actual sun. Whether it is midnight or noon, whether the sun is absent
              or its penetrating rays are beaming down, the waters of the Mississippi
              River continue to flow, more or less the same. But when the sun of
              awareness shines on the river of our perceptions, the mind is
              transformed. Both river and sun are of the same nature.<br><br>Let us
              consider the relationship between the color of leaves and sunlight,
              which also have the same nature. At midnight, the starlight and
              moonlight reveal only the form of the trees and leaves. But if the sun
              were suddenly to shine, the green color of the leaves would immediately
              appear. The tender green of the leaves in April exists because the
              sunlight exists. One day, while sitting in a forest, mimicking the <span style="font-style: italic;">Prajna Paramita Heart Sutra</span>, I wrote:<br><br>Sunshine is green leaves<br>Green leaves are sunshine<br>Sunshine is not different from green leaves<br>Green leaves are not different from sunshine<br>The same is true of all forms and colors.<br><br>As
              soon as the sun of awareness shines, at that very moment a great change
              takes place. Meditators lets the sun of awareness rise easily, so we
              can see more clearly. When we meditate, we seem to have two selves. One
              is the flowing river of thoughts and feelings, and the other is the sun
              of awareness that shines on them. Which is our own self? Which is true?
              Which false? Which is good? Which bad? Please calm down, my friend. Lay
              down your sharp sword of conceptual thinking. Don't be in such a hurry
              to cut your "self" in two. Both are self. Neither is true. Neither is
              false. They are both true and both false.<br><br>We know that light and
              color are not separate phenomena. In the same way, the sun of self and
              the river of self are not different. Sit with me, let a smile form on
              your lips, let your sun shine, close your eyes, if need be, to see your
              self more clearly. Your sun of awareness is only part of your river of
              self, isn't it? It follows the same laws as all psychological
              phenomena: it arises and vanishes away. To examine something with a
              microscope, a scientist must shine light on the object being observed.
              To observe the self, you must shine light on it too, the light of
              awareness.<br><br>I just told you to put down your sword of
              conceptualization and not cut your self into sections. Actually, you
              couldn't, even if you wanted to. Do you think you can separate the
              sunshine from the green color of the leaves? You can no more separate
              the observing self from the self observed. When the sun of awareness
              shines, the nature of thoughts and feelings is transformed. It is one
              with the observing mind, but they remain different, like the green of
              the leaves and the sunshine. Don't rush from the concept of "two" to
              the concept of "one." This ever-present sun of awareness is at the same
              time its own object. When a lamp is turned on, the lamp itself is also
              brought to light. "I know that I know." "I am conscious of being
              conscious." When you think, "The sun of awareness has gone out in me,"
              at that moment it re-lights itself, faster than the speed of light.</p>

Awareness is not other than all manifestations. This is contrary to the Hindu notion that there is a detached Witness that transcends the waking, sleeping, and deep sleep state. In Buddhism there is no such transcendental self apart from skandhas.</p>

              <h1 style="margin-bottom: 2px;">Rupert Spira on The Provisional Acceptance of The Witness</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Question: "You comment that Awareness or consciousness is simply
              observing the various arisings...as though there are two things:  one
              called Awareness or consciousness and the other called arisings. Why
              would you posit such a dualistic notion in an effort to share the
              wisdom of non-dual experience?"</p>
              <p>Here is Rupert's answer, worth the time to completely digest.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">This is said to one who believes him or herself
              to be a person, located in and as the body, looking out at a world of
              objects that are considered to have an existence that is separate from
              and independent of their being known.<br> <br> The terms in which such a person expresses his or her question (that
              is, the belief in a separate entity, separate bodies, objects made of
              matter,  a world that has independent existence etc.) are granted
              provisional credibility in order that we may proceed from what, at
              least appears to this person, seem to be the facts of the current
              experience.<br> <br> In other words we start with the conventional formulation that ‘I,’
              inside the body, am looking out at an objective and independent world
              of objects. This is a position of dualism, that is, ‘I,’ the body (the
              subject) am experiencing the world, objects and others (the object).<br> <br> From here our attention is drawn to the fact that the body (sensations)
              and the mind (thoughts and images) are in fact experienced in exactly
              the same way as the world (perceptions). In other words, the body/mind
              is not the subject of experience and the world the object of
              experience, but rather the body/mind/world are all objects of
              experience.<br> <br> We then ask what it is that experiences the body/mind/world. What is it
              that is referred to as ‘I?’ It is obviously not the body/mind, because
              at this stage the body/mind has been seen to be the experienced rather
              than the experiencer.<br> <br> What then can we say about this perceiving ‘I?’ It cannot have any
              objective qualities because any such qualities would, by definition, be
              objects and therefore experienced. However, it is undeniably present
              and it is undeniable conscious or aware or knowing. For this reason ‘I’
              is sometimes referred to as Consciousness, Awareness or Knowing
              Presence. <br> <br> At this stage the Knowing Presence that I know myself to be (that is,
              that knows itself to be) is conceived of as being ‘nothing,’ ‘empty’ or
              ‘void’ because it has no objective qualities, and could be formulated
              by saying simply, ‘I am nothing.’ It is the position of the ‘witness.’<br> <br> This position is still a position of dualism in that there is still a
              subject (Knowing Presence) and an object (the body/mind/world). Yet it
              is one step closer to a truer formulation of an understanding of the
              true nature of experience than was the previous formulation in which
              separate entities were considered to be existent and real.<br> <br> If we explore this Knowing Presence that we know ourselves to be, we
              discover from direct experience that there is nothing in our experience
              to suggest that it is limited, located, personal, time or space-bound,
              caused by or dependent upon anything other than itself.<br> <br> Now we look again at the relationship between Knowing Presence and the
              objects of the body/mind/world: How close is the world to our knowing
              of it? How close is the world to ‘experiencing?’<br> <br> We find that there is no distance between them. They are, so to speak, ‘touching’ one another.<br> <br> Now we can go deeper. What is our experience of the border between
              them, the interface where they meet or touch? If there was such an
              interface, it would be a place where Consciousness ended and the object
              began. We find no such place.<br> <br> Therefore we can now reformulate our experience based upon our actual
              experience, not just theoretical thinking. We can say that objects do
              not just appear TO this Knowing Presence but WITHIN it.<br> <br> At this stage Knowing Presence is conceived (based on experience) more
              like a vast space in which all the objects of the body/mind/world are
              known and experienced to appear and disappear.<br> <br> However, it is still a position of dualism, a position in which this
              vast knowing space is the subject and the world is the object that
              appears within it.<br> <br> So we again go deeply into the experience of the apparent objects of
              the body/mind/world and see if we can find in them a substance that is
              other than the Presence that knows them or the space in which they
              appear. <br> <br> This is a very experiential exploration that involves an intimate
              exploration of sensations and perceptions and which is difficult to
              detail with the written word. It is an exploration in which we come to
              FEEL not just understand that the body/mind/world is made out of the
              substance that knows them.<br> <br> However, in this formulation there is still a reference to a
              body/mind/world, albeit one known by and simultaneously made out of
              Knowing Presence. It is a position in which the body/mind/world doesn’t
              just appear WITHIN Presence but AS Presence.<br> <br> But what is this body/mind/world that is appearing as Presence? We
              explore experience more deeply again and find that it is this very
              Presence itself that takes the shape of the body/mind/world.<br> <br> Knowing Presence takes the shape of thinking and appears as the mind.
              It takes the shape of sensing and appears as the body. It takes the
              shape of perceiving and appears as the world, but never for a moment
              does it actually become anything other than itself.<br> <br> At this stage we not only know but FEEL that Presence or Consciousness
              is all there is. It could be formulated as, ‘I, Consciousness, am
              everything.’ At the same time we recognise that this has in fact always
              been the case although it seemed not to be known previously.<br> <br> So we have moved from a position in which we thought and felt that ‘I’
              am something (a body/mind) to a position in which we recognised our
              true nature of Knowing and Being (Presence) and which we expressed as
              ‘I, Consciousness, am nothing.’ And we finally come to the
              feeling/understanding that I, Consciousness, am not just the witness,
              the knower or experiencer of all things, but am also simultaneously
              their substance. In other words, ‘I, Consciousness am everything.’ <br> <br> Even this is to say too much, for what is this ‘everything’ that is
              referred to? Language collapses here. Instead of saying ‘Consciousness
              is all,’ we should say just ‘Consciousness is.’ But then what is this
              Consciousness that is being framed....again it is to say too much.<br> <br> To summarize we move from ‘I am something’ to ‘I am nothing,’ from ‘I
              am nothing’ to ‘I am everything’ and from ‘I am everything to
               ‘I,I,I....’<br> <br> We fall silent here.<br> <br> <br> As we abide knowingly as this Knowing Presence we discover that it is
              not a void, an emptiness. Rather it is the fullness of Love. In other
              words, Love is the substance of all things. <br> <br> The movement in understanding from ‘I am something’ to ‘I am nothing’ could be called the Path of Wisdom or Discrimination.<br> <br> The movement in understanding from ‘I am nothing’ to ‘I am everything’ could be called the Path of Love.<br> <br> The abidance in/as this Love is simply to abide as the Self that we are
              and that we know ourselves to be. Love is known to be the substance of
              every appearance and to be solely present throughout all the apparent
              stages of its revelation. It is the origin, the substance and the goal
              of our enquiry.<br> </span></p>

              <p>I can't see 'The rest of what you wrote was proven wrong by this
                  very scripture.' -- As far as I can see, the sutta proves
                  everything I am saying: sensate reality is all there is, and there
                  is no separate observer -- rather as J Krishnamurti puts it,
                  observer IS the observed because the so called observer cannot be
                  found apart from the flow of five skandhas. Awareness is not other
                  than all manifestations. This is contrary to the Hindu notion that
                  there is a detached Witness that transcends the waking, sleeping,
                  and deep sleep state. In Buddhism there is no such transcendental
                  self apart from skandhas.</p>

              <p><em>Through the sustained practice that presupposes the meditation outlined in the sutta, the practitioner is radically oriented toward what the Buddha calls "one's proper range" (gocaro sako). This is the field within which, according to the Buddha, human life is properly lived. The proper range is the scope given by immediate experience. This point may seem obvious, but a central contention of Buddhism is that we are constantly wandering outside that range and into the improper, detrimental range of storytelling, fantasy, fabrication, personal narrative, and metaphysical conjecture. Throughout the canonical texts, the Buddha holds that to be careless toward, or inattentive to, immediate experience is to be as good as dead. Immediate experience is not only our proper range but, if we are honest about the manner in which our lives actually unfold moment to moment, our only range -- immediate experience is all that there is. The Buddha, in fact, used the term "the all" (sabba) to denote this range.</em></p>
              <p><em>"God" fits into the all in a manner no different from the sound of rain striking the roof, the scent of a flower wafting through the air, the sensation of skin touching cold metal, or the taste of salt on the tongue. In each case, a specific process unfolds: a phenoemnon arises out of the confluence of numerous conditions; it comes int contact with a sense faculty; a specific type of cognizance -- sight cognizance, sound cognizance, scent cognizance, taste cognizance, touch cognizance, or thought cognizance -- arises at the point of contact. "God," in this account, does indeed arise in the mind, but not as the entity posited by theistic traditions." God" arises as a thought, a concept, a notion, an idea, etc cetera, conditioned, like every other thought or idea, by cultural practices, linguistic usages, personal need, and so on. The Buddha calls such conditioned entities "fabrications" and notes that they exhibit in every instance the qualities of impermanence, non-substantiality and unreliability. The notion "God," like the sound of rain, arsies in accordance with the confluence of necessary conditions, persists as long as those conditions hold together, begins to dissappear as those dissolve, then dies away when those have ceased. What is left at the end? Well, what follows the final step of the elaborate staircase leading to the absent palace?</em></p>

              <h1 style="margin-bottom: 2px;">Rupert Spira on The Provisional Acceptance of The Witness</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Question: "You comment that Awareness or consciousness is simply observing the various arisings...as though there are two things:  one called Awareness or consciousness and the other called arisings. Why would you posit such a dualistic notion in an effort to share the wisdom of non-dual experience?"</p>
              <p>Here is Rupert's answer, worth the time to completely digest.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">This is said to one who believes him or herself to be a person, located in and as the body, looking out at a world of objects that are considered to have an existence that is separate from and independent of their being known.<br><br>The terms in which such a person expresses his or her question (that is, the belief in a separate entity, separate bodies, objects made of matter,  a world that has independent existence etc.) are granted provisional credibility in order that we may proceed from what, at least appears to this person, seem to be the facts of the current experience.<br><br>In other words we start with the conventional formulation that ‘I,’ inside the body, am looking out at an objective and independent world of objects. This is a position of dualism, that is, ‘I,’ the body (the subject) am experiencing the world, objects and others (the object).<br><br>From here our attention is drawn to the fact that the body (sensations) and the mind (thoughts and images) are in fact experienced in exactly the same way as the world (perceptions). In other words, the body/mind is not the subject of experience and the world the object of experience, but rather the body/mind/world are all objects of experience.<br><br>We then ask what it is that experiences the body/mind/world. What is it that is referred to as ‘I?’ It is obviously not the body/mind, because at this stage the body/mind has been seen to be the experienced rather than the experiencer.<br><br>What then can we say about this perceiving ‘I?’ It cannot have any objective qualities because any such qualities would, by definition, be objects and therefore experienced. However, it is undeniably present and it is undeniable conscious or aware or knowing. For this reason ‘I’ is sometimes referred to as Consciousness, Awareness or Knowing Presence.<br><br>At this stage the Knowing Presence that I know myself to be (that is, that knows itself to be) is conceived of as being ‘nothing,’ ‘empty’ or ‘void’ because it has no objective qualities, and could be formulated by saying simply, ‘I am nothing.’ It is the position of the ‘witness.’<br><br>This position is still a position of dualism in that there is still a subject (Knowing Presence) and an object (the body/mind/world). Yet it is one step closer to a truer formulation of an understanding of the true nature of experience than was the previous formulation in which separate entities were considered to be existent and real.<br><br>If we explore this Knowing Presence that we know ourselves to be, we discover from direct experience that there is nothing in our experience to suggest that it is limited, located, personal, time or space-bound, caused by or dependent upon anything other than itself.<br><br>Now we look again at the relationship between Knowing Presence and the objects of the body/mind/world: How close is the world to our knowing of it? How close is the world to ‘experiencing?’<br><br>We find that there is no distance between them. They are, so to speak, ‘touching’ one another.<br><br>Now we can go deeper. What is our experience of the border between them, the interface where they meet or touch? If there was such an interface, it would be a place where Consciousness ended and the object began. We find no such place.<br><br>Therefore we can now reformulate our experience based upon our actual experience, not just theoretical thinking. We can say that objects do not just appear TO this Knowing Presence but WITHIN it.<br><br>At this stage Knowing Presence is conceived (based on experience) more like a vast space in which all the objects of the body/mind/world are known and experienced to appear and disappear.<br><br>However, it is still a position of dualism, a position in which this vast knowing space is the subject and the world is the object that appears within it.<br><br>So we again go deeply into the experience of the apparent objects of the body/mind/world and see if we can find in them a substance that is other than the Presence that knows them or the space in which they appear.<br><br>This is a very experiential exploration that involves an intimate exploration of sensations and perceptions and which is difficult to detail with the written word. It is an exploration in which we come to FEEL not just understand that the body/mind/world is made out of the substance that knows them.<br><br>However, in this formulation there is still a reference to a body/mind/world, albeit one known by and simultaneously made out of Knowing Presence. It is a position in which the body/mind/world doesn’t just appear WITHIN Presence but AS Presence.<br><br>But what is this body/mind/world that is appearing as Presence? We explore experience more deeply again and find that it is this very Presence itself that takes the shape of the body/mind/world.<br><br>Knowing Presence takes the shape of thinking and appears as the mind. It takes the shape of sensing and appears as the body. It takes the shape of perceiving and appears as the world, but never for a moment does it actually become anything other than itself.<br><br>At this stage we not only know but FEEL that Presence or Consciousness is all there is. It could be formulated as, ‘I, Consciousness, am everything.’ At the same time we recognise that this has in fact always been the case although it seemed not to be known previously.<br><br>So we have moved from a position in which we thought and felt that ‘I’ am something (a body/mind) to a position in which we recognised our true nature of Knowing and Being (Presence) and which we expressed as ‘I, Consciousness, am nothing.’ And we finally come to the feeling/understanding that I, Consciousness, am not just the witness, the knower or experiencer of all things, but am also simultaneously their substance. In other words, ‘I, Consciousness am everything.’<br><br>Even this is to say too much, for what is this ‘everything’ that is referred to? Language collapses here. Instead of saying ‘Consciousness is all,’ we should say just ‘Consciousness is.’ But then what is this Consciousness that is being framed....again it is to say too much.<br><br>To summarize we move from ‘I am something’ to ‘I am nothing,’ from ‘I am nothing’ to ‘I am everything’ and from ‘I am everything to  ‘I,I,I....’<br><br>We fall silent here.<br><br><br>As we abide knowingly as this Knowing Presence we discover that it is not a void, an emptiness. Rather it is the fullness of Love. In other words, Love is the substance of all things.<br><br>The movement in understanding from ‘I am something’ to ‘I am nothing’ could be called the Path of Wisdom or Discrimination.<br><br>The movement in understanding from ‘I am nothing’ to ‘I am everything’ could be called the Path of Love.<br><br>The abidance in/as this Love is simply to abide as the Self that we are and that we know ourselves to be. Love is known to be the substance of every appearance and to be solely present throughout all the apparent stages of its revelation. It is the origin, the substance and the goal of our enquiry.<br></span></p>

              <p>AEN, you cited SN35.23 to support your contention that sensate reality is "ALL" as spoken of by Buddha in SN35.23. But SN35.23 does not support sensate reality but a delusive reality. The commentary note then cited MN49 which was an interesting conversation between Buddha and Brahman and Mara in the background trying to make Buddha looked like a fool. In MN 49 Buddha spoke of the "allness of ALL".  There were other sutras that spoke of the delusive "ALL" that you seem to believe was "ALL".  You and thusness are caught in a conceptual bind and the evidences you used doesn't even support your position if one bother to just read a bit of the sutras you had cited.</p>
              <p>I came in again to this forum to point out the above and also to point out the conversation in MN 49 that went to the heart of mara's agenda. Mara would support any delusion and the method he used are always devious. Mara never showed himself in the above conversation but spoke through one of the attendant of brahman. Imagine that brahman and all the attendant of brahman realm had achieved the formless state of meditation and yet could not see the evil hand and agenda of mara. </p>
              <p>Mara is a great manipulator in this sutra and also in another dzogchen sutra I read.  The warning in the dzogchen sutra and a zen sutra was to reduce or even remove yourself from active engagement with the world when one has gained illumination even at the stream entry level. </p>
              <p>Becareful of those who offer you "sadhu,sadhu,sadhu".  Not everyone is what they seemed.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I respond to your criticism under Rupert Spiru on Provisional acceptance of the Witness;  when one wishes to approach an issue or problem, one can conceptualise in order to have a better handle on the subject.                                                                                               "self" cannot to separated from the collective of the senses. Simply put, self arises or derives from the collection of the sensations. It is a process, treat a person  as a business, with the senses as partners and workers in a company. The management (self)is created to act in the interest. How sophiscated the management is, depend how complex or convoluted it is, depends on the needs of collective senses, the manager(self), the outside world. If you were a monk, your main occupation is practice, and as outside influences gradually diminishes, you have only yourself to contend with.Were you a layman, like me, the day you wake up, you start dealing with your world.                                                               We use to reach a conclusion, when reach we do not cling to it as a dogma, in this instance duality.  The collection of sense and self, are in reality one but different functions, we dissect it into two, there is really only one.                  Sorry to you, I tend to carry too many innuendoes, I do, however wish to engage you constructively.     </p></div>

              <p>SN35.23 is talking about sensate reality as the All. That means all that we ever actually experience, our only sensate reality. Everyone can see that. He never said 'delusive reality' and anyway, there is NO such thing as 'delusive reality' -- that's a self contradictory statement. If it is delusion, it is delusion, if it is reality, it is reality. Those are two opposites. It seems you're the one caught in a conceptual bind that doesn't even make sense or have any substance.</p>
              <p>If anyone bothers to read even a bit of the suttas with open mindedness, I'm sure he will see my point.</p>
              <p>Next, MN 49 said: "'Having directly known the all as the all,<a id="t-8" class="noteTag         " name="t-8" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.049.than.html#n-8">8</a> and having directly known the extent of what has not been experienced
                                                  through the allness of the all, I wasn't the all, I wasn't in the all,
                                                  I wasn't coming forth from the all, I wasn't "The all is mine." I
                                                  didn't affirm the all. Thus I am not your mere equal in terms of direct
                                                  knowing, so how could I be inferior? I am actually superior to you.'"</p>
              <p>I fully agree with this and do not see any contradictions with my previous statement. There is no observer and observed division, however that doesn't mean that I am part of the all, I am manifesting from the all, etc. Because there is always, simply the All! There is no such thing as an observer being part of, or apart from, the All. Any sense of an observer apart (or being part of) from observed is simply an illusion.</p>
              <p>This is what Buddha meant when he said having known the Allness of All, he no longer sees himself as, in, or coming from, or owning, the All. There is just the All! Nothing outside, apart, from that. That's it.</p>

              <p><span id="textNode_17895994" class="threadText"></span></p><blockquote>"(for instance Kenneth referred to Krishnamurti saying something like the observed and the observer is one)."</blockquote><em>Thitatto,
                  I'm glad you picked up on this apparent inconsistency. Krishnamurti
                  would have done better to say that "observing (the sense of
                  observation) and the observed are one." Although we must admit that
                  Krishnamurti's phrase is much more elegant, it has serious problems as
                  there is no observer to be found. There is, however, the sense of
                  observation, and this is what he meant by "observer." By saying that
                  the observer and the observed are one, he was saying that the universe
                  is "one without a second," or "not-two." But, more than making a
                  philosophical statement, he was pointing to a particular situation
                  (experence?) in which duality does not arise.<br><br>A related matter
                  is the no-dog. The experience of "Self" described by the advaitists can
                  be seen as both a means and an end. It's an end in that it is a refuge,
                  a trans-personal perspective that is prior to the arising of a separate
                  self, and therefore upstream from suffering. The no-dog knows no
                  suffering. But in the no-dog, there is still a tenuous thread of
                  delusion; the small personal self has been superseded by the universal
                  and impersonal Self. So the no-dog is also a means; by dwelling as the
                  no-dog "Self," you are just one tiny step away from the simplest thing,
                  aka primordial awareness, which has no reference point, either personal
                  or transpersonal. There is no self, big, small or otherwise, from this
                  simplest of all perspectives. It knows Itself. There is no localized
                  sense of knowing standing apart from what is known.There's just the
                  entire phenomenological world, which is self-aware.<br><br>I'm sorry if
                  this seems convoluted. It's not nearly so confusing in real life. But
                  you can see why so many have failed so miserably to speak clearly about
                  it; it's just really hard to talk about.</em><p></p>

                                      engaging with the world and just remain. If it wanted to it can

              <p>It is better to read the following passage and not be fooled like Bhikkhu Sati. The Buddha has so clearly explained that consciousness is a cognizance of the 6 senses that dependently originates, that it is not an agent or observer that transmigrates and does not have existence apart from that manifestation of auditory, visual, etc, consciousness. Meaning there is no observer apart from the vision of mountain, the sound, etc. Rebirth happens but it is not an observer or entity that is reborn, rather it is the re-manifestation of cognizance based upon conditions (of which karma, and many other conditions, play a part). If there is no other consciousness than these six consciousness that dependently originates, how can you state a separate observer apart from them, or worse still a consciousness disassociated with the senses? This is in contradiction with what Buddha told Bhikkhu Sati, told Bahiya, said in Kalaka Sutta, in MN.45, and so on.</p>
