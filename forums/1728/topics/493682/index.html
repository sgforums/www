              Abbot</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9pt;">PAVIN CHACHAVALPONGPUNMARCH
              17, 2017 The New York Times</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              siege of the temple near Bangkok was lifted last Friday, and the abbot remains
              at large. Some say he is abroad; others say he is dead. But the military
              government of Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha is still on a manhunt for Phra
              Dhammachayo, the controversial spiritual leader of the Dhammakaya movement, a
              powerful Buddhist sect.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">For
              23 days, the Thai police blocked access to the sprawling Dhammakaya compound
              outside Bangkok and raided it in search of its former abbot. Phra Dhammachayo
              is wanted for embezzlement and money laundering, among other things. The
              temple’s spokesman has denied the accusations; the abbot’s supporters claim the
              charges are politically motivated.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">But
              the curious saga of this possibly wayward cleric is also, or mostly, about the
              ruling junta’s growing insecurity. To stamp out dissent, the military
              government is now willing to openly trespass into the religious sphere and
              clamp down on a very popular Buddhist leader. And this story may soon become a
              cautionary tale.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Dhammakaya
              is the biggest and most influential temple in Thailand. It has gained traction,
              especially among lower-middle classes, thanks to a kind of Buddhist prosperity
              gospel that advocates meditation, volunteering and donations. It repackages
              traditional Buddhist concepts in accessible form, including carnival-like
              pilgrimages and </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Members
              of the royal family appear to have sponsored the sect, and are thought to have
              helped pay for buildings at its main compound. But the movement is better known
              for its suspected ties to the former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was
              overthrown in a military coup in 2006, and to his sister Yingluck, who was
              ousted by the current junta, in 2014, after she, too, became prime minister.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Phra
              Dhammachayo was charged with embezzlement in the late 1990s and removed from
              his position. But he was cleared of the charges and reinstated as abbot after
              Mr. Thaksin became prime minister. Many Shinawatra supporters, better known as
              the red shirts, are hardcore loyalists of Phra Dhammachayo.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Much
              like Mr. Thaksin challenged the political domination of the traditional Thai
              elites — namely royalists, the military and big business — Dhammakaya’s brash
              form of Buddhism threatens the belief system of Thai conservatives. Together
              the Shinawatras and this sect seem to erode traditional forms of authority, and
              so in the junta’s view, must be quieted.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Buddhism
              is one prong of the holy trinity that makes Thai identity, alongside the nation
              and the monarchy. It is the state religion, and a compulsory subject of study
              in public schools. The king is considered to be Buddhism’s ultimate patron and
              the gatekeeper of the Sangha, the Buddhist monastic order.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Tensions
              between Dhammakaya and the Prayuth government were bound to come to a head
              after the death of King Bhumibol Adulyadej in October. Bhumibol had ruled for
              seven decades, partly by forging strong ties with the military and
              Bangkok-based elites. But in recent years the Shinawatras defied those
              traditional networks, tacitly challenging the king’s moral authority, by
              appealing to rural voters with populist projects. The military arguably staged
              the 2014 coup in the hope of steering the impending royal succession in ways
              that would safeguard the interests of the establishment. Now it is trying to
              control the Buddhist establishment as well.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It
              so happened that as Bhumibol’s health was faltering last year and the question
              of his succession became a pressing concern, the conservative elites had to
              worry about another passing of the guard: The Supreme Patriarch, the head of
              the monks’ order, died in 2013 and had yet to be replaced.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Traditionally,
              the country’s top religious position goes to the most senior monk designated by
              the Sangha Supreme Council, the Buddhist order’s governing body. In this
              instance, the presumptive heir was Somdet Phra Maha Ratchamangalacharn, better
              known as Somdet Chuang. But the Prayuth government blocked his nomination by
              invoking a tax evasion scandal involving vintage cars. More to the point
              perhaps, Somdet Chuang was a mentor to Phra Dhammachayo and he enjoys massive
              support among Thaksin supporters.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              January, the government amended the Sangha succession law to give the king sole
              power to appoint the Supreme Patriarch. In February, Maha Vajiralongkorn, the
              new king, chose Somdet Phra Maha Muniwong, the abbot of a competing sect,
              circumventing the Sangha Council.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Then
              on March 5, the government issued a royal command, signed by the king,
              stripping Phra Dhammachayo of his religious titles.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Are
              the new king and the military working in tandem? Who knows. Almost three years
              after the coup, Thai politics remains precarious and very opaque.
              Vajiralongkorn has asked for revisions to a junta-drafted constitution that was
              approved by referendum last year; a form of horse-trading may be underway. The
              controversial constitution has yet to come into force, and pending that, the
              date of the next election, already many times delayed, remains uncertain.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">One
              major question is how long the Thai people will stand for this, especially if
              the Prayuth government starts cracking down on religious leaders. At the height
              of the recent siege at the Dhammakaya complex, several thousand monks and
              supporters stayed in the compound to protest the raid. The standoff was the
              most high-profile mass demonstration against the junta since the 2014 coup.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              generals’ tough stance hardly is surprising given their insistence on quashing
              critics in the past. But their failure to eradicate Mr. Thaksin’s influence has
              probably made him stronger, and if their attack on Dhammakaya, and meddling in
              religious affairs, was an attempt to tighten their grip on power, they may well
              come out the weaker for it.</span></p>
