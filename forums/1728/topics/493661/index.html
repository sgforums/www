              for the Homeless in Myanmar</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Shuyin Buddhistdoor Global
              | 2017-02-24 | </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify;">Located
              about two hours outside of Yangon, the Thanlyin Thabarwa Centre has neither the
              tranquillity of a meditation retreat nor the ornamentation of many Burmese
              temples. In fact, it feels more like a busy shantytown. With more than 3,000
              permanent residents of all ages from assorted backgrounds—monks, novices, nuns,
              yogis, the niece of an army major-general, a film star, addicts, prostitutes,
              the homeless, the abandoned, the chronically ill, the disabled, the elderly,
              families with children, and volunteers, the centre is usually abuzz with
              activity, especially over the weekends when hundreds of visitors arrive.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Aside
              from the monastic members and foreign volunteers, most of the residents live in
              overcrowded communal dormitories constructed largely of bamboo. Due to the lack
              of space, people simply make do with whatever living areas are available, with
              some sleeping under flimsy, stained tarpaulins that look like they could hardly
              withstand a heavy rainfall.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Within
              the centre is a hospital housing a few hundred patients with diseases ranging
              from HIV, tuberculosis, cancer, and diabetes to mental illnesses. Managed by a
              team of volunteer doctors and assistants, medical treatment is completely free.
              There is even a sparsely equipped “intensive care unit” for about 10 people,
              including 110-year-old Daw Shwe, who came to Thabarwa with her son some six
              years ago. Since he passed away from age-related ailments last year, she has
              been bedridden, lying frail and hopeless in the hospital.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              busiest places at Thabarwa are probably the two kitchens, where more than 300
              kilograms of rice must be cooked daily to feed the thousands of residents and
              visitors. Fortunately, there is no lack of volunteers for the endless work of
              washing, cutting, cooking, and distribution. At meal times, there are usually
              long queues—people waiting to collect their meals, and helpers filling buckets
              for distribution to those who are bedridden or unable to collect the food
              themselves.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">About
              15 minutes’ walk from the main centre is Saytanar (or Goodwill) Village, also
              known as “15 feet village,” because the big plot of land is divided into small parcels
              of 15 by 15 feet (4.6 by 4.6 meters). To qualify for one of these parcels at
              Saytanar Village, there is no requirement to prove one’s financial status or
              need. Applicants only have to fulfil one condition—to meditate for seven days
              at the monastery.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Most
              of the 3,000 families in the village (of about 15,000 people) live well below
              the poverty line and cannot afford to pay rent. For many, a 15-by-15-foot
              bamboo hut is a welcome alternative to homlessness. With climbing land costs in
              Myanmar due to rapid development in recent years, many people have been forced
              out of their homes. In the countryside, large areas of farmland have been
              acquired on behalf of foreign companies. With no means of survival, many
              displaced people migrate to Yangon in search of work but end up sleeping on the
              streets or under bridges. Development-induced displacement, exacerbated by
              natural disasters, has already rendered millions homeless.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">For
              Tin Win, 57, and her family of six, Thabarwa was their last resort because they
              could not afford to pay the advance of six months’ rent required to renew the
              lease on their property.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Myint
              New and her family of nine have been here for two years, and she is grateful
              for what they receive. “My husband had a stroke and is unable to work,” she
              says. “With no income, we had nothing to eat. I have no relatives to help me.”
              With the little she makes from selling fruit, she is able to buy snacks for her
              children occasionally and medicine for her husband, but Myint New can see no
              way out of her difficulties. “I want to live in my own house and run my own
              business,” she said. “But I have no savings.” Unable to afford building
              materials, the family have been staying in a communal dormitory.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Thabarwa
              Centre was founded by Sayadaw U Ottamasara, a pale, lean-looking monk who is
              much revered by everyone here. Unlike many senior monks in Myanmar who enter
              the monastery at an early age, Sayadaw Ottamasara was not ordained until the
              age of 33, after giving up his business and selling all his assets. Despite
              this, the 48-year-old Sayadaw has managed to garner a following in Myanmar and
              overseas, where he travels regularly to conduct meditation retreats.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">He
              established Thabarwa Centre in 2008 to teach meditation, but soon realised that
              there was a need to provide a permanent home for some elderly yogis who had
              been abandoned at the centre by their families. As more and more people came,
              he decided to develop Thabarwa into a home for the needy. With the generous
              support he received he acquired more land, and within a few short years Sayadaw
              Ottamasara has expanded his services to include two centres in Pyin Oo Lwin and
              Thayetpinyeik in Ayeyarwady Region, and nearly a dozen meditation centres
              around the country. Another 73-hectare Saytanar Village for 500 families has
              also been set up in Hlegu, outside of Yangon, together with an animal
              sanctuary.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Sayadaw
              Ottamasara’s vision for Thabarwa goes beyond just providing a refuge for the
              needy. He sees it as a place where everyone can perform good deeds. “I believe
              that if we want good results, we must do good deeds. This centre was
              established to teach people about the benefits of doing good deeds,” he said.
              “In this country, there are many poor people who have no work and cannot find
              any way to survive. They come to Thabarwa for help. Instead of confronting and
              solving problems directly by traditional social norms, I encourage, train, and
              guide the people to solve their problems with the aid of the Dhamma, through
              meditation practice and right understanding. Everyone here can donate their
              skills, time, energy, money, and materials to gain merit and practice
              meditation for a worthy cause. By so doing, they will be able to fulfil their
              desire. If they want land, they will get land. If they want a home, they will
              have a home. Gradually, they will realise that their problems were solved due
              to the merit they gained from their good deeds here.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">For
              some, such a vision may seem overly optimistic. Admittedly, in trying to
              accommodate anyone, regardless of race, status, background, and beliefs, there
              will be problems. There will be some who come for selfish gain, such as
              profiting by selling their parcel of land at Saytanar Village, even though it
              is illegal to do so. There will be some who prey on the kindness and generosity
              of donors, such as the drunkard who reeked of alcohol and cigarettes, pestering
              visitors for money. There is also the danger of creating an addiction to
              assistance that renders people lazy and helpless, rather than taking
              responsibility for their own lives or striving to improve their conditions.
              Some of the young people I spoke with at the centre do not attend school, but
              hang around and occasionally do simple chores.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">In
              addition, there is a genuine concern about health and hygiene because of the
              poor living conditions. The communal dormitories are overcrowded, with poor
              ventilation and exposure to sunlight. A rancid odour pervades and the air is
              stale and stuffy. The “wards” in the hospitals are dilapidated, with broken
              doors and windows. And hills of garbage and pools of stagnant water provide a
              festering ground for all kinds of diseases, much like the slums in other parts
              of the country. Yet amid the squalor, life goes on.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Sayadaw
              Ottamasara remains unwavering in his conviction: “Most of the people here are
              not healthy, not young, not rich, but their minds are healthy and clean, with
              fewer attachments than most people in society. This is the place of healthy and
              wealthy minds.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">My
              visit to Thabarwa conjured up a storm of emotion and mixed reactions within me.
              The raw, stark reality of Thabarwa challenges us to reflect upon our attitudes
              and prejudices. How do we balance compassion and wisdom in performing charity?
              Are we discomfited by that which is repulsive and squalid because it threatens
              our own self-cherishing thoughts and sense of self-righteousnesss? But was it
              not the sight of humanity in all its wretchedness that drove Prince Siddharta
              to leave behind the comfort and security of his royal existance to search for
              an answer to life’s suffering? It takes much courage to be fully immersed in
              the sea of human suffering, to transcend and embrace all—the good, the bad and
              the ugly! As Joseph Campbell says in The Power of Myth: “When we quit thinking
              primarily about ourselves and our own self-preservation, we undergo a truly
              heroic transformation of consciousness.”</span></p>
