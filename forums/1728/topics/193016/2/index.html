We have to investigate to acertain whether it is wrong or correct.<br><br>For example, during an argument, you have to allow there someone to explain to you his or her stand. Instead labelling the person as guilty without an explaination. we need to know her reasons to see 2 side of the coins and in order for there we need to have more informations to decide.<br><br>Another example is, a person who has been raped can understand the feeling and experience as rape victim. ( just an example, no offence to anyone <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> ) Similary when someone has to undergo training to be chef, will one become a qualified chef.<br><br>There people who learn how to cycle pretty fast and without hurting themselves. There are people who took a long time and painful multi-trys but did they manage to learn cycling in the end.
