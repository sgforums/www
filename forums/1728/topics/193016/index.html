            <div class='col-md body'>Anyone can have deep respect for the Buddha and his teachings, but to become a Buddhist you will have to take refuge in the Triple Gems. There are no other ways to become a disciple of the Buddha and a Buddhist.<br><br>To be a Buddhist one has to be committed to his refuge and refuge vows, which includes not relying on external sources of refuge/taking refuge in deities and gods, since they have not transcended samsara and will not lead one towards freedom from samsara.

Because there is nothing for us to tolerate. You are free to believe what you want to believe. We do not say 'Since you do not believe in the things I do, you are going to hell'. But generally Buddhists should avoid the false views that Buddha listed if we want to become enlightened like the Buddha quickly.<br><br>But if you claim to be a Buddhist by believing in all other weird stuff that has nothing to do with Buddhism, then obviously that is wrong and will give people misunderstanding of what Buddhism is.<br><br>But generally Buddhists who has taken refuge in the Triple Gems do not rely on other samsaric beings (beings still unenlightened/in samsara) for refuge.</div>

Worldly gods are those like Brahma, Indra, Vishnu and Shiva, or Tsens and Gyalpo and other spirits. Since they themselves are in Samsara, how can they help you to become liberated from it? So, as it is said in the Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva (by Thogme Rinpoche), one should not go for Refuge to unenlightened and worldly beings.</span><br><br><a href="http://groups.msn.com/AryaTaraTibetanBuddhismUK/takingrefuge1.msnw" rel="nofollow">http://groups.msn.com/AryaTaraTibetanBuddhismUK/takingrefuge1.msnw</a><br><br><blockquote>What if one day, they come across a samsaric being who give them an advice which is meaning but yet contradicts to the Buddhist's belief?

I heard thus. Once the Blessed One, while wandering in the Kosala country with a large community of bhikkhus, entered a town of the Kalama people called Kesaputta. The Kalamas who were inhabitants of Kesaputta: "Reverend Gotama, the monk, the son of the Sakiyans, has, while wandering in the Kosala country, entered Kesaputta. The good repute of the Reverend Gotama has been spread in this way: Indeed, the Blessed One is thus consummate, fully enlightened, endowed with knowledge and practice, sublime, knower of the worlds, peerless, guide of tamable men, teacher of divine and human beings, which he by himself has through direct knowledge understood clearly. He set forth the Dhamma, good in the beginning, good in the middle, good in the end, possessed of meaning and the letter, and complete in everything; and he proclaims the holy life that is perfectly pure. Seeing such consummate ones is good indeed."<br><br>2. Then the Kalamas who were inhabitants of Kesaputta went to where the Blessed One was. On arriving there some paid homage to him and sat down on one side; some exchanged greetings with him and after the ending of cordial memorable talk, sat down on one side; some saluted him raising their joined palms and sat down on one side; some announced their name and family and sat down on one side; some without speaking, sat down on one side.<br><br><strong>The Kalamas of Kesaputta ask for guidance from the Buddha</strong><br><br>3. The Kalamas who were inhabitants of Kesaputta sitting on one side said to the Blessed One: "There are some monks and brahmins, venerable sir, who visit Kesaputta. They expound and explain only their own doctrines; the doctrines of others they despise, revile, and pull to pieces. Some other monks and brahmins too, venerable sir, come to Kesaputta. They also expound and explain only their own doctrines; the doctrines of others they despise, revile, and pull to pieces. Venerable sir, there is doubt, there is uncertainty in us concerning them. Which of these reverend monks and brahmins spoke the truth and which falsehood?"<br><br><strong>The criterion for rejection</strong><br><br>4. "It is proper for you, Kalamas, to doubt, to be uncertain;uncertainty has arisen in you about what is doubtful. Come, Kalamas. Do not go upon what has been acquired by repeated hearing; nor upon tradition; nor upon rumor; nor upon what is in a scripture; nor upon surmise; nor upon an axiom; nor upon specious reasoning; nor upon a bias towards a notion that has been pondered over; nor upon another's seeming ability; nor upon the consideration, 'The monk is our teacher.' Kalamas, when you yourselves know: 'These things are bad; these things are blamable; these things are censured by the wise; undertaken and observed, these things lead to harm and ill,' abandon them.<br><br><strong>Greed, hate, and delusion</strong><br><br>5. "What do you think, Kalamas? Does greed appear in a man for his benefit or harm?" - "For his harm, venerable sir." - "Kalamas, being given to greed, and being overwhelmed and vanquished mentally by greed, this man takes life, steals, commits adultery, and tells lies; he prompts another too, to do likewise. Will that be long for his harm and ill?" - "Yes, venerable sir."<br><br>6. "What do you think, Kalamas?
