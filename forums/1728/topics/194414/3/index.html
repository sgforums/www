            <div class='col-md body'>The funny thing is after watching the cruel killing, Some find eating chicken more tastier in KFC. lol. of course they are some who are defer by it.<br><br>some farmers who rear chicken or poulty don't respect life. the way they keep these for  chicken in cages... some even beat up chicken or turkey when they are angry.. abusive of animals.. there are no proper laws and regulations in protecting these animals. Cos they are destined to be killed? so we shld allow the farmers to act inhumane to them? sad manz....<br><br>Male chick are killed when they are born. The hens are kept in overcrowding cages. There are no floor in the the cages so the their claws or feet got hurt. The hens are so stressed by the cramping environment that they peck at the other hens and themselves.<br><br>Can u imagine if u are the hen... what will u feel? Despair?<br><br>To prevent pecking, some practise chipping off their beaks. So the young chick's beaks are chipped off without any pain killers. The beaks are very senstive organ to the chick.<br><br>And the hens are given chemical in the feedings so that they can grow fat faster and laid egg faster. they grow so fat that their poor legs can be broken.<br><br>The chemical injected ( i think hormone ) can affect human being.. i forgot what it is.. make male more femaleish or female more maleish??<br><br>when there are people who still eat meat.. there shld have proper regulations on how they handle these animals..<br><br></div>

Legend claims that his head split into ten pieces from grief and despair on discovering the extent of wickedness in the world, and the utter hopelessness of saving all mankind. Amitabha caused each piece to become a head, and placed the heads on the body of his spiritual son, Avalokitesvara. Nine of the heads have benign faces and are depicted in three rows; the tenth has an angry face, while the head at the top is that of Amitabha.<br><br>All the heads, except that of Amitabha, is crowned. In contrast to the floral crowns of the three rows of heads, the top wrathful head is adorned with a crown of skulls.<br><br>At a symbolic level, eight of the heads represent the cardinal directions and their intermediate points, and the other three signify the zenith, the center, and the nadir.<br><br><a href="http://www.exoticindiaart.com/product/ZJ56" rel="nofollow">http://www.exoticindiaart.com/product/ZJ56</a><br><img src="http://images.exoticindiaart.com/brass/zj56.jpg"><br><br>ps: china often portray Guanyin as a motherly form while Tibetans often portray Guanyin as a Da zang fu(great gentleman).<br><br>/\<br></div>
