One could start to increase the consumption of carbohydrates and fibres, so that stomach will get full easily, and hence lesser desire for meat products.

Of course, I'm not saying a vegetarian will not fall ill, but without animal fats, one does becomes "lighter".</div></blockquote>For me, I believe it is possible to turn vegetarian overnight. It is all a person's attitude towards vegetarianism. Why I say can turn vegetarian overnight? Because I used to go for a dharma tour overseas and for two weeks we ate vegetarian meals. It is delicious, so we had no problems with it.<br><br>So vegetarianism is actually quite easy, just that my will is not strong enough. If you cook, you also need to know how to cook well, so that you have enough nutrients and also the food must be delicious so that you will like it. The vegetarian diet is actually suitable to most people. As long as you know what you need to eat.</div>

But if you have the right vegetarian diet it will be beneficial to your health and you can live till old age. There are many vegetarian Buddhist monks in history who lived till a very old age with great health. Some even lived till 120 years old like modern Zen Master Hsu Yun.<br><br>If we are long time vegetarians we must avoid to eat this kind of things. Anyway to me they arent really delicious either. The real vegetarian stuff are much better.</div>
