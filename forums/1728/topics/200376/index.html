The nature of the eighth consciousness is said to be "non-obscuring" because it does not obscure True Thusness. The eighth consciousness can also be said to be "unobscured"  because its own nature is not obscured by the mind-dependent dharmas that arise with it.  It is indeterminate because, being passive, it does not make  the distinctions  of  wholesome and unwholesome or any other distinctions.<br><br>The eighth consciousness contains seeds, karmic potentials created by previous karmic activities. The seeds ripen and become actual dharmas as they are "perfumed" by the karmic activity of the first seven consciousnesses.  The image here is built on an analogy with of sesame seeds, which take on the fragrance of the sesame plant's flowers or of any fragrance with which they come into contact.<br><br>...........................<br><br>----------------<br><br>The first 7 consciousness, which is the 6 sense consciousness + 7th consciousness, are propelled by cause and conditions due to the ripening of karmic seeds from the 8th Consciousness. The volition of a sentient being plants a karmic seed into the 8th consciousness whenever a cause that will lead to a karmic result is committed. The 8th Consciousness can also be seen as a 'tape recorder', as our memories and past life memories are stored in this consciousness.<br><br>8th Consciousness by itself is 'non-obscuring', and due to delusion, there arise the 7th Consciousness which takes the 8th Consciousness as a permanent entity, as a 'Self'. Therefore awakening is the transform 'consciousness' to 'awareness'/'wisdom'. 7th Consciousness is basically, the egoic consciousness, consciousness of a seperate self.<br><br>In reality, consciousness is also 'non-self', 'impermanent', - a continuum. Not a permanent entity.</div>

Difference between rebirth and reincarnation is that reincarnation implies there is a 'self' undergoing reincarnation, while rebirth simply means a continuum. Because we are empty of inherent existence, there is no 'self' that is the same as us in the past, nor will there be a 'self' that is the same as us in the future. Neither similar nor different, cos empty. Reality is beyond extremes.. if we go by linear analysis we cannot understand it. We will be trapped in the assumption that there is a really real past and a really real future, and then we cling to them as our egoic identity. This is what I meant by '7th consciousness clinging to 8th consciousness as a Self'. Therefore, the perceived duality that there must be a self or something real with inherent existence that is experiencing the world is from the beginning a great illusion caused by grasping in the time dimension and missing the essence.<br><br>There has always been NOW, what you perceive as future and past is just memory and rearrangement of memory to form prediction, and even the memory and recalling takes place in the NOW. Difficult to grasp? It's very simple if you dont try to understand it through linear mode of analysis. Too simple that it doesn't make sense to our ordinary mind. Let's say, in terms of clock time 3 hours ago you were drinking coffee. But while you were drinking coffee, you were drinking coffee in the NOW. 3 hours later you drink coffee, you will be drinking coffee in the NOW. NOW is all there ever is.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Life is nothing other than the continuous flow of the Now Moment.</span> - Thusness<br><br>---<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"It is like an image reflected in a mirror, it is seen but it is not real; the One Mind is seen as a duality by the ignorant when it is reflected in the mirror constructed by their memory. . . .

Although you recognize that all the different phenomena are the extension of this basic substance or Supreme Truth, yet there still exists the opposition of basic substance versus external phenomena. Not until the distinctions of all phenomena disappear, and everything goes back to truth or Heaven, will you have absolute peace and unity. As long as the world of phenomena is still active, you cannot do away with conflict, calamity, suffering and crime. Therefore, although philosophers and religious figures perceive the peace of the original substance, they still have no way to get rid of the confusion of phenomena.</strong></span><br><br>------<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">One who has entered Chan <span style="text-decoration: underline;">does not see basic substance and phenomena as two things standing in opposition to each other.</span> They cannot even be illustrated as being the back and palm of a hand. This is because <span style="text-decoration: underline;">phenomena themselves are basic substance</span>, and apart from phenomena there is no basic substance to be found. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The reality of basic substance exists right in the unreality of phenomena, which change ceaselessly and have no constant form.

The highest stage of AMness lies in the fusing into everything, individuality into nothingness, and finding AMness in everything. There is already a certain degree of Non-Duality experienced, however still there is a subtle attachment to that transcendental experience. This is the highest stage in Hinduism and many other contemplative paths.<br><br>Even that, is not yet there. In fact 2nd stage is the basis of all major religions, and only Buddhism transcends that.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Naturally, all great religious figures must have gone through the experiences of this second stage, where they free themselves from the confines of the small "I", and discover that their own basic substance is none other than the existence of the entire universe, and that there is no difference between themselves and everything in the universe. All phenomena are manifestations of their own nature. They have the duty to love and watch over all things, and also have the right to manage them; just as we have the duty to love our own children and the right to manage the property that belongs to us. This is the formation of the relationship between the deity and the multitude of things he created. Such people personify the basic substance of the universe which they experience through meditation, and create the belief in God. They substantiate this idea of a large "I" the self-love of God and formulate the mission of being a savior of the world or an emissary of God.</strong></span><br><br>More of that can be found in the website so read up.</div>
