            <div class='col-md body'>Thank-you all for taking the time to post replies.<br><br>To some extent I understand the whole "flow" thing of a mental continuum, how I am a different self every moment, etc.  At one level that makes sense.<br><br>But at another level it doesn't fit with what I have been telling myself in order to encourage myself to practise the 5 precepts.  When I am tempted to do stupid things like speak unkindly I tell myself "That's just my ego or whatever wanting to show off, whereas my mental continuum is the real, important bit, the bit I will carry over into the next life ... so it is more important to avoid accumulating negative karma".  I have found this way of thinking helpful ... but am I ultimately wrong to think this way then?<br><br>I really still don't think I understand it because surely even if my self is just flow and ever-changing, it is still true that if what I do in one moment affects the subsequent moments/even lives then there is some permanency in that ... like for example if I accumulate some positive karma it is like a permanent investment because it increases the future likelihood of more positive karma/good rebirth/even Enlightenment eventually?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>very interesting read.<br><br>one question regarding the point of reincarnation or rebirth -<br><br>rebirth is the word used becoz reincarnation implies a "self".<br><br>"there is no 'self' that is the same as us in the past"<br><br>if this is the case, why are there so many Buddhist stories about past lives?</div>
