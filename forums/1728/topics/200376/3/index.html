            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by paperflower:</div><div class="quote_body">i ever heard this from a layman teacher long ago, that one needs to recognise the clear light in the bardo stage. he ever told me before, that there are also other colored lights such as green, red, blue as well each representing the path light to respective rebirth. he said that during this bardo stage, one is not as awake or in complete control of the firm awareness of as now so he also did advise the ones to practice mindfulness and meditation well when we are alive.<br><br>as for the "zhong ying shen", i also have come across in the mahayana teaching and to verify, well not exactly to verify....:<br>after my dad passed away, i dreamt of him for 2weeks and on the last few days of the 2 weeks i dreamt he had finally closed his eyes in death like a sign he had let go to move on..... we can't see and know for now, neither can the dead say anything but the consciousness of the mind during sleep, faint, meditating, waking could collectively present an understanding of the ongoing of the mind-consciousness throughout the bardo and taking rebirth.<br><br>each day each moment is a rebirth of us not realising also...<br></div></blockquote>Yes there will be various lights, each 7 days there will be a light that can potentially lead you to rebirth. It is also true that the state of consciousness in bardo is quite different from now. Depending on what stage, we will have to use various means to speak the dharma to him. I remember my dharma teacher saying that one needs to speak the dharma many many times repeating over the ears, because in that particular bardo stage he will be in a blur and needs to be repeated many times before he understands.. the mind in bardo stage is also likened to a child's level of intelligence if i can remember clearly. It is also true that one may see different beings according to the karma they manifest. For example my master had actually led many dying people to reborn in Amitabha Pure Land, but in a few cases, those people got led away by the Devas because they were attracted by the devas. It is quite a pity, although devas is a very enjoyable place but nothing compared to Buddha's pure land.<br><br>Also, it is good that your father has moved on... You may also want to dedicate merits when you attend the Ullambanadharma session. Ullambanadharma dedication should not be mistaken as only limited to those deceased having gone to lower realm, even in higher or deva realm, they will have lasting blessings, those in Amitabha pure land may increase in grade (there are 9 pure land grade).</div>
