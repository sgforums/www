              <p>You miss the point completely. Uncontrived bodhicitta is based on

              <p>For Vajrayana view: </p>
              <p>Apart from the view of 2-fold emptiness that dissolves grasping to self and dharma.</p>
              <p>Vajrayana also holds that there is also the view of 'primordially pure appearance' that dissolves grasping to impure vision.</p>
              <p>That is why in the final conclusion stages of Dzogchen, there is Togal which reveals in a natural way the visions of the mandalas and Buddhafields of the Buddha deities and so forth as a manifestation of rigpa.</p>
              <p>For the Mahayana path, after the 8th Bhumi onwards, the Bodhisattva would gradually undo the grasping to impure appearances naturally, thus both the Mahayana and Vajrayana paths have the same Buddhahood result.  However, in terms of expediency, the Vajrayana path tackles the grasping to impure appearances directly right from the beginning of the path, and thus is a much more swifter method towards defeating both kinds of grasping (grasping to self/dharma and grasping to impure phenomenon)</p>
              <p>One teacher called Achuk Lama Rinpoche.  He has attained the rainbow body and is famous for his display of Buddhas and other sacred signs on his own body which many thousands upon thousands have seen, including my friends. He uses these pure phenomenon as a skilful means to lead one to realise one's own true nature and also for ascertaining one's stage on the path etc. For him all phenomenon is pure and he sometimes does things like pick up ordinary pebbles from places to keep because he has pure view of those pebbles as deities mandalas etc. </p>
              <p>When a Buddha attains Buddhahood, from the POV of the Vajrayana vehicle, all appearances to him are on the level of ultimate truth inseparable from the relative truth (this is the viewpoint of Vajrayana) and also, all impure appearances manifest as primoridally pure Buddhafields and deities.</p>
              <p>I want to bring this up because many people do not yet understand the difference in viewpoints of the Vajrayana and Mahayana schools.  It is important to be clearer about it esp for Vajrayana practitioner.  If possible, i will try to take out the main points and compile another article about this in future when time permits.</p>

              <p>I should make another point about Bodhichitta.  Although it seems from Thusness experience and realisations, Bodhichitta could arise from the 2 emptinesses, which i agree definitely. But the Buddhist path has never prescribed that one only tries to generate the motivation for Bodhichitta after realising the 2 emptinesses.  In fact, for the Mahayana path of accumulation, entry is only possible due to uncontrived Bodhichitta (i presume on a aspirational level) and then after that realisation of emptiness comes on the Mahayana path of seeing.  Which means, you can and should generate Bodhichitta motivation first as an entry to the Mahayana path.</p>
              <p>I write this in case any other reader here mistake the above quotes and utilise them wrongly in their practice.</p>
              <p>A case in point would be in the time of Lama Atisha. One day he woke up and exclaimed very sorrowfully to his attendant monk saying, "Oh, today someone has attained the 'stream-entry' or 'arhat' level (i can't remember which)  through the practice of Hevajra, what a pity!'  The attendant was shocked and asked, 'But the practice of Hevajra leads to unsurpassed complete Buddhahood!'  Then Lama Atisha replied, "Yes, Hevajra practice leads to Buddhahood, however, due to the level of motivation of the practitioner, he attained only such a small result (compared to Buddhahood)."</p>
              <p>This example is not belittling the result of stream-entry at all.  But it does show that the result depends on the causal motivation.  So in the first place, the causal motivation is important. And this is in line with the teachings of Buddha (as i know it from my Vajrayana studies)</p>
              <p>Shared with all humbly, may it be of benefit! Peace</p>

              <p>Not only that... Some Dzogchen teachings from the tantras state that only Dzogchen leads to the 13th bhumi full Buddhahood, and there are lower levels of Buddhahood which does not revert to basis. As only the 13th bhumi Buddha is able to recognise all appearance as the display of his own wisdom, when this universe ends and a new universe cycle starts again, all other beings including those Buddhas who have not reverted to the basis, will be unable to recognise the display as their own wisdom and note this: <strong>fall back into samsara again (oh my gosh, buddhahood can be reversed?) </strong>Basically: Dzogchen says that all sentient beings become Buddhas before the end of a universe, but not everyone becomes Buddhas that revert to basis (13th bhumi), so not all Buddhas will escape being a sentient being again in the next universe. So basically, we have all been Buddhas before, but too bad just not a 13th bhumi one so thats why we got lost again.</p>
              <p>That is shocking to say the least, but not something I can personally verify because it is way beyond my own experience. Also I have my own doubts (wouldn't a 12th bhumi Buddha have known better?? wouldn't the 13th bhumi buddha have taught the 12th bhumi ones??) I hope the whole story is just an analogy (I once asked Namdrol if the teaching about the primordial buddha samantabhadra are just analogies and not a literal story, as ChNNR seems to suggest it is an analogy, but Namdrol says such stories are taught as literal especially in higher teachings like the menagde)</p>
              <p>I must say, I still have a lot of confusion and doubts about dharma even now despite whatever insights, or experiences.. haha</p>

              <p>Not only that... Some Dzogchen teachings from the tantras state
                  that only Dzogchen leads to the 13th bhumi full Buddhahood, and
                  there are lower levels of Buddhahood which does not revert to
                  basis. As only the 13th bhumi Buddha is able to recognise all
                  appearance as the display of his own wisdom, when this universe
                  ends and a new universe cycle starts again, all other beings
                  including those Buddhas who have not reverted to the basis, will be
                  unable to recognise the display as their own wisdom and note this:
                  <strong>fall back into samsara again (oh my gosh, buddhahood can be
                  reversed?)</strong> Basically: Dzogchen says that all sentient
                  beings become Buddhas before the end of a universe, but not
                  everyone becomes Buddhas that revert to basis (13th bhumi), so not
                  all Buddhas will escape being a sentient being again in the next
                  universe. So basically, we have all been Buddhas before, but too
                  bad just not a 13th bhumi one so thats why we got lost again.</p>
              <p>That is shocking to say the least, but not something I can
                  personally verify because it is way beyond my own experience. Also
                  I have my own doubts (wouldn't a 12th bhumi Buddha have known
                  better?? wouldn't the 13th bhumi buddha have taught the 12th bhumi
                  ones??) I hope the whole story is just an analogy (I once asked
                  Namdrol if the teaching about the primordial buddha samantabhadra
                  are just analogies and not a literal story, as ChNNR seems to
                  suggest it is an analogy, but Namdrol says such stories are taught
                  as literal especially in higher teachings like the menagde)</p>
              <p>I must say, I still have a lot of confusion and doubts about
                  dharma even now despite whatever insights, or experiences..

              <p>Where you read this from?  Supreme Source?</p>
              <p>From my memory, there is up to 16th Bhumi based on the classification of Dzogchen.</p>
              <p>I think that i have read somewhere that the later classes of Bhumis (above 12th) is a matter of classification.</p>
              <p>Tsultrim Lodro says that although there are suggestions in the texts that the Mahayana Buddhahood is slightly inferior to the Vajrayana Buddhahood, however it is a matter of interpretation.  Basically, it is the same Buddhahood.</p>
              <p>However, in terms of views of Vajrayana and Mahayana, there are indeed many distinct points, and even between the different schools of Tibetan Buddhism there are differences. But, apart from the differing speed of progress and methods, we can say that all reach the same result, same Buddhahood.</p>

              <p><br>Sure there is -- as Samputa clearly explains. But this is something 
                              Sakyas/Nyingmas and Kagyus do not agree on. Kaguyus basically assert 
                              what you just have -- there is only one level of buddhahood, the elventh
                               bhumi. When we see breakdowns into more bhumis, these are just 
                              refinements of bodhisattva levels -- but still only one level of 
                              Buddhahood.<br><br>Sakyas and Nyingmapas do not see it that way. So we 
                              will agree to disagree. we see qualitative differences in the 
                              omniscience of the three levels or six levels of Buddhahood. The funny 
                              thing is meditatively, and in terms of direct introduction and so on 
                              Kagyu and Nyingma are closer. But in terms of philosophy and basic 
                              attitudes about the path and so Sakya and Nyingma are closer. This is 
                              why when one leaves Sakya or Kagyu, there is only one place to go. <br><br>Moreover, in Dzogchen there is a further disctinction between Abhisambudhas and Samyaksambuddhas.</p>
              <p>.................<br><br>The basis is the three wisdoms: essence, nature and compassion. 
                              "Reverting to the basis" means that you have not eradicated all the most
                               subtle traces in the elements of your physical body. <br><br>N</p>
              <p>............</p>
              <p><cite></cite>Most people think that Buddhahood is irrersible; Dzogchen 
                              on the other hand asserts that the buddhahood of the lower yanas is 
                              reverts into the basis, and only Dzogchen results in complete and 
                              irreversible buddhahood.<br>N</p>
              <p>............</p>
              <p><br><br><br>It is because buddhahood of lower yÄ�nas is incomplete and 
                              does not reach the stage of ka dag chen po, great original purity. The 
                              simplest way to explain it is that after the this universe dissolves and
                               the next one arises, those beings who have not achieved the stage of ka
                               dag chen po start all over. <br><br>N</p>

              <p><br><br>Oh,
                               probably longer than that. That nirodhasamapatti is permanent in the 
                              sense that when an arhats enters that kind of suspended animation, he 
                              has no particular intention of rousing from it again.</p>
              <p>............</p>
              <p><br>Wisdom = ye shes. <br><br>This is a subtle point of Dzogchen most 
                              people do not pay attention to. There is very little difference between 
                              Dzogchen cosmology and Abhidharma cosmology. But there is a slight 
                              difference. In Dzogchen cosmology all sentient beings achieve 
                              buddhahood. <br><br>But....there are two kinds of buddhahood discussed 
                              in Dzogchen; buddhahood that reverts to the cause and the buddhahood 
                              that does not revert the cause. <br><br>Those whose buddhahood was 
                              incomplete can still fall into sentient being hood if they do not 
                              recognize the arising of the basis as being their own display. <br><br>According
                               to the commentary on the à½¦à¾²à½¦à¼‹à½‚à½…à½²à½‚à¼‹à½”à½´à¼‹à½¢à¾’à¾±à½´à½‘ by Garab Dorje in the Vima 
                              Nyinthig, the basis arises because of traces of latent affliction and 
                              action left over from the previous eon. At that time, one either 
                              recognizes the stirring of the basis or not. <br><br>N</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>............</p>
              <p><br>There are, if you recall, three stages of Buddhahood. Since the 
                              first two stages of Buddhahood do not realized all phenomena as the 
                              display of their own wisdom, the eleventh and twelfth bhumi are not 
                              complete buddhahood, this true even in Sarma schools. <br><br>N</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>............</p>
              <p><br>There are three explanations possible, given that Dzogchen tantras 
                              and traditions definitely state that Samantabhadra was intiallly subject
                               to either one or two ignorances (ma rig pa, avidyÄ�):<br><br>1) The 
                              Dzogchen assertion that all sentient beings attain "full awakening 
                              (sangs rgyas)" at the end of a given mahÄ�kalpa requires interpetation 
                              and must not be taken literally.<br>2) Buddhahood is, up to a point, in fact reversible.<br>3) Buddhas and sentient beings newly form at the beginning of a mahÄ�kalapa. <br><br>All three possibilities present problems in terms of traditional Indian MahÄ�yÄ�na Buddhology. <br><br>This controversy first came to my attention when my Sakya khenpo mentioned it in passing in the early '90's.</p>

                               Regarding certain tantras it would seem that originally, by the magic 
                              of knowledge and of ignorance, on one side there arose Samantabhadra, 
                              the first Buddha, and on the other side beings who transmigrate. 
                              However, this should be mainly understood as a metaphor to enable us to 
                              disxover our real condition. If we deem Samantabhadra as an individual 
                              being, we are far from the true meaning. In reality, he denotes our 
                              potentiality that, even though at the present moment we are in samsara, 
                              has never been conditioned by dualism. From the beginning, the state of 
                              the individual has been pure and always remains pure: this is what 
                              Samantabhadra represents. But when we fall into conditioning, it is as 
                              if we are no longer Samantabhadra because we are ignorant of our true 
                              nature. So what is called the primordial Buddha, or Adibuddha, is only a
                               metaphor for our true condition.<br></div>

              <p><br> I am simply reporting what Garab Dorje, Padmasambhava, Shri Singha
                                                  et al actually say. I don't need to interpret anything.<br> <br> In HÄ«nayÄ�na, Shakyamuni taught arhatship as buddhahood. In
                                                  MahÄ�yana, he taught that arhatship was not buddhahood, and was
                                                  inferior to buddhahood. And that in fact, after attaining
                                                  arhatship, arhats would be roused from their nirodhasamapatti at
                                                  some point and then they must traverse the paths of stages of
                                                  MahÄ�yÄ�na. So, was the Buddha lying in HinÄ�yÄ�na when he told his
                                                  followers that arhatship was it?<br> <br> In VajrayÄ�na, in the Samputa tantra it is clarified that there are
                                                  three stages of Buddhahood. Two stages of Buddhas who do not
                                                  recognize all phenomena as being the display of their own wisdom
                                                  and the thireenth bhumi, Vajradhara, where all phenomena are so
                                                  recognized. Does this make the Buddha a liar about MahÄ�yÄ�na?<br> <br> In Dzochen, there are enumerated another three stages, three more
                                                  stages of those who dwell within wisdom, rendering the thirteenth
                                                  bhumi a lower stage of buddhahood. Does this make the Buddha a liar
                                                  about VajrayÄ�na?<br> <strong><br> In any event, this notion of "Buddhahood that reverts to the basis
                                                  [gzhi, not kun gzhi]" as an inferior buddhahood that is not
                                                  complete is well attested in Dzogchen. It has to be the case
                                                  because as Garab Dorje points out, all sentient beings in the
                                                  previous eon attain buddhahood by the end of the eon. This is
                                                  explicitly stated by Garab Dorje in the commentary I mentioned to
                                                  above.</strong><br> <br> But to illustrate my point further, the Drikung view is Dzogchen is
                                                  definitely subordinated. For example, Jigten Sumgon states in
                                                  Gongcik: “The supreme realization is not touched by the three great
                                                  ones.” This is echoe of a statement by Gampopoa to his nephew,
                                                  Gomchung.<br> <br> But I don't during Jigten Sumgon's time Nyingthig was wide spread.
                                                  At this point in history Nyingma was very much on the decline.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>............</p>
              <p> <br>From the thirteenth bhumi onwards, they are stages of "abiding in 
                      wisdom". Presuming one manages to attain the thirteen bhumi, it is 
                      unlikely that one's realization will be blocked. <br><br>N</p>
              <p>............</p>
              <p><br>There are two systems. One in which the sixteen bhumis directly 
                  correspond with the thirteen bhumis + three. Another where the bhumis 
                  are given as descriptive names for experiences through the four visions.
                   <br><br>They are both correct explanations. <br><br>N</p>

              section on the arising of the basis. <br><br>The Unwritten Tantra (Yi ge med pa describes how the general original basis exists:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">“There
               is no object to investigate within the view of self-originated wisdom: 
              nothing went before, nothing happens later, nothing is present now at 
              all. Action does not exist. Traces do not exist. Ignorance does not 
              exist. Mind does not exist. Discriminating wisdom does not exist. 
              Samsara does not exist.  Nirvana does not exist. Even vidyÄ� itself does 
              not exist i.e. nothing at all appears in wisdom. That arose from not 
              grasping anything.”</span><br><br>This is the state of original purity, The Blazing Lamp says:<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Within initial original purity<br>the nature is like so:<br>not made by anyone, manifesting naturally,<br>the nature is already just so.</span><br><br>In this state, The Rosary of Pearls states:<br><span style="font-style: italic;">The mere term delusion cannot be described<br>within the original purity of the initial state,<br>likewise, how can there be non-delusion?<br>Therefore, pure of delusion from the beginning.</span><br><br>The Heart Mirror states “<span style="font-style: italic;">All
               phenomena of the basis must be understood as the trio of essence, 
              nature and compassion. All phenomena of the essence must be understood 
              as emptiness. All phenomena of the nature must be understood as 
              luminosity. All phenomena of compassion must be understood as pervading 
              all sentient beings.</span>”<br><br>So, of course, there must be 
              essence, nature and compassion, timelessly present as the basis. Without
               these wisdoms, there can be no nirvana and no samsara. We can term 
              these three "sugatagarbha" if we like. Padmasambhava states in the Clear
               Mirror:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Those three wisdoms 
              pervade Samantabhadra and sentient beings down to the tiniest creature 
              without any discrimination of good or bad, high or low.</span><br><br>Since
               these three wisdoms are themselves not established in anyway at all, we
               can be sure we are free from eternalism. Since these three natures 
              always appear, we are free from annihilationism. <br></p>

              <p><br><br>In the system of the Dzogchen 
              Nyinghig three causes of ignorance are described -- those three are 
              essence, nature and compassion. This is why there are three ignorances 
              in this system. The system of explanation of Gongpa Zangthal is a little
               different, with only two ignorances -- we will continue with the 
              Dzogchen Nyinthig system. <br><br>According to Garab Dorje, prior to the
               arising of the basis which is latent during the dark eon interval, 
              nevertheless there are traces of affliction and action remaining from 
              the previous eon. Because of these traces, the basis is stirred, the 
              five lights appear and so on (this is why the Dzogcgen doctrine of two 
              different kinds of Buddhahood is critical -- the first, the buddhahood 
              that reverts the basis is the buddhahood asserted by all lower vehicles.
               The buddhahood that does not revert to the basis is the preserve of 
              only Dzogchen). <br><br>The Gongpa Zangthal cycle supplies that during 
              the arising of basis there is a neutral awareness (shes pa lung ma 
              bstan) in the basis that does not recognize itself. This non-recognition
               is the innate ignorance. When this neutral awareness cognizes the five 
              lights there is a dividing line between nirvana and samsara. When a 
              neutral awareness recognizes the appearance of the basis as its own 
              appearances it is is prajñÄ� and is immediately liberated. That is 
              Samantabhadra. A neutral awareness that does not recognize appearances 
              as its own appearances immediately is the imputing ignorance, and 
              samsara begins (again) because subject and object is imputed. This is 
              all very clearly explained in detail in the eleven topics of Dzogchen 
              Nyinthig. This is also clearly explained by Khenpo Ngawang Palzang. <br></p>
              <blockquote class="uncited">
              <div>Key point: innate enlightenment arises simultaneously with innate ignorance.</div>
              </blockquote>
              <p><br><br>After
               the basis arises, innate ignorance is first and even Samantabhadra has 
              it. There is period where a neutral awareness does not recognize itself 
              in anyway. That is the innate ignorance. It (the neutral awareness) can 
              only recognize itself through the display of five lights. When it 
              recognizes that display as its own display, then this is the liberation 
              of Samantabhadra without the performance of an iota of virtue. We on the
               other hand did not recognize these five lights as our own display, and 
              for us, samsara began, without even an particle of non-virtue having 
              been done. <br><br>According to Dzogchen teachings, all sentient being 
              attain Buddhahood by the end of the eon -- this is very clearly stated 
              by Garab Dorje in the commentary above. But there are two kinds of 
              Buddhahood, and as I said above, there is only Buddhahood that does not 
              revert to the basis, and that is the Buddhahood attained through 
              Dzogchen methods. The Buddhahood of other vehicles reverts to the basis,
               without the corresponding result. <br><br>Now then, the reason why we 
              cannot take these metaphors in Uttaratantra literally is that the basis 
              is not Buddhahood. If the basis were Buddhahood, there would be no need 
              for any kind of recognition. <br><br>In Dzogchen, there is a difference 
              between the basis and the result. The difference is simply vidyÄ� and 
              avidyÄ� and the recognition and non-recognition that comes from those. <br><br>Further, it is not enough merely to understand the general original basis. One must also understand the human body as a basis. <br><br>I will not discuss this here since it is not a proper topic.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><br> Sure there is -- as Samputa clearly explains. But this is something
                      Sakyas/Nyingmas and Kagyus do not agree on. Kaguyus basically
                      assert what you just have -- there is only one level of buddhahood,
                      the elventh bhumi. When we see breakdowns into more bhumis, these
                      are just refinements of bodhisattva levels -- but still only one
                      level of Buddhahood.<br> <br> Sakyas and Nyingmapas do not see it that way. So we will agree to
                      disagree. we see qualitative differences in the omniscience of the
                      three levels or six levels of Buddhahood. The funny thing is
                      meditatively, and in terms of direct introduction and so on Kagyu
                      and Nyingma are closer. But in terms of philosophy and basic
                      attitudes about the path and so Sakya and Nyingma are closer. This
                      is why when one leaves Sakya or Kagyu, there is only one place to
                      go.<br> <br> Moreover, in Dzogchen there is a further disctinction between
                      Abhisambudhas and Samyaksambuddhas.</p>
              <p>.................<br> <br> The basis is the three wisdoms: essence, nature and compassion.
                      "Reverting to the basis" means that you have not eradicated all the
                      most subtle traces in the elements of your physical body.<br> <br> N</p>
              <p>............</p>
              <p>Most people think that Buddhahood is irrersible; Dzogchen on the
                      other hand asserts that the buddhahood of the lower yanas is
                      reverts into the basis, and only Dzogchen results in complete and
                      irreversible buddhahood.<br> N</p>
              <p>............</p>
              <p><br> <br> <br> It is because buddhahood of lower yÄ�nas is incomplete and does not
                      reach the stage of ka dag chen po, great original purity. The
                      simplest way to explain it is that after the this universe
                      dissolves and the next one arises, those beings who have not
                      achieved the stage of ka dag chen po start all over.<br> <br> N</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>............</p>
              <p><br> Even the arhat path leads to buddhahood, the question is, how
                      long?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>............</p>
              <p><br> <br> The arhat path leads to buddhahood because arhats are roused from
                      nirodhasamapatti by a Buddha and placed into the bodhisattva
                      path.<br> <br> N</p>
              <p>............</p>
              <p><br> <br> Oh, probably longer than that. That nirodhasamapatti is permanent
                      in the sense that when an arhats enters that kind of suspended
                      animation, he has no particular intention of rousing from it
                      again.</p>
              <p>............</p>
              <p><br> Wisdom = ye shes.<br> <br> This is a subtle point of Dzogchen most people do not pay attention
                      to. There is very little difference between Dzogchen cosmology and
                      Abhidharma cosmology. But there is a slight difference. In Dzogchen
                      cosmology all sentient beings achieve buddhahood.<br> <br> But....there are two kinds of buddhahood discussed in Dzogchen;
                      buddhahood that reverts to the cause and the buddhahood that does
                      not revert the cause.<br> <br> Those whose buddhahood was incomplete can still fall into sentient
                      being hood if they do not recognize the arising of the basis as
                      being their own display.<br> <br> According to the commentary on the à½¦à¾²à½¦à¼‹à½‚à½…à½²à½‚à¼‹à½”à½´à¼‹à½¢à¾’à¾±à½´à½‘ by Garab Dorje
                      in the Vima Nyinthig, the basis arises because of traces of latent
                      affliction and action left over from the previous eon. At that
                      time, one either recognizes the stirring of the basis or not.<br> <br> N</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>............</p>
              <p><br> There are, if you recall, three stages of Buddhahood. Since the
                      first two stages of Buddhahood do not realized all phenomena as the
                      display of their own wisdom, the eleventh and twelfth bhumi are not
                      complete buddhahood, this true even in Sarma schools.<br> <br> N</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>............</p>
              <p><br> There are three explanations possible, given that Dzogchen tantras
                      and traditions definitely state that Samantabhadra was intiallly
                      subject to either one or two ignorances (ma rig pa, avidyÄ�):<br> <br> 1) The Dzogchen assertion that all sentient beings attain "full
                      awakening (sangs rgyas)" at the end of a given mahÄ�kalpa requires
                      interpetation and must not be taken literally.<br> 2) Buddhahood is, up to a point, in fact reversible.<br> 3) Buddhas and sentient beings newly form at the beginning of a
                      mahÄ�kalapa.<br> <br> All three possibilities present problems in terms of traditional
                      Indian MahÄ�yÄ�na Buddhology.<br> <br> This controversy first came to my attention when my Sakya khenpo
                      mentioned it in passing in the early '90's.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>............</p>
              <p><br> <br> That is a sems sde prensentation. The presentation in Man ngag sde
                      is very specific.</p>
              <p>N</p>
              <p>............</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br> I am simply reporting what Garab Dorje, Padmasambhava, Shri Singha
                      et al actually say. I don't need to interpret anything.<br> <br> In HÄ«nayÄ�na, Shakyamuni taught arhatship as buddhahood. In
                      MahÄ�yana, he taught that arhatship was not buddhahood, and was
                      inferior to buddhahood. And that in fact, after attaining
                      arhatship, arhats would be roused from their nirodhasamapatti at
                      some point and then they must traverse the paths of stages of
                      MahÄ�yÄ�na. So, was the Buddha lying in HinÄ�yÄ�na when he told his
                      followers that arhatship was it?<br> <br> In VajrayÄ�na, in the Samputa tantra it is clarified that there are
                      three stages of Buddhahood. Two stages of Buddhas who do not
                      recognize all phenomena as being the display of their own wisdom
                      and the thireenth bhumi, Vajradhara, where all phenomena are so
                      recognized. Does this make the Buddha a liar about MahÄ�yÄ�na?<br> <br> In Dzochen, there are enumerated another three stages, three more
                      stages of those who dwell within wisdom, rendering the thirteenth
                      bhumi a lower stage of buddhahood. Does this make the Buddha a liar
                      about VajrayÄ�na?<br> <strong><br> In any event, this notion of "Buddhahood that reverts to the basis
                      [gzhi, not kun gzhi]" as an inferior buddhahood that is not
                      complete is well attested in Dzogchen. It has to be the case
                      because as Garab Dorje points out, all sentient beings in the
                      previous eon attain buddhahood by the end of the eon. This is
                      explicitly stated by Garab Dorje in the commentary I mentioned to
                      above.</strong><br> <br> But to illustrate my point further, the Drikung view is Dzogchen is
                      definitely subordinated. For example, Jigten Sumgon states in
                      Gongcik: “The supreme realization is not touched by the three great
                      ones.” This is echoe of a statement by Gampopoa to his nephew,
                      Gomchung.<br> <br> But I don't during Jigten Sumgon's time Nyingthig was wide spread.
                      At this point in history Nyingma was very much on the decline.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>............</p>
              <p> <br> From the thirteenth bhumi onwards, they are stages of "abiding in
                      wisdom". Presuming one manages to attain the thirteen bhumi, it is
                      unlikely that one's realization will be blocked.<br> <br> N</p>
              <p>............</p>
              <p><br> There are two systems. One in which the sixteen bhumis directly
                      correspond with the thirteen bhumis + three. Another where the
                      bhumis are given as descriptive names for experiences through the
                      four visions.<br> <br> They are both correct explanations.<br> <br> N</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>............</p>
              <p><br> <br> Ok, it is important to understand three things: the general
                      original basis, the reality of the basis, and how ignorance
                      manifests. In addition to that it is necessary to know that Garab
                      Dorje's commentary on the Single Son of the Buddha's tantras
                      supplies a necessary understanding I will address below at the
                      section on the arising of the basis.<br> <br> The Unwritten Tantra (Yi ge med pa describes how the general
                      original basis exists:<br> <br> <span style="font-style: italic;">“There is no object to
                      investigate within the view of self-originated wisdom: nothing went
                      before, nothing happens later, nothing is present now at all.
                      Action does not exist. Traces do not exist. Ignorance does not
                      exist. Mind does not exist. Discriminating wisdom does not exist.
                      Samsara does not exist. Nirvana does not exist. Even vidyÄ� itself
                      does not exist i.e. nothing at all appears in wisdom. That arose
                      from not grasping anything.”</span><br> <br> This is the state of original purity, The Blazing Lamp says:<br> <span style="font-style: italic;">Within initial original
                      purity<br> the nature is like so:<br> not made by anyone, manifesting naturally,<br> the nature is already just so.</span><br> <br> In this state, The Rosary of Pearls states:<br> <span style="font-style: italic;">The mere term delusion cannot be
                      described<br> within the original purity of the initial state,<br> likewise, how can there be non-delusion?<br> Therefore, pure of delusion from the beginning.</span><br> <br> The Heart Mirror states “<span style="font-style: italic;">All
                      phenomena of the basis must be understood as the trio of essence,
                      nature and compassion. All phenomena of the essence must be
                      understood as emptiness. All phenomena of the nature must be
                      understood as luminosity. All phenomena of compassion must be
                      understood as pervading all sentient beings.</span>”<br> <br> So, of course, there must be essence, nature and compassion,
                      timelessly present as the basis. Without these wisdoms, there can
                      be no nirvana and no samsara. We can term these three
                      "sugatagarbha" if we like. Padmasambhava states in the Clear
                      Mirror:<br> <br> <span style="font-style: italic;">Those three wisdoms pervade
                      Samantabhadra and sentient beings down to the tiniest creature
                      without any discrimination of good or bad, high or
                      low.</span><br> <br> Since these three wisdoms are themselves not established in anyway
                      at all, we can be sure we are free from eternalism. Since these
                      three natures always appear, we are free from
                      annihilationism.</p>
              <p><br> <br> In the system of the Dzogchen Nyinghig three causes of ignorance
                      are described -- those three are essence, nature and compassion.
                      This is why there are three ignorances in this system. The system
                      of explanation of Gongpa Zangthal is a little different, with only
                      two ignorances -- we will continue with the Dzogchen Nyinthig
                      system.<br> <br> According to Garab Dorje, prior to the arising of the basis which
                      is latent during the dark eon interval, nevertheless there are
                      traces of affliction and action remaining from the previous eon.
                      Because of these traces, the basis is stirred, the five lights
                      appear and so on (this is why the Dzogcgen doctrine of two
                      different kinds of Buddhahood is critical -- the first, the
                      buddhahood that reverts the basis is the buddhahood asserted by all
                      lower vehicles. The buddhahood that does not revert to the basis is
                      the preserve of only Dzogchen).<br> <br> The Gongpa Zangthal cycle supplies that during the arising of basis
                      there is a neutral awareness (shes pa lung ma bstan) in the basis
                      that does not recognize itself. This non-recognition is the innate
                      ignorance. When this neutral awareness cognizes the five lights
                      there is a dividing line between nirvana and samsara. When a
                      neutral awareness recognizes the appearance of the basis as its own
                      appearances it is is prajñÄ� and is immediately liberated. That is
                      Samantabhadra. A neutral awareness that does not recognize
                      appearances as its own appearances immediately is the imputing
                      ignorance, and samsara begins (again) because subject and object is
                      imputed. This is all very clearly explained in detail in the eleven
                      topics of Dzogchen Nyinthig. This is also clearly explained by
                      Khenpo Ngawang Palzang.</p>
              <p><br> <br> After the basis arises, innate ignorance is first and even
                      Samantabhadra has it. There is period where a neutral awareness
                      does not recognize itself in anyway. That is the innate ignorance.
                      It (the neutral awareness) can only recognize itself through the
                      display of five lights. When it recognizes that display as its own
                      display, then this is the liberation of Samantabhadra without the
                      performance of an iota of virtue. We on the other hand did not
                      recognize these five lights as our own display, and for us, samsara
                      began, without even an particle of non-virtue having been
                      done.<br> <br> According to Dzogchen teachings, all sentient being attain
                      Buddhahood by the end of the eon -- this is very clearly stated by
                      Garab Dorje in the commentary above. But there are two kinds of
                      Buddhahood, and as I said above, there is only Buddhahood that does
                      not revert to the basis, and that is the Buddhahood attained
                      through Dzogchen methods. The Buddhahood of other vehicles reverts
                      to the basis, without the corresponding result.<br> <br> Now then, the reason why we cannot take these metaphors in
                      Uttaratantra literally is that the basis is not Buddhahood. If the
                      basis were Buddhahood, there would be no need for any kind of
                      recognition.<br> <br> In Dzogchen, there is a difference between the basis and the
                      result. The difference is simply vidyÄ� and avidyÄ� and the
                      recognition and non-recognition that comes from those.<br> <br> Further, it is not enough merely to understand the general original
                      basis. One must also understand the human body as a basis.<br> <br> I will not discuss this here since it is not a proper topic.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>......</p>
              <p>p.s. N also said:<br> Anyone who even begins the practice of tögal will achieve full
                      awakening in at most three lifetimes, if not during the bardo of
                      dharmatÄ�.</p>

              <p>As for all sentient beings attaining Buddhahood by the end of a universe cycle, i dunno whether you still remember i wrote about a vision transmission in the old dreamdatum website years ago... Where i was pondering on the question of rebirth and a symbolic vision come into the mindscreen. The vision is of blue background where circular and some broken rings converging onto a central position. This vision seems to suggest what i interprete as the universe having contraction cycle where all beings will eventually spiritually progress towards. Erm ... not to advocate and promote these vision stuffs though...</p>

              <p>Hi AEN,</p>
              <p>I think here the term 'Buddhahood' is the problematic area for interpretation. Namrol seems to be using the term in a very broad way, going for Hinayana Buddhahood, Dzogchen Buddhahood and so forth.</p>
              <p>In tibetan, the term Sang gye (ie Buddhahood) implies the full purification of all latencies (such as obscurations and karmic dispositions etc) and full flowering of enlightened qualities.  It is not applicable to Hinayana Arhathood which has another term (Dra Chom pa, i think)</p>
              <p>In your quote,</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 9px;">But....there are two kinds of buddhahood discussed in Dzogchen; buddhahood that reverts to the cause and the buddhahood that does not revert the cause.</span><br style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 9px;"><br style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 9px;"><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 9px;">Those whose buddhahood was incomplete can still fall into sentient being hood if they do not recognize the arising of the basis as being their own display.</span><br style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 9px;"><br style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 9px;"><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 9px;">According to the commentary on the à½¦à¾²à½¦à¼‹à½‚à½…à½²à½‚à¼‹à½”à½´à¼‹à½¢à¾’à¾±à½´à½‘ by Garab Dorje in the Vima Nyinthig, the basis arises because of traces of latent affliction and action left over from the previous eon. At that time, one either recognizes the stirring of the basis or not.</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Remainder of traces/ latencies cannot be considered to fit the definition of Buddhahood, as i see it.</p>
              <p>It is merely a matter of interpretation. And the tantras (whether Dzogchen / inner tantras) are notoriously difficult to interpret without extensive knowledge and even some cultural and linguistic knowledge.  I do think that this will confuse people more. So to leave it aside would be better.  That is why traditionally, in the Vajrayana, it is said that the teachings should only be given to recipients suitable for it and even then it should be under the guidance of a very qualified teacher.</p>
              <p>Tsultrim Lodro is very learned in the Dzogchen teachings and tantras. I cannot vouch for his realisations but he is immensely respected for his understanding and scholarship in Tibet.  He is also an unrecognised rebirth of Longchen Rabjam.  But due to his modesty, he refused any recognition. Therefore i feel that it is possible to trust in his statement.</p>

              <p>Yeah but what namdrol is saying is that ONLY dzogchen can lead to full buddhahood... so its the elitist kind of statement, like if you are sutrayana, or just doing normal tantra, you can't get irreversible Buddhahood.</p>

              <p>Haha, but i have something to add to that in support of Namrol...</p>
              <p>It has been said by Jigme Phuntsok that eventually all the paths even in the Tibetan schools have to culminate in Dzogchen realisations to complete the path.  Eg, even one of the highest Sakya master, Chogye Trichen maintains the Dzogchen inner practices and view in his personal practice although he has to maintain hefty personal commitments in the practices of Sakya as a lineage holder. </p>
              <p>In the Vajrayana view, even for the Mahayana purists, it is impossible to travel the last part of the path without tantra.  But that is near the end, when the practitioner is almost reaching Buddhahood.</p>
              <p>(*** Jigme Phuntsok, an authority of Dzogchen, himself the fountainhead for spreading the Dzogchen teachings in China after the cultural revolution.  And who is reputed to have completed the full realisations of Dzogchen and displayed a partial rainbow body upon his death, ie massive shrinkage)</p>

              <p>Although it is said that paths <strong>lead to </strong>the same results with varying methods/speed, however, it cannot be taken to mean that each path (to the exclusion of all else) can bring Buddhahood.  It merely means that every path depending on the inclinations of its practitioner is a direction towards Buddhahood.  As the practitioners' conditions mature, it may lead to some other path that he find more suitable at that time.  And this is <strong>not contradicting</strong> the statement that all paths lead to the same Buddhahood.</p>

              <p>good to know. MCK was also pondering about his in his talks. like in Shurangama Sutra's analogy of ore and gold, when u extract the gold from the ore, will the gold become ore again, after another long long time? the sutra say no, but ....so N is saying even if the gold were to become ore again, it's the way it is. go beyond it. nice.</p>
