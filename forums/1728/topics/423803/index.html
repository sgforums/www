              <p>No. There is no rule what time or date a deceased person comes to 'visit' you.</p>
              <p>When you die, depending on your good or bad karma, you can be reborn in these realms:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3 higher realms: human, asura, heaven</p>
              <p>3 lower realms: animals, ghost, hell</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Only if your deceased family member fall into the ghost realm will they 'come back to visit'. </strong>And it is not the case that they 'come back', sometimes it can be that they are too attached that they linger around. That's why sometimes they are being seen. It is all possible.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And if you read my earlier thread, you will know that engaging in a priest to sing the merit to deity, <strong>will not make a person be reborn in the western pure land.</strong></p>
              <p>That person must practice chanting Amituofuo himself and must accumulate the merits and conditions to be reborn in pure land.</p>
              <p>And as a Buddhist, my advice is to engage in Buddhist monks to perform whatever pujas... especially if you want your deceased relative to be reborn in pure land.</p>

              <p>Although there is no rule on the time or date of visit. I was told by a relative and his family member that her grandfather passed away about 20 years ago then, that he spirit came back on the 7th day with obvious signs of visit.</p>

              <p>Seems to me Taoist can only achieve the status of a Deity while cultivating well during a living lifetime but once the person is dead , it's all about how to live well in the hade world while waiting for reborn.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Or at least not to suffer badly in the hade world.  To be bully by the other ghosts or to be wandering lost, hungry and pathetic.</p>

              <p>that is very tough to know.  Either by the age of the taoist priest, the certification and his background, for eg if he is trained in Wudang since a young boy and he is still a Taoist priest at age 60.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Else it will be by word of mouth like a previous family who engaged a Taoist and dreamt of good news from the deceased.  You need to know this family quite well and can trust their words.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you can afford it, get those Taoist from China Wudang mountain. They are properly trained in all the ancient rituals and some grew up there as boys. Destined to be a priest due to karma.</p>

              <p>Sutra on the original Vows &amp; the attainment of merits of the Ksitigabha Bodhisattva<br><br>Shortly thereafter a maidservant in the house bore a son who spoke before he was three days old. Lowering his head and weeping he said to Bright Eyes, The karmic conditions we create during our lives and deaths result in retributions that we ourselves must undergo. I was your mother and have been in darkness for a long time. Since you and I parted I have repeatedly fallen into the great hells. Upon receiving the power of your blessings, I have gained rebirth as a servant.s child with a short lifespan. Thirteen years from now, I will fall into the evil paths again. Do you have some way to free me so that I can avoid them? The maidservant's child answered. I am undergoing retribution for two kinds of karma: killing and slandering. Had I not received the blessings you earned to rescue me from difficulty, I would not yet be released from that karma.<br><br>Sweet Swarnlata's Story from Ian Stevenson<br><br>The story of Swarnlata is characteristic of Stevenson's cases: the young girl's memories began when she was 3, she gave enough information to enable Stevenson to locate the family of the deceased person she remembered (the case was "solved"), and she gave more than 50 specific facts that were verified. But Swarnlata's case was also different from most because her memories did not fade. And this is a sweet case, characterized by love and happy memories rather than by violent death and struggles between castes and families, like in so many other cases.<br><br>Swarnlata Mishra was born to an intellectual and prosperous family in Pradesh in India in 1948. When she was just three years old and traveling with her father past the town of Katni more than 100 miles from her home, she suddenly pointed and asked the driver to turn down a road to "my house", and suggested they could get a better cup of tea there than they could on the road.<br><br>Soon after, she related more details of her life in Katni, all of which were written down by her father. She said her name was Biya Pathak, and that she had two sons. She gave details of the house: it was white with black doors fitted with iron bars; four rooms were stuccoed, but other parts were less finished; the front floor was of stone slabs. She located the house in Zhurkutia, a district of Katni; behind the house was a girl's school, in front was a railway line, and lime furnaces were visible from the house. She added that the family had a motor car (a very rare item in India in the 1950's, and especially before Swarnlata was born). Swarnlata said Biya died of a "pain in her throat", and was treated by Dr. S. C. Bhabrat in Jabalpur. She also remembered an incident at a wedding when she and a friend had difficulty finding a latrine.<br><br>In the spring of 1959, when Swarnlata was 10 years old, news of the case reached Professor Sri H. N. Banerjee, an Indian researcher of paranormal phenomenon and colleague of Stevenson. Banerjee took the notes her father made and traveled to Katni to determine if Swarnlata's memories could be verified.<br><br>Using nothing more than the description that Swarnlata had given, he found the house--despite the house having been enlarged and improved since 1939 when Biya died. It belonged to the Pathak's (a common name in India), a wealthy, prominent family, with extensive business interests. The lime furnaces were on land adjoining the property; the girls school was 100 yards behind the Pathak's property, but not visible from the front.<br><br>He interviewed the family and verified everything Swarnlata had said. Biya Pathak had died in 1939 leaving behind a grieving husband, two young sons, and many younger brothers. These Pathaks had never heard of the Mishra family, who lived a hundred miles away; the Mishra's had no knowledge of the Pathak family.<br><br>The next scene in this story sounds like a plot from Agatha Christie, but is all true, extracted from the Stevenson's tabulations in Swarnlata's published case. In the summer of 1959, Biya's husband, son, and eldest brother journeyed to the town of Chhatarpur, the town where Swarnlata now lived, to test Swarnlata's memory. They did not reveal their identities or purpose to others in the town, but enlisted nine townsmen to accompany them to the Mishar home, where they arrived unannounced.<br><br>Swarnlata immediately recognized her brother and called him "Babu", Biya's pet name for him. Stevenson gives only the barest facts, but I can imagine the emotions ran high at this point. Imagine how Babu felt to be recognized immediately by his dead sister reborn.<br><br>Ten-year-old Swarnlata went around the room looking at each man in turn; some she identified as men she knew from her town, some were strangers to her. Then she came to Sri Chintamini Pandey, Biya's husband. Swarnlata lowered her eyes, looked bashful--as Hindu wives do in the presence of their husbands--and spoke his name. Stevenson says nothing of Sri Pandey's reaction at finding his wife after twenty years<br><br>Swarnlata also correctly identified her son from her past life, Murli, who was 13 years old when Biya died. But Murli schemed to mislead her, and "for almost twenty-four hours insisted against her objections that he was not Murli, but someone else." Murli had also brought along a friend and tried to mislead Swarnlata once again by insisting he was Naresh, Biya's other son, who was about the same age as this friend. Swarnlata insisted just as strongly that he was a stranger.<br><br>Finally, Swarnlata reminded Sri Pandey that he had purloined 1200 rupees Biya kept in a box. Sri Pandey admitted to the truth of this private fact that only he and his wife had known.</p>

              <p>We are not only related through matter, but by the vast storehouse of karmic seeds and latent imprints, tendencies, and memories, known as the Alaya Vijnana or the 8th consciousness.</p>
              <p>This is why sometimes when you glance someone, he seems likeable, familiar, or sometimes unlikeable.</p>
              <p>As my Master say, if we meet someone and have a good impression of him/her on first glance, and he/she did the same thing (glance at you and have a good impression), you had at least 6 months of strong relation with him/her in some form in previous lives.</p>
              <p>By the way, consciousness is not matter, but in Buddhism, consciousness is also not a soul - it is an impermanent<em> stream</em> of consciousness arising according to conditions, and this stream and tendencies is what continues - there is no fixed, unchanging entity. Rather than saying there is 'A Consciousness', it is more accurate to say that there is 'Consciousness-1, Consciousness-2, Consciousness-3' succeeding each other according in lightning speed every moment according cause and effect, and yet even this is not quite complete because each moment of consciousness is also empty of independent existence and cannot be established.</p>
              <p>Seeing this, Consciousness is realized as not being a knower or experiencer or controller or self or agent (there is no perceiver apart from the perceived) - rather, it is empty of self and independent existence, is a manifestation that dependently originates. This is the realization of Anatta and Emptiness, and this realization liberates.</p>
