              I am local Singaporean. Race? Human. Ethnic group is Chinese but my Chinese not that good. 
              
              Sidetrack a bit. The concept of race has no biological basis at all. Our so-called skin colours aee all different shades of the same pigment called melanin.

              <p>yeah, indeed a good point! even now mating of two totally
              different species to produce a new species is out of the question,
              i think. u cannot mate a cat and a dog. they think that the split
              happen long time ago. but i think even now we cannot produce a
              "real" split....the example of the mule that is the product of
              horse and donkey is just like european human marrying an asian to
              produce an eurasian. as their geno are similar.   in short u
              cannot mix/mate two different geno. not now, then not before
              too(?). hmm.</p>
              <p>in term of mutation like example when a species no longer needed
              their tail in their living, and through time, they become shorter
              is ok with me. </p>

              <p>I do not believe that cats and dogs split longer. I believe cats have always been cats and dogs have always been dogs. They were created to reproduce after their kind, just like the Bible says. You can mix tiger and lion because they are of the same "cat" kind. I have no problem with mutations at all. Mutations are copy mistakes in DNA. They introduce errors in pre-existing DNA but this does not answer the question of where the DNA comes from.</p>

              <p>Note that the magic words used by evolution scientists are "appear, arise" but they do not explain the mechanisms as to how. Such words simply gloss over the insurmountable obstacles from nonliving matter to living things, from simple cells to complex organisms. Time, being the hero of the plot, is simply credited with the powers to do the impossible, given enough time.</p>

              If it is a mattet of priority, then why was it made into an issue of relevance and then set aside as irrelevant? It is one thing to say that finding the cause is not first priority, it is quite another to say that finding or knowing the cause is irrelevant and does not matter anyway. Can you point out the exact verse in the Bible that tells people not to be smart? BTW, I think your understanding of omniscient is off. If being enlightened means being omniscient, then how can there even be ignorance? Did people start off with ignorance or enlightenment?

              <p>1. I am aware of the main Buddhist division between the Theravada and Mahayana, the question is, which version is what the Buddha actually teach? I think the Theravada Buddhism sees itself as closest to what Buddha taught, though I believe this is complicated by the fact that what Buddha taught was only written down 500 years later. The Mahayana actually came a few hundred years later. And the issue is not whether a view is extreme, but whether the view is true. Problem is that we too easily attached a negative connotation to the word "extreme" and frown upon it.</p>
              <p>2. A person who forgot he has his glasses on is not deluded, but forgetful. There is a big difference between being deluded and being forgetful.</p>
              <p>3. Pure Land Buddhism is in the same division of Mahayana, and thus I think point 1 above applies here as well.</p>

              <p>In what sense is asking about the issue of origins a stupid question? Or a stupid issue for that matter? If that is really the case, then it must be concluded that a lot of scientists are asking stupid questions and answering stupid questions.</p>
              <p>Both verses that you quoted from the Bible have nothing to do with what we are talking about. The first verse is talking about how riches can deter someone from seeking God. The second verse is saying that God works differently from what the world thinks. The world thinks that great accomplishments must be done through great display of feats and marvel. But God uses the suffering servant on a despised cross to accomplish the great feat of salvation.</p>
              <p>But on what basis do you conclude that there is no need to know about origins? Surely the fact that this question is often asked belies its importance? Again it can be suspect that the refusal to answer may not be because there is no need to know as claimed, but because one doesn't know in fact.</p>

              <p>yeah, they/scientists are "extra curriculum" in Buddhism. u know who ur parent or ancestors are already, their name, then? it doesn't make u a better person. so i was saying, Buddha rather teach you to be a better person. knowledge is different from wisdom and well-being. knowing to swim, does not make one a great swimmer, and if they have no practice or jump into the water to swim. moreover, know to swim is one thing, but do u help others? Buddha is teaching one to swim and save people!</p>

              <p><br>yes, forgetful also can, no different that true nature is "originally" present. but one is blind to see it even, when one is told, IS deluded.</p>

              <p>If you tell the person that the glasses is on him and he still denies it, I don't think he is deluded, I think he is crazy! Again one can be deluded but not crazy.</p>
              <p>I think the issue is also whether the teaching itself is true. A church pastor can be "authorised" to teach the Bible but he can still teach falsehoods which can be exposed by a "lay" person who reads his Bible diligently.</p>
              <p>And in the case of Christianity, the messenger IS the message! The teachings of Jesus cannot be separated from His person. Apart from Christ there is nothing to teach. One cannot teach the truth about Christianity and ignore the person of Christ, though you can do that with Buddhism.</p>

              <p>I read this thread, I shake my head...</p>
              <p>BroInChirst, I see your interest to know more, but your micro scruntiny is going around in circles.</p>
              <p>sinweiy, and other Dhamma bros., remember that before Buddha gave an exposition, he will survey the audience before he expounds. For this case, keep on the surface or stick to one topic. Because BroInChrist have so many doubts and queries in his head; and we move on to another concept, making it worst.</p>
              <p>So many points are taken out of context by BroInChrist making it "wrong".</p>
