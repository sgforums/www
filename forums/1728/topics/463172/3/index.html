              <p>I certainly do not think that you are using Buddhist concepts to

              quote from the Bible? Anyway my point is that one should not take
              issue with me quoting Bible verses, just as I do not take issue
              with Buddhists quoting Buddhist teachings by various monks. (Though
              I would admit that having to read long passages of cut-&amp;-paste
              Buddhist teachings can be quite a daunting task!) Surely It can't
              be the case that my quoting Bible verses got no point but your

              <p>at first the lower realms was not suppose to be there. but because of ignorance, afflictions, greed and all, the lower realms start to manifest. the heavenly devas came to earth as u read, "created" the human realms, then with folly karma, created the animal realms, with greed karma created the ghosts realm, and with hatred karma created the hell realms. all sort of <em>sins/karma</em>, killing, stealing, lust, lying arises. however, there's a sutra where things will "return" back to heavenly realms. as we have End of the whole Universe (which is 1000000000 universes in all). it will start when hell realm are saved, then the ghost realm, the animal realm and the human realm will also be saved and reborn into some higher heavenly realm of light and above. but way before that we also have a smaller chaos or "end days" where a group of good people will escape to some remote place to start life over, and then after that that's also the next coming of Buddha and by then the human on earth will live like devas/gods, very happy era indeed. sound familar isn't it?</p>
              <p> we are not the only universe, there are countless of them like the sands on the beach said Buddha. we are in agreement with science. universes are born and die just like the 4 seasons. AEN's late master/teacher used to study bible, like how many cm thick? but after studing the massive Buddha sutras, he said that the bible is like kindergarden book. not detail enough, too general. the Buddhadharma a lot in depth.</p>

              <p>So before there was ignorance, what was there?</p>
              <p>A return back to the "heavenly realms"?</p>
              <p>Yes it does sound familiar to the Bible, which speaks of a perfect creation (no sin, no suffering, no death), then man's rebellion against God (which brought in sin, suffering and death), then God's redemptive-salvaton plan, and finally the restoration of all things (no more sin, suffering and death). In fact, I think this general idea is rather universal and present in most religions. I believe this is because of the Tower of Babel incident, the point in human history when the languages of man were confused, each language group separated from the others but each retained the memory of the former times, but got embellished over time. I believe the Bible retained the true account of what human history.</p>

              <p>I think it is fallacious to conclude that because a small thumb drive can contain vast amount of data, therefore a small seed can contain the entire universe. One is talking about packing wallops of standardised same kind of stuff i.e. information bits on a chip due to technology advancement (but there will be a limit), the other is talking about time, space, matter. We are talking about completely different things. The question is, before the univese can exist what seed are we talking about?</p>

              <p>1. Yes, Buddha lived about 500 years before Christ, so in that sense he preceded Christianity. But since Christ was God-incarnate, in that sense Christ preceded Buddha. In fact, the Bible teaches that Christ is the Creator of the universe i.e. God Himself. When was the teachings of Buddha first put into writing? If I am not wrong it was about 500 years after he died. The NT, on the other hand, was written well before the first century ended, less than 60 years after Jesus' resurrection.</p>
              <p>2. On what basis you say the Tower of Babel incident is fiction? How is it not realistic compared to narrate exploits of Buddha? The issue is not about the amount of detail, since one can babble a lot and still be nonsense. The issue is whether the contents supplied is correct and true.</p>

              <p>2. As mentioned, a better term to use would be that the universe and all that is in it is contingent i.e. such things do not exist in and of themselves but have a beginning and thus requires a cause. In short, all contingent beings are dependent upon something else for their existence. However, the difference is that Christianity does not teach that everything is contingent, while Buddhism does. Christianity teaches that you cannot have infinite contingent beings, that there is one necessary being as the logical first uncaused cause, God.</p>
              <p>3. The issue is not whether one accepts the claim that there is no inherent existence, but whether there is good reasons to believe the claim is true. The mere acceptance of a claim does not make it true.</p>
              <p>4. What conditions can only be experienced by the Who, isn't it? If there is no Who then there is no What to experience.</p>

              <p>What you have is squares in circle, still there is distinct square and circle. It still proved my point that it is impossible to have a squared circle. Even your imagination is limited by what is a square and a circle. You cannot conceive of a squared circle. It is a logical impossibility. Just like you cannot be a married bachelor.</p>
              <p>The image of God is "imprinted" in every human being. Which is why it is wrong to take another's person life without authority and right.</p>

              <p>Jesus was a pious Jew, yet there were many things taught by the religious leaders which Jesus rejected or criticised. These leaders went beyond the OT and enacted many laws and rules that burdened the people, turning God's law into legalism. The Jews failed to recognise Jesus as the promised Messiah, and many today are still looking for the One to come. They knew the Bible taught a suffering servant and a coming King, but failed to see that Jesus was both. Kind of a fallacy of reasoning that it is either/or but not both/and.</p>

              <p>1) Yes, sentient beings cannot have birth without a previous instance of consciousness.<br><br>Therefore there are three conditions for birth: father, mother, consciousness in Buddhism. Consciousness is not an entity, but a stream or arising and re-arising, a mindstream... each of us have or rather is a distinct mindstream, but that is just speaking conventionally.<br><br>But we do not see 'design' involved.<br><br>2) You don't get it... because you still think there must be an experiencer apart from experience. My point is, experience is always occurring without experiencer. Thinking happens without thinker. Hearing is occurring without hearer. Even right now, there is only reading without a reader. Seeing without a seer. There is only ever experience without an experiencer. Later on I can recall seeing a flower and I can even say "I saw a flower" but knowing fully well that is merely conventional parlance for communication, there is actually no seer apart from the sight 'flower', no actual self persisting from one moment to another.<br><br>The notion of a self being distinct from experience can be seen through with some investigation just like the notion of a car-ness distinct from its parts, e.g. engine, window, wheels etc can be seen through.<br><br>The direct experience of this is gapless, direct, and self-releasing - i.e. no distance between a seer and a seen, no vantage point, boundless freedom, intense aliveness and intimacy and clarity in every single experience because there is no 'I' at a center to be separate from any experience, nor any sense of a boundary or circumference, mere experience appearing that is self-knowing, self-felt and releasing moment to moment.</p>
