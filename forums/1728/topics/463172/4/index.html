              <p>1) Yes, sentient beings cannot have birth without a previous instance of consciousness.<br><br>Therefore there are three conditions for birth: father, mother, consciousness in Buddhism. Consciousness is not an entity, but a stream or arising and re-arising, a mindstream... each of us have or rather is a distinct mindstream, but that is just speaking conventionally.<br><br>But we do not see 'design' involved.<br><br>2) You don't get it... because you still think there must be an experiencer apart from experience. My point is, experience is always occurring without experiencer. Thinking happens without thinker. Hearing is occurring without hearer. Even right now, there is only reading without a reader. Seeing without a seer. There is only ever experience without an experiencer. Later on I can recall seeing a flower and I can even say "I saw a flower" but knowing fully well that is merely conventional parlance for communication, there is actually no seer apart from the sight 'flower', no actual self persisting from one moment to another.<br><br>The notion of a self being distinct from experience can be seen through with some investigation just like the notion of a car-ness distinct from its parts, e.g. engine, window, wheels etc can be seen through.<br><br>The direct experience of this is gapless, direct, and self-releasing - i.e. no distance between a seer and a seen, no vantage point, boundless freedom, intense aliveness and intimacy and clarity in every single experience because there is no 'I' at a center to be separate from any experience, nor any sense of a boundary or circumference, mere experience appearing that is self-knowing, self-felt and releasing moment to moment.</p>

              <p>1. Again whose consciousness are we talking about? Whose mindstreams? And you mean you do not see design in living things? That the eyes are designed for sight? The heart designed to pump blood etc etc? How much intelligent design is needed to even give a person an artificial limb that can barely do what a normal arm can do? To deny design in the face of the evidence is IMO a irrational thing.</p>
              <p>2. It's not that I don't get it, I just find it illogical. You have yet to demonstrate how one can experience something without an experiencer. It is logically absurd to say that there is no writer writing what is being written for the purpose of letting a non-existent reader do some reading. I think it is contingent things taken to absurdity, a reductio ad absurdum situation. Of course you can take all these as mere mental exercises to be performed, like a thought experiment to see the car-ness apart from the parts, or where is the "I" when you take a human apart. But that's all there is to it, thought experiments. In a sense, almost anything can "happen" when it is mere thought experiments. But then it comes to reality. If I walk into a door, it hurts. Not just conventionally saying it hurts as a parlance of communication but literally! And if anyone think it does not then perhaps he should try walking into a door. Of course one can do more thought experiment and say the door does not have inherent existence. But then when the thought is banished the door is really there, and the blood is flowing.</p>

              <p>What you have is squares in circle, still there is distinct square and circle. It still proved my point that it is impossible to have a squared circle. Even your imagination is limited by what is a square and a circle. You cannot conceive of a squared circle. It is a logical impossibility. Just like you cannot be a married bachelor.</p>
              <p>The image of God is "imprinted" in every human being. Which is why it is wrong to take another's person life without authority and right.</p>

              <p><br>that's what i said, cannot. imagination is another thing.</p>
              <p>indeed logic is in Buddhism too. we said when we plant an apple seed, you only can get an apple tree, no other type of fruit tree. reap what u planted. another example is no matter how you cook sand, u cannot get cooked rice. i think possibility has it's limit. squared circle is one kind of geometry logic. married bachelor is word logic(?). things like shrinking the entire universe into a mustard seed as an example was written in our text, even when we think it's not possible.</p>

              <p>1. There is no 'whose' mindstream, just many unique mindstreams. Mindstreams are empty of self. <br><br>There is no designer. There is just a conglomerate of body parts that form a function. Evidence shows evolution, not design.<br><br>2. What does getting hurt have anything to do with a self?

                          by trying to isolate the inherent existence of the person
                          in relation to the parts the body/mind.<span>  </span>For
                          purposes of one's meditation, the parts of the body/mind
                          include everything related to what one thinks of as one's
                          self.<span>  </span>It can be any physical, mental, moral or
                          psychological phenomenon whatsoever.<span>  </span>We might think
                          of ourselves as a body, a mind, set of memories, or a
                          collection of character values, or something that
                          essentially includes all of these.<span>  </span>The reasonings
                          go like this.<span>  </span>With a firm sense of this inherent
                          existence in mind, we try to isolate it – is the
                          inherent existence of the self exactly the same as the
                          parts of the body/mind?<span>  </span>Is it different from the

                          inherently the same as, or different from, the parts.<span>  </span> The other steps of the reasonings are valuable to go into
                          because they keep the meditation from being purely an
                          intellectual exercise.<span>  </span>We might, for example, truly
                          feel that the self <strong>owns</strong> the body/mind.<span>  </span>This
                          is the conception to get at, even though it is logically
                          entailed by the self being different from the body/mind.<span>  </span> Once all the reasonings are gone through in depth and the
                          inherent existence of the self is not found anywhere,
                          this can upset one's conception of the way things are.<span>  </span> At first it is disorienting and perhaps scary.<span>  </span>Later,
                          it can be the source of great joy.</span></p>

              <p>From someone deeply realized:<br><br><br> "Dan Berkow, PhD" &lt;berkowd<br> Re: Zenbob/interbeing<br> <br> Dan:  Interbeing (as I've typically heard Thich Naht Hahn translated<br> into English) means that no thing exists on its own.  This is a<br> restatement of the Buddhist teaching of dependent origination,<br> sometimes termed "interdependent origination".  Therefore,<br> no thing exists as a separate thing.  At the same time, the<br> appearance<br> of different qualities can arise with no difficulty, although<br> these appareances and qualities are actually in constant flux<br> if observed closely.  So what is it that is existing in<br> "interbeing"?  Not a thing can be said to be existing,<br> as anything that is named is dependent on other things existing,<br> into infinity.  So who is the "you" who has "your pain" and the<br> "me"<br> who has "my pain"?  These entities, according to<br> "interbeing", aren't there in any sense as a discreet entity.  The<br> sensation of pain arises, but no one "has" it.<br> <br> Empathy is a<br> resonation of vibration, not a feeling-state of one separate<br> entity toward another.  There is pain "over there" and pleasure<br> "over here" - but whose pain and pleasure is it?  The apprehension<br> of interbeing leads to an unimaginable and unspeakable Infinity<br> that<br> is capable of indefinite flux and eternal stillness<br> simultaneously.<br> In the midst of this Infinity, you and I converse, words emanating<br> from "here" are heard "there" and vice versa.  The Void is alive<br> and resonating.  It is indeed a marvelous unbounded symphony<br> in which every note has its place in the song, and the song<br> arises as a simultaneous unsplit melody, every "this" resonating<br> with every "that".<br> <br> -- Love --  Dan<br><br><br>.....................<br><br><br> Dan: Indeed.<br> <br> The external reality is constructed<br> by the internal observer, and<br> the internal observer couldn't<br> self-perceive or construct "its"<br> perception except in contrast/relation<br> to external reality. As each<br> is needed to assume the other,<br> any inherent reality to them<br> dissolves when the "middle<br> way" is attended to. Thought-memory<br> and emotional-sensory processes<br> construed as reactions to external beings<br> and forces or internal states and needs are <br> dependent on the inner-outer<br> scheme of reality, so they have<br> no place to stand. <br> <br> *Truly* there is no <br> external or internal,<br> yet there is the appearance of<br> external and internal through<br> mutual arising and co-construction.<br> Hence, language, culture, families,<br> lives being lived, deaths being<br> died, places to go,<br> things to do.<br> <br> The intriguing question here is:<br> "how can this appearance of co-constructed<br> 'interbeing' appear?"<br> There is no "where" for it to appear, and<br> any "how" is simply a construction<br> arising within and from the appearance<br> itself.<br> <br> So, the answer is: poof! like this!<br> <br> Yet it's this very "poof" in which
                      "they"<br> seem to appear, in which "they" aren't!<br> <br> So, as you say, "pop" and "drop" -<br> (that has a much better ring to it<br> than, say, "poop" and "droop" ;-)<br> <br> Splash,<br> a frog jumps in the old pond.<br> (haiku)<br> <br> Plop, plop<br> fizz, fizz<br> <br> oh, what a relief<br> it izz.<br> <br> (old alkaseltzer commercial).<br> <br> Love,<br> Dan</p>

              <p>indeed logic is in Buddhism too. we said when we plant an apple
              seed, you only can get an apple tree, no other type of fruit tree.
              reap what u planted. another example is no matter how you cook
              sand, u cannot get cooked rice. i think possibility has it's limit.
              squared circle is one kind of geometry logic. married bachelor is
              word logic(?). things like shrinking the entire universe into a
              mustard seed as an example was written in our text, even when we
              think it's not possible.</p>

              I do not think you would succeed in imagining a squared circle either. Anyway, as the Bible says, God created living things to reproduce after their kinds. This is why you do not get an orange fron an apple tree. This is also why evolution is false. All this is by God's divine design. Nothing is left to undirected natural causes.

              <p>Christianity is not incompatible with current scientific thinking, it is only incompatible with popularly accepted "scientific" thinking on the subject of origins.

              <p>Even the link is not proven between ape and man, it doesn't mean that it is not a baseless theory. The theory of evolution has many implications and is the basis for many other branch sciences like Genetics and so forth. So, you cannot dispel the entire theory of evolution just because there is no direct link between ape and man. </p>
              <p>The Buddha taught reincarnation via his teachings on karma. Anyway, there is already a pervalent belief system on reincarnation in ancient indian society. However, he redefine reasons for getting out of the vicious cycle of death and rebirth. The Hindus believe it is so that they get to become one with their God(s). Buddha was a revolutionary teacher who taught in minute detail, the reasons of what compells us to take uncontrollable rebirths and why and how to get out of this cyclic existence. He taught on many levels to suit the audience of different listeners. These became the major schools of Buddhism that exists today. </p>

              <p>So you are agreeing that Buddha did not teach reincarnation and in fact rejected it? And what does the knowledge that our cells can renew and repair themselves (again this testify to an intelligent designer) have anything to do with rebirth?</p>

              <p>oh, no wonder, from a documentry i saw, they say Lucy where more 2 legged and non-ape like, so i was thinking that Lucy was more human like compare to the four legged(?) ape. but what ever, i also not interested,  if she is ape-like, then we skip this to the next that is more human-like. as long as i agreed that there's still a missing link and a little change/mutation/"evolving" in body/bone structure/skin color is ok due to location and different habits.  yes?</p>
              <p>Buddha never teach yes, but also never rejected reincarnation, as there's still karma. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">karma is the cause of reincarnation. so long as one has not reached an arahat stage, they still undergo endless reincarnation. rebirth is more like becoming again</span>, stream of consciousness, <span style="line-height: 1.231;">cycles in nature, continuum. nothing is fixed unchanging. hinduism thought that their god was unchanging, but Buddha said no. </span></p>

              <p>dunno, rejecting reincarnation in some zazen school is a skill in mean(?) to directly jump into a higher level. though if jump wrongly, can result into nullism. </p>

              <p>That's the problem with evolution. The evidence is so scanty that evolutionists are desperate to make a big issue out of a few pieces of bones. It makes for a great story with lots of money in it. It will usually last for a while so that they can milk it for a while. And then when it is finally revealed as just an ape, they call it still a relative of humans and look for the next thing to hype on.</p>

              <p>So if Buddha never teach reincarnation, yet you claimed that he never rejected reincarnation, then wouldn't your belief in reincarnation be a belief resting on silence?</p>
