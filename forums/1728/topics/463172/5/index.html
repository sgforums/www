              <p>That's the problem with evolution. The evidence is so scanty
              that evolutionists are desperate to make a big issue out of a few
              pieces of bones. It makes for a great story with lots of money in
              it. It will usually last for a while so that they can milk it for a
              while. And then when it is finally revealed as just an ape, they
              call it still a relative of humans and look for the next thing to
              hype on.</p>

              <p>Holy cow, someone posted a link to <a href="http://throwawayyourtv.com/2006/04/kirk-cameron-evolution-zone.html">this video</a> in a comment and you just have to see it. It’s Kirk Cameron and Ray 
              Comfort “debunking” evolution in the most hilariously ridiculous thing 
              you may have ever seen. Funniest of all is that they start it out by 
              saying that they’re going to be interviewing people about evolution and 
              you’re supposed to notice how they use words like “possibly” and “we 
              think” and then finally “I’m not an expert”. Why is that funny? Because 
              the people they’re interviewing <em>aren’t experts</em>, they’re just 
              random people they found somewhere, most of whom are as ignorant of 
              evolution as the hosts. But apparently it’s suspicious that random 
              people who know nothing about evolution don’t speak with the certainty 
              of experts or claim to be experts. Well that proves it, I’m convinced. 
              This is a bit like going to an art school and asking them how the 
              internal combustion engine works, edit it down to all the responses 
              where people say things about it based on ignorance, and then saying, 
              “See, it should be obvious that the internal combustion engine is 
              impossible.” 100% pure idiocy.</p>
              <p>There are lots of outright lies in the video as well. For instance, 
              they say of Lucy that “nearly all experts agree that Lucy was just the 
              skeleton of a 3 foot tall chimpanzee.” Really? I’d love for them to find
               just <em>one</em> expert – by which I mean an actual paleo-anthropologist
               – who claims that Lucy was just a 3 foot tall chimpanzee. They say 
              Neanderthal man was a creature “whose famous skeleton found in France 
              over 50 years ago was that of an old man who suffered from arthritis.” 
              Yes, these people are in fact clueless enough to believe that there is 
              only one fossil of Homo neanderthalensis; in fact, there are dozens of 
              them. I’ll give this video 850 milli-Hovinds on the creationist 
              stupidity scale.</p>

              <p>I see. Neanderthal is man-like but they are not human, there are clearly distinguishing features between human (as in homo sapiens) and the neanderthals. Neanderthals share a common ancestry with the homo sapiens, but the neanderthals died out later. Either way, Neanderthals have <strong>never </strong>been considered 'human ancestors'... they are a different evolutionary branch from the Homo Erectus. Neanderthals are however considered to be as or in fact slightly more intelligent than the homo sapiens (they have slightly larger brains than us).<br><br>I read one article some time ago, here's something about why they disappeared from the face of Earth, part of their decline is because "<span id="intelliTxt">the base of the Neanderthal tongue was positioned 
                      higher in the throat, crowding the mouth somewhat. As a result, 
                      Neanderthal speech would most likely have been slow-paced and nasalized.
                       "... ...</span>"<span id="intelliTxt">although Neanderthals did have the ability to 
                                      speak, they were capable of articulating only a smaller number of 
                                      phonemes. Jared Diamond described this limitation using the following 
                                      example: imagine how many words you could say if the only sounds you 
                                      were able to make were a, u, c, p. Imagine trying to say "Trinity 
                                      College is a fine place to work." All you could say were something like 
                                      "Capupa Cappap up a cap capupap."</span> (also see: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o589CAu73UM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o589CAu73UM</a>)<br><br>And also there is a curious fact that some European and Asian races (not all) have a few percentage (1 to 4) of Neaderthal DNA in them due to cross-mixing tens of thousands of years ago. Chinese is included in those races so I'm probably a bit neanderthal and mostly homo sapien myself.<br><br><br>See <a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/Neanderthals-were-too-smart-to-survive-15264.shtml">http://news.softpedia.com/news/Neanderthals-were-too-smart-to-survive-15264.shtml</a></p>

              <p>By the way you can also say Neanderthals are human, as they are, by definition... but they are still different species.<br><em><br> <br> Both Homo Sapien and Homo Neanderthal are humans.

              <p>Let's say there's this species of animal we call "A" that lived 10 million years ago. Over the years this species slowly changed and 5 million years ago groups of them eventually differ from each other enough that you can no longer call them species A any more, and thus we have species b and c and maybe even d.</p>

              <p>Hawking is a physicist, he thinks of the universe in models. Our understanding of the universe is already limited by our senses. For example, light can be described by drawing a wave (to show frequency and stuff), a particle (basics in quantum physics), or even a straight line (to explain law of reflection). So which one of this is it? The truth is, a photon is what it is.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">We see it as light because that is how sight works in animals, all other ways of thinking about it are models. </span></p>
              <p>He thinks of God (the creator) as a model as well. A model that tries to explain how the universe is formed. The laws of gravity allow spontaneous creation, therefore Hawking thinks that God is an unnecessary model to explain this phenomenon.</p>

              <p>I actually took out a few sentences in my original reply because going into species Z4 is very tiring to read, so yes species b will split off into species b1, b2 and e-what-have-you. Is the original b still around? Well most species do change over time, but those we find to not have changed much we name these creatures "living fossils". Also, evolution is constant so yes it is a smooth transition. We simply point out a few because their differences are significant enough that we have to draw a line and give them a new classification as a separate species rather than call them "species a version 20382"</p>

              <p>Yet to speak of attachment and ignorance and attaining knowledge and detachment while negating the notion of Self, is precisely what I find to be most incoherent and inconsistent. See how you cannot avoid talking about "we", "you" or "I" i.e. self. Calling it conventional truths is mere language tools is IMO not a good excuse at all.</p>

              <p>erm still seem like u have not understood not-self...<span style="line-height: 1.231;">self is on changing, hence we negate a fixed self. to us, we are just emotions coming together. anger is just anger. happy is just happy. etc. other than the changing emotions, there's nothing else per se. also most considering rebirth, at one life u can be this and on the next that, changing and changing, in different location, act and time, etc. </span><strong style="line-height: 1.231;">if u are an actor, is the role you are acting the real you, every time u change a new role?</strong><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> no. </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">the "you" u are thinking now is not the real you.</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> when u truely understood non-self/emptiness, then u can talk about "you".  </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">so don't be so attached. but u reject rebirth, so no use explaining...</span></p>

              <p>BroInChrist: 1. Yes, although if you want to go even further you can say man evolved from fish-like creatures. Or heck, microbial lifeforms. 2. You already know of them and decided they're not enough for you. I doubt I can convince you otherwise. I do agree with your last statement though.</p>
              <p>sinweiy: Since it's mindstreams that move from one living being to another anyway, I don't think this is a problem. The capacity to reason and develop morality is surely limited to the kind of thinking capacity a living being posesses, so I'm sure it's possible to fall again and again down the realms of rebirth.</p>

              <p>? u mean i think that human can't reborn into lower realm? or higher realms cannot reborn into lower realms? i am fine if the transition is rebirth, but by mean of mutation, like an animal 'giving birth' to a human, i am far-fetched. as there are causes of rebirth in the different realms in the suttas.</p>
