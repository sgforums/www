              <p>There is a messenger, and there is a message. As an audience, what is of paramount importance? If we revered the messenger too, is it not idol worship? Not that it is wrong, but the message is of paramount importance. (aka the teachings)</p>

              <p>There are so many things to find out. Buddha is concerned with how we can get out of samsara (your analogy : go to heaven) The issue of origins (I am speculating) may not be so simple and it does not in any way help us in getting out of samsara. Not stupid questions, but it may raise even more questions, and at the end of the day, does not in any way help us with salvation.</p>

              <p>i disagree, i think he's plain stubborn, refuse to look up/within. although, since Buddhanature is within, and it's not an object and not easy to decern, the glasses analogy is not suitable in the sense that one can touch it.  </p>
              <p>in Buddhism, Buddha states, "Those who see the Dharma, sees the (real) Buddha." and if u do not discern the Dharma, no matter how close u are with Buddha, u do not see the real Buddha.</p>

              <p>i think we are also just wanting to clarify for other Buddhists as well. so others will not misunderstand the dharma in a Buddhist forum. maybe u just followed recently, i think most of the questions are pretty general, not so chim as yet. i see a few including me, had gone thru xtianism before converting to Buddhism.  </p>

              <p>I have observed that Buddhists generally like to answer a question of knowledge with a moral slant, but this merely sidesteps the question. The quest for knowledge should not be confuse with the building of one's moral character. Yes, it does not make you a better person to know that maybe your ancestor is a warrior in China. It does not make you more honest or reliable as a person. But that's never the intention of such knowledge anyway. Yes, knowledge and wisdom are two different but related things. You can't be wise if you have no knowledge! It's one thing to live a good and upright life, but if that is complemented by a coherent and rational worldview that would even be better. So it is not a false dilemma of either/or, but both/and.</p>

              <p>A rebellious son can say that his parents are redundant to him and that he can live without his parents. But without his parents he would not even be around and alive in the first place to be able to say those rebellious words. Get it?</p>

              <p>There are so many things to find out. Buddha is concerned with how we can get out of samsara (your analogy : go to heaven) The issue of origins (I am speculating) may not be so simple and it does not in any way help us in getting out of samsara. Not stupid questions, but it may raise even more questions, and at the end of the day, does not in any way help us with salvation.</p>

              <p>1. No offence, but I think we should try to refrain from arguing for argument's sake.</p>
              <p>2. Re the messenger and the message, I am saying that in the case of Christianity, the messenger IS the message. As to revering the messenger, it depends on who the messenger is. Since Christ is God, He deserves worship and there is no issue of idol worship at all.</p>
              <p>3. The question of origins is relevant because what we are today is a result of what happened at the beginning. Buddhism would bury the "origins" of death and suffering  in the countless rebirths that people go through. Christianity would explain that there was a perfect creation marred by sin which brought in suffering and death. Knowing the cause is often the most effective way to introduce a remedy. The question of origins helps us to make sense of many things, even the need for salvation.</p>

              <p>Wouldn't it be just as correct to say that Buddhists are stubborn too? I think we should refrain from such ad hominem remarks. Having said that, we need to be able to evaluate teachings of religious leaders. I am sure you would agree with this. Lastly, when asked by His disciples to who God to them Jesus answered, "If you have seen Me, you have seen the Father." In other words, Jesus was telling them that God is talking to them in the flesh! </p>

              <p>I think I have stated my purpose here earlier. I was drawn to this forum because of the thread about Buddhist concepts analysed in a Christian website. While it can be claimed that the Christian has wrong ideas of Buddhism I also saw that it was also true that the Buddhist has wrong ideas of Christianity. And thus I decided to participate to clarify and defend the Christian position, and in doing so also offer a critique of the Buddhist position in a manner of fair comment and debate, without malice or ill-intent.</p>
