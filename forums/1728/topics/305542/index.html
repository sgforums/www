              <p>I have long wanted to express my views on this topic myself from a Buddhist perspective. Perhaps when I have done more research on it and get to understand more about buddhist teachings, I would post it down here.</p>
              <p>One thing that we should all understand is, based on my limited understanding, homosexual people are very much different from what we call sexual perverts or psychopaths.They need love and can give love too.</p>
              <p>I also share the same views in that hetereosexual people have the same needs as homosexual people too, as listed by bohiruci:</p>
              <p>1. engaging in carnal desire</p>
              <p>2. wish for procreation, or</p>
              <p>3. possession of opposite sex.</p>
              <p>However I wish to add another one: Need for true love from a life partner or any type of relationship.</p>
              <p>In any kind of romantic relationship, emotional commitment is very important. If homosexuals practise casual sex or adultery (if marriage for them is legalised in SG), the consequences will be the same as that of heterosexuals.</p>

              <p>God or no God, it is no good to go against nature. Example; China using the rivers waters to å�—æ°´åŒ—æŽ‰ï¼Œand the Three Gouges Dam project, it had a lot of enviromental effects like floodings, erosion and other unimaginable problems etc..</p>
              <p>In the beginning, Adam is lonely, someone created Eve. Male and female, period. Now another group wants male n male, female n female, and someone gives them or created Aids...another classic case of going against nature and cause &amp; effect <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
