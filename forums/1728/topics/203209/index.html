But we may have different understandings from them. Guan Yin to us is not a deity or a goddess, but a Bodhisattva (Pu2 Sa4), someone embarking on the path to Enlightenment, while having great compassion to liberate and lead sentient beings to Enlightenment.<br><br>Guan Yin Bodhisattva is also setting a great example for all Bodhisattva practitioners of Mahayana Buddhism. There are many different Bodhisattvas (Pu2 Sa4) in Buddhism, each of them representing a quality that we need to cultivate to attain Buddhahood. Guan Yin represents Great Compassion. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

I thought you were asking whether Guan Yin is from Buddhism or Taoist.<br><br>In this case, I must say, it depends.

For example the famous Si Ma Lu Guan Yin temple is also a Folks Tradition temple, it is not a Buddhist monastery. Also 'Niang Niang' should not be the term used, but rather, 'Pu2 Sa4'.</div>
