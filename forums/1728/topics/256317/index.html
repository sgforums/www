Anything that enhances our grasping to the ego - be it negative acts or even positive acts - yup, anything that enhances the ego is not wrong, it merely lengthens our stay in Samsara. That's all. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>In fact, many teachers cautioned that it's easier to let go of negative actions than to let go of positive actions. They say that not to tell us to perform negative acts and give up positive acts. They say that to remind us that positive acts can also become an object that our ego holds very tightly to... and if we truly want liberation, then we have to prepare ourselves to let that go too.<br><br>I don't think one needs a high understanding of emptiness to do that. It is applicable. Because at this moment, we just need to halt for one second and reflect am I doing all these to strengthen my ego? Am I feeling happy to know that I'm doing something good? Will I feel upset if someone thinks I'm doing harm rather than good? And if... any of these answers "yes", it's normal. But it also raises a reminder to us that hey, maybe I need to just slow down a bit and reflect where I am really heading - towards Nirvana or Samsara.<br><br>Like what path_seeker or someone else mentioned, it is good reminder for us to reflect on our own motivations - are we seeking for a better next life, are we seeking for worldly benefits, or are we seeking for liberation/Enlightenment?<br><br>Well, again, it's not an issue of "right and wrong". It's an issue of what we ourselves truly want.<br><br>Compassionate acts are important in the practice of the Bodhisattva path. However, one can easily engage in outwardly-seemingly-compassionate acts, but actually engaging in them just to serve one's own ego. It is normal for us to slide into that, because that's our ego's habitual tendency.<br><br>Therefore, if one has the opportunity to hear the Dharma teaching that the true enemy is our "ego", then I think one should try to cherish the opportunity, and try as much as we can, to let go of that grasping.<br><br>True compassion is not contradictory to ultimate merits. There can only be true compassion when one lets go of one's self.<br><br>A person who devotes one minute of full attention to the Bodhicitta mind can benefit even more sentient beings than one who is doing one million projects but whose mind is ever distracted and full of self. The merits of the former are inconceivable.<br><br>I'm not writing this to discourage people from engaging in meritorious actions. I am merely sharing what I found as a very useful and important reminder that in whatever we do, try not to get overly distracted by too many things. But to remember and focus on the real goal - Enlightenment, so that we will truly be able to benefit sentient beings - and pull them away from the root of their suffering.</div>

As soon as Su Dung-pwo saw the Great Master Fwo-yin's criticism, he couldn't get it out of his mind, and he rushed across the Yangtze--he lived on the south side of the river and Great Master Fwo-yin lived on the north side--to find the Master and scold him. He wanted to tell the Master that he had written an enlightened poem, and so how could the Master possibly have replied, 'Fart, fart?'<br><br>"In fact, when Great Master Fwo-yin criticized him, not only did Su Dung-pwo fart, he blazed forth and wanted to scorch Fwo-yin to death. And so he rushed across the river and burst unannounced into the Master's quarters and shouted, 'How could you possibly scold someone and slander him that way by writing "fart, fart"?'<br><br>"Fo-yin replied, 'Who was I slandering? You said that you were unmoved by the Eight Winds, but just by letting two small farts I've blown you all the way across the Yangtze. And you still say that the Eight Winds don't move you? You don't have to talk about eight winds; just my two farts bounced you all the way up here.'<br><br>"Then Su Dung-pwo thought, 'That's right. I said that I'm unmoved by the Eight Winds, but two words have been enough to make me burn with anger.' Realizing that he still didn't have what it takes, he bowed to the Master and repented. . . .<br><br>"I. Praise. For example: 'Upasaka, you are really a good person; you really understand the Buddhadharma, and your wisdom really shines. Furthermore, your genius is unlimited and your eloquence is unobstructed.<br><br>II. Ridicule. For instance: 'It's the scientific age now, and you are studying Buddhism. Why do you study that old, superstitious rubbish?' Really ridiculous ridicule and yet you think, 'They're right. How can I study Buddhism now in the scientific age? Cause and effect, no me and no you--how can such metaphysical theories be worth anything in the age of science? I am I, and people are people.' You become confused and are moved by the blowing of the wind.<br><br>III. Suffering. The wind of suffering makes you suffer. To be unmoved while ceaselessly performing ascetic practices is an example of being unmoved by the wind of suffering.<br><br>IV. Happiness. To eat well, to wear good clothes, to have a good place to live, and to be especially happy all day long, thinking, 'This certainly is good,' is to be moved by this wind.<br><br>V. Benefit. You think, 'All I did is go to a lot of trouble cultivating. I don't even have any polluted thoughts. Consequently, people come to me and make an offering of a million dollars to build a temple.' And they are very, very happy. That is to be moved by the wind of benefit.<br><br>VI. Destruction. Perhaps the wind of benefit blew yesterday, but tomorrow people may come and ruin everything.
