              Protest</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">RUSSELL GOLDMAN AUG. 10, 2017 New York Times</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">HONG KONG — A 100-foot statue depicting a Chinese deity was
              covered with an enormous sheet this past weekend in East Java Province,
              Indonesia, after Muslims threatened to tear the colossus down amid mounting
              ethnic and religious tensions across the country.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Islamist campaign against the statue, a depiction of the
              third-century general Guan Yu, who is worshiped as a god in several Chinese
              religions, began online and soon spread to the gates of a Chinese Confucian
              temple in Tuban, near the Java Sea coast, where the figure was erected last
              month.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">On social media, Muslims assailed the statue as an
              “uncivilized” affront to Islam and the island’s “home people,” and a mob
              gathered this week outside the East Java legislature in the city of Surabaya to
              demand its destruction.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Statues deemed un-Islamic have been destroyed or vandalized
              around Indonesia in recent years, and several Chinese temples have been set on
              fire. Covering the statue with a large white tarp was a stopgap measure
              proposed by the temple’s officials after a governmental religious body pushed
              them to find a solution.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Indonesia is the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation, and
              ethnic Chinese — largely Christian, Buddhist or Confucian — make up less than 5
              percent of the overall population. The recent anti-Chinese animus is driven in
              part by an increased influence of extremist Muslim ideology in the country’s
              politics, experts said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;"> <span lang="EN-US">“</span>Anti-Chinese
              sentiment has become quite strong,” said Aan Anshori, a coordinator at the East
              Java Muslim Anti-Discrimination Network, which opposed covering the statue.
              “It’s quite worrying to think that these sentiments could be used by
              politicians in the future.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In recent years, Muslim extremists have pressed for the
              adoption of Islamic law, or Shariah, throughout Indonesia. A civil court found
              the Christian governor of the capital, Jakarta, guilty of blasphemy against
              Islam in May. Islamists falsely claimed that President Joko Widodo was a
              Chinese Christian during his 2014 campaign.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Colossal statues of Guan Yu have been erected around the
              world. The Tuban statue, which took more than a year to build at a cost of
              about $188,000, is the largest of its type in Southeast Asia, according to
              Indonesia’s Museum of World Records.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Adding to tensions between Chinese and Muslim Indonesians is
              a sense that as Beijing becomes more dominant in the region — exerting
              financial and military influence — ethnic Chinese will profit at the expense of
              Muslims.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;" lang="EN-US">“</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">It is growing religious intolerance, making their own
              interpretation of the Quran and using that hostile interpretation against the
              Chinese temple,” said Andreas Harsono, the Indonesia director for Human Rights
              Watch. “They say that it is showing that China is dominating Indonesia.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Didik Muadi, a Muslim who organized the protests against the
              statue, said Muslims would destroy the figure themselves if the government did
              not intervene.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;" lang="EN-US">“</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Actually, we can allow them to build the statue, just not as
              high as it was and it should be in the temple, not outside,” Mr. Didik told the
              news site Tempo. “We are tolerant.”</span></p>

              <p>“We are tolerant” said Pak Didik, and in the same breath set the conditions as to how you are allowed to show your reverence in your religion. The statue is assailed as an “uncivilized” affront on their religion.Just wonder when their religion has become so superior that believers of other Faiths have to abided by what their Faith teaches.</p>
              <p>If the statue is so offensive, just wondering, why they do not seem to be able to take the simple act of ignoring or looking at it. I suppose when one is a minority in a country, one just have to humble and be tolerant even when shit is thrown at your face. </p>
