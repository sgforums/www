            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><strong>Tian Tao</strong><br><br>Tian Tao or I Kuan Tao is a modern, syncretic faith and the third most popular religion in Taiwan. The Chinese words I Kuan Tao can be roughly translated as the Religion of One Unity. It is a religious doctrine that draws upon both traditional Chinese teachings and each of the world's major religions. This religion attempts to identify common principles underlying Taoism, Buddhism, Christianity, ---censored---, Judaism and Hinduism. Tian Tao believes that by uncovering a single set of universal truths, the "increasing chaos" of modern times can be defeated and the world can live peacefully in harmony. They believe in a God beyond all other gods, called Ming-ming Shang-ti (the God of Clarity).<br><br>It may have its roots with the Bai Lian Jiao (White Lotus Sect) which created several political unrests for both the Qing court (1644 - 1911) and foreign powers, such as the British, French and so forth who have seized the lands from the hands of the Qing court since the Opium War. Bai Lian Jiao is closely related to the Chinese Christian cult, Tai Ping Tian Guo, founded by Hong Xiu Quan, in the late Qing dynasty. Hong Xiu Quan believed himself as Jesus Christ's heavenly brother, which was sent to Earth by Lord God to liberate Chinese people from imperial oppression. Lands were belonged by Lord God and not the Qing court, hence poor and uneducated peasants in ten of thousands accepted his teachings. Heavenly King Yang Xiu Ching, the Minister of State for Tai Ping Tian Guo, tried to seize the p[ower and authority of Emperor Hong Xiu Quan. To legitimize his authority, he occasionally lapsed into trances in which his voice supposedly became that of the Lord's. In one of his trances, Heavenly King Yang Xiu Ching claimed that the Lord demanded Hong Xiu Quan be whipped for kicking one of his concubines. Emperor Hong Xiu Quan had Heavenly King Yang Xiu Ching murdered by Wei Chang Hui, a Tai Ping Tian Guo general. The followers of Heavenly King Yang Xiu Ching later formed the Bai Lian Jiao.<br><br>Another source stated that Tian Tao was evolved from Xian Tian Tao which was founded by 9th Patriarch Huang De Hui of the Shun Zhi period of Qing Dynasty. Huang De Hui combined the three main belief systems of China with a belief in the Wu Sheng Lao Mu (Great Mother) to form Xian Tian Tao. Bodhidharma is credited as the 1st Patriarch, the first five Chinese Chan Patriarchs are credited as 2nd to 6th Patriarchs. Bai Ma became the 7th Patriarch and the 8th Patriarch is Luo Wei Qun. The lines of patriarch of Xian Tian Tao continue into the present I Kuan Tao. The 15th Patriarch had made some major changes in the formulas and goals of Xian Tian Tao. And it is the 16th Patriarch Liu Ching Xu renamed the group as I Kuan Tao. The 18th Patriarch is the last in line of the patriarchs.<br><br>The followers of I Kuan Tao claimed that it is a distinguished lineage back over 2000 years when it begins from the ancient Chinese astrolgers, emperors, Confucius, and so forth. From 18th Ancient Patriarch Mencius, the lineage travels to the west, the lineage began from Shakyamuni Buddha, Mahakashyapa to 28th Indian Patriarch Bodhidharma. But the modern practice of Tian Tao, as we know it today, was established about 70 years ago. In the 1930, Shi Zueng Zhang Tian Ran and Shi Mu Sun Hui Ming, became the 18th Patriarch and started their practice I Kuan Tao in Chi Nan City, Shang Dong Province of China. Their work spread by word of mouth, and by 1946 I Kuan Tao became prevalent among 36 provinces of China. At the end of the Civil War in 1949, many followers in China found their beliefs incompatible with Communist doctrines. This and other reasons compelled large numbers of them to emigrate to Taiwan, Hong Kong, Korea, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines. Tian Tao quickly took root in these new lands, spreading with its teachings Chinese culture and traditional family values. By increasing the number of I Kuan Tao temples, they believed that they are bringing the Buddhist "Western Paradise" to earth and creating a world of brotherhood and universal love as envisioned by Confucian teachings.<br><br>Today, they have about 4,500,000 followers in Taiwan, Korea and Japan; about 2,000,000 followers in South East Asian countries; and a growing number of adherents in countries like Canada, USA, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Argentina, South Africa, Paraguay, Italy, France, Germany, Holland and United Kingdom. In Taiwan alone, there are over 200 large and medium-sized temples and over 30,000 family shrines.<br><br>Presently, they claimed that the founder, 17th Patriarch Lu Zhong Yi, was an incarnation of Maitreya. He has major influence and impact on the present form of I Kuan Tao. The central teaching of Tian Tao, is based on the initiation ceremony - a new formula on the Triple Gem, namely: 1. Opening of Heavenly Eye (Dian Xuan Dao), 2.Oral Transmission of the Maitreya prayer (Chuan Ko Jue), and 3. Hand Gestures (Jie He Tong). They believe that the recipient has obtained the Tao and that his name has been reserved in the heaven and erased from the lists in hell. Upon death, the recipient will ascend straight to heaven without having to endure the cycles of rebirth.<br><br>The followers of this organization must be a strict vegetarian. It is said that they will not teach and liberate three groups of people: they are butchers, fishermen and prostitutes.<br><br>Usually, their temples are painted in pure white. And they have large followers in Asia. Their selection for potential followers are very strict. Non-members of this organization are not allowed to step into their temple compound. They can only enter the temple compound through the invitation from the senior members. On the day itself, the new recruit will make to vow to keep secrets on what he/she has learnt from the temple. Why? Without asking of consert, he/she is sent to receive the "secret" formula, so-called "Triple Gem". If he/she has failed to keep the secrets, and leaked out these secrets to non-members, he/she will be killed by the 5 heavenly thunders (Wu Lei Hong Ding).<br><br>There are many works written by this cult group. There are few popular ones. For example:<br><br>1. "Maitreya Sutra" (Chinese: Mi Le Zhen Jing) is their own version of Maitreyavyakarana Sutra. It is said that this scripture was spoken by the Buddha. It talks about the benefit on having faith on Maitreya Buddha. The retinue of protectors are non-Buddhist ones, most of them are from the Chinese folk religions and not to mention the main character, Lao Mu who is Wu Sheng Lao Mu in short.<br><br>2. "The Travelogue for the Hell" (Chinese: Ti Yu You Ji) revealed by Ji Gong, a Chinese folk religion deity whose origin is unknown. This work explains about hell.<br><br>These books can be found in the free book distribution corners in the Chinese folk religion temples.<br><br>"The group is known as Ee Kwang Tao. I was invited to attend the opening of one of their 'Holy Houses'. It was one of the strangest rituals that i have ever witnessed. Following the ritual we were invited to go before the 'Master' to receive initiation. I declined on the grounds that I had been invited to attend the opening but not to join anything. After a while they approached me again and they said that the 'Master' was waiting for me and I MUST go before the 'Master'. I replied that I must not do anything of the sort as I am a traditional Buddhist and had no wish to join their organisation. I thanked them for their hospitality and said that I was leaving. As each person arrived they took their name. As I left they asked me for my name as they said that the names were being sent to heaven and, as I refused initiation, my name would have to be struck off the list. I consulted a Chinese friend about my experience and he immediately identified it as the Ee Kwang Tao cult which, as was said, is proliferating in Australia. The initiates are sworn to secrecy with the threat of harm to themselves and their family if the secrets are revealed. This dangerous cult bears no relation to Buddhism so beware of them."

It is also stated that it is "strictly for members". Their first centre was located at Upper Serangoon Road, and was demolished recently.

Being always Â“just thatÂ…..Â” Buddhas may or may not be perceived as Buddhas by others, nevertheless, they always continue being Buddhas just as they are. However, since the Â“as they areÂ” is inherently empty and not any fixed entity, Buddhas appear as simply Â“thisÂ” [Â…Â….] or Â“thatÂ” [Â…Â…..], as me and you, as Â“this very momentÂ” and as the entire Universe.<br><br>They Â“appearÂ” only when Mind appears (Â…) divided into its object / subject modes of Being.<br><br>Whenever a Buddha realizes that he or she is Buddha as a human being, the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha rejoice, leap forward, and Â“BuddhismÂ” takes yet another turn.<br><br>The last 2,600 years of Buddhism have been marked by such occasional appearance of realized Buddhas, of spiritual guides, whose insights, understanding or manifestation of the Dharma not only subsumed and included all prior teaching traditions but also reformulated them into a new philosophical turn, new school or spiritual paradigm.<br><br>Today, two centuries after Buddhism was introduced to the West, many practitioners in this country wonder how long will it take for another Buddha, another uniquely enlightened mind, another Nagarjuna, Asanga, Milarepa, Hui-Neng, Hakuin or Dogen to appear in American Buddhism?<br><br>Alas for all of us, as the timeline in the box below suggests, it may to take quite a long time again.<br><br>In the past, it was always at least 600 years after Buddhism was first transplanted to a new culture or country before a truly original teacher / reformer would appear Â– suggesting, if one can extrapolate from history Â– that it may take another 450 years for one to emerge here, in the West.<br><br>In its birthplace, India, almost an entire millennium passed, before early Buddhism, proselytized by Siddharta Gautama around 600 B.C., spread throughout Southeast Asia and Tibet and matured into its philosophical pinnacle manifested by Madhyamika (Nagarjuna 200 Â– 300 AD), and Yogacara (Asanga and Vasubandhu 300 Â– 400 AD).<br><br>In China, over 500 years passed since the time Buddhism was first introduced (ca. 100 B.C. Â– 100 A.D.) to the arrival of Boddhidarma ( 500 A.D), the legendary Indian monk who became the First Patriarch of Chan (Zen).<br><br>It took another 150 years and five more generations of teachers after Boddhidarma, before Hui Neng (638 Â– 674), the revered Sixth Patriarch appeared, and additional 200 years for Lin-chi (Rinzai) (d. 867) and TsÂ’ao-tung (Soto) ( 830) schools of Chan (Zen) to emerge.<br><br>Over 1,000 years passed in China, since Buddhism was first introduced, to the time when the first two major Zen koan collections Â– Â“Blue Cliff RecordÂ” (1125 A.D.) and Â“The Gateless GateÂ” (ca 1228 A.D.) were compiled.<br><br>Similarly, even if Buddhism arrived to Japan as early as 550 A.D., it took more than 250 years for it to fully settle in Kyoto during the Heian Period ( 800) and another 400 years to culminate in the Kamakura Period (1185 - 1333 A.D.).<br><br>Again, Buddhism was widely present in Japan for at least 650 years before the spiritual and poetic genius of Dogen and his mystical masterpiece Shobogenzo (1200 Â– 1253) appeared and established Soto ZenÂ’s Ehei-ji temple as a major presence in the Japanese Mahayana Buddhism.<br><br>After Dogen, it was another 400 years more till the time when Hakuin (1686 Â– 1769) reformed Rinzai Zen and its use of koans at the Ryutaku-ji temple in Japan where it still continues today.<br><br>Buddhism was originally introduced to the West, about 1800, and it still seems to be in its infancy today.<br><br>Several generations of Asian pioneer teachers struggled with cultural and language barriers for several decades, as they attempted to bring authentic practice to the US and Europe.<br><br>First legitimate non-Asian Buddhist teachers began to emerge in the second half of the last century (ca 1950 Â–2000) and a transition to the second and third generations of teachers is currently under way in all major Buddhist traditions, nationwide.<br><br>More time is needed for Buddhism to take root on the American soil, more time to assimilate with the culture at large and to mature enough for its new, truly Western, form to eventually emerge.<br><br>Even more time is probably needed for an American teacher, another Nagarjuna, Asanga, Milarepa, Hui-Neng, Hakuin or Dogen to appear in the U.S., a teacher who will not only conclude the transmission of Dharma to this new land but who will also legitimize American Buddhism as a new and fully autonomous tradition.<br><br>And when it finally arrives, what is the American Buddhism likely to be, 400 - 500 years from now?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How is that future American Maitreya Buddha, likely to lead, galvanize and propel American Buddhism into its next Millennium?<br><br>Historically, Buddhism, born out of Hinduism and Yoga traditions in ancient India, has always tended to absorb native spiritual tradition and culture of the country to which it arrived. As it moved East throughout Asia, it merged with Confucianism and Taoism in China, assimilated shamanism in Tibet and adapted to the Shinto Samurai culture in Japan.<br><br>Similarly, the future of American Buddhism is likely to be shaped by the entire Western / American culture and its future evolution in the time to come.<br><br>One can anticipate that, by the year 2,500, American Buddhism in will have assimilated and merged with the following Â“WesternÂ” influences:<br><br>Democracy Â– contrary to more autocratic, male dominated Asian model, American Buddhists will embrace more democratic, egalitarian / libertarian approach, with man and women practicing together in centers governed by elective process where the role of a teacher is separate from the centerÂ’s administrator. A full spectrum of training models will develop, from more traditional monastic institutions to lay centers which are likely to grow in popularity. The Western appreciation of individuality, democracy and transparency will result in more horizontal, egalitarian approach to the interpretation of the Dharma, with multiple, loosely related Â“lineagesÂ” and a marketplace of individual preachers. Paradoxically, this model is likely to resemble the origins of Buddhism in 600 B.C. India where wondering Â“seekersÂ” / Â“monksÂ” gathered only during rain seasons to study and practice in one place and only to resume their individual/ solitary search afterwards. An individual Â“hermitÂ” / Boddhisatva / preacher model is likely to emerge, in addition to more organized Buddhism-as-religion.<br><br><strong>ScienceÂ–</strong> science in general, and quantum physics and Unified Theory (when available) will replace Mahayana Buddhism as the new paradigm for the understanding of the Universe, Mind and Emptiness. American Buddhism will not only embrace science as the preferred language of the Dharma but a new, Scientific Buddhism will emerge as the dominant Â“schoolÂ” of Buddhism not only in the West but worldwide.<br><br><strong>Psychology Â–</strong> both Buddhism and psychology endeavor to alleviate suffering and to grasp the nature of Mind. Psychology without the Mysterium of spirituality and mysticism is incomplete, Buddhism without postmodern psychology is naÃ¯ve. Buddhism will eventually adopt the language of cognitive neuroscience and psychology to redefine itself within the Western culture. Insights of psychology, psychiatry, brain science and psychotherapy will not only inform any serious spiritual training and practice in the future but will also permeate the Â“WesternÂ” interpretation of the Madhyamika / Yogacara Dharma. Buddhist teachers of the future are likely to undergo formal training in at least one of the above disciplines to match ever evolving psychological-mindedness of their Western practitioners. Seated meditation and mindfulness will continue as the key elements distinguishing Buddhists practice from other traditions.<br><br><strong>Â· Language Â–</strong> translating Buddhism into the Western context will impose the English language and its vocabulary on the Dharma. A complete translation of most of Sanscrit, Chinese, Tibetan and Japanese texts should be completed within the next 100 years and most of the Buddhist canon will be available to Western readers in English. Terminology and understanding of particular terms is likely to evolve to adjust to the usage within the Western culture. New, original, modern Â“sutrasÂ”, or Dharma texts, will appear and gradually replace the old ones. Future, American, Nagarjuna, Asanga, Milarepa, Hui-Neng, Hakuin and Dogen will Â“re-writeÂ” the old texts and create a uniquely English-language Â“schoolÂ” of Buddhism.<br><br><strong>Postmodern / postindustrial culture Â–</strong> Buddhism preceded some ideas typically associated with deconstruction and postmodernism for over 2,600 years. The lack (emptiness) of the subject and form, decentralization / multiplicity (Absolute / Relative) of signification and truth, quantum physics and interdependent origination Â– all point to inescapable parallels between Buddhism and the postmodern. The future Buddhism will continue to evolve within the postmodern Western culture and will become increasingly permeated by its ideas and values. Environmentalism and Â“engagedÂ” Buddhism will play a significant role in defining how Buddhists will function in the future global / local marketplace.<br><br><strong>Technology Â–</strong> Buddhism will evolve in the Millennium dominated by science and its applications - technology. In a few decades we will be able to effectively manipulate our genetic codes, and hence the life itself, will learn how to control and change, at will, our states of mind through new advances in molecular neuropsychopharmacology, and will be able to immerse ourselves in computerized virtual realities of our choice, leaving more mundane chores to increasingly more efficacious and omnipresent artificial intelligence tools and robotic appliances. Instantaneous visual-audio global access to any information, person or place anywhere on Earth, via the next generations of the Internet, will be taken for granted. Biological computers and ultramicrochip-enhanced biological implants will merge technology with brain functions, altering cognition, consciousness and the sense of individual identity. The new American Â“Scientific BuddhismÂ” will emerge to embrace technology as its new Â“Great VehicleÂ” to ferry all sentient beings to the other shore of Existence.<br><br><strong>Judeo-Christian tradition Â–</strong> Buddhism will assimilate many of the contemporary Judeo-Christian forms of monastic and lay practice, ranging from the Catholic monastery / church / priest model to the Episcopalian / Protestant / Baptist minister / preacher / congregation formats of practice. Buddhism will continue to struggle with the concept of Judeo-Christian monotheistic God. Interfaith dialogue(s) will emerge to clarify basic ideas and to enhance mutual understanding. The concepts of God and Buddha-Mind, along with neuroscience, will take the center stage in the multidisciplinary debate on the nature of the mind and spiritual and religious life.<br><br><strong>Global marketplace Â–</strong> American Buddhism will embrace wholesome, not-for-profit entrepreneurial self-sufficiency, simplicity and non-attachment rather than poverty and asceticism. Although Buddhism originally developed within tribal / feudal cultures of ancient India, China and Japan, we are now witnessing an increasing emphasis on economic self-reliance rather than on alms-gathering or feudal / government donations and support. Sophisticated fund raising, students / members fees and small business ventures are likely to become dominant sources of income for Buddhist centers in the future. Separation of the spiritual teaching from the economics, similar to that of church / state in the society at large, will have to be strictly observed to prevent perception of exploitation. The issues of property ownership or de facto property control by teachers, non-attachment vs poverty vs asceticism will have to be addressed and resolved as a Dharma question and within the American Sangha to assure integrity, purity and depth of future practice.<br><br>The future is always different from our speculations about it. However, we know that Buddhism will have to change in its encounter with the West. The old Theravada / Mahayana tradition will be, eventually, replaced by a new "school" or paradigm.<br><br>Since science and technology, along with democracy and global marketplace, are the most dominant forces shaping the world today, the postmodern science will become the next discourse of Buddhism, not only in the West but worldwide.<br><br>That fully autonomous American / Western Scientific Buddhism will need a teacher, who like others did before, will propel it into the next Millennia. That person, whoever he/she will be, will find a way to translate the Dharma into a new language of science, psychology, cognitive neuroscience and postmodern / postindustrial culture.<br><br>To save all sentient beings, we all need to do our best to make it happen as soon as possible.</div>

I find that Buddhist teachings are much closer to me and much more easier to understand (perhaps shallowly). For Christianity, some of their teachings are about the same, but I think they have different interpretations about the teachings. I have been to their self-help group for a few times, listen to them and heard them explaining their interpretations. On the surface, their interpretations seem about the same as buddhism, but I guess when one goes more indepth, it would be different. Probably I read too much into their words. That's what I think.<br><br>Another thing I found out when I attended their self-help group is that there are some people who are pretty extreme over there.

Bodhisattvas and Buddhist practitioners are driven by true compassion to help liberate beings, and is not to concerned with 'names and forms' of Buddhism. After all Buddhism easily adopts a culture as it spreads... for example in order for Buddhist teachings to be more easily accepted in Tibet, or Thailand, or China etc, Buddhism adopts the local culture while retaining the Buddhist dharma/truths.<br><br>Therefore I feel the article did gave quite useful directions on how Buddhism could adopt to the modern world and therefore be able to help more sentient beings.

For me, most of my friends have not converted and have no wish to convert.<br><br>I did think of converting, but after that decided against it. I find that Buddhist teachings are much closer to me and much more easier to understand (perhaps shallowly). For Christianity, some of their teachings are about the same, but I think they have different interpretations about the teachings. I have been to their self-help group for a few times, listen to them and heard them explaining their interpretations. On the surface, their interpretations seem about the same as buddhism, but I guess when one goes more indepth, it would be different. Probably I read too much into their words. That's what I think.<br><br>Another thing I found out when I attended their self-help group is that there are some people who are pretty extreme over there. Some of them condemn the Catholics, although they have been warned not to do so. I found it out accidentally.</div></blockquote>There are many similarities between Buddhism, Christianity, Catholicism, and so on. One major difference is that they do not advocate 'liberation' and 'purification of the mind' but rather 'ascension to heavens'. But in Buddhism we believe this is not ultimate...<br><br>Anyway, in a way, Christianity do have some form of 'small liberations' but it is due to the submission to the almighty God. In Buddhism we have no dependancy... complete liberation as it is. For example. A Christian gave birth to a child with some illness etc... some people will be very angry or sad, but because of the Christian faith he will accept the child as a gift of God so he may learn to be more patient and loving. In Buddhism, we recognise this as karma and whilst clearing our karma, we are also practising liberation from samsara.<br><br>Speaking of purification of the mind Buddhism is the only religion that advocates this and the only religion that will lead to the complete purification of the mind... All Buddhas teaches 'Do good, avoid evil, purify the mind'. But we just don't hear 'purify the mind' in other religions. In fact this is very important because everything we think, speak, do, good or evil, comes from our mind. Afflictions and defilements also come from our mind. Suffering comes from mind. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Anyway the condemnation of Catholicism is happening somewhere in sgforums  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
