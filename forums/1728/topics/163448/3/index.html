My colleagues tried to share with me their experience as a christians, and even passed booklets that propagate christianity ideas to me.  1 1/2 have passed, I'm still me, practising the ideology that Lord Buddha has passed down, to be compassion, and accomodate all.  In fact, they are now able to accept my reason for turning into vegetarian, and sometimes, could even join me for vegetarian meals!<br><br>Of course, I don't talk about dharma, but just emphasise that all beings (cows, pigs, chicken) have feelings, and they could feel pain, happiness and fear.  As a human being, we have to show our compassion to all beings, REGARDLESS of our faith.   Just some sharing of my own personal encounter.<br><br>I have alot of christian friends, and some are really closed friends.  Even my godmother and godfather are staunch christians too.  But we seldom talked about our religion, but we all agree that in this society, we have to learn to live with all, and accomodate all, and not forcefully put our belief on others.  Compassion should be the common ground to make this world a better place.</div>
