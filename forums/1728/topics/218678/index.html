Why have precepts when no one cares? Curious as I am. </div></blockquote>Well you must know, then follow.. it's simple as that. No point knowing and not following. And also very importantly, we must understand why we need to follow it.. I don't think many people are going to blindly follow what is being taught, and should deeply consider the consequences and impact of following that teaching. As for this topic, you may want to read the Kalama Sutta, which is a very good sutta on this: <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an03/an03.065.than.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an03/an03.065.than.html</a><br><br><blockquote>....."So what do you think, Kalamas: Are these qualities skillful or unskillful?"<br><br>"Skillful, lord."<br><br>"Blameworthy or blameless?"<br><br>"Blameless, lord."<br><br>"Criticized by the wise or praised by the wise?"<br><br>"Praised by the wise, lord."<br><br>"When adopted &amp; carried out, do they lead to welfare &amp; to happiness, or not?"<br><br>"When adopted &amp; carried out, they lead to welfare &amp; to happiness. That is how it appears to us."<br><br>"So, as I said, Kalamas: 'Don't go by reports, by legends, by traditions, by scripture, by logical conjecture, by inference, by analogies, by agreement through pondering views, by probability, or by the thought, "This contemplative is our teacher." When you know for yourselves that, "These qualities are skillful; these qualities are blameless; these qualities are praised by the wise; these qualities, when adopted &amp; carried out, lead to welfare &amp; to happiness" Â— then you should enter &amp; remain in them.' Thus was it said. And in reference to this was it said.<br><br>"Now, Kalamas, one who is a disciple of the noble ones Â— thus devoid of greed, devoid of ill will, undeluded, alert, &amp; resolute Â— keeps pervading the first direction [the east] Â— as well as the second direction, the third, &amp; the fourth Â— with an awareness imbued with good will. Thus he keeps pervading above, below, &amp; all around, everywhere &amp; in every respect the all-encompassing cosmos with an awareness imbued with good will: abundant, expansive, immeasurable, free from hostility, free from ill will....</blockquote>Therefore it's more important to be a BUDDHIST, than be a 'buddhist academic'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>As for precepts, I believe Sinweiy explained it very well. Other people don't care is their business, their karma. We care because precepts are safeguarding our blessings, our blissfulness.. so that we may not end up in lower realms of sufferings (i.e Animal, Ghost, Hell realm) due to our karma.<br><br>But even if you cannot completely abide by the 5 precepts, it is ok to enter Buddhism first and change gradually. Nobody is perfect in this world and is constantly improving themselves... that that is there is the teachings of Dharma. If everyone is perfect then there wouldn't be the need to practise. Changes are gradual... for example you can't stop someone who loves drinking to stop at once, that has to come gradually and maybe through guidance and help too.</div>
