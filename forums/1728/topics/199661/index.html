Even if one believe in a highly logical religion like buddhism, we can't expect a new comer to immediately eradicate all his bad habit.<br>There are buddhist who don't strictly follows its teaching, but if you compare buddhism to other religions by the percentage of extremist who created religious war, sects fight, killing of innocent, preaching thru invasion, buddhism is still the best.<br>Believing in buddhism cannot guarantee a person not to do any bad deeds, just like studying cannot always guarantee you a job that you like. It's all depends on your own practise.<br>Without believing in buddhism, you can't go further in the practise.<br>As a buddhist, you get to know more dharma friends to remind each other on cultivation, you get to know the dharma door which best suits you.<br>If you think you can practise alone, you might go the wrong way mistakenly unknowingly.<br>If you have a dharma teacher to guide you, you might use half the effort and achieve twice as much achievement in shorter time compare to a person without proper guidance.<br>btw, which aspects of Buddhism you find it more attractive.</div>

Buddhism is a religion of tolerance because it preaches a life of self-restraint. Buddhism teaches a life based not on rules but on principles. Buddhism has never persecuted or maltreated those whose beliefs are different.<br><br>Buddha always welcomed people to come and observe His way of teaching; not to come and believe it all at once. He actually advised people on how to choose a proper religion, by considering, analyzing and investigating it in various ways without accepting anything through emotion or blind faith. Of course all religions promote faith.<br><br>But faith in Buddhism is not a surrender to the unknown; it is not submission to fear and punishment. Buddhist faith is the courageous acceptance of what one has found out through careful observation and analytical investigation. This is why Buddhism is called a doctrine of <strong>analysis.</strong><br><br>We have full freedom to judge and to think for ourselves whether to accept or to reject anything. We are not bound to accept anything in the name of religion, either simply by thinking of the greatness of a particular religious teacher or by thinking that it is our bounded duty to accept the words of Holy Scriptures or the ways of ancient traditions.<br><br>Buddhists are at liberty to investigate for themselves and accept or reject any proposition in accordance to their own conviction, based on sensible reason. Buddhists never say that they are forbidden to do this or that. They simply say that they dislike doing something because it creates some troubles, miseries, pain or disturbance amongst the masses. <strong>Conversely, they practice certain good deeds not because their religion asks them to do so, but because they themselves have come to realize the value and meaning of such good deeds for the welfare of themselves and others</strong>.<br><br></div>

I think it's important for us to understand these 2 definitions.<br><br>Very often, the many buddhist I'd met would always stress the importance of going through the ceremony so as to be an <span style="font-style: italic;">official</span> buddhist. But is there <span style="font-style: italic;">official</span> buddhist in the first place? I agree with what neutral_onliner had said that "Buddhism teaches a life based not on rules but on principles". So I suppose one shouldn't constraint to the need in going through the ceremony. Of course there are some exceptions, like my parents who are in their late 50s and both are illiterate, so in order for them to have Faith in the Triplegem, I brought them through the refuge ceremony which I also participated last year. So "officially" I only became a buddhist last year, but to me, I'm a buddhist since 8 years ago.<br><br>Many buddhists I'd met often discuss on the issue of practice. Many will think that to practice means must take part in meditation retreat, group chantings, attending talks on by famous monks, become long-term vegetarian, etc. I'm not saying that they are not practice, but I think they are more like complimentary and not the core and primary practice that we should be doing.<br><br>Buddha's Teachings is to change our lives. It's the adjustment of lifestyle. The lifestyle is not about going through ritualistic motions but rather how can we deal with life challenges. From the sutras, we know that our root problems are derived from greed, aversion and ignorance, so how can we apply the Buddha's Teachings in our lives? To have lesser greed, one must know the needs and wants in life, and learn to be more generous and sympathic to those who are less-fortunate compare to us, etc. I find that this is then the real practice.<br><br>So before we assume others have not taken refuge and/or started practising Buddhism, who knows they may have already been doing it and far better than us, whether or not do they know that what they are doing are buddhistic or not?! It's what we do through our actions, speech and thoughts that determines whether or not are we buddhists. Let not the training ground be defined as temple or shrines, but anywhere and everywhere are training grounds that are giving us the chances and conditions to purify our actions, speech and thoughts. To detach ourselves away from sufferings.</div>

To have lesser greed, one must know the needs and wants in life, and learn to be more generous and sympathic to those who are less-fortunate compare to us, etc. I find that this is then the real practice.<br><br>So before we assume others have not taken refuge and/or started practising Buddhism, who knows they may have already been doing it and far better than us, whether or not do they know that what they are doing are buddhistic or not?! It's what we do through our actions, speech and thoughts that determines whether or not are we buddhists. Let not the training ground be defined as temple or shrines, but anywhere and everywhere are training grounds that are giving us the chances and conditions to purify our actions, speech and thoughts. To detach ourselves away from sufferings.</div></blockquote>Btw buddhism is abt understanding ourselves ,understanding happiness,understanding suffering and understanding reality thru seeing things as they really r  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>While I agree that practising BuddhaÂ’s Teaching should be a daily affair, and venues should not be limited to monasteries, activities such as  Dharma talks, meditations are not just important because this avenue will help one to revise the teachings of Buddha that we could have forgotten, or overlooked, such as the importance of mindfulness, awareness etc.  These additional Â“remindersÂ” from the sutras will bring us to the next level of cultivation, and hence, gradually liberating us from our sufferings.</div>

I think it's important for us to understand these 2 definitions.<br>Very often, the many buddhist I'd met would always stress the importance of going through the ceremony so as to be an <span style="font-style: italic;">official</span> buddhist. But is there <span style="font-style: italic;">official</span> buddhist in the first place? I agree with what neutral_onliner had said that "Buddhism teaches a life based not on rules but on principles". So I suppose one shouldn't constraint to the need in going through the ceremony. Of course there are some exceptions, like my parents who are in their late 50s and both are illiterate, so in order for them to have Faith in the Triplegem, I brought them through the refuge ceremony which I also participated last year. So "officially" I only became a buddhist last year, but to me, I'm a buddhist since 8 years ago.<br></blockquote>Taking refuge meaning you vow to let the triple gems which are buddha, dharma and sangha to guide you the way.<br>It is true that we shouldn't be attached to the label "buddhist", but taking refuge to be a buddhist is more than the label, it is your willingness to be buddha's disciple and follow the teaching.<br><br>Form is something that we should give up, even focusing on breath while meditating is also a form, but we need this to deattach ourselves from other forms and thoughts. Only when we are skillful on this, then we can let go the breathing and go straight to samadhi. Well, samadhi is also a stepping stone for us to attain wisdom. But can a beginner let go the form of buddhist, meditation, breath, samadhi and go straight to wisdom directly? Cannot. If we do that, we will go back to samsara.<br><br>In sutra, it states that taking refuge to triple gems is one of the criteria to be born in western pureland. Let's not go into ceremony here, different tradition has different ceremony, even during buddha's time, the ceremony is also slightly different from now. It is your vows and attitude that matters. Don't underestimate the power of vow, amitabha vows created western pureland that accomodate countless beings who vows to go there, wisdomless vows make you suffer in next life.<br><br>Taking refuge is the 1st door to buddha dharma, although we can't ensure they will practise diligently hereafter, but if we close the 1st door before they enter, it will cause more bad than good for sure.
