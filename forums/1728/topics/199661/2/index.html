So does meditating, repenting and chanting, it doesn't liberate us as well.<br><br>If you do understand the example I'd quoted, it probes us into looking at the root problem, and the method to eliminate. I don't see being more generous as a way to gain merit. In fact a buddhist shouldn't be going after merits. A buddhist should simply do what is good as it is, and not because it can accumulate a lot of merits. Having the mind of accumulate merits will simply gain no merits at all. Because the supposedly genuine intent will be blinded by our ego self.<br><br>As Rencheng's name suggested itself, if we can't even be a good man, how to become a Buddha?<br><br>While it's not a bad idea to be aspired to ultimately become Buddha, or even some who claim that they undertake the Bodhisattva's precepts, let's touch our hearts and ask ourselves, how many of us can hold our basic layman 5 precepts and the 10 whole deeds well and good?<br><br>Before falling into the mind of escapism, let us ask ourselves is there really samsara to leave at the first place? If so, then Buddha would have jolly well chose to enter Parinibbana when He'd attained Enlightenment. A buddhist aspire to be a Buddha, should like Him, not only having Wisdom but a Compassionate heart as well.<br><br>When one's mind is conditioned and detached away from sufferings, then it doesn't make any difference whether he/she is still in the samsara or not.<br><br>=)</div>

Only when we are skillful on this, then we can let go the breathing and go straight to samadhi. Well, samadhi is also a stepping stone for us to attain wisdom. But can a beginner let go the form of buddhist, meditation, breath, samadhi and go straight to wisdom directly? Cannot. If we do that, we will go back to samsara.<br><br>In sutra, it states that taking refuge to triple gems is one of the criteria to be born in western pureland. Let's not go into ceremony here, different tradition has different ceremony, even during buddha's time, the ceremony is also slightly different from now. It is your vows and attitude that matters. Don't underestimate the power of vow, amitabha vows created western pureland that accomodate countless beings who vows to go there, wisdomless vows make you suffer in next life.<br><br>Taking refuge is the 1st door to buddha dharma, although we can't ensure they will practise diligently hereafter, but if we close the 1st door before they enter, it will cause more bad than good for sure. Let's give non-buddhists a chance.</div></blockquote>Apparently you didn't get my point. I do no underestimate the power of vows. In fact if you want to make a vow, you must have the substance to back it up. Vowing need not go through ceremony. Who insists that vowing needs to be ceremonial? Like you'd mentioned it's the heart and attitude of the practitioner himself. In Buddha's time, when a person want to be Buddha's disciple, simply go to Buddha and tell him you willing to take refuge under the Triplegem, how ceremonial can it be? But I believe Buddha would definitely be more glad that a person understands and apply His Teachings rather than paying lip services.<br><br>Anyway,  a real buddhist shouldn't be aspired to be reborn into Western Pureland but should aspire to be always be in samsara as it is the place where Buddhas-to-be are trained.<br><br>Of course choosing the easier way out by reborning at other place is individual's choice in the end.<br><br>Let's not forget that this very samsara is the pureland of Lord Sakyamuni.<br><br>=)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just wish to say tis again.  i think buddhism is kind of a step by step thing. Cultivation take time. Just take it easy and learn it within ur own pace.  As buddhism is not easily understandable, not everyone is ready for Buddhism yet.   And it is for this reason that Buddhists gently and quietly strive to share the insights of Buddhism with others.

You may think "Oh I think I agree with Buddhist teachings, I like what Buddha said" but whether one actually seriously practises what he said is another thing.<br><br>Secondly, taking refuge in Three Treasures is planting a seed in your consciousness. This seed in 8th Consciousness will be brought to the next life, it is a good seed and will create the cause for you to meet a Sangha in a future lifetime again.<br><br>And thirdly, taking refuge also means you have found a teacher. A teacher is important for one's path as I have stated above.<br><br>and... wow.... there's this spellchecker thing in sgforums now.. its superb!!</div>

After which, itÂ’s up to individuals to realise the teachings and follow the path.</div></blockquote>MmM I took the triple Gems and five Percepts in Pali and unknowingly in its signficance then... some of my friends took the vows many times and have many Fa min 'names  given my venerable' and some break it for numerous times.<br><br>It is better to focus on the meaning of the action. u can still cultivate without offically seeking refuge by sincerely practising the five percepts.. However, by taking the refuge has its pro.. for me it will remind me time over time and at least before i am going to breake some percepts, i will at least do some rethinking of my action and be hesitant. it serve as a good reminder  to cultivate harder and be more self-discplined to keep the percepts. Practising the Percepts are not easy at all. Taking the refuge is like affirming desire to cultivate is like signing a contract and putting commitment into it.<br><br>if you are not taking the first step in seeking refuge in triple Gems, it could be rather hard. Triple Gems has meanings in Buddhism. It is not easy to be liberated from Cycle of birth and death by your own. With guidance from teachers will help you to accelerate the liberation process faster.<br><br>Though i don't have a dharma teacher, a someone whom i can seek teachings from or listen to. I still need to read on materials from these teachers and from people whom have are knowledge in buddhism. In a way, im learning from many teachers. Very often all of us cant really learn and understanding Buddhism by our own.<br></div>
