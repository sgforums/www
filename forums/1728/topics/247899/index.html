            <div class='col-md body'><br><img src="http://www.dzogchen.org/library/photos/miscpix/dilgo.jpg">Leads a pious life true meaning<br><br>The heart justs like the rivers which continues, if you are unable to utilize you to repair hold grasp its each immediately, you do hold the incantation, the view thought, reads aloud, the imperial sacrifices repair, and even the style of speaking excellent sees, appears the excellent behavior, these all are is wasting the time.<br><br>Leads a pious life essential any unusual place, its essence has not been repeatedly penetrates our intention to continue, and changes it, otherwise, this precious person can waste, you use the life the time to pursue own thought, rigid it creates but the samsara, in fact, is loses in the illusion oneself is unconscious.<br><br>Every day begins from the slight narrow view, does not want the wild hope mysterious magnificence, sees through these vanities the acrobatics, observes own carefully heart. Even if in this life, you is unable to transform your heart thoroughly, you are unable in the card to become aware make the big progress, so long as you very careful protect own three forms of karma, considers own each thought, although you are unable to achieve even is in the sleep sober, perhaps also can control own at serious illness heart, but so long as you diligently repair oneself each thought, diligently and reverent treats thoroughly oneself intrinsic, but is not makes the semblance the appearance, that, resembles Qu Jiwang the wave in "Completely Greatly Three To have To release such which Propitious King" center sings: Â�gEven if this does not live the achievement, also innermost feelings serene really happy.Â�hWhy? From the intrinsic level, you already transformed your heart, thus transformed your life, serene, the mercy, lays down, already demonstrated the greatest achievement.<br><br>The achievement divides into externally, intrinsic, secret, extremely secret. On the external achievement stratification plane, is the mental achievement first, but you although has grasped the great knowledge, had understood profound sees, but very unfortunate, they resemble are on clothes patch, the institutional records of a reign fall off eventually. For example, we in health time will feel very comfortablely, moreover we have the Buddhist doctrine knowledge, all these suggested by one kind of good self- feeling: We are as if the uncommon saint are wise, but, when you come across serious illness the time, your whole body burns down falls into the stupor, looked carefully your heart, it simply does not receive your control, all sorts approach the death industry to demonstrate in the dream, even if you loathe them not to dare to fall into the lethargic sleep, but the stupor can strike rapidly you breaks down, which time, your any ability and wisdom, the knowledge, could not help you, thereupon, Â�CÂ�sÂ�l should know, appeared the common custom and even the terror in serious illness continues the dreamland, this was a shame which led a pious life, even, this was Wen Si shame, has not investedLeads a pious life, perhaps superficial leading a pious life, this is on the mirror mist, how long couldn't maintain.<br><br>Next is an achievement which examines repairs, when joyful and bright production, huge follows deep being infatuated with tranquilly, even may see the assorted strange picture, and can know in advance the matter the occurrence, these experience resembles to the mountain valley yells to be same loudly, your diligently yelling, it gives you the very big echo, but vanished immediately. If you diligently repair hold, each kind of unusual experience has occurred, but remembers, in this world all unavoidably variable, if you want to have these experience, the eternal holds them, that, you can undergo seem in the capture water moon same pain, they are radically variable, therefore from examines in all sorts of fantasies which repairs to extricate, does not attempt to hold them, equal regards them, but does not harass the intrinsic intention to continue, even if is in the general equal definite opinions, all appear for not the actual five colors smog or the rainbow light, but can comfortable pass through the wall perhaps in the rockOn presses down the hand imprint, but regards as these the symbol which comprehends and produces I to be slow, this is the start which is bewitched, and because I hold roam about the samsara.<br><br>Finally is the general unwise achievements, this indicates our equality treatment life, safely living with untroubled mind in the general disposition, all becomes the dignified nature to extricate, in Yu Zixin wisdom, eliminated rigid and the worry, the mercy and the heart is broad, during the life any thing all is unable to confuse this intrinsic wisdom, surmounting is joyful and is sorrowful, safely leaving it to fate in immediately.<br><br>Repairs by way of the heart holds, we experience each different stage, finally, our heart becomes spatial and bright constantly, any fear perhaps the hope, all is unable to occupy our mind, this is road of the Buddha.<br><br>Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche<br><br>chinese version is available at http://www.wisdombliss.blogspot.com<br></div>
