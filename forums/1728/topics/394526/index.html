              <p>by Sharmarpa</p>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="bodytext">In
              as much as the Buddha's teachings are extraordinarily profound and
              vast, it is immensely difficult to be a truly qualified teacher. To be
              genuinely competent requires the attainment of a level of understanding
              which apprehends the essence of enlightened mind in its entirety, and
              which is completely free of any erroneous supposition. Such an
              individual is extremely rare. However, despite this fact, there are
              many well-educated teachers who have attained impressive intellectual
              mastery of the general tenets of the Buddhist tradition, and are
              proficient in instructing student in a purely academic fashion.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">In fact, the training of a scholar is quite
              rigorous, which is partially due to the sheer volume of material that
              must be covered. In the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, there is a vast
              collection of commentaries which expound on the sutras, tantras, and
              other viewpoints derived from the Buddha's teachings. The writings of
              Nagarjuna, Asanga, and other great scholars and realized beings were
              translated centuries ago from Sanskrit and brought to Tibet, where they
              have in turn been the subject of further commentaries by innumerable
              Tibetan philosophers. The tradition has undergone continuous evolution
              as various topics have been debated over and eminent essays repeatedly
              critiqued and revised in order to clarify various theories. Buddhist
              institutions of higher education (Tib. Shedras) of all of the major
              traditions of Tibetan Buddhism have certain areas of study in common,
              such as: the Madyamaka Viewpoint, which is considered the highest level
              of thought within the Mahayana-sutra tradition, through which one
              acquires definitive understanding of the ultimate view known as Pramana
              (Tib. Tsema). Pramana is the investigation through debate and analysis,
              of different schools of thought concerning the nature of mind's
              relative and ultimate cognition of phenomena. The Prajna Paramita sutra
              (perfection of wisdom sutras) discloses the systematic path of
              enlightenment according to the Bodhisattva tradition. The Abhidharma
              Kosha is a detailed analysis of the Sravaka and Pratyeka Buddha
              vehicles, which together comprise the Theravada tradition. The Vinaya
              (discipline); and studies in tantric philosophy.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">The more one delves in depth into these topics, the
              more complex and extensive the explanations become. It is not unheard
              of for studies to last fifteen or twenty years, or more. In addition,
              there are also subsidiary subjects such as Sanskrit, astrology, and
              linguistics (which include grammar, poetry and literature).</p>
              <p class="bodytext">Presently, those who follow a course of study in a
              Shedra normally spend twelve to fourteen years as students. Upon
              successful completion of their studies, they receive a title indicating
              their level of qualification. Their study is comprehensive and the
              completion of the course indicates an extensive knowledge of the
              subject matter. It must be remembered, however, that there is
              no-guarantee that the graduates have understood the teachings
              profoundly, since true knowledge extends far beyond the mere
              compilation of information.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">Beyond this, if additional years of study are
              undergone, it is possible that the scholar may reach a point where no
              doubts concerning the meaning of the whole array of texts and
              scriptures remain, and where certitude of the various philosophical
              viewpoints expounded therein has been attained. Thorough examination
              has clarified every discrepancy, and no question is unanswerable. For
              such a person there is no book which has any more to teach, and upon
              reaching this level of outstanding academic achievement a scholar may,
              finally be able to compose treatises. <br><br>In Tibet, composing a
              philosophical work was an extremely serious undertaking. If a great
              scholar had a solid background in literature and debate as a basis, it
              was permissible to write about any of the main subjects of
              philosophical inquiry mentioned earlier; but one had to be prepared to
              defend oneself in public debate. Great scholarship was needed because
              defects in reasoning which the author could not clarify were
              justification for the refutation of the composition and a cause for
              great humiliation. However, if other great scholars accepted it as a
              valid composition, it would bring the author respect and renown. Among
              those great scholars who were called "Khenpos" in the Kagyu, Sakya and
              Nyingmapa traditions, and "Geshes" in the Gelugpa tradition, the
              highest status that one could attain came when one produced a treatise
              that stood unrefuted by the many inevitable challenges and
              cross-examinations. As a result, high standards prevailed in both India
              and Tibet.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">Although it is difficult to attain academic status,
              to be a highly qualified meditation master capable of effectively
              guiding students is also an admirable accomplishment. The actual
              purpose of following the Buddhist path is to achieve Buddhahood, the
              enlightened state. This attainment depends extensively on meditation
              experience. Although one has memorized thousands of books, if one does
              not attain that awareness which the Buddha intended, then his teachings
              cannot be said to lead one to enlightenment.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">In order to lead a student along the path of
              meditation, a teacher must have thorough knowledge about every aspect
              of meditation, and must have practiced every aspect as well. The
              experiences and problems that have arisen in the teacher's own
              meditation practices allow the teacher to have insight into the nature
              of students' particular problems. Such skills cannot be learned through
              theoretical knowledge. Through one's own experience alone one learns to
              see whether or not the fruition of a particular meditation practice has
              been achieved, and if not, one learns how to develop it. In addition,
              every single student has unique aptitudes and weaknesses and therefore
              requires individual guidance. Clearly, only highly realized meditators
              are capable of guiding others in meditation.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">An example of the value of this type of training is
              shown by the relationship that existed between the yogi Milarepa and
              his disciple, Gampopa. One day during the period in which Gampopa was
              training under Milarepa, he lost his eyesight while meditating in a
              cave and became completely blind. He crawled on his hands and knees to
              Milarepa's cave and informed Milarepa that a grave problem had arisen.
              He was afraid. Milarepa answered that he should not worry that this
              event was neither good nor bad. He diagnosed the cause immediately,
              informing Gampopa that his meditation belt<sup>1.</sup> was too tight and was creating excessive tension.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">On another occasion, Gampopa's meditation in his
              solitary retreat was suddenly disturbed by the appearance of a thousand
              Buddhas in the space above him. He rushed to meet Milarepa and
              excitedly informed him that a great fruition had been achieved in his
              practice. Milarepa answered calmly, "if you press on your eyes with
              your fingers you will see two suns, which like your vision is just an
              illusion. It is neither a positive nor a negative sign. So just
              concentrate on meditation and don't be attached to visions". Because
              Gampopa was able to fully appreciate the significance of his teacher's
              statement, the vision subsided.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">It was Milarepa's vast insight that enabled him to
              advise Gampopa correctly. A scholar might have searched through various
              books, concluded in the first case that perhaps Gampopa should go to a
              doctor, and in the second case that the vision was a truly great
              occurrence and might have advised Gampopa to attempt to have more such
              visions.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">Presently there are many meditation teachers in the
              world but almost all are knowledgeable of only the beginning stages of
              meditation, being beginners themselves. One cannot say that all
              meditation teachers are inexperienced, but it does seem to generally be
              the case. They may have the capacity to teach the beginning levels of
              meditation practice, but lack experience of advanced levels. This
              includes scholars of eminent and humble status alike, if they
              themselves do not have extensive direct experience of the higher levels
              of meditative awareness. Scholars who are relatively inexperienced in
              meditation still serve the purpose of being able to lecture and
              instruct people about the truths of Buddhism. Even so, when compared to
              a meditation master, an erudite scholar is inferior. A blend of these
              qualities would seem to be optimal were it not for the time constraint
              involved. Mastery of theoretical knowledge requires years and years of
              study, as does mastery of the meditation experience through the various
              stages of tranquility and insight meditation, up to its most advanced
              level, which, in the Kagyu' tradition, is known as Mahamudra.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">One must consider the true aim of Buddhist
              practice, which is nothing less than achieving enlightenment. In
              considering the most expedient method to gain the result of absolute
              realization of a Buddha, Milarepa has stated that the proper teacher,
              proper instructions, proper practice and proper conditions combine to
              produce the proper result. This refers to successfully progress through
              all of the various stages of attainment from the beginning up through
              to the final result. With this in mind, the proper teacher is an
              essential condition. If one is striving to be a scholar one's teacher
              should certainly be a scholar. If one is striving to achieve
              enlightenment, one's teacher should be a qualified meditation master.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">The most recommended course of action which I offer
              to Buddhists of this present age is to gain a firm basis of theoretical
              understanding of the Buddhist path, and then to proceed onward by
              focusing as much as possible on actual meditation practice under a
              competent guide. Competence, in this case, is not measured by abilities
              to read Sanskrit or English, or the possession of a Khenpo or Geshe
              degree; it is measured by meditation experience and realization.</p>

              <h1 class="csc-firstHeader">Four Ways to Authenticate a Genuine Buddhist Teacher</h1>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="bodytext">Many
              students in the Bodhi Path Buddhist Centers have asked me to explain
              how to find a good meditation teacher. As this is an important question
              and something that many people are curious about, here is a brief
              explanation.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">Good meditation teachers are usually people who
              live very simply. 'Living simply' means someone who has renounced
              everything and lives free of the many things that may burden most
              people's lives. He or she will likely stay in a quiet, isolated place
              such as a cave or small hut in the mountains. For the most part, great
              meditators are not people who are known widely as highly ranked
              spiritual teachers. Instead, they have spent many years of their lives
              in retreat, and when not in retreat are completely stable in their
              daily meditation practice. Even figuring out where to look for such a
              great meditator is not easy. You can begin to search for them by
              enquiring from Buddhist people who know meditators, and then you should
              analyze how they live. If someone is not really accomplished in
              meditation, they will not be able to live for long in such conditions.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">Teachers who travel regularly may not be the best
              meditation teachers. While one cannot generalize, the mind of someone
              who travels regularly is likely preoccupied by many things. This
              happens because of what one sees and experiences in one's daily life,
              even ordinary things like big supermarkets and malls. Add to that the
              more exceptional experiences like having devotees invite one to many
              events, and it is not difficult to understand that such a mind may
              already be distracted. While this is not true 100% of the time, in most
              cases it is. And a person with a distracted mind will not be a good
              meditation teacher. Therefore finding someone who lives in an isolated
              setting and is dedicated to meditation is already putting you on the
              right path to find an appropriate meditation teacher. The following
              guidelines will make this more clear.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">When you set out to examine a teacher, you will
              see that there are four kinds. These four kinds of teachers can be
              categorized according to two things: their scholarly understanding of
              dharma, and their mastery of essential instructions. Essential
              instructions are the key to unlock the heart of the teachings. Each
              practice has a key that is not openly explained, and it is held by
              those few serious practitioners who were taught it by a long line of
              the most experienced meditators. Some teachers are scholars who have no
              essential instructions. Then there are teachers who have key
              instructions but no scholarly training or ability. There are also
              teachers who are both key holders and scholars. The fourth type of
              teacher is one who has no key or scholarly training. Among the four,
              only the last needs to be completely avoided.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">Of course, each type of teacher can benefit you in
              a specific way. If you only follow the dharma that is explained in a
              scholarly way, that is good. To only follow key instructions without
              scholarly training is very good. If you follow both the scholarly
              training and the key instructions, that is supremely good. It perhaps
              goes without saying that having neither scholarly access to the dharma
              nor key instructions does zero good! But in any case, to reach the goal
              you need the key.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">For a general audience in need of the most basic
              introduction, the type of teacher who is only trained as a scholar is
              very good. For very advanced practitioners engaging in intense
              practice, the teacher who only holds key instructions is excellent.
              Finally, the combined scholar/keyholder is perfectly suited for any
              type or level of student. The fourth type of teacher, the one with
              neither scholarly training nor key instructions, is perfect for nobody.
              Ironically, it is also the type of teacher that many may be tempted to
              follow.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">You might wonder how it is possible to judge if
              someone is truly learned, or if they are a great meditator who holds
              the essential instructions. To start to determine if someone is
              learned, you can begin by looking into this person's background - check
              their scholarly training and qualifications. Do some research in the
              community where that person was trained or teaches to make sure they
              have the training and qualifications they claim. A thorough
              investigation of their background is the best way to know if they are
              qualified or not.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">Unfortunately it is impossible to determine if
              someone is a great meditator, so looking for a meditation teacher is a
              different thing altogether. You can find information out about the
              person to see if he or she spent many years in retreat or not, if he or
              she lives in a way that embodies renunciation. One thing is for sure -
              if someone is claiming to be a great meditation teacher, or claiming to
              be enlightened, that person is not at all reliable. Anyone who
              consistently claims greatness, who tries to control his or her students
              strongly by claiming that is the nature of <em>samaya</em>, who tries to
              tell you that if you don't obey their commands you will go to hell, who
              is clearly trying to collect money, should not be trusted. To learn
              dharma perfectly from the right teacher you must drop your ordinary
              concepts and learn to look with new eyes. You cannot search for a
              meditation teacher the same way you look for something like a good
              brand of toothpaste. Following the best advertising campaign will not
              lead to the right teacher. If you judge according to such things as
              status, wealth, or number of followers you will not find the right
              meditation teacher.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">Just like a good meditation teacher, someone who
              wants to be a good meditator must also renounce attachment to worldly
              life. A meditator should live simply, without too many
              responsibilities, and without ambition. In order to focus, you must be
              willing to renounce.</p>
