              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Mark Epstein SPRING 2018 tricycle</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">We practice “right concentration” not to experience blissful
              states but to help us entertain uncertainty.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Concentration is the secret ingredient of meditation, the
              backbone of the entire endeavor. It is the simplest, most elementary, most
              concrete, most practical, and most ancient therapeutic technique in the
              Buddhist repertoire. It is a means of temporarily dispelling the repetitive
              thoughts of the everyday mind, a way of opening the psyche to new and
              unscripted experiences. Although it follows mindfulness on the eightfold path,
              it is generally taught before mindfulness when one is learning to meditate. It
              is such an essential introduction to Buddhist practice that its closing place
              on the eightfold path does not make sense at first glance. But concentration
              needs to be understood in the context of the entire path if it is not to become
              a distraction in itself. Concentration is “right” when it connects with the
              other branches of the whole. It is “right” when it demonstrates the feasibility
              of training the mind, when it supports the investigation of impermanence, when
              it erodes selfish preoccupation, and when it reveals the benefits of surrender.
              It is not “right” when it is seen as an end in itself and when it is used to
              avoid painful truths. One can hide out in the peaceful states that meditative
              concentration makes possible, but in the context of the eightfold path, this is
              considered a mistake.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Concentration, from a Buddhist perspective, means keeping
              one’s attention steady on a single object such as the breath or a sound for
              extended periods of time. This is not something that we do ordinarily, and it
              is not something that comes easily. Those who try to fix their attention in
              this way for even five minutes will see this for themselves. Try to follow your
              breath and see what happens. Note the sensation of the in-breath and repeat the
              word “in” to yourself. Do the same with the out-breath and repeat the word
              “out.” Keep the mental label in the background and the bulk of your awareness
              on the direct physical sensation of the breath. If you are like most people,
              after successfully noting a breath or two, your usual subconscious inner world
              will reassert itself.<span>  </span>Thinking,
              planning, fantasizing, and worrying will rush to fill the void, noises from the
              outside world will pull you in, and five minutes will be over before you know
              it.<span>  </span>The mind does not become
              concentrated just because we tell it to.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But right concentration asks us to persevere. Beginning
              meditators struggle with this very simple task. Whenever they notice that their
              attention has strayed, they return it to the central object. Lapses in
              attention happen not once or twice but over and over and over again. Sometimes
              people notice right away, and sometimes not for a long while, but right
              concentration suggests that we do not judge ourselves for our failings. Ancient
              texts compare the process of concentration to the taming of a wild animal. It
              is a difficult endeavor, full of ups and downs, but one that yields reliable
              results if practiced diligently and with patience.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">As concentration increases, the mind and body relax. Thoughts
              diminish, emotional pressures weaken, and a kind of calm takes over.<span>  </span>The mind gradually comes under some degree of
              control and settles down.<span>  </span>The Buddha
              compared this process to the smelting of gold. When its superficial
              contaminants are removed, gold becomes light, soft, malleable, and bright. Its
              brilliance comes forth, and it begins to shine.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The benefits of concentration for the management of stressful
              situations are now widely acknowledged. I spoke recently with a young man newly
              diagnosed with colon cancer who had to go through a number of tests, scans, and
              procedures in rapid succession. His wife was interested in meditation and had
              already begun to explore it, but he had other things to do when he was healthy.
              Upon receiving the diagnosis, however, he needed something to help him, and he
              quickly became proficient in using concentration to calm his anxiety.<span>  </span>This was incredibly useful. When inside the
              PET scan machine, for example, where he had to lie still for long periods of
              time in a close space, he was able to watch his breath or scan the sensations
              in his body while letting the machine do its thing. It was just like a long,
              enforced meditation, he told me cheerfully, and it was fine. It is good to have
              this ability, to know from experience that it is possible; it is incredibly
              useful in all kinds of uncomfortable situations.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Concentration is not just a method of managing stress,
              however; it is also an incubator of self-esteem.<span>  </span>This is less easily measured but just as
              important. I found this out for myself during one of my first extended
              explorations of meditation. Up until this first retreat, I had tried to watch
              my breath with varying degrees of success. I was taken with the challenge and
              interested in the underlying philosophy of Buddhism, but my immediate experience
              of meditation had mostly made me aware of the rather mundane nature of my own
              mind. The more I tried to watch my breath, the more I saw of the incessant,
              routine, repetitive, and self-serving thoughts running through the
              undercurrents of my psyche.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">At this retreat, however, after about three or four days of
              practice, things started to shift. I remember sitting in the meditation hall
              and suddenly being able to focus. All the effort to locate the breath and stay
              steady with it no longer seemed necessary. It was just there. Although I was
              remarkably devoid of my usual litany of thoughts, I was wide awake and
              clearheaded. My eyes were closed in the darkened hall, but light started to
              pour into my consciousness. Literally. I was seeing light while resting the
              bulk of my attention in the breath.<span>  </span>The
              light lifted me in some way and I had that feeling I sometimes get, when very
              moved, of the hairs of my body standing on end. A strong feeling of love came
              next—not love for anyone or anything in particular, just a strong sense of
              loving.<span>  </span>This all lasted for a while. I
              could get up and walk around and then, when I sat back down, it would be there
              again. It was as if the curtains in my mind had parted and something more fundamental
              was shining through. It was tremendously reassuring. Many of my doubts about
              myself— as inadequate, unworthy, or insufficient—seemed, as a result, to be
              superfluous. I knew, from the inside, that they were stories I had been
              repeating to myself, but not necessarily the truth. The love pouring out of me
              seemed infinitely more real.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">While this experience lasted for hours, it did not, of
              course, last forever. It was one of the more dramatic things to ever happen to
              me while meditating, and in fact I subsequently spent a fair amount of time
              trying to get it back. But its impact is as strong today as it was when it
              first happened. I know for a fact that behind my day-to-day preoccupations lies
              something more fundamental. While I have changed over the years, and while
              change (as we know from right view) is the nature of things, this underlying,
              almost invisible, feeling is there in the background. Concentration revealed it
              to me and sometimes allows it to reemerge. At times, with my family, with my
              patients, when listening to music or walking in the countryside, it peeks
              through of its own accord.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Clinging takes many forms, and the desire for inner peace can
              sometimes be just as neurotic as other, more obvious addictions.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">A couple of years after this pivotal experience, when I was
              in medical school and doing one of my first monthlong rotations in psychiatry,
              I had an individual tutorial with an esteemed Harvard psychiatrist, Dr. John
              Nemiah, who was teaching me about a rare syndrome then called “conversion
              hysteria.” In this disorder, patients present with physical, often
              neurological, symptoms, like paralysis or shaking fits, for which no organic
              cause can be found. In many such cases, the theory goes, the actual problem is
              some kind of anxiety, but the anxiety is “converted” into physical symptoms
              because it is too overwhelming to experience in its raw psychological form. The
              diagnosis is rarely used today; it has been replaced in many instances by the
              term “dissociative disorder,” and some clinicians now believe that the symptoms
              can be traced back to episodes of sexual abuse. But the underlying theory about
              it remains essentially unchanged. Overwhelming feelings are somehow displaced
              onto, or into, the body. Physical symptoms emerge that have no direct and
              obvious cause. Post-traumatic stress might be thought of as a contemporary
              version of this. Traumatic events, never fully acknowledged, come back to haunt
              people in the form of seemingly inexplicable symptoms that arise as if out of
              the blue. Dr. Nemiah showed me some films of patients from the 1950s with
              conversion symptoms and then questioned me about them. He was trying to teach
              me not just about this particular syndrome but about the concept of the
              unconscious. If a patient’s symptoms are expressions of underlying anxiety, he
              wanted to know, how do they get “converted” into physical form? How does this
              happen?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“What is the unconscious?” Dr. Nemiah asked me. This was a
              central question for a young would-be psychiatrist in those days, and I sensed
              that his evaluation of me depended upon my answer.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">I thought immediately of my retreat, of the curtains parting
              and the light shining through, of my understanding that the narrow world of my
              day-to-day preoccupations did not have to define me. In Dr. Nemiah’s world, the
              unconscious was mostly thought of as the dark and lurking place from which
              dreams emerge, but, as much as I would come to respect that point of view, this
              was not how I was thinking at the time.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“The unconscious is the repository of mystery,” I responded.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">I remember how much Dr. Nemiah liked my answer despite being
              unaware of what I was actually thinking about. I was not about to tip my hand
              to him about my Buddhist leanings despite my admiration for his clinical
              acumen. Buddhism, at that time in my life, was not something I was talking
              about to my superiors, especially those who were going to give me an
              evaluation. But my answer worked just as well in his world as it did in my own.
              Mystery encompasses the dark as well as the light.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">As an experienced and erudite psychiatrist, Dr. Nemiah was
              trying to give me a feel for how little we, as supposed experts, understand the
              recesses of the mind. The unconscious is a mystery, and it remains one all
              these years later. In bringing Buddhism to a Western audience, I am in a
              similar situation. As much as I may talk to my friends and patients about how
              concentration opens doors into unexpected areas of the psyche, nothing beats
              experiencing it for oneself. Concentration is a channel into something we do
              not have exact words for. The unconscious? Mystery? The imagination? Love and
              light? It is tempting to turn whatever it is into something more concrete than
              we can actually apprehend.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Right concentration argues against doing this. I think that
              is why it is saved for the last step instead of being talked about at the
              beginning. Right concentration does not want us to get attached to it. It does
              not want us to turn it into an object of worship. Use it to free yourself, but
              don’t turn it into another thing. Allow it to remain unpredictable.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">My Buddhist teachers, in making this point, chuckle at a
              story they often repeat. A man who successfully completed a three-month silent
              retreat came running down the street in its immediate aftermath screaming, “It
              didn’t work! It didn’t work!” Under the spell of developed concentration and
              enveloped within the silence of the retreat, this man had discovered a profound
              sense of inner peace. Mistakenly assuming that this achievement was permanent
              and that his mind had been transformed (and laboring under the conviction that
              absorption was the goal he was aiming for), he was naturally distressed to find
              this golden state evaporating as soon as conditions changed. He thought his
              mind would stay quiet forever and assumed he was finally rid of his neurotic
              tendencies. But his assumptions were unfounded, and his attachment to a
              particular state of mind was revealed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In a certain light, realizing his mistake was the real point
              of this man’s retreat. The desire to conquer impermanence by uniting the self
              with an idealized and unchanging “other” is very understandable. It manifests
              in love as well as in religion and is a persistent theme warned about in
              Buddhist psychology. Concentration meditations, deployed in the extreme, tend
              to take people away, akin to what happens when one is lost in music or
              transported during sex. The mind becomes focused, physical sensations are
              heightened, and feelings of serenity become strong. With diligent one-pointed
              practice, these feelings of absorption can be extended for prolonged periods of
              time, giving people the impression that all their problems have disappeared
              forever. The Buddha himself was careful not to urge his followers too far in
              this direction, however. Clinging takes many forms, and the desire for inner
              peace can sometimes be just as neurotic as other, more obvious addictions. The
              wish to lose oneself, however well-intentioned, masks a mind-set dominated by
              self-judgment and self-deprecation. It is often just another way of trying to
              find a safe place to hide, replacing a troubled self with something perfect and
              unassailable. Right concentration steers in a different direction. It offers
              stillness, not just as respite, but as a way of entertaining uncertainty. In a
              world where impermanence and change are basic facts of life, the willingness to
              be surprised gives one a big advantage.</span></p>
