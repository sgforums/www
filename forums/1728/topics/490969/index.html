              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 19.65pt;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 19.65pt; text-align: justify;">Once an ordained monk, the author’s
              latest work focuses on bringing Buddhist teachings into the 21st century.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 22.45pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">What is Buddhism? It’s a simple question, but an
              unanswerable one, at least on a frozen, bite-size, media-ready level. It’s a
              question not unlike the koan that<strong><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Stephen Batchelor</span></strong><span> </span>pondered back in the early 80s, as he
              sat before a white wall in a Korean Zen monastery, day in and day out:<span> </span><em>“What is this?”</em></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 22.45pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">At the time, Batchelor was still a practicing saffron-robed
              and crimson-scarfed Buddhist monk. He had departed from England in the early
              70s with<span> </span><em>Siddhartha</em>,
              Alan Watts, and Soft Machine in his head and a mop of long hair on top. The
              young man went east and ended up in Dharamsala, the northern-Indian home of the
              Dalai Lama in exile. Batchelor was thus one of the first among the waves of
              young Westerners who embarked on a quest for a higher consciousness and went
              native in the process.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 22.45pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">“I suspect that in the initial honeymoon phase, I probably
              uncritically absorbed everything and figured it was just the way things were,”
              said Batchelor, a seemingly mild-mannered but fiercely concentrated 62-year-old,
              via Skype from his home in France. “The paradox is that the emphasis of my
              training was very explicitly on<span> </span><em>not</em><span> </span>taking anything for granted, by
              subjecting these doctrines and ideas and teachings to a kind of critical rigor.
              And what you find out in the end is that most of these things that Tibetans or
              Buddhists claim to be true don’t stand up particularly well. In<span> </span><em>A History of Western Philosophy</em>,
              Bertrand Russell said that the Jesuits employed highly sophisticated reason to
              convince themselves of what they already believed. I think it’s the same with
              the Buddhists.”</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 22.45pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">As Batchelor’s standing within the hierarchy of orthodox
              Tibetan Buddhism rose, his doubt about two of its central tenets—karma and
              reincarnation—deepened.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 22.45pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">“We don’t need to keep holding on to those ideas of the
              ancient world,” Batchelor told me. “They don’t serve us anymore. They confuse.
              And then they lead to all kinds of silly fantasies about ‘If I do this in this
              life then when I’m reborn in the next life I’ll become a deity.’ This is just missing
              the point.”</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 22.45pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Batchelor’s first giant step away from
              Buddhism-as-organized-religion brought him to the Korean Zen monastery,
              Songgwangsa, where his teacher, Kusan Sunim, instructed him to meditate on the
              aforementioned koan. During his years in Korea, he became increasingly close to
              a Zen nun, another spiritual pilgrim from the West, who had taken the name
              Songil and was also in a state of doubt. In 1985, they renounced their vows,
              married, and moved back to Europe, where they were confronted with a different
              kind of question, one they hadn’t had to consider for many years: How were they
              going to make a living? Stephen and<span> </span><strong><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Martine
              Batchelor</span></strong><span> </span>both
              found an answer in writing and teaching.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 22.45pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Batchelor’s break with Buddhist orthodoxy led to his first
              book,<span> </span><em>The Faith to Doubt</em>,
              published in 1990. Since then, in a series of wonderfully lucid volumes that
              strike a welcome balance between personal memoir, philosophical and historical
              inquiry, and practical instruction—including two best-sellers,<span> </span><em>Buddhism Without Beliefs</em><span> </span>and<span> </span><em>Living
              with the Devil</em>—Batchelor has written his way to a radical rethinking of
              Buddhism itself. He considers his newest book,<span> </span><em>After Buddhism: Rethinking the
              Dharma for a Secular Age</em>, recently published by Yale University Press, to
              be a kind of crowning achievement.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 22.45pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">“I don’t like the term ‘magnum opus,’ because it’s very
              grand, but effectively I think that’s what the book is aspiring to be, a sort
              of culmination of about 40 years’ work. I do feel that in some ways it coheres
              as a whole perhaps more than anything else I’ve ever written.”</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 22.45pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Batchelor’s luminous writings and teachings, taken
              altogether, do not amount to<span> </span><em>Buddhism
              for Dummies</em>. Nor do they reduce Buddhist practice to the level of a
              pseudo-science, a corporate-friendly self-awareness technique, or an antidote
              to your iPhone fixation. Batchelor removes Buddhism from the realm of dogmas
              and spiritual hierarchies and gives it to us as a living practice, a<span> </span><em>response</em><span> </span>to the here and now.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 22.45pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">“I feel it’s important that I stand up for a Buddhism that
              does not tow a party line,” he says. “I think it’s important for people in the
              world who are looking for a Buddhist practice or something to do with Buddhism,
              that they are not just left with the options available through orthodoxies. A
              great deal of the correspondence I get from my readers is basically saying,
              ‘Thank you for doing this. Without this work I would have abandoned this whole
              thing a long time ago.’ I give people an opportunity to have a practice which
              is rooted in Buddhist values and ideas and ethics, and for them to be able to
              feel that they can belong to that tradition without having to buy in to the
              sorts of beliefs that they simply cannot accept.”</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 22.45pt;"><em><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">After Buddhism</span></em><span><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;"> </span></span><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">alternates
              chapters on the life and times of the Buddha and certain of his followers,
              enemies, and successors, with careful descriptions and elucidations of
              different aspects of Buddhist practice, grounded in years of painstaking
              research and a close reading of the Pali Canon (the earliest known Buddhist
              scriptures). Batchelor identifies and isolates what he recognizes as the
              original, founding, non-conformist spirit of what came to be known as Buddhism,
              and in so doing he puts the Buddha on a level playing field with the rest of
              us. He is as fallibly human as we are, and we in turn have access to the
              sublime, right here and right now, just as he did. Batchelor strips away layer
              after layer of centuries-old dogma and mystification and burns off the fog of
              spiritual perfection. Siddhartha Gautama and his band of followers, he
              explains, “gave birth to something called ‘Buddhism,’ yet that was very
              unlikely to have been their actual wish. I don’t think that’s what they
              intended at all: another religion, a belief system, a hierarchy of priests. Yet
              that’s clearly what happened. . . . Perhaps it’s only in the kind of world
              we’ve arrived at now that we can recover what it was that the Buddha was trying
              to do at the outset, and put to one side the whole<span> </span><em>religious</em><span> </span>project.”</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 22.45pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Despite the fact that he is a regular on the Buddhist
              “circuit,” giving talks at meditation centers, alternative bookstores, and in<span> </span><em>sanghas</em><span> </span>throughout the world, Batchelor is
              regarded with suspicion by many in the Buddhist community. There are those who
              see him as a secularizer whose scholarship is more selective than thorough and
              whose thinking is so shot through with Western influences (he is an admirer of
              Michel de Montaigne, Martin Heidegger, and the American pragmatist philosopher
              Richard Rorty) that finally he doesn’t seem like much of a Buddhist at all.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 22.45pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">“I think about this a lot. Some people say, ‘Look,
              everything you say goes against what Buddhists take to be necessary for their
              faith, so why not just drop this idea of being a Buddhist and go your own way?’
              But you see, that is a very naïve remark. It somehow suggests that you can step
              outside of tradition. But you can’t.”</span></p>

              <p>In my opinion, there is no better time to learn Buddhism. We are blessed with critical thinking tools, and have sufficient time for leisurely pursuits. We can also see the "Big picture" in our mainstream media.</p>
              <p>Karma is moral causation.  Without karma, there no need for moral and ethical conduct. There is no need for generosity either. No showing and sharing loving kindness and compassion too. Suffice to say, we can see karma manifesting itself in our capitalist society.</p>
              <p>Being amoral and inherently self centric, we create so much social inequality,  self centeredness, unhappiness and suffering leading to so much hate we now see in this world. How do you think terrorists are born?!</p>
              <p>We reap what we sow, screw socially responsibility, screw the environment badly enough again and again, we will probably see karma screwing us badly within our lifetime.</p>
              <p>Reincarnation happens if you have an eternal souls.Buddhists should not believe that(but many do). What we do have are storehouse consciousness, or imprinted memories that get passed on to another consciousness. Each of us are born with a personality even before self consciousness is fully developed. Some carry memories and traumas of  previous lifetimes. Most lose them as they got older.</p>
              <p>Perhaps, shifting our perspective a bit to our present body, our new mind is like a operating system with certain preprogramming. We have an affinity to receive certain seed consciousness that becomes our initial personality.</p>
