              <p>Ok, thanks Fugazzi for your elaboration, I think it's out of my depth to understand/live/experience, but I'll go over it a few more times.</p>
              <p>Weychin: Thanks, I'll go over what constitutes right view again just in case anyway.</p>
              <p>AEN: Thanks for the advice, I wonder if I should stick with the "who am I" koan or should I use the "before my parents were born" one though? Although I must admit that my answer to "who am I" developed after my experience and not through contemplating the koan itself.</p>
              <p>Sgforumerposter: Thanks for the elaboration, you mean people actually have gone mad during vipassana? I've only ever heard of teachers saying they've never encountered such cases during retreat before. I've actually been thinking of trying yoga anyway, so that's something worth looking into.</p>

                                      to <em>insight</em> into impermanence, no-self, stress and

              <p>Our consciousness are all geared towards sensing and experiencing "something".  We do not have the capacity to "know" that "this do not belong to me". The moment you have such conceptual arising it is no longer an insight of no-self or realisation of emptiness.</p>
              <p>The whole dualistic divide of belong-not belong is still not the realisation of non-self.</p>

              <p style="text-align: justify;">In buddhism the first awareness is of the body sensation. Cognition follows from feeling.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">The non-existent knower you are referring to is the delusional self. Buddhist "knowing" is not perception. Sentient beings have the capacity of "direct knowing" beyond sensation, feelings, perceptions and volition.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">One of the fruits of vipassana meditation is the progressive disengagement of our mind from body sensations, feelings, perception and volition. This disengagement is not the silencing of the mind of jhana. When the mind no longer engages the mindstream it has the capacity to discern the quiet advice of our innate wisdom.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">When we see the world through a multitude of thoughts all we are really seeing are our thoughts and all the attendant baggages.  To see the world without thoughts is to see the world anew, fresh and alive - insight will arise unimpeded.<br></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Liberating insights that you referred to above will come at a special moment.<span style="color: #ffcc00;"><br></span></p>
              <p> There are other definition.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">It is not well reported but some years back there was one in malaysia I could remember. If you visit some vipassana center you are made to sign a waver before you are allowed sign on. I was in myanmar many years back and before I signed up I was asked to sign such waiver.</p>

              <p style="text-align: justify;">Hardly buddhist !  Zen is undefinable.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">This is not what I was referring to. Samatha meditation or concentration meditation tries to exclude thoughts by focusing on a singular object. The fruits on the mindstream is very different from repeating a delusional thoughts over and over again.....please don't mention mantra ;-)</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Kasina meditation, while it has elements of samatha, its fruits are slightly different from samatha. Kasina works on our energetic system and is very similar to some tantric practice</p>

              Because sgforumposter has not realized no-self, he still experiences subject object duality and think that consciousness is the knower of manifestation.
              
              Of course, this totally goes against the Buddha's teaching that cognition, consciousness, is simply manifestation of six kinds that arise due to dependent origination. There is no knower.

              Muse over this
              
              One who is  â€œthinkingâ€� of the possibility of reaching (aka attaining or ...) it in the future, one is already subjecting oneself to a â€œdesireâ€�. The thinking and the desire creates (in fact) adds to the ego, and the latter is a ''phenomenon'' of the ego identifying with the seeking, the idea, a concept, a value, a position - it seems to be a addiction and that is in actuality being absnet to what is not or what is. Escaping the herenow is lost to one's knowing and .... 
              there was this man who went away and indulging in meditation or at least that was what he assumed he was practising to ''awaken'' - with the passage of a year or so, he would write to his master to report his progress/non-progess . The first letter arrived and the master read it and threw it away, after a lapse of another few months - another letter arrived and the master on reading the contents was aghast and threw it away ..... yet another arrived ... he read, he yawned and threw it away... and after a few years, another came - and the master found himself uttering this - ''finally he got it!'' In the letter this or something to the effect of this was written by this man : i dont care whether I awaken or not and dont care if others care or not!
              Catch the drift?

              Whatever we see, it is not I, not me, nor a man, not a woman.  In the eye, there is just color.  It arises and passes away.  So who is seeing the object?  There is no seer in the object.  Then how is the object seen?  On account of certain causes.  What are the causes?  Eyes are one cause; they must be intact, in good order.  Second, object or color must come in front of the eyes, must reflect on the retina of the eyes.  Third, there must be light.  Fourth, there must be attention, a mental factor.  If those four causes are present, then there arises a knowing faculty called eye consciousness.  If any one of the causes is missing, there will not be any seeing.  If eyes are blind, no seeing.  If there is no light, no seeing.  If there is no attention, no seeing.  But none of the causes can claim, "I am the seer." They're just constantly arising and passing.  
              
              As soon as it passes away, we say, "I am seeing."  You are not seeing; you are just thinking, "I am seeing."  This is called conditioning.  Because our mind is conditioned, when we hear the sound, we say, "I am hearing." But there is no hearer waiting in the car to hear the sound.  Sound creates a wave, and, when it strikes against the eardrum, ear consciousness is the effect.  Sound is not a man, nor a woman; it is just a sound that arises and passes away.  But, according to our conditioning, we say, "That woman is singing and I am hearing."  But you're not hearing, you are thinking, "I am hearing."  Sound is already heard and gone.  There is no "I" who heard the sound;  it is the world of concept.  Buddha discovered this in the physical level, in the mental level: how everything is happening without an actor, without a doer - empty phenomenon go rolling on.

              <p style="text-align: justify;">sense impression through contact(phala) without consciousness give rise to sense consciousness. There is no cognition but can have awareness("knowing"). The first foundation of mindfulness in vipassana uses this awareness.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Sense consciousness become the cause and condition for feelings to arise. This feeling is not the feeling you were referring to. This is not emotive. Feelings skandha had 3 possible quality ; pleasant, unpleasant or neutral.  There is no cognition but we can be aware("knowing") of it. The second foundation of mindfulness in vipassana uses this awareness.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Feelings then become the cause and condition for perception. Here there is cognition(knowing) and awareness("knowing"). The third foundation of mindfulness in vipassana uses this awareness.</p>

              <p style="text-align: justify;">Yes !  The vipassana that is normally taught uses knowing(perception) and the focus/concentration here accentuate delusive thoughts when it stray. "knowing" or awareness is developed as a by-product of developing concentration.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Knowing exclude and concentrate. "Knowing" includes and expands the mind.</p>

              <p>There is no knowing apart from the aggregates. In particular, the consciousness aggregate is 'knowing'. Dependent on form/matter/rupa (sense organs and sense object) plus mental aspects like attention, there arise consciousness.</p>
              <p>There is no knower apart from that.</p>
              <p>As for it being 'beyond sensations.... etc'. If there were no consciousness, there is no sensation, and there isn't consciousness without sensation - Sensation is the pleasant/unpleasant/neutral feeling tone of a felt experience. Just like there is no scenery without shapes. Even arhats have feelings (vedana) - "What, bhikkhus, is the Nibbana-element with residue left? Here a 
                  bhikkhu is an arahant, one whose taints are destroyed, the holy life 
                  fulfilled, who has done what had to be done, laid down the burden, 
                  attained the goal, destroyed the fetters of being, completely released 
                  through final knowledge. However, his five sense faculties remain 
                  unimpaired, by which he still experiences what is agreeable and 
                  disagreeable and feels pleasure and plain. It is the extinction of 
                  attachment, hate and delusion in him that is called the Nibbana-element 
                  with residue left".</p>
              <p>For example a tactile consciousness arise dependent on namarupa, it is simply this cognizance of something tactile, and because of this consciousness naturally there is the arising feeling-tone to it, like 'pain', which is vedana or sensation. The vedana is simply a feeling tone of a felt experience.</p>
              <p>There is no 'beyond' in Buddhism, only conventionally observed phenomena which are all flat and dependently originated.</p>
              <p>Matter is not anymore 'beyond' mind than 'mind' is beyond matter, since all dependently originates and are not self how can you speak of a beyond? Unless you are talking about nirvana.</p>
              <p>By the way the 'sheaves of reeds' analogy is good.</p>
              <p>Anyway I do agree with you that consciousness stripped of mental perception (labels, concepts, etc) is of course possible. But it doesn't mean consciousness is some watcher. Consciousness is simply an arising experience, not an experiencer.</p>
              <p>And because there is no consciousness as a watcher, experience is itself self-luminous - it is just the process itself that rolls and knows without a watcher. Of course I don't deny there is a difference between 'direct perception' and 'conceptual perception' but nonetheless, they are just different modes of perception and no real watcher at all.</p>

              <p style="text-align: justify;">Yes !  The vipassana that is normally taught uses knowing(perception) and the focus/concentration here accentuate delusive thoughts when it stray. "knowing" or awareness is developed as a by-product of developing concentration.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Knowing exclude and concentrate. "Knowing" includes and expands the mind.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">The koan technique originated from advaita vedanta. It predated zen.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">If zen is definable it is not zen.</p>

              <p style="text-align: justify;">Given the context in which it was stated, isn't this obvious ?  We are addicted to thoughts, to concepts as a means of knowing that we failed to appreciate our innate ability. Remember the phrase "seeing the world through tinted glass" ?</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Kasina meditation is related to the colours of the various elements and the inner colour we visualise internally emanate from the various chakras. The meditation on the various elements stimulate the chakra related to the element.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Rest assured the fruits are different.</p>

              <p><br>   Three connections are missing from the above "model".  <br><br>Consciousness is dependent on Rupa and Mental factors (vedana, sanna and sankhara).<br><br>Consciousness upon contact (phasa) give rise to sense consciousness which become the dependent condition for Mental factors. <br><br>Sense objects are not self-luminous.

              <p>Check out MN 109.<br><br>The 5 skandha model as enunciated by Buddha is a reflection of the dependent origination.

              <p>Yes... Rupa is not self-luminous. Luminosity is solely for mind/nama. Nama arises dependent on nama and rupa, having no inherent existence, not self, not knower...</p>

              <p>Yes, I have no idea on vijnanavadin but a quick read on the subject revealed the following :</p>
              <p>a. Vijnanavada has its basis in the Mandukya Upanishad.</p>
              <p>b. Buddhist epistemology is NOT Buddhist logic as you have claimed. In vijnanavada Dinnaga argued that the source of knowlege are (i) sense perception and (ii) Inference. He had essentially given a different interpretation to the perceptual and mental formation skandha. Buddhist logic was superimposed on to the skandha model to explain mental formation.</p>
              <p>c. In Vijnanavada there is no objective reality. Example given :</p>
              <p>"An   itinerant
                      ascetic, an amorous person and a dog, all catch sight
                      of a woman, but they have  three  different  notions.
                      The ascetic  looks  upon  her as a mere  carcass, the
                      voluptuary  takes  her  to  be an object  of  amorous
                      delight  while  the  dog  takes  her  to be something
                      eatable.(2) Thus with  reference  to one and the same
                      body of a woman, diverse judgments arise according to
                      the pre-conception  and the mental inclination of the
                      different  observers."</p>
              <p>   Or on another note let's say for the sake of argument that someone had told you that I am a dirty rotten scoundrel. You become hateful and mean everytime you see me and this was due to the belief that motivates all your thoughts, speech and actions.</p>
              <p>d. Buddhist logic is not an epistemological tool but a way to explain how each of us deal with our sense perception. How could any artificial and contrived system of thoughts be complete (Godel's incompleteness theorem) to explain or understand the arising thoughts, speech and actions of a sentient being ?</p>
              <p>e. Buddhist logic over time became more important than the sutra and realisation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A lot of mahayana literature were influenced by the hindu tradition and the vehemence denial by her adherent only goes to reinforce the similarity rather than the confirm its uniqueness.</p>
