            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hello everyone again. Recently after one of my meditations at night I was just observing my sensations and I realised that there seems to be something "underneath" that's kind of like, witnessing these sensations. As in, there's always this thing "receiving/acknowledging" whatever information my sense organs and mind could come up with. I can't get always "see/sense" it being there, although being in a silent environment helps. But the thing is, I'm not even sure if this is a valid observation. Anyone willing to leave a pointer or two?</p></div>

              Let go of all inference and doubts or any uncertain understandings... Let the waves of discursive thoughts settle. Then look at what is undeniably present in the gap between two thoughts without any doubts, with utter certainty. Discover what I call the "Certainty of Being"
                                
              Self-inquiry is also very effective if you are so inclined.

              <p>Hi Jui,</p>
              <p>You are doing well. This something beneath 'witnessing' is what we call the 'I AM' phase.</p>
              <p>However, you have not reach the pure experience of it ... which will appear as all-pervading / borderless.</p>
              <p>Will like to stress that this 'witness' as being underneath is a FALSE impression. The witness/awareness is not underneath ... it is embed with the flow of thoughts.</p>
              <p>To understand that the witnessing is not underneath, one must progress towards the next phase which is the insight of non-duality or 'no subject-object division'... which should in turn lead to the insight of no-self.</p>
              <p>Good luck... May you enter the stream soon.</p>

              Jui you are entering the first phase but realization has not arisen and if you contemplate further it will lead to the I AM realization.

              <p>The
               Question: "You comment that Awareness or consciousness is              
                         simply observing the various arisings...as though there are 
              two                         things:  one called Awareness or 
              consciousness and the other                         called arisings. Why
               would you posit such a dualistic notion in an                         
              effort to share the wisdom of non-dual experience?"</p>
              <p>Here is Rupert's answer, worth the time to completely                         digest.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">This
               is said to one who                         believes him or herself to 
              be a person, located in and as the body,                         looking
               out at a world of objects that are considered to have an               
                        existence that is separate from and independent of their being
                                       known.<br> <br> The terms in which such a person expresses his or her 
              question                         (that is, the belief in a separate 
              entity, separate bodies, objects                         made of matter,
                a world that has independent existence etc.)                         
              are granted provisional credibility in order that we may proceed        
                               from what, at least appears to this person, seem to be 
              the facts of                         the current experience.<br> <br> In other words we start with the conventional 
              formulation that ‘I,’                         inside the body, am 
              looking out at an objective and independent                         
              world of objects. This is a position of dualism, that is, ‘I,’ the      
                                 body (the subject) am experiencing the world, objects
               and others                         (the object).<br> <br> From here our attention is drawn to the fact that
               the body                         (sensations) and the mind (thoughts 
              and images) are in fact                         experienced in exactly 
              the same way as the world (perceptions). In                         
              other words, the body/mind is not the subject of experience and the     
                                  world the object of experience, but rather the 
              body/mind/world are                         all objects of experience.<br> <br> We then ask what it is that experiences the 
              body/mind/world. What                         is it that is referred to 
              as ‘I?’ It is obviously not the                         body/mind, 
              because at this stage the body/mind has been seen to be                 
                      the experienced rather than the experiencer.<br> <br> What then can we say about this perceiving ‘I?’ 
              It cannot have any                         objective qualities because 
              any such qualities would, by                         definition, be 
              objects and therefore experienced. However, it is                       
                undeniably present and it is undeniable conscious or aware or         
                              knowing. For this reason ‘I’ is sometimes referred to as
                                       Consciousness, Awareness or Knowing Presence.<br> <br> At this stage the Knowing Presence that I know 
              myself to be (that                         is, that knows itself to be) 
              is conceived of as being ‘nothing,’                         ‘empty’ or 
              ‘void’ because it has no objective qualities, and could                 
                      be formulated by saying simply, ‘I am nothing.’ It is the 
              position                         of the ‘witness.’<br> <br> This position is still a position of dualism in 
              that there is still                         a subject (Knowing Presence)
               and an object (the body/mind/world).                         Yet it is 
              one step closer to a truer formulation of an                         
              understanding of the true nature of experience than was the             
                          previous formulation in which separate entities were 
              considered to                         be existent and real.<br> <br> If we explore this Knowing Presence that we know 
              ourselves to be,                         we discover from direct 
              experience that there is nothing in our                         
              experience to suggest that it is limited, located, personal, time       
                                or space-bound, caused by or dependent upon anything 
              other than                         itself.<br> <br> Now we look again at the relationship between 
              Knowing Presence and                         the objects of the 
              body/mind/world: How close is the world to our                         
              knowing of it? How close is the world to ‘experiencing?’<br> <br> We find that there is no distance between them. 
              They are, so to                         speak, ‘touching’ one another.<br> <br> Now we can go deeper. What is our experience of 
              the border between                         them, the interface where 
              they meet or touch? If there was such an                         
              interface, it would be a place where Consciousness ended and the        
                               object began. We find no such place.<br> <br> Therefore we can now reformulate our experience 
              based upon our                         actual experience, not just 
              theoretical thinking. We can say that                         objects do
               not just appear TO this Knowing Presence but WITHIN                    
                   it.<br> <br> At this 
              stage Knowing Presence is conceived (based on experience)               
                        more like a vast space in which all the objects of the        
                               body/mind/world are known and experienced to appear and
                                       disappear.<br> <br> However, it is still a position of dualism, a position in
               which                         this vast knowing space is the subject 
              and the world is the object                         that appears within 
              it.<br> <br> So we again go 
              deeply into the experience of the apparent objects                      
                 of the body/mind/world and see if we can find in them a substance    
                                   that is other than the Presence that knows them or 
              the space in                         which they appear.<br> <br> This is a very experiential exploration that 
              involves an intimate                         exploration of sensations 
              and perceptions and which is difficult to                         detail
               with the written word. It is an exploration in which we come           
                            to FEEL not just understand that the body/mind/world is 
              made out of                         the substance that knows them.<br> <br> However, in this formulation there is still a 
              reference to a                         body/mind/world, albeit one known
               by and simultaneously made out of                         Knowing 
              Presence. It is a position in which the body/mind/world                 
                      doesn’t just appear WITHIN Presence but AS Presence.<br> <br> But what is this body/mind/world that is 
              appearing as Presence? We                         explore experience 
              more deeply again and find that it is this very                         
              Presence itself that takes the shape of the body/mind/world.<br> <br> Knowing Presence takes the shape of thinking and 
              appears as the                         mind. It takes the shape of 
              sensing and appears as the body. It                         takes the 
              shape of perceiving and appears as the world, but never                 
                      for a moment does it actually become anything other than        
                               itself.<br> <br> At this stage we not only know but FEEL that Presence or            
                           Consciousness is all there is. It could be formulated as, 
              ‘I,                         Consciousness, am everything.’ At the same 
              time we recognise that                         this has in fact always 
              been the case although it seemed not to be                         known
               previously.<br> <br> So we 
              have moved from a position in which we thought and felt that            
                           ‘I’ am something (a body/mind) to a position in which we 
              recognised                         our true nature of Knowing and Being 
              (Presence) and which we                         expressed as ‘I, 
              Consciousness, am nothing.’ And we finally come to                      
                 the feeling/understanding that I, Consciousness, am not just the     
                                  witness, the knower or experiencer of all things, 
              but am also                         simultaneously their substance. In 
              other words, ‘I, Consciousness                         am everything.’<br> <br> Even this is to say too much, for what is this 
              ‘everything’ that is                         referred to? Language 
              collapses here. Instead of saying                         ‘Consciousness
               is all,’ we should say just ‘Consciousness is.’ But                    
                   then what is this Consciousness that is being framed....again it is
                                       to say too much.<br> <br> To summarize we move from ‘I am something’ to ‘I am
               nothing,’ from                         ‘I am nothing’ to ‘I am 
              everything’ and from ‘I am everything to                          
              ‘I,I,I....’<br> <br> We fall silent here.<br> <br> <br> As we abide knowingly as this Knowing Presence we
               discover that it                         is not a void, an emptiness. 
              Rather it is the fullness of Love. In                         other 
              words, Love is the substance of all things.<br> <br> The movement in understanding from ‘I am 
              something’ to ‘I am                         nothing’ could be called the
               Path of Wisdom or                         Discrimination.<br> <br> The movement in understanding from ‘I am nothing’
               to ‘I am                         everything’ could be called the Path 
              of Love.<br> <br> The abidance
               in/as this Love is simply to abide as the Self that we                 
                      are and that we know ourselves to be. Love is known to be the   
                                    substance of every appearance and to be solely 
              present throughout                         all the apparent stages of 
              its revelation. It is the origin, the                         substance 
              and the goal of our enquiry.<br></span></p>

              Pegembara, what Buddha is saying is different from what Rupert is saying. Rupert is describing nondual, Buddha is describing dependent origination. Nondual and anatta is impt but not the same as D.O. Its the difference between stage 4 and stage 6 of thusness seven stages: http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html
              
              P.s. Buddha in pali canon only teaches stage 5 and 6. If you understand 5 (anatta) properly, nondual is already implicit. As for I AM, buddha teaches it as "monks the mind is luminous", but does not reify it as a self.

"I" am literally not sitting until "I" bring my attention to sitting. So it literally is body sits but only when awareness of that fact occurs that the thought "I am sitting" appears.

              <p>Hello everyone again. Recently after one of my meditations at
                                night I was just observing my sensations and I realised that there
                                seems to be something "underneath" that's kind of like, witnessing
                                these sensations. As in, there's always this thing
                                "receiving/acknowledging" whatever information my sense organs and
                                mind could come up with. I can't get always "see/sense" it being
                                there, although being in a silent environment helps. But the thing
                                is, I'm not even sure if this is a valid observation. Anyone
                                willing to leave a pointer or two?</p>

              <p> Aiyoyo !  ....so many complicated replies ;-) .</p>
              <p>First off, you must remember that mind objects are considered as the 6th sense objects. So what feeds into your conscousness come from your 5 physical senses and the mental sense.</p>
              <p>Our meta-congnitive ability allows us to be aware of all that flows pass our mindstream. If what is cognised or meta-cognised is responding then your mind is projecting onto the mind's tapestry.  This is a well-known psychological phenomena.</p>
              <p>Relax....meditation is not for you...try yoga and breath work.</p>

              <p>Thank you for your advice Sgforumerposter. I don't quite understand your second paragraph though, so this "meta-congnitive ability" is essentially the awareness? What does it mean by  "cognised or meta-cognised is
                                      responding" ? Sometimes I wonder if my poor command of english and abstract thinking is stopping me from understanding these concepts.</p>
              <p>Also, can you elaborate on what you mean by breath work? The only yoga I know of is the kind you do in CCs and gyms also. Not sure if that's the kind you mean. And if you don't mind, may I know how you came to the conclusion that meditation is not for me?</p>

              ï¼ pegambara: no, consciousness is not a knower, it is an act of knowing without a subject/object division. That act of knowing dependently originates based on mental factors like attention, and also your sense faculty and sense object.
              
              In seeing there is just the experience of sight, colours, shapes and forms, no seer. But that experience dependently originates. That experience is a mental arising - like all skandhas except rupa.

              <p>Hi jui,</p>
              <p>In my own experience, sit-down meditation is very important.  It allows me to drop the thoughts / concepts sufficiently to see with much greater clarity.</p>
              <p>Poor English will not stop you from understanding the concepts in Dharma, as most of them are very intuitive.  Based on your own experience.</p>
              <p>But you need to understand the concepts clearly and make sure you check up the terminologies properly and understand them clearly.  I had quite abit of problems with the terms used on this forum too.</p>
              <p>Personally, I like writings that are very clear and direct instead of fudging up the words (usually due to their own lack of clarity)</p>

              <p>Thank you for your advices Dharmadhatu and simpo, haven't really done walking meditation before I guess, mostly when I do it, it's when I take long walks for lunch and I just note the sensations from the foot. Of course since it's outdoors, I do have to be mindful of people so probably not the most ideal way to be doing it. Don't see a big problem with sitting down meditation, and my concentration's bad anyway, so it's something I should work to improve.</p>
              <p>Fugazzi: Thanks but I have no idea what to disagree or agree on...</p>
              <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Ok, so it's been a while since I've posted on what I've "seen", so I guess I should give an update. I'm actually quite concerned that I might have just done a good job bluffing myself into believing I've seen something, that I just happened to suddenly, luckily, conceptualized the whole thing into something that, without further probing from people who know better, might actually pass for the real thing. So I'm hoping all the kind people here can take a look and see if this is a big farce after all, or if I'm right, can kindly give some more directions. Certainly, if I'm really on the path, it's not a realization.</p>
              <p>Right now, whenever I'm mindful, this awareness/witnessing will be felt. An hour ago, I was actually wondering if this awareness and mindfulness are actually tied together, but I guess I need to observe more before I can know for myself. Certainly though, throughout the day mindfulness switches on and off, just that whenever I "looked", this awareness/witnessing is there, being the centre of my sensations.</p>
              <p>In a way, I guess I can describe it as an unchanging thing, because it seems like whatever happens to the senses never actually touches this center. It's like your friend tells you he twisted an ankle. You'll probably feel for him, but that ankle pain doesn't ever hurt you personally. I'm not sure if the famous mirror analogy should be used here, but at this point this awareness does kind of feel like a mirror. Acknowledging (reflecting?) whatever happens to be passing by, but it's own nature is never affected.</p>
              <p>Although, the fact that at times I can feel bothered by this unclear state I'm in probably means something I'm missing.</p>
              <p>If I were to answer the koan "who am I" right now, my answer would be to express this awareness, which doesn't feel like it ever changes, which feels like some kind of boss that sits separate from all his employees (i.e. the senses, the mind), which is ever so present. Perhaps because of my strong belief in anatta (alas, not a realization!), I'm not interested in calling this a "me" or "I", but the simplest way to answer would be "I am". Just I am, anything tagged behind is missing the point since sitting, standing, looking, hearing, touching has nothing to do with this "I".</p>
              <p>...Or maybe I'm just deluded? </p>
              <p>Trying to answer "what is my original face before my parents were born" still doesn't yield an answer, maybe because there's a time aspect that I still cannot see, hopefully. </p>
              <p>The thing is, this honestly is not much of a difference from when I didn't feel this extra, uh, thing. The best example that I can give right now, is if I didn't know there exists a shade of red called vermillion, and I've always had a piece of paper coloured in red and vermillion. Then one day, someone told me about this shade and lo and behold, something extra pops out, I suddenly have 2 colours on this piece of paper, nevermind that it's been there all along. So there's not much of great joy nor surge in energy. Certainly, the paragraph from Thusness's 7 stages makes me doubt if I've got anything real at all:</p>
              <p>"At that moment of realization, I experience tremendous flow of energy 
              being released. It is as if life is expressing itself through my body 
              and I am merely nothing but this expression. However at that point in 
              time, I am still unable to fully understand what this experience is and 
              how I have misunderstood its nature."</p>
              <p>Mmm... nope.</p>
              <p>Well, apologies for this long post that *might* actually turn out pointless. Many thanks to anyone who'll take their time to go through this :) . Hopefully I can get some things right.</p>

              I have no idea what to disagree or agree on...- where did this ''idea'' come from? book, friends, family, add on what comes to ur mind. One can find an enlightened mind, can one find an engligtened heart ? One can find a Buddhist mind, can one find a buddhist heart?
              I dont know what u looking for .... and the only thing i can say is that a ''good'' start is to KNOW if u are dying to yourself ( dying to your idea of yourself eg a chinese, a student, a parent, Buddhist, Christian or ...) Dying to the past in you ( esp psychological cos it is bound to encroach onto the present and colour perception of what is and what is not). 
              I can go on but space constraints disallows for ... 
               Eg Jesus/Buddha or ... may have expereineced something, and if I repeat it without experiencing it - it is simply just empty talk. Real it is - only in the mind. However when one has faith it is a different dimension altogether - it is allowing for the unknown to manifest and partaking of what is a paradox .
              
               theses are not answers nor can they be boxed in - so they only thing one can do is to introspect with no-attitude of .....

              Normally, in our daily interactions, we act and feel the role, however, if you are being aware without being indulgent, you watch your action with better dispassionate clarity. Like watching a movie, but you're the actor!
                  You have developed wa heightened sense of vision acuity, seeing things with vividity.
                  It is a good time to start developing the right view, if you have not done so already.

              @jui: what you had is an experience of I AM, not the unshakeable doubtless realization, so keep doing self inquiry cos it leads to realization. See the first part in http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/09/realization-and-experience-and-non-dual.html
              
              I have had experiences of I AM since 2007 but the realization only came in 2010

              <p>Hi Jui,</p>
              <p>To cognise basically to perceive and understand. To cognise you need to interpret.</p>
              <p>Metacognition is our ability to "know" that we are cognising. As I had said it is awareness as opposed to concentration. It is this ability that will open up our mindstream whereby insights will arise. </p>
              <p>Meditation is as varied as there are religion. There is no one meditation that will fit all people. Different personalities will benefit from different kind of meditation.</p>
              <p>People had been known to literally  lose their mind while attending vipassana or meditation session.</p>
              <p>A person with a lot of thoughts will benefit from some form of dynamic meditation where the object of concentration is deliberately moved in a regular pattern. Yoga and breathwork- can be qigong will be benefitial.</p>
              <p>A person with thoughts that move in some fixed pattern and this pattern gets REPEATED will, after a while find themselves projecting onto the images they create in their mind. It is actually quite normal. In this regard yoga, taichi and breathwork will be benefitial.</p>
              <p>A person with thoughts that are linked in a single train of thought will soon arrive at insight. This is known as the access stage. This is normally accompanied by mild bliss.</p>
