              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #666666;'>Asvaghosa
              was an Indian Philosopher-poet. He was born to a Brahmin family in Ayodhya in
              Northern India. He is believed to have been the first Sanskrit dramatist, and
              is considered the greatest Indian poet prior to Kalidasa (5<sup>th</sup> century). He is acclaimed as the father of Sanskrit drama. He popularized the
              style of Sanskrit poetry known as Kavya. His span of life was from 80 AD to 150
              AD. He died in Peshawar.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #666666;'>He was
              it seems the most famous in a group of Buddhist court writers whose epics
              rivaled the contemporary Ramayana. Much of Buddhist literature prior to the
              time of Asvaghosa had been composed in Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit but Asvaghosa
              wrote in Classical Sanskrit. He was said to be an outspoken opponent of
              Buddhism till he had a heated debate with a noted Buddhist scholar on the
              relative merits of Hinduism and Buddhism; he accepted the value of Buddhism and
              became a disciple of his opponent.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #666666;'>According
              to the traditional biography of Asvaghosa which was translated into Chinese by
              Kumaragiva and preserved in that language, he was originally a wandering
              ascetic who was able to defeat all comers in debate. He set a challenge to the
              Buddhists monks that if none could meet with him in debate then they should
              stop beating the wood-block which signaled to the people to bring offerings to
              them. There was no one there to meet the challenge so they stopped beating the
              wood-block.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #666666;'>However
              at that time, in the North, there was an elderly Bhikshu named Parsva, who saw
              that if he could convert the ascetic, it would be a great asset to propagation
              of the Dharma, so he travelled from Northern India and has the wood-block
              sounded. The ascetic when he heard the wood-block sounded, he questioned as to
              whom and why it was sounded. Though thinking the old monk would be unable to
              debate with him, he accepted the challenge.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #666666;'>After
              seven days, the debate was held in front of the King, Ministers, and many
              ascetics and Brahmins. The loser agreed to become the disciple of the other.
              They agreed that the elderly Parsva should speak first and he said: “The world
              should be made peaceable with a long-lived king, plentiful harvests, and joy
              throughout the land with none of the calamities,” to which the ascetic had no
              answer. And, so the ascetic was bound to become Parsva’s disciple and he was
              given full ordination as a Bhikshu.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #666666;'>Although
              he had to consent to this, the ascetic was still not convinced of Parsva’s
              virtues until he showed him he had mastered the Basis of Spiritual Power, after
              which the ascetic was convinced. Parsva then taught him the Five faculties, the
              Five Powers, the Seven factors and the Eightfold Noble Path and eventually he
              mastered the teachings.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #666666;'>Later
              it seems the Central Kingdom was besieged by the Kusan king’s army who demanded
              300,000 gold pieces in tribute.  The king of the Central Kingdom could not
              pay so much. The Kusan king, therefore, asked for the Buddha’s begging bowl,
              the converted monk (ascetic) and 100,000 gold pieces. Though the king of the
              Central Kingdom was reluctant to part with the converted monk, the monk
              persuades him saying it would be good for the propagation of the Dharma which
              would spread across the continent if he went with the Kusan King. So the Kusan
              king takes with him the ascetic or the converted monk or Bhikshu.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #666666;'>The
              Kusan king’s Ministers were, however, were not happy as they thought the
              Bhikshu was priced incorrectly at 100,000 gold pieces. But the King who knew
              the worth of the Bhikshu ordered that seven horses be starved for six days. The
              King then had the Assembly make the Bhikshu preach the Dharma. To everybody’s
              surprise even the horses leaving their favourite food placed in front of them
              were entranced by the teaching of the Monk and listened intently!! All were
              convinced now of his worth. The ascetic or the converted monk was then honoured
              with the name of ‘Asvaghosa’ (Horse-cry).</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #666666;'>Apparently
              the philosopher rose to the position of spiritual counsellor in Kanishka’s
              court at Peshawar. He travelled throughout Northern India proclaiming the
              Dharma and guiding all with his wisdom and understanding. He was held in great
              regard by the Four-fold Assembly who saw him as the Sun of Merit and Virtue.
              Asvaghosa was a brilliant orator who could speak on length on Mahayana (Greater
              Vehicle) Buddhist doctrine at the Fourth Buddhist Council which he helped to
              organize. His fame lay largely in his ability to explain the intricate concepts
              of Mahayana Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #666666;'>Asvaghosa
              is described in Tibetian history as someone who could just solve any solution,
              any query and could give a solution to any problem. His opponents were
              intellectually beaten down by him. Asvaghosa was also known for his musical
              talents. He used to roam around with his musical partners, men and women,
              playing music and singing songs in market places. His songs used to narrate
              about the banalities of life and the meaningless of human existence without
              faith and belief. Later, he made this one of his techniques to spread the
              message of his religion.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #666666;'>There
              is another story pertaining to the term ‘Asvaghosa’. Asvaghosa was once
              teaching and singing the principles of Dharma to a crowd in the royal city when
              the king deliberately tried to feed seven hungry horses to test their reaction
              to Asvaghosa’s teachings. The horses were distressed due to hunger, but they
              did not touch the food to appease their hunger. They seemed to understand
              Asvaghosa’s sermon and were relieved. That is how the name Asvaghosa bodhi
              sattva came into being; it literally means “horses that listen to Bodhisattva”.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #666666;'>Asvaghosa’s
              famous works include Mahayana Sraddhotpada-Sastra, which means Awakening of
              Faith in Mahayana, Buddhacharita or Life of Buddha and Mahalankara or the Book
              of Glory. He also wrote a poem called ‘Saundaramanakavya’.  It was about
              the conversion of Nanda (Buddha’s half-brother) to Buddhism by Lord Buddha in
              order to give him Salvation.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #666666;'>Regarding
              other works, Sraddhotpada was translated in Chinese language first time in 534
              A.D. and then 710 A.D. After its second translation, it was it seems finally
              translated into English language by T. Suzuki. It was called the “Discourse on
              the wakening of Faith in the Mahayana”.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #666666;'>Though
              Asvaghosa initially was a strict opponent of Buddhism he finally became one of
              the most noted disciple of Buddhism and preacher of Buddhism.</span></p>
