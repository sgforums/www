              You keep thinking that samsara and nirvana are places.
              
              As I mentioned before, only samsara is place and nirvana has no places 
              
              Don't make conclusion that you never have any awakening experiences based on Mahayana experiences 
              
              I'm just asking only very simple questions and in a logical way .
              
              If you don't believe what I said, you can ask Theravaddin master or teacher about rainbow body for clarification.

              <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: small;"><span style="color: #000000;"><br>“Based on the Tibetan terms <em>'lus'</em> (that which is left behind, ordinary body) and <em>'ja'</em> (rainbow, rainbow hue), the Rainbow Body …<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>is not so much a "body" but
              rather a vortex of energy into which certain adepts can apparently
              transform themselves on dying. </strong></span>Rather than leaving a corpse behind that
              needs to be cremated or chopped to pieces, highly accomplished men and
              women rather pass away in a mass of rainbow light. To use a Tibetan
              phrase, they "dissolve into space like a rainbow"; a process which -
              curiously enough - is reported as leaving the practitioners hair and
              nails behind as physical remnants. </span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>http://www.surajamrita.com/bon/buddhahood.html</p>
              <p>Indeed Thodgal does possess a method for dissolving the
              impure physical body at the time of death or even before and then the
              Rainbow Body of Light manifests. But this is not a process of
              transforming an impure physical body into a pure Sambhogakaya. The
              method Proper to Dzogchen is not the path of transformation as is the
              case with the Tantras but the path of self liberation. So the procedure
              in Tantra and in Thodgal is quite different. To effect a transformation
              in vision and in energy Tantra employs visualization in terms of Kyerim
              and Dzogrim practice. We visualize ourselves in a Sambhogakaya form
              whether this be a peaceful or a wrathful manifestation. But in Dzogchen
              there is nothing to be visualized and nothing to be transformed. The
              visions which arise during the course of Thodgal are not
              visualizations. Visualization represents the work of the mind;
              visualizations are created by the mind. But Dzogchen is a state beyond
              the mind. So these visions which arise in Thodgal are not created by
              the mind or by unconscious karma <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>but they are a manifestation of what
              is already primordially present in the Natural State.</strong></span> The vision is not
              something created by causes but it is Lhundrub (Ihun grub) or
              spontaneously perfected. Since the Sambhogakaya is already fully
              inherent in the Natural State it simply manifests. Dzogchen alone
              discloses our real nature; Dzogchen has already discovered this
              inherent Buddhahood our real nature and so it can manifest the
              Sambhogakaya effortlessly. <strong>At the culmination of the Thodgal process at
              the stage of vision called the exhausting of everything into Reality
              (bon nyid zad pa) all of the visions that the practitioner experiences
              whether pure or impure dissolve into the Natural State. This includes
              our physical body which is the result of past karmic causes and
              represents our impure karmic vision. For the practitioner everything
              dissolves. This sets the stage for the spontaneous manifestation of the
              Sambhogakaya which has been present in potential in the Natural State
              from the very beginning. Since it is already there no primary cause for
              its manifestation is needed.</strong> [The secondary causes for its
              manifestation however are the purifications of obscurations along the
              path. This is like the winds removing the clouds from the sky so that
              the face of the sun becomes visible or like opening the doors to the
              temple so that the image of the Buddha can clearly be seen].</p>
              <p>If we examine the notion of Buddhahood from the logical
              standpoint we find that the Nirmanakaya and the Sambhogakaya are
              impermanent whereas the Dharmakaya alone is permanent. But when we
              further examine the Dhan-nakaya we discover that there are two sides to
              it. On the side of emptiness it is permanent but on the side of wisdom
              it is impermanent. The Kunzhi the basis of everything is permanent
              because it is emptiness but Rigpa is impermanent because it is not
              always manifest. These two Kunzhi and Rigpa are always inseparable
              (dbyer med) in the Natural State. On the side of emptiness (stong cha)
              there is permanence but on the side of clarity (gsal-cha) or awareness
              (rig-cha) there is impermanence. So the manifestation side is
              impermanent; it is changing all of the time whereas the emptiness side
              is constant and permanent. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>We can logically distinguish these things
              when we speak about the Natural State but the Natural State is a
              totality and a perfect unity. Within it emptiness and clarity are
              inseparable and never otherwise. This inseparability or Yermed (dbyer
              med) is the essence of Dzogchen. To fall either on the side of
              emptiness or on the side of manifestation is to deviate from Dzogchen. </strong></span></p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p>This lalu or Rainbow Body can appear in a material sense to
              sentient beings in order to teach them. The Rainbow Body is not
              material but appears to be so since it can act on all of the senses of
              a sentient being simultaneously. The Sambhogakaya can be perceived only
              by the Aryas the Boddhisattvas who have ascended the third, fourth, or
              fifth paths [that is the Paths of Vision of Meditation Development and
              Culmination]. They can hear the teachings of the Sambhogakaya whereas
              ordinary beings cannot see nor hear this manifestation. So it is the
              Nirmanakaya that they hear and perceive. To human beings this
              Nirmanakaya appears as human. In other worlds and with other species of
              beings the situation will be different. But the Rainbow Body as the
              potentiality of the Natural State is not limited to any particular
              form. It can appear in a myriad of different forms. The Natural State
              has been with us from the very beginning. We have done nothing more
              than to rediscover it continue in it and allow its potentiality to
              manifest. That is Buddhahood.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p>E-Sangha: <br><br>Rainbow body is the result of total realization of dharmakaya. <br><br>Rainbow
              body is a realization of the nature of the union of appearances and
              emptiness with the added factor of the total realization that all
              phenomena are nothing other than the display of one's own wisdom. In
              this case, issues of permanent and impermanent are not longer germaine.
              One's realization is permanent, diverse and changing appearances are
              all ornaments to that realization. One's physical body vanishes in the
              perception of ordinary beings.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p><br>Rainbow body is a realization, not a physical process-- but to the deluded, it seems like something physical is happening.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p><br>This is sort of a misconception (not your fault). When we said 'od
              kyi lus, body of light, we mean actually a body which is composed of
              the energy of the wisdom of rigpa. <br><br>Well, everything, the five
              elements already is the energy of the wisdom of rigpa [rig pa'i ye shes
              gyi rtsal]. So, actually, a so called rainbow body is merely the
              reversion of the bodies elements back into the state of wisdom. There
              is actually no transformation at all.</p>

              Don't misunderstand on me.I'm very curious for asking answers if I have a doubt or I don't know it.Thanks for your contribution to me.
              In history of Theravada history, you heard the debate of King Milinda.
              The king Milinda also asked the very funny questions and complex questions to Nagasena Arahart. Nobody except for Nagasena Arahart can answer the questions of King Milinda.
              After the dialogues between them is over, King Milinda become realized his misunderstanding on Theravada monks. Finally, King Milinda was converted to monk and became a Arahart after his practice of meditation.

              <p>Hi Friend,</p>
              <p>Just my understanding only. For discussion sake. Also, I find this topic very interesting.</p>
              <p>What appears to us are registered by all the sense organs. The eye sight sees some thing, the ears hear something, etc ,etc. There are not happening in some place. They are the arising of certain conditions.</p>
              <p>To illustrate that what we experience is not standardised, we know that human beings see in term of colour range. Some animals are colour-blind. so they see differently. But none of us, is seeing the truth nature directly. The senses of different species of sentient beings experience things differently.</p>
              <p>Likewise, the 31 planes of existence are due to different conditions arising. In the jhana meditation, one is said to be able to access these planes of existence. This is because they are not specific locations. They are mental states. In the jhanas, our consciousness changes and 'aligned' more with these other states or planes of existence.</p>
              <p>All the planes of existence are simultaneously manifesting, but because our senses are human-based conditioned arisings, we only see the human world and other beings that shared 'similar' resonating arising conditions.

              Maung Tiong Myay Zin Sayadaw 's Dhamma telescope to see 31 planes of existence
              and other objects
              
              http://www.dhammaweb.net/Sayadaw/subject.php?keyword=Maung%20Tiong%20Myay%20Zin%20Sayadaw
              
              I want to share Dhamma telescope to differentiate which one is right or wrong .Like a microsope enables to see minute particles and also as a telescope making distant objects appear larger and nearer.To acquire a â€˜Dhamma Telescopeâ€™, one must practice Samatha-kammaá¹­á¹­hÄ�na or Ä�nÄ�pÄ�nasati .Let go details in Ä�nÄ�pÄ�nasati .
              The Buddha taught Ä�nÄ�pÄ�nasati step by step: long breath, short breath, whole breath and subtle breath, only for easy understanding. At the time of actual practice, all four stages may occur at the same time. Then, if you can concentrate on the whole long breath, and the whole short breath for about one hour, then (as your concentra-tion improves) the breath will automatically become subtle, and
              you can change to concentrate on the subtle breath. When the subtle breath is long, you should try to know the whole, long,subtle breath; when the subtle breath is short, you should try to know the whole, short, subtle breath.If the breath does not become subtle by itself, you should concentrate on it (attention(manÄ�sikÄ�ra)) with the decision that it should be subtle.
              That way it will become subtle, but you must not make the breath subtle on purpose, nor make it long or short on purpose; just decide that it should be calm.
              In this way, long breath, short breath, whole breath and subtle breath, all the four
              stages, are included in a single stage.
              A concentrated mind can usually create a nimitta. When concentration is deep, strong, and powerful, then because of different perceptions, different nimittas appear. For example, if you want the nimitta to be long, it will be long; if you want it to be short, it will be short; if you want it to be round, it will be round;if you want it to be red, it will be red. So various perceptions may arise while practising Ä�nÄ�pÄ�nasati. You may perceive yourself as outside the body. It is simply a mental creation, not because of a soul. It is not a problem. Just ignore it, and return to being mindful of your breath.
              Using a nimitta as Dhamma telescope, everything is vivid.All the cells of the body,circulation of blood and the like could be seen very clearly.Not only that.One could see celestial beings like Devas and Brahmas and son on and those suffering in hell.

              <p>I can see the synchronization of emptiness view into your non-dual experiences --. Integrating view, practice and experience.  This is the essence of our emptiness nature and right understanding of non-dual experience in Buddhism that is different from Advaita Vedanta teaching.  This is also the understanding of why Everything is the One Reality incorporating causes, conditions and luminosity of our Empty nature as One and inseparable.  <strong>Everything as the One Reality should never be understood from a dualistic/inherent standpoint.</strong></p>

              causes, conditions and luminosity of our Empty nature as One and
              inseparable.  <strong>Everything as the One Reality should
              never be understood from a dualistic/inherent
              standpoint.</strong></p>
              <p> Indeed!  You can see the how the view, practice and
              experience leading to the understanding of non-locality in terms of
              views, practices and experience.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Stage 6. The nature of Presence is Empty</strong></p>
              <p>Not only is there no ‘who’ in pristine awareness, there is no
              ‘where’ and ‘when’.  This is its nature.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>When there is this, that is.<br> With the arising of this, that arises.<br> When this is not, neither is that.<br> With the cessation of this, that ceases.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>-- the principle of conditionality</strong></p>
              <p>The self-luminous awareness from beginning-less time has never
              been separated and cannot be separated from its conditions. They
              are not two -- This is, That is. Along with the conditions,
              Luminosity shines without a center and arises without a place. No
              where to be found. This is the emptiness nature of Presence.</p>

              <p>Hi Thusness,</p>
              <p>Thanks for this post.</p>
              <p>To me, the 'emptiness' aspect was the hardest for the mind to be 'convinced'. It was too different/far-away from how the dualistic mind understood things.</p>
              <p>But after a while, this truth becomes more clear.</p>

              <p>Let's put aside whether all the mahayana translated scripture was discussed in the first buddha council. But if we are to reject all the new words that comes after it, then we cannot read or buy buddhism book anymore, as I am sure more than 99% of the modern buddhism book are written by buddhists.</p>

              Hi .......
              I don't want to tell any more which Buddhism group is right or wrong.
              You should find the truth deeply from history of Buddhism.Think about some of questions
              1)How many religion of groups have in India before and after Gautama Buddha's time?
              
              2) After First Buddha Council, which group of monk Buddhism group change and add the original version of Buddha Scripture?
              
              3) Why original Buddhism group need to hold the Second Buddha Council to prevent the danger of group of monks who want to break the original rules and disciplines of monks and change and add the original version of Buddha scripture ?
              
              4) Which Buddhism groups set up new group by combining the ideas,methods and theory of other religions and original version of Buddha scripture?
              
              5) Why original Buddhism group chase out groups of monk who want to change and add the original Buddha scripture and break the original rules and disciplines of monks from the country? Which places do the bad monks of groups who are chased out from country in ancient times go and do what?  
              
              5) Why the whole India country lost original Buddhism and became Hindu  after over 200 years counting from Gautama Buddha passed away.
              
              6) Which buddhism group prevent the Buddha Scripture by sacrificing their life and how they overcome the difficulties of lifes and danger from enemy?
              
              7) How many and which buddhism groups and how they spreads out  the buddhism towards the whole Asia, Western and middle east countries in ancient times?
