              Welcome for discussion:)
              
              From the history of Buddhism, how come one major Buddhism group collapse into many Buddhsim group? What is the root cause of collapse into many Buddhism group?
              I found some differences among each Buddhism group.Is it due to fame, power, ego, attachment to new one, money,wealth ? There are similarities happened in other religion like Christian , Muslim,etc.In Christian, different Christian groups are found.
              How is your view and opinion?

              <p>You may have a wrong understanding of samsara and nirvana.</p>
              <p>One cannot escape to anywhere. Escape from samsara denotes a
                  fear. Fear is a desire. There is no escape at all. Samsara and
                  nirvana are not places.</p>
              <p>He who desire to escape from samsara will not escape. This is
                  the irony and paradox. It is only the ego that desire to escape
                  from samsara. But the ego is not a self at all! So where are you
                  trying to escape to?</p>
              <p>Now, you may not be able to detect the working of the 'self'.
                  Further down the road you may see that 'you' never existed as a
                  separate being at all. So who is it that escape from samsara? How
                  can the no-self escape from samsara when it is not a self?</p>
              <p>Before you become awaken, you will alway think that you are an
                  individual self striving towards a goal. In this case, the goal is
                  escape from samsara. When you awake, you will discover that all
                  along samsara and nirvana are not places at all. The seeker for
                  enlightenment never existed in the first place... it is just an
                  impression of a self wondering around striving for this and that.
                  <strong>This is the cause of samsara</strong>... the ignorant
                  wondering around thinking that it is progressing towards a desired
                  state, fullfilment or goal.</p>
              <p>As said before, there are many subtle desires that normally go
                  un-noticed. .. including the wish to escape from suffering and
                  samsara.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You should learn to open up your mind and not cling to concepts
                  that you have acquired.</p>
              <p>I think you already have a fixed views of things. So, perhaps,
                  we should just leave it as that.</p>
              <p>....</p>
              <p>Regarding asking whether you are from Burma, I am just curious
                  about the conditions in Burma. I have an ex-student who was from
                  Burma. He is a very nice and polite person. After his graduation,
                  occasionally i still met up with him. He has been working in
                  Singapore for several years. Recently, he brought his sister to
                  Singapore too.</p>

              <p>This is so true...</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Sans Serif; font-size: normal;">
              </span></p><div><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Sans-serif;">''Understanding is the 
                  fruit of meditation. When we practice deep looking directed towards the heart of 
                  reality, we receive help, we receive understanding, we receive the wisdom that 
                  makes us free. If there is a deep pain within you, meditate.</span></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">  Meditating is not trying to run away, trying to ignore 
                  the presence of the pain, but on the contrary, it is looking at it face-to-face. 
                  You have to practice deep looking directed towards the nature of this pain, 
                  because for Buddhists, we are joy, but we are also pain; we are understanding, 
                  but we are also ignorance. Meditating is not transforming oneself into a 
                  battlefield where one side is fighting another, where good fights evil. This is 
                  not Buddhist meditation. Buddhist meditation is based on the principle of 
                  nonduality. This means that if we are mindfulness, if we are love, we are also 
                  ignorance, we are also suffering, and there is no need to suppress anything at 
                  all.</span></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">  When the seed of anger manifests on the level of our 
                  conscious mind, our immediate awareness, it is because the seed of anger is in 
                  the depth of our consciousness, and then we begin to suffer. Our immediate 
                  awareness is something like our living room. The task of the meditator is not to 
                  chase away or to suppress the energy of anger that is there, but rather to 
                  invite an other energy that will be able to care for the anger.</span></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">  You can use the method of mindful breathing to make 
                  the seed of this other energy grow inside you. It will then manifest in the form 
                  of energy, and this energy will embrace your energy of anger like a mother 
                  taking a baby in her arms. Then there is only tenderness, there is no fighting 
                  with, or discriminating against, the pain. The purpose of the practice of 
                  mindful breathing is to help to give birth to this precious energy called 
                  mindfulness and to keep it alive.''</span></div>

                  nature of all things. Equanimity embraces the loved and the unloved, the

                                      away from any sensation, thoughts or feeling that is being felt at
                                      that moment.<br> <br> You must not give yourself excuse to be not what you are at that

                      dissolve all karmic.The light itself is made of very fine
                      particles. There fine particles are in arising and passing away

                      from the sight of ordinary beings.The practitioner can convert the
                      whole body to rainbow color light using his power.<br> Here is the way how to develop the power<br> The practice of Samatha-kammaá¹­á¹­hÄ�na will develop the mental states

                      rÅ«pajhÄ�nas<br> and four rÅ«pa-jhÄ�nas. Repeated exercise of these jhÄ�nic states will
                      bring<br> forth the following:–<br> a) Iddhividha-abhiññÄ� â€• Power to become manifold from being one,

                      walk on water<br> without sinking, as if on the earth. Power to dive into the earth
                      and rise up again,<br> just as if in the water. Power to float cross-legged through the
                      air, just as a<br> winged bird. Power to touch the sun and moon with the hand.<br> b) Dibbasota-abhiññÄ� â€• Celestial ear, the power to hear sounds
                      both<br> heavenly and human, far and near.<br> c) Cetopariya-abhiññÄ� â€• Power to know the mind of others.<br> d) PubbenivÄ�sa-abhiññÄ� â€• Power to recollect the incidents of one’s
                      past<br> existences.<br> e) Dibbacakkhu-abhiññÄ� â€• Celestial eye, the power to see all
                      material<br> forms and colours, whether far off or near, whether great or
                      small.</p>
              <p>I don’t look up all these methods because these cannot help to
                      escape from Samara.<br> If one like to stay with rainbow body, he have to stay in
                      Samara.</p>
              <p>In this world, there are fake and genuine things found in the

              <p>Dzogchen is not a samatha practice, but an insight practice. When correctly practiced they do not lead to Samatha jhanas, but full realisation and liberation. Rainbow body is not the manifestation of supernatural powers, and is a permanent transformation.</p>

              from samsara. But the ego is not a self at all! So where are you
              trying to escape to?</p>
              <p>Now, you may not be able to detect the working of the 'self'.
              Further down the road you may see that 'you' never existed as a
              separate being at all. So who is it that escape from samsara? How
              can the no-self escape from samsara when it is not a self?</p>
              <p>Before you become awaken, you will alway think that you are an
              individual self striving towards a goal. In this case, the goal is
              escape from samsara. When you awake, you will discover that all
              along samsara and nirvana are not places at all. The seeker for
              enlightenment never existed in the first place... it is just an
              impression of a self wondering around striving for this and that.
              <strong>This is the cause of samsara</strong>... the ignorant
              wondering around thinking that it is progressing towards a desired
              state, fullfilment or goal.</p>
              <p>As said before, there are many subtle desires that normally go
              un-noticed. .. including the wish to escape from suffering and
              samsara.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You should learn to open up your mind and not cling to concepts
              that you have acquired.</p>
              <p>I think you already have a fixed views of things. So, perhaps,
              we should just leave it as that.</p>
              <p>....</p>
              <p>Regarding asking whether you are from Burma, I am just curious
              about the conditions in Burma. I have an ex-student who was from
              Burma. He is a very nice and polite person. After his graduation,
              occasionally i still met up with him. He has been working in
              Singapore for several years. Recently, he brought his sister to
              Singapore too.</p>

              To test for magga and phala result,
              A person can change his mind to Phala mind state or can stay with Phala mind state for a few hours or days depending on his wishes.
              If a person cannot change his mind to Phala mind state or cannot stay with Phala mind state for a few hours or days on his wishes, we can decide he has not attained the enlightenment.

              <p>Dzogchen is not a Samatha meditation, and it is about realising the ultimate nature of reality and experience self liberation. This kind of insight-practice is not the same as the Theravadin Vipassana kind. The Mahayana traditions also practice insight practice but differs slightly.</p>
              <p>To be quaitied as a Samatha practice, the practitioner must fixate on a conceptual object, rather than on ultimate reality. In Dzogchen it is not about concentrating at any paritcular points, but experiencing self-liberation. My understanding (may longchen correct me if I'm wrong) is that when the degree of insight of self-liberation is so deep that the remaining karmas are burn out, the material body returns to its rainbow-light essence. Karmic vision is self liberated into the light essence.</p>
              <p><br>--------------<br><br>...The particular method of Dzogchen is
              called the Path of Self-Liberation, and to apply it nothing need be
              renounced, purified, or transformed. Whatever arises as one's karmic
              vision is used as the path. The great master Pha Tampa Sangye [South
              Indian Yogin of the 11 century (ed.)] once said: It is not the
              circumstances which arise as one's karmic vision that condition a
              person into the dualistic state; it is a person's own attachment that
              enables what arises to condition him. If this attachment is to be cut
              through in the most rapid and effective way, the mind's spontaneous
              capacity to self-liberate must be brought into play. The term
              self-liberation should not, however, be taken as implying that there is
              some 'self' or ego there to be liberated. It is a fundamental
              assumption...at the Dzogchen level, that all phenomena are void of
              self-nature. 'Self -Liberation', in the Dzogchen sense, means that
              whatever manifests in the field of experience of the practitioner is
              allowed to arise just as it is, without judgement of it as good or bad,
              beautiful or ugly. And in that same moment, if there is no clinging, or
              attachment, without effort, or even volition, whatever it is that
              arises, whether as a thought or as a seemingly external event,
              automatically liberates itself, by itself, and of itself. Practicing in
              this way the seeds of the poison tree of dualistic vision never even
              get a chance to sprout, much less to take root and grow.(p33)<br><br>So
              the practitioner lives his or her life in an ordinary way, without
              needing any rules other than one's own awareness, always remaining in
              the primordial state through integrating that state with whatever
              arises as part of experience -- with absolutely nothing to be seen
              outwardly to show that one is practicing. This is what is meant by
              self-liberation, this is what is meant by the name Dzogchen - which
              means Great Perfection - and this is what is meant by non-dual
              contemplation, or simply contemplation....</p>

The body is pretty much still there for all others to see. But in rainbow body, one's material body 'physically' dissolve in front of the observer's eyes back into its light essence.</p>
              <p>Nobody has attained rainbow body through samatha -- pls remember that rainbow body is a permanent transformation, one often will undergo clinical death. As in, the material body dissolving into light and never coming back. Only one with insights/realisation into self-liberation and with proper dzogchen practices can begin to develope the rainbow body.</p>

              <p>Hmmm... just writing from my understanding only. Not definitive.</p>
              <p>For jhana meditation, it is a kind of concentration. Your mind fixate on a object. When one get out of the meditation, the jhana states goes away. With Jhana meditation, insight may not necessarily arise. I did jhana meditation since 1985 and have since stop after realising that it did not produce any results towards enlightenment (for me). Also, in the jhana states, the workings of the self is not understood. There is always an observer (self) watching the changes of states. Also, the various systems have different ways of assessing the jhanas and they do not tally with one another.</p>
              <p>From my understanding, vipassana brings about insights, awareness and mindfulness. However, it is working largely and initially at the mental level. The mind mentally notes whatever is occuring.</p>
              <p>From my understanding self-liberation (in Dzogchen) is working at a different level from Vipassana. It can only occur after going deep into and stabilizing firmly in no-self state. I am not at the self-liberation level so I can only speculate. My understanding is that arhats MAY NOT necessarily understand self-liberation. It is the stages beyond arhatship and it is working at levels that is not mental or conceptual at all. The liberation is automatic. At the vipassana level, the mindfulness practice is more at the mental level. The depth is different.</p>
              <p>Note... I am not an arhat. I am making some assumptions here. But i am already experiencing the arising and automatic release of tensions that is without the need of volitional mental noting.</p>
              <p>Just my opinion only.</p>

              <p>The reason why we can't see the rainbow body is because of our strong karmic vision that 'confines us' to see 'things' as 'material, existing objects out there' with a fixed inherent existence. It's said those with pure vision can see the rainbow body.</p>
              <p>Our karmic vision arises giving rise to the infinite variety of forms that a human being experience, and we become attached to these that we miss its original essence. Just like a dog may see a black and white flower, we may see a red flower, if we were to see the world with a quantum glass we will find mostly (99.999%) space without any perceivable forms. It is our karmic vision that gives rise to the variety of visions which we ignorantly believed to be a solid reality.</p>
              <p>If we realised the truth of dependent arising, and hence all perceived phenomena are empty of self-nature/essence/inherent existence, are mere luminous-emptiness appearances, then we can begin to detach ourselves from these visions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Zen Master Dogen Zenji writes about the difference of viewing
                  water depending upon the karmic conditions of each being in Shobogenzo
                  Sansuikyo (Mountains and Waters Sutra) as follows.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p class="italics">The
                  ways of viewing mountains and waters are different depending upon what
                  kind of beings we are. There are some beings that view water as a
                  jewel. However, this does not mean that they view a jewel [for human
                  beings] as water. How do we see what they view as water? What they see
                  as a jewel is what we see as water. Some beings see water as wondrous
                  flowers. But they do not use flowers [for human beings] as water.
                  Hungry ghosts view water as raging fire or as pus and blood. Dragons
                  and fish view it as a palace or a lofty building. [Some beings] see it
                  as the seven treasures or the mani jewel. [Others] see it as a forest
                  or walls, or as the dharma nature of immaculate liberation, or as the
                  true human body, or as body as the form and mind as the nature. Human
                  beings view it as water. And these [different ways of viewing] are the
                  conditions under which [water] is killed or given life.</p>

                  at the mental level. In another word, the mental noting is through
                  the 'observer self'. A grasping (in the form of a subtle self) is

                  meditation within the sphere of Theravada Buddhism entails noting and
                  watching the arising and falling of moments of conceptual thinking, but
                  not through the “eyes” of an independently existing “me” as the
                  observer. Through this procedure, we realize the impermanence or
                  fleeting nature of conceptual thought and of mental activity in
                  general. We also realize that mental activity occurs without an

              <p><span class="searchword1">Dzogchen</span> meditation, in contrast, focuses on the simultaneous arising, abiding,

                  aspect of rigpa that spontaneously establishes the appearance of
                  simultaneously arising, abiding, and disappearing thoughts. It then
                  allows us to recognize essence rigpa – the aspect of rigpa that serves
                  as the cognitive space underlying every moment of mental activity and
                  allowing for the spontaneous establishment of simultaneously arising,
                  abiding, and disappearing thoughts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Moreover, vipassana deals only with the grosser levels of mental activity, whereas dzogchen accesses the subtlest level, rigpa.</p>

                          realm.This condition is similar with rainbow body that made of fine
                          particles.Hence Is it still in Samara ?<br> The Fine-Material World (rupa-loka)<br> 22)Unconscious beings (asaññasatta) Only body is present; no
                          mind.</p>
              <p>Scientists already proof there is a giant black hole in the
                          universe .This giant black hole can attract every light , and fine
                          particles. One day, in our universe, the sun is converted to a
                          giant black hole .How rainbow body can escape from attraction of a
                          black hole?</p>

              <p>Sofital,</p>
              <p>Aiyah......You keep thinking that samsara and nirvana are places. Obviously you never have any awakening experiences at all. All your knowledge are just read from elsewhere.</p>
              <p>The unborn Buddha nature has never at all been affected by any apparent destruction in the universe! Not a single bit! This enables the enlightened person to be fearless under all circumstances.</p>
              <p>So what if blackhole can suck light. The entire universe is alway in constant change... even right now. You keep thinking that there is a 'self' that needs to escape. And you think that the rainbow body is another 'self' and that this 'self' cannot escape blackhole.</p>
              <p>This manner of thinking will not lead you to awakening. It just breed your fear... driving you to seek a solution that is totally safe from all suffering. Right here, right now, know that there is no escape.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can you understand this... at least conceptually?</p>
