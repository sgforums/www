              <p>Leo Hartong (<a href="http://www.awakeningtothedream.com/">http://www.awakeningtothedream.com/</a>) was asked about the Direct method which is non dual vs the Progressive Path.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Here is his answer:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Each method is an illusion. It can be fun and it's OK, but who is on the way to what? As long as there is the belief that you are somebody on the way to something, you confirm the existence of a separate individual. Every step you take to reach IT, says that your separation is real and that you have to accomplish something. When this is seen through, then there is no you to do anything. There is no path leading to yourself and there is no way to get any closer. There is no I that - by accumulating merit via a process of becoming more and more spiritual - will finally reach the summit of spirituality... 'spiritual enlightenment.'</p>

              <p>Whatever experiences manifesting, thoughts, feelings, etc... is not an illusion but like an illusion. It's an appearance. There is no denying the appearances as the vivid display of pure awareness. But it is without substance, like a mirage. Only that when we identify with them (thoughts and feelings) as a solid entity or 'me', or 'mine', or there being a separate controller of those thoughts and feelings, or there being a separate perceiver of those thoughts and feelings, that is delusion.</p>
              <p>Everything is 'unfolding on its own accord' as JonLS puts it. This will not be very obvious until certain periods (months) of diligent practicing and watching as Galen Sharp (posted a link below) said.</p>

              <p>There are many aspects to insight and practice though they are inseparable. No-doership is one aspect, there are others.</p>
              <p>Thusness/Passerby:<br><br>A simple summary I use to help my practice:-<br> <br> When there is simply a pure sense of existence;<br> When awareness appears mirror like;<br> When sensations become pristine clear and bright;<br> This is luminosity.<br><br> When all arising appear disconnected;<br> When appearance springs without a center;<br> When phenomena appears to be on their own without controller;<br> This is no doer-ship. <br> <br> When subject/object division is seen as illusion;<br> When there is clarity that no one is behind thoughts;<br> When there is only scenery, sounds, thoughts and so forth;<br> This is anatta.<br> <br> When phenomena appears pristinely crystal;<br> When there is merely one seamless experience;<br> When all is seen as Presence;<br> This is non-dual Presence.<br> <br> When we feel fully the unfindability and unlocatability of                         phenomena;<br> When all experiences are seen as ungraspable;<br> When all mind boundaries of in/out, there/here, now/then                         dissolve;<br> This is Emptiness.<br> <br> When interconnectedness of everything is wholly felt;<br> When arising appears great, effortless and wonderful;<br> When presence feels universe;<br> This is Maha.<br> <br> When arising is not caged in who, where and when;<br> When all phenomena appear spontaneous and effortless;<br> When everything appears right every where, every when;<br> This is spontaneous perfection.<br> <br> Seeing these as the ground of all experiences;<br> always and already so;<br> This is wisdom.<br> <br> Experiencing the ground in whatever arises;<br> This is practice.</p>
              <p>----------------</p>
              <p>And this is also a good in-depth article written on the various aspects of insight by our moderator Thusness based on his experiences:</p>
              <p><a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/03/on-anatta-emptiness-and-spontaneous.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/03/on-anatta-emptiness-and-spontaneous.html</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There's an article by Galen Sharp that I think elucidates the non-doership aspect pretty well though the non-dual (observer is the observed) aspect is missing.</p>

              <p>Haha, that's something I can't "break through". Put that way,
                                              Buddhism sounds deterministic and flat... And anyway, why

              <p>Ah ok I see what you mean by 'deterministic and flat' now.</p>
              <p>No, what JonLS is saying is not the same as determinism or fatalism. He's talking about no-doership, no-self. No separate self or controller or perceiver, i.e. an agent, can be found apart from the transient flow of phenomenality.</p>
              <p>In fact no-doership is not only taught in Buddhism. Hinduism, and the Bhagavad Gita that you mentioned in the other thread is basically teaching the same: <em>"All Actions are performed by the
                              gunas of prakriti. Deluded by his identification with the ego, a person
                              thinks, 'I am the doer.' But the illumined man or woman understands the
                              domain of the gunas and is not attached. Such people know that the
                              gunas interact with each other; they do not claim to be the doer." -
                              Krishna, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590301900?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thetruabofooa-20&amp;link_code=as3&amp;camp=211189&amp;creative=373489&amp;creativeASIN=1590301900">Bhagavad Gita</a>, 3:27,28</em></p>
              <p>Non-doership is often misunderstood as fatalistic and deterministic. In fact I was just discussing this with someone a few months ago.</p>

                      imprints. So there is intentions. And there is imprints -- for example something

              <div><br></div>
              <div>I just read your blook. Your chapter on No-Self vs True Self is very good. 
                                              I feel it is much better than the chapter on the same topic in the book Path 
                                              with Heart by Jack Kornfield. Could you allow me to ask you a couple of 
                                              questions here?</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>According to this chapter, basically you don't agree with Advaita's concept 
                                              of True Self and Oneness. Is this correct?</div>
              </blockquote>
              <div><blockquote>
              <div>Second, all Advaita people basically assert that humans have no free will. 
                                              Here is a sample short article to show what I mean:</div>
              <div><a style="color: #2a5db0;" href="http://www.advaita.org.uk/discourses/teachers/freewill_balsekar.htm">http://www.advaita.org.uk/discourses/teachers/freewill_balsekar.htm</a><br></div>
              <div>I think this view is closely connected to their another view which is 
                                              seeing this world completely as an illusion and dream. I think Buddhism's 
                                              dependent origination is a better description for perceived reality. As I read 
                                              some Buddhism books, when they talk about Karma, they all say humans have a 
                                              choice to change the future course. I interpret this as saying that humans have 
                                              free will in Buddism's view. Is this correct? If so, how does this reconcile 
                                              with no-self/ego teaching?</div>

              <div>I am a pragmatist, so I think that concept that help people are key.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Tbe Buddha addressed this topic, and I agree with his answer. He said that 
                                              when training in Morality assume free will, as it helps. Thus, you presume that 
                                              you can make healthy choices about how to speak and act and think, and so you 
                                              proceed with the notion that you are in control and can make yourself and your 
                                              world better.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>When doing Insight practices, you do the complete opposite as much as 
                                              possible. You assume that sensations arise on their own in a causal, natural way 
                                              and as much as possible you try to see that aspect of things. That said, until 
                                              concentration, mindfulness, and continuity of practice are strong, one makes a 
                                              lot of effort to see things as they are and stay with the natural arising and 
                                              vanishing of sensations.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>From an ultimate point of view, and from a strictly Buddhist technical 
                                              point of view, there is no free will. All the sensations of effort and will are 
                                              themselves causal, and thus, while there are definitely the impressions of free 
                                              will, these themselves are made of moments that arise and vanish on their own 
                                              according to the laws that govern causality.</div>

I'm still in the middle of the first article, because I have trouble understanding these things, I'm as much a beginner in Buddhism as in Hinduism... :p But in the meantime, maybe I can explain myself, and hopefully you can guide me on these issues...<br><br>I think of actions in terms of effects, particularly when talking about lifestyles and world views... So I cannot reconcile "non-doership" with the 'real' effects of selfishness and indifference. That's what I meant when I said that if life were not lived [actively], then the [passive] being that suffers this life is a victim...<br><br>Can we say that a cruel person doesn't have the choice to change his ways? Or doesn't the good man strive for his goal because he somehow chooses to, and not because of circumstance?<br><br>I guess my question is, what's the Buddhist opinion on reward and punishment? If there is no one who acts, then there is no responsibility, much less someone who deserves...</p></div>

                                  AnEternalNow, thanks very much for your thorough replies. I'm still in the
                                  middle of the first article, because I have trouble understanding these things,
                                  I'm as much a beginner in Buddhism as in Hinduism... :p But in the meantime,
                                  maybe I can explain myself, and hopefully you can guide me on these issues...<br> <br> I think of actions in terms of effects, particularly when talking about
                                  lifestyles and world views... So I cannot reconcile "non-doership"
                                  with the 'real' effects of selfishness and indifference. That's what I meant
                                  when I said that if life were not lived [actively], then the [passive] being
                                  that suffers this life is a victim...<br> <br> Can we say that a cruel person doesn't have the choice to change his ways? Or
                                  doesn't the good man strive for his goal because he somehow chooses to, and not
                                  because of circumstance?<br> <br> I guess my question is, what's the Buddhist opinion on reward and punishment?
                                  If there is no one who acts, then there is no responsibility, much less someone
                                  who deserves...</span></p>

              <p>Because morality and insight training are really quite different areas.</p>
              <p>Morality deals with relative truths and working skillfully within this field, while insight training deals with discerning the ultimate nature of reality. For example relatively speaking we talk about 'me', 'you', 'him', etc.</p>
              <p>These are just conventional designations, and are fine -- but the problem is when we take it to be more than what they are really pointing to -- we treat 'me' or 'self' as a separate, independent, and permanent entity -- but upon investigation no such fixed entity can ever be found. 'Me', 'self', 'others' are useful concepts and designation -- without which we cannot function in our everyday interactions with people, but becomes a problem when we <strong>become attached and identified</strong> with these positions as being ultimate, absolute, there being 'truly inherent' and 'truly existing self'.</p>
              <p>We think we are separate, independent, permanent entities, but when we really become mindful and aware of our experiential process of what we call 'self' we really see only a bunch of thoughts, feelings, sensations, arising and subsiding in lightning speed, happening naturally on its own in a causal fashion -- without a separate doer or controller, nor a perceiver. A separate and 'fixed' self cannot be found apart from the transient flow of phenomenality. There is only that everchanging flow, nothing fixed, nothing independent, nothing separate, nothing that can be identified as a 'self'. It is merely designated as 'self' for conventional purposes, but nothing inherent, independent or static can be found. There is in reality only a Dynamic Presence without center and circumference, not separated from the universe, not separated from the Totality. There is no division between 'me in here' and 'universe out there'. There is just One. That is our true nature.</p>
              <p>To add on to your already heavy reading list (hehe) there's a good article by Toni Packer here, it's written in a way to bring your attention to our whole process of experiencing to discover ourselves whether is there really an entity called 'me' or not -- it's not a theory, it is written from experiential insights.</p>
              <p>The article: <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2008/10/what-is-me.html">What Is The "Me"?</a></p>
              <p>Lastly, practice is still important -- in Buddhism to gain insights we practice Vipashyana or Vipassana practice, which means insight practice.</p>
              <p>Our true nature is already spontaneously perfected -- i.e., there is nothing you can do to make our pristine awareness brighter than it already is. It always is bright and shining, but whether we notice it is another issue. Furthermore -- there is no need to 'get rid of a self', 'get rid of ego', etc etc... always already, there is no separate self. This is not a matter of getting rid of something -- but realising that always already, in seeing Always just scenery, no seer. In thinking Always just thought, no thinker. In acting Always just action, no actor. In hearing Always just sound, no hearer, etc... a separate perceiver or agent or self behind manifestation cannot be found.The very attempt to get rid of self is based on ignorance and the belief that there is a 'self' that is existing that must be 'gotten rid of'. But getting rid of a 'self' is just like trying to get rid of the 'horns of a rabbit' -- since no rabbits have horns, i.e. no horns can be found on rabbits, similarly no 'self entity' can be found to be gotten rid off.</p>
              <p>So why practice, since our nature and the nature of reality is already perfectly shining awareness, already empty of self, already empty of inherent existence, etc...</p>
              <p>The reason why we need to practice is because the dualistic and inherent way of viewing in terms of 'self', duality, inherency, is very very strong in us due to strong karmic propensities/tendencies/conditioning and continues to affect every moment of our perception, inquiry, and relating. We relate our experiences dualistically and inherently, because we fail to realise the nature of mind, the nature of reality.</p>
              <p>And so we need to practice. But as explained earlier, practice is not about trying to get rid of something to achieve something (e.g. to brighten awareness, to reach a state of egolessness, etc.) It is not a 'state' that can be reached -- <strong>rather it is simply seeing on a level beyond conceptual knowledge what is always and already so, i.e. our ever-present true nature</strong>. Insight practices are designed for us to investigate, be aware of, the true nature of mind and reality. We investigate if there is truly a separate self entity that can be found. In the Mahamudra Vipashyana practices the practitioner is told to investigate what is the Mind like -- is it a tangible object that has colour or shape or size? Does it have a location? Or is it empty? Is its emptiness like a void or nothingness, or like space, or does it have an innate lucid knowingness? Does all other phenomena, thoughts, perceptions, have the same nature? Etc. By looking into our own mind, we discover the facts about our true nature not through theory but through direct experience of what we really are. In the Theravadin traditions, vipassana practitioners are also told to observe in their meditations the impermanence, suffering, and no-self characteristics on a moment to moment basis with precision (that is, not to even miss a single arising and subsiding of phenomena in real time!) It is this deep clarity that allows insights about the nature of reality to arise..</p>
              <p>This 'practice' is not only limited to sitting meditation sessions but what is also important is to integrate the recognition and insight in our daily lives. Once we have some glimpses and recognition of our ever present
                              awareness then we simply abide/rest in/relax into this fundamental seeing/awareness as
                              much as possible and stop being lost and caught up in our thoughts, feelings and
                              emotions. When doubts arise, question it and come back to what is clear, obvious and undeniable.</p>
              <p>Insight practice, or vipassana, or vipashyana,<strong> should be distinguished</strong> from other concentrative practices known as 'Shamatha' in Buddhism, including but not limited to breathe control, mundane yoga, chanting mantras, visualisation, or any form of pure focusing techniques that aims to bring the mind to a state of one pointedness. Though these practices are important to bring the mind to a state of calm and one pointedness so that the mind can truly inquire into our own nature without distractions, nevertheless these concentrative techniques <strong>by themselves does not lead to insights, enlightenment, liberation, or Nirvana, but does lead to altered states of consciousness, blissful form and formless absorptions known as jhanas, samadhi, psychic powers, and so on. Altered states however, are transient, unlike insights.<br></strong></p>
              <p>Insight practices do not aim for altered states, it is not about reaching a 'more enlightened state of <em>altered</em> consciousness' but simply the insight into the nature of mind -- i.e., what is already and always the case in/as your ordinary present awareness, in which different contents and thoughts may appear but never obscure its luminosity.</p>

              <p><em>Q: What specific questions can I ask or what inquiry can I do, given the fact most non-dual books, such as yours, claim there is nothing I can do?</em></p>
              <p>John Wheeler: I never say this. Many do, but it is an unclear view. See the basic pointers for yourself. Apply the pointers. See who and what you are and expose the roots and doubt and suffering. If there is nothing to do to end seeking and suffering, why talk about all this?</p>
              <p><em>Q: But the doing based on the separate 'I' is a distraction.</em></p>
              <p>John Wheeler: Forget the doing or not doing. This is not the problem. As you are intuiting, the assumed 'I' sense is the central concept at the root of the mind's problems. That concept thrives because it is taken to be true, to be your identity. Who and what is this assumed entity? Can you find it? Is it real? Is this what you really are? This inquiry unwinds all the doubts and exposes your true state of present clarity. That is here now of course, but the fixation on conceptual thoughts turns us away from recognizing what is actually present. In the end, it is a matter of getting your doubts and questions resolved and simply abiding in and as the doubtless presence of awareness that you truly are.</p>
