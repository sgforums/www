            <div class='col-md body'><p>Nisargadatta says: "the personality gives way to to the witness, then the witness goes and pure awareness remains." I then would continue the deconstruction to then say: "pure awareness" goes revealing that which is truly "unestablished" as being beyond conceptual description. This is the single step beyond Advaita that differentiates Buddhism from Advaita.<br><br><br>The problem is one like Santa Claus. All the young children across the world agree there is a Santa Claus, but differ regarding his costume and how he arrives.<br><br>They don't consider that perhaps there is no Santa Claus at all, and that it was just a "belief". But then they argue: well then how do you account for all our presents that "he" brought us?<br><br>We infer a Santa Claus based on experience and evidence. Santa Claus was a convenient explanation and fostered belief only.<br><br>Likewise looking deeper we may learn something about "awareness". Because our dualistic mind rips reality into two separate pieces, a perceiving subject and object, we sense an awareness that perceives and objects perceived. In this dualistic illusion we can mistake "awareness" as being one half of the whole. We then create a story about the half alone. This is like ripping the waves off the ocean and discussing the waves as though a possible independent reality as just "pure waves" independent of "ocean and water" were possible.<br><br>We do the same with awareness. In the moment of immediate experience as a thought or sensory perception. There is a vivid happening like the gong of a bell. Our mind rips the experience into two pieces, the sound texture and the awareness of it. But in fact the experiential event is a flashing forth of aware-sound-texture, as a unit-like self-known-event. Because of this mental bifurcation, the mind imputes experienced texture and awareness as two independent realities. We then believe in an independent "awareness" or super-pure-awareness. But unfortunately this is a belief that we can successfully verify in dualistic vision from moment to moment, just like looking at pictures of Santa Claus that prove his existence. We remain trapped in our own self-validating loop of dualistic illusion.<br><br>Then some guy comes along and says: Hey! There is no Santa Claus and no "awareness" either! Ho, ho ho..,</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Beyond Awareness...<br><br>Its interesting how these discussions evolve between the "awareness" approach and the other regarding the "emptiness" approach. Some I think get the idea that awareness "disappears" in the "emptiness of awareness" insight. It doesn't disappear by any means, so its not that "awareness" is seen to be an illusion. What is the illusion is that "awareness" exists on its own side as a "perceiver", as though experiences are arising "to awareness".<br><br>I found when this is really seen clearly, experiences appearing like the gong sound of a bell, contain the "awareness" element as the sound itself, without a "listener". In Dzogchen all phenomena are described as "essence, nature and energy". Essence is the empty aspect, nature is the clarity and awareness luminosity aspect, and energy is the formative aspect. Energy (thugje) implies a quality of "compassionate reflexiveness" that runs through the whole continuum as Bodhicitta.<br><br>So cognitive awareness is a quality of all experience, inherently so or the experiences would never be known, its just not a separate viewer of experience. In Dzogchen one can speak freely of the cognitive "clarity" aspect as though it was a stand-alone phenomena. In fact it is this aspect that is pointed out in what is called a "direct introduction". The intelligence is the "clarity" as "wisdom" (yeshe). Therefore the empty aspect is never absent of awareness-clarity, nor are the appearances. So we could invent a new word: "empty-awareness-luminous-appearances" and I would add that there is an overall "intent" embedded in that totality as a "resonating compassionate concern" as Bodhicitta. As such there is no reason to postulate a background awareness or Brahman. Its all self-contained as non-dual "empty-awareness-luminous-appearances".<br><br>We could further refer to "empty-awareness-luminous-appearances" as simply "Buddha Nature". That would mean that all phenomenal and cognitive aspects could be called "Buddha Nature". The term Buddha Nature also implies this quality of a Buddha, compassion. How is this compassion expressed? It is the compassionate action of "awakening" due to pointing out the "right view" that allows the release of all suffering.<br><br>To clarify: The Buddha Nature is empty, yet is cognitively bright, and has a quality of self-presenting itself as appearances called "experience". It also has the Buddha qualities of compassion, wisdom and power. The Buddha Nature is never absent at any time as it is all there is on any level. Hence we can more easily understand Dogen's and others comments that "mountains, rivers, streams and the grasses" are all the Buddha Nature. There is only Buddha Nature.<br><br>The empty aspect of the Buddha Nature means its is intrinsically free of inherently existing afflictions and substance, yet the luminous clarity and compassionate "alive responsiveness" aspect ensures it's functions for the benefit of all. "Buddhahood for all" is embedded in the display as Bodhicitta and therefore we can always find the true Guru or Buddha within. Its the very essence of what we are.</p></div>

              <p>I'm glad he's come to this level of clarity after decades being stuck on a substantialist view...<br><br>------------</p>
              <p>Jax:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br> Some thoughts on "emptiness and appearances":<br> <br> Some may think that "emptiness" and appearances are two different 
              phenomena or aspects of one reality. But if we think like that we are 
              seeing reality as compounded not non-dual.<br> <br> Some may think that appearances arise from emptiness, but in fact there 
              is no "causal connection". Appearances are emptiness, not in a "cause 
              and effect" relationship, but in the fact that what we call an 
              appearance is merely a web of relationships that can't be ascertained to
               be any one apparent part more than another. The absence of the 
              independently existing nature of the appearance is its emptiness. Its 
              empty of itself. So you don't find the emptiness of appearances in some 
              other place or time than as the appearance itself. Its also not that the
               emptiness is "within" or the "true nature" of the appearance either. 
              The appearance is itself emptiness as it can't be found to exist as the 
              mind believes it to exist. There is indeed an energy event occurring, 
              but there is no way to really pin it down. That's as futile as trying 
              separate a river from the river bed, gravity, and movement. Rarely do we
               consider those aspects as defining a river. But there is no possibility
               of there being a river without those aspects being present. So it is 
              also with all appearances, they only "exist" as within their total 
              context, which in itself has no center or border. This can give a sense 
              of the "feeling" of emptiness.<br> <br> If appearances were caused, that would mean something was actually 
              "caused" and therefore having been caused, now "exists". If we examine 
              any apparent "existent", we won't be able to find a fixed unit of a 
              "something". There are only interdependent relationships. The caused 
              "thing" disappears amongst its various aspects and conditions that in 
              themselves can't be pinned down as being any one thing either. Since 
              there are clearly no "caused" things, then that means "cause and effect"
               is an illusion. There is just a flow of inter-dependent relationships, 
              none of which ever attain the legitimate status of being either a 
              "cause" or an "effect".<br> <br> When applying this insight to the notion of there being a "self", we 
              also will fail in finding any one "thing" that we can point to as this 
              "entity" known as a self. It too will become lost in a web of 
              inter-dependent relationships without any one part waving its hand in 
              the air saying "Hey this part is the real me!". Well, almost not any 
              part, except for the "I" or "me". So when we look for this "me", what do
               we find? Can we separate an independent "me" apart from its context any
               more successfully than we could with separating a river from its river 
              bed, gravity and motion? In this case the "me" is inseparable from 
              thoughts, self-images, memories, emotions, feelings, identity-stories, 
              the body, consciousness, awareness and sensory experience. Pondering 
              this we may get the sense of the empty nature of the "me".<br> <br> Who would you be without your story of "me"? Don't answer that question 
              with another "story"! Don't answer that question with a concept, word, 
              sentence or thought. What you may be experiencing in this moment if you 
              followed the instruction, is the "emptiness of "me" or self".<br> <br> The appearance as a "me" or self is now seen to be "empty of itself". 
              Having recognized the two-fold nature of emptiness of "things" and 
              emptiness of "self"... we simply continue without the futile effort of 
              reifying appearances beyond their own emptiness and hence find unbounded
               openness as the true nature of experience.<br> <br> <span id=".reactRoot[18].[1][4][1]{comment656611271032759_656614597699093}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2]"><span id=".reactRoot[18].[1][4][1]{comment656611271032759_656614597699093}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0"><span id=".reactRoot[18].[1][4][1]{comment656611271032759_656614597699093}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[0]">"Cause and effect" exist, but only conceptually.</span></span></span><br> <br> ------------<br> <br> What's occurring when any appearance is known, is that a "thought" is 
              appearing, a sense of consciousness is appearing, a feeling is 
              appearing, a perception is appearing, a choice is appearing,a sense of 
              an identity is appearing, an action is appearing. But in all that 
              activity there is no one "doing" it or thinking it or choosing the 
              action nor is there a consciousness or an awareness that is perceiving 
              the arising energies. A flashing forth is just what is happening, like 
              individual frames in a movie, each frame a complete presentation in 
              itself. But no one is watching the movie, nothing is aware of the movie.
               The movie is self-known, frame by frame bursting forth in vivid clarity
               as vivid clarity... how wonderful, how amazing!<br> <br> <span id=".reactRoot[5].[1][4][1]{comment657539297606623_657540384273181}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2]"><span id=".reactRoot[5].[1][4][1]{comment657539297606623_657540384273181}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0"><span id=".reactRoot[5].[1][4][1]{comment657539297606623_657540384273181}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[0]">Every appearance is the self-display of "Buddha Nature" flashing forth as the "ten thousand things"...</span></span></span></p>

              <p>When we speak or think about the quality of awareness, </p>
              <p>there is also a subtle danger of trying to cast it into the form of </p>
              <p>some kind of immaterial thing or process. The word “aware-</p>
              <p>ness” is an abstract noun, and we get so used to relating to </p>
              <p>ordinary objects through conceptualizing them that we allow </p>
              <p>the habit to overflow and we can end up conceiving aware -</p>
              <p>ness in the same way. The heart can be aware, but trying to </p>
              <p>make awareness an object, in the same way that we would a </p>
              <p>tree or a thought, is a frustrating process. Ajahn Chah warned </p>
              <p>against this, often saying:</p>

              <p>can see their own eyes. I can see your eyes but I can’t see my </p>
              <p>eyes. I’m sitting right here, I’ve got two eyes and I can’t see them. </p>
              <p>But you can see my eyes. But there’s no need for me to see my </p>
              <p>eyes because I can see! It’s ridiculous, isn’t it? If I started saying </p>
              <p>“Why can’t I see my own eyes?” you’d think “Ajahn Sume-</p>
              <p>dho’s really weird, isn’t he!” Looking in a mirror you can see a </p>
              <p>reflection, but that’s not your eyes, it’s a reflection of your eyes. </p>
              <p>There’s no way that I’ve been able to look and see my own eyes, </p>
              <p>but then it’s not necessary to see your own eyes. It’s not neces-</p>
              <p>sary to know who it is that knows—because there’s knowing.</p>
              <p>~ Ajahn Sumedho, “What is the Citta?”  </p>
              <p>Forest Sangha Newsletter, October 1988</p>
              <p>This very error is the reason why it’s perhaps wiser to use </p>
              <p>a term such as “knowing” instead of “transcendent wisdom” </p>
              <p>or “awareness.” As a gerund it is a verb-noun, thus lending </p>
              <p>it a more accurate quality of immanence, activity, and non-</p>
              <p>thingness. The process of awakening not only breaks down </p>
              <p>subject-object relationships, it also breaks down the very for-</p>
              <p>mulation of “things.” </p>
              <p>Some years ago Buckminster Fuller published a book enti-</p>
              <p>tled I Seem to Be a Verb, and more recently, and more expan-</p>
              <p>sively, Rabbi David Cooper published God is a Verb. Both of </p>
              <p>these were attempts to counteract the floodtide of formula -</p>
              <p>tions of reality as “things” that the untrained, conditioned </p>
              <p>mind is prone to generating.</p>
