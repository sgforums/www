            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>The following two articles are from the book "The Silent Question: Meditating in the Stilness of Not-Knowing" by Toni Packer while the last article is by the same author in the book "The Wonder of Presence". I was first introduced to Toni Packer by Thusness who thinks her writings on Presence and non-duality is quite good.<br><br><strong><span class="large">About Ego</span></strong><br><br>Can we start with distrusting <span style="font-style: italic;">ideas</span> about others and ourselves the next time we feel their oppressive weight? Statements like Â“IÂ’m no good at thisÂ” or Â“IÂ’m too good for thisÂ” or Â“People donÂ’t like me Â– they donÂ’t talk well about meÂ” can be questioned for their validity. Â“How do I know that this is true?Â” Questioning not only the relevance of such statements but also the soundness of the emotions and tensions that grow out of labelling each other Â“goodÂ” or Â“bad.Â” Can we look and listen inwardly to track down this Â“me,Â” this Â“I,Â” every time it makes itself painfully or pleasantly felt? What is it really?<br><br>New space creates itself out of genuine curiosity, serious questioning. What is this Â“meÂ” that seems so much at the center of our stories Â– creating conflicts, suffering, unfulfilled wanting, pleasures, and a sense of insufficiency resonating deeply within us?<br><br>Does everybody know and experience feelings of insufficiency? Very likely we all do. We are born as helpless, vulnerable creatures. Though the newborn baby is amazingly whole and complete, it canÂ’t fend for itself, and it does not Â“knowÂ” about itself. ItÂ’s totally at the mercy of other peopleÂ’s feedback, gathering and embodying in a growing sense of personality (Â“meÂ”-ness) whatever judgments, descriptions, and labels have been given it by others: Â“YouÂ’re a good baby,Â” Â“YouÂ’re a bad boy,Â” Â“YouÂ’re so cute,Â” Â“You are smart, talented, clumsy, lazy, angry, bright, dull.Â” These verbal attributes build up a construct of Â“selfÂ” in the brain that causes alternating pleasure, pain, sorrow, and infatuated attachment. We are deeply convinced that we actually <span style="font-style: italic;">are</span> those different images, arenÂ’t we?<br><br>But we are also free to question the validity of self-images. If it becomes increasingly transparent how much they dominate our thinking and reacting, space may open up to actually see them and see <span style="font-style: italic;">through</span> them as sheer imagery bare of reality. Then the question arises naturally: Is <span style="font-style: italic;">that</span> what I am Â– a buildup of images, stories Â– or is there something true to this Â“meÂ” other than projection upon projection?<br><br>Last night during group dialogue, somebody reported feeling painfully rejected when her husband didnÂ’t happily accept the leftover soup she had offered him for supper. He just said, Â“IÂ’ll cook for myself.Â” Hearing this as a participant in someone elseÂ’s story, we may think, Â“What an unkind response!Â” We will remember our own experiences of Â“rejectionÂ” and sympathize with the person, entering into someone elseÂ’s story like stepping onto slippery ice.<br><br>But first letÂ’s wonder for a moment if it is really an insult to be refused an offer of leftovers with the comment, Â“IÂ’ll cook for myself.Â” Is it inevitable that one would feel rejected and hurt by that remark, with all that goes with feeling hurt? How easy living would be if we stayed off that slippery ice of vulnerable self-images?<br><br>Reactions of hurt arise from habit. There is also the tacit assumption that we <span style="font-style: italic;">ought</span> to feel rejected and <span style="font-style: italic;">ought</span> to show our hurt to the Â“offender.Â” Then things either run their course through pouting or hurting back, or the whole reaction can be seen at one glance, with the liberating question Â“Does it really have to keep on going that way?Â”<br><br>The difficulty in our relationships is that we donÂ’t see our mutual images as transparent projections, but take them personally as truth and thus keep smarting in their wake: Â“That person doesnÂ’t appreciate me; she is moody and I canÂ’t deal with moody people. IÂ’ve got to stay away from her and talk to others to find out whether they agree with me about her.Â” We attribute things to others and to ourselves that may not be accurate at all.<br><br>No need to make matters complicated. Just to keep open the simple question whether one needs to feel rejected, or whether one can see a situation <span style="font-style: italic;">factually</span> the way it is: Â“He doesnÂ’t want me to fix him leftover soup but rather wants to cook for himself.Â” ThatÂ’s clear. Finished.<br><br>There is tremendous investment in this Â“I,Â” the center of the story, longing for gratitude and love. This person herself admitted after a moment of reflection, Â“I was probably not intending kindness toward him at all. I was doing it for myself. Yet I wanted to be seen as a nice, thoughtful, helpful wife.Â” Then what happens when our desire to be seen as kind and thoughtful falls flat?<br><br>Can we let go of the expectation of gratitude? How quickly can it drop? It takes a flexible, Â“seeingÂ” mind to let go of a story about Â“me,Â” the victim. Story making is one of the most favourite occupations of the brain, but it neednÂ’t become emotionally entangling. Awareness need not be clouded by emotional reactions. When self-centered (emotional) stuff is left out of the picture, our relationships become easier and lighter.<br><br>All of us walk around wrapped in all kinds of changing moods that are woven out of thinking about Â“who knows what about me.Â” Just like the weather that doesnÂ’t have much stability, our moods change all the time depending on whether we assume people are thinking well of us or not. Recollecting that someone disliked me creates an immediate mental burden, just as remembering someoneÂ’s approving remarks or smile frees up the burden.<br><br>Can we live around a person who is temporarily under the cloud of moodiness and not take it personally? Without getting annoyed by it? Or do thoughts immediately start spinning:Â” He would not talk like that, not treat me that way. It clearly shows that he doesnÂ’t like me.Â” Â“IÂ’m not worthy of being loved.Â” Just see all these ideas stirring around like drifting clouds. Why take them personally? Just let them be seen the way they are drifting in this moment. Can we agree that taking it easier with our temporary moods makes them dissipate faster? They need not be justified or defended! We help each other greatly by accepting each otherÂ’s moodiness, letting it be a passing mind-state that we know weÂ’re all burdened with at one time or another. When the sun appears from behind the cloud cover, how liberating is the effect upon our moods!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">Am I My Body?</span></strong><br><br><blockquote>We can wisely admonish others and ourselves: "Don't be identified with your body." But what does that mean? Try not to settle superficially for the words but ask what they really point to, so that we can understand each other more deeply.</blockquote>ItÂ’s a day heavy with clouds and humidity. You feel it as you walk through the meadows, wetness penetrating shoes and socks Â– you feel wet and cold on your toes. Grasses sparkle with moisture, with translucent droplets of pearl. These grasses! It never tires to look at them, all the varied colours and shapes and their graceful movements in the wind.<br><br>Today I walked down into the lower meadow, the tops of blades full with yellow seeds. Some were tall enough to touch the clouds! CouldnÂ’t go far since the feet were hurting badly- I had to limp along the mowed path, feeling a bit foolish. IÂ’m saying this so you need not ask me, Â“WhatÂ’s the matter with your feet?Â” Right now they are happily resting on a stool Â– burning, yet thankful for the cooling air. Discomfort is passing. ThatÂ’s the amazing thing about all the different states of bodymind: They pass. They come, they go. Some of them linger, but they will change eventually. The art of living is not to make stories about any of them, because stories linger longer than the states theyÂ’re describing. Much longer. For centuries sometimes.<br><br>People often affirm what we read in traditional texts from the East: Â“I am not my body.Â” Â“you are not your body!Â” It can be beneficial to use those words like a mantra worth repeating when one is strongly identified with Â“myÂ” hurting body, painfully worried about it. It can be helpful when a set of fresh words replaces worn-out, depressing phrases.<br><br>Does it bring about some relief to hear, Â“YouÂ’re not your bodyÂ”? Up to a point, yes. But it only goes so far, since a voice immediately replies,Â” It does feel that <span style="font-style: italic;">I</span> am my body! These are Â‘myÂ’ aching feet, not <span style="font-style: italic;">yours</span>. It definitely feels that II am the owner of this body, no one else.Â”<br><br>So, then, what do we mean by this Â“I,Â” and what about this ownership? Are we willing to inquire deeply into this? Watching the state of mind, the effect of the words upon the organism when we say, Â“<span style="font-style: italic;">I</span> am in pain,Â” Â“ItÂ’s <span style="font-style: italic;">my</span> body,Â” Â“YouÂ’re hurting <span style="font-style: italic;">me</span>,Â” or when we (deliberately at first) leave out these powerful words and simply describe what is going on? Like Â“Right now there is pain in the feet,Â” or Â“It really hurts when you say those words.Â”<br><br>We can wisely admonish others and ourselves: Â“DonÂ’t be identified with your body.Â” But what does that mean? Try not to settle superficially for the words but ask what they really point to, so that we can understand each other more deeply. DonÂ’t just accept what Toni is saying. Question it. We can question together. Then the one who says things is invited to look, to speak out of that depth of looking.<br><br>What does it mean to be identified with this body? Does it mean that it is the most essential part of the story? We can hear that story when we listen inwardly, let what goes on in thought become transparent. This story about me and my body is as long and as old as I am, and itÂ’s taken for a true representation of what I am.<br><br>Is that what <span style="font-style: italic;">identification</span> means? An integral part of the story is the Â“me,Â” believed to be (in) this body. If you ask me, Â“What are you or who are you?Â” I can give you my name and instantly point to this body, saying, Â“This is me.Â”<br><br>I remember going through all this many years ago, racking my brain about Â“IÂ” and Â“me,Â” trying to get to the root of it while driving to Rochester on the interstate. And if you, too, are interested in finding this out, go quietly into it any time it comes up for you. It is amazing to experience this quandary, this wondering, and investigating into not-knowing, because it really seems to exercise the brain and allow it to move outside its accustomed pathways of talking and thinking. Questioning can shake it up, loosen its stuckness. Like weÂ’ve said before, Â“cracking the cement of language.Â”<br><br>So when  I say I am not my body, does it mean itÂ’s no longer part of this picture story? This story has ended, maybe just for a moment, for the time being. A moment here doesnÂ’t mean measured time- it simply means seamless space of awareness.<br><br>So, for a moment not thinking in words about me and my body, its past and its future-  does that open up free space? Try it, find out. Or maybe itÂ’s just an exercise in deliberately speaking differently, which is all right too. ItÂ’s still a good exercise not to think and talk in words about Â“me and my body.Â” But then maybe for an instant there is a true opening Â– the habitual routine is gone and there are just birds twittering and the fan humming, a voice producing words, body vibrating with sound, muscles flexing gently, breathing in and out Â– all of that right here fleetingly filling open space. And as you walk through the glistening meadow, here are the tall grasses and the clouds, the beauty of every single sparkling blade. What amazing works of art each single one off them is Â– tall and slender, with yellow seedpods delicately waving in the breeze.<br><br>Does the mind come in and say, Â“Now I understand what it means, I am not my body Â– I am the whole,Â” or whatever words have been said about it? Does thought say, Â“I am that, I am this?Â” Alan Watts wrote a book that I gobbled up Â– its title is <span style="font-style: italic;">The Supreme Identity</span>. It provided some marvellous new words. IÂ’m not saying the author didnÂ’t know what he was talking about. But the reader Â–what happens to us? The brain in its attachment to security is constantly searching for concepts to attach to that which is beyond all words, all concepts and ownership.<br><br>ItÂ’s an elating feeling to think, Â“Now IÂ’ve shed my ego identity because I know IÂ’m the supreme identity!Â” I went through that elated feeling, quite unawares. But readers, beware! IsnÂ’t it the task of the author of books to keep the written work lucid but loose, open, unfixed, flexible, to keep reminding the reader that the word is not the real thing and can be substituted by another word any time? IsnÂ’t the authorÂ’s task to sustain the readerÂ’s curiosity to find out <span style="font-style: italic;">what is the real thing</span>, abiding nowhere? Is curiosity alive this moment?<br><br>Krishnamurti was never tired of saying, Â“The word is not the thing.Â” Do we understand that? Even though words are used? There wouldnÂ’t be talks or articles if there werenÂ’t words used as conveyors. For one thing, more is conveyed in a talk than just the words. Are we together in the depth of words and beyond the words? Can words point beyond themselves?<br><br>The total energy of presence allows the mind to see what the word merely points to. To see it here, within myself. Not out there, but here. To feel the shift from Â“out thereÂ” to Â“right here.Â” The shift from being in a tunnel of wordy Â“meÂ”-ness toÂ… inexpressible openness. Do you se? Is I happening right now? Here? Now?<br><br>So, did we say enough about identity, the story of Â“meÂ” as this body, or Â“meÂ” as Â“not this body,Â” Â“the supreme identityÂ”? When this experience of Â“opennessÂ” happens,Â… itÂ’s not really an experience. This openness, this presence, this nondivision, is not an Â“experience.Â” because there is no one here who experiences it through thinking, even though the bodyÂ’s heart is beating, the breath is flowing; the feet feel refreshing cool air. As this happens, there is no story. No identity. That comes in later, with the mind that wants to explain, to conceptualize, and to possess. ItÂ’s helpful, and even beautiful, to conceptualize, if one knows what one is doing and doesnÂ’t dwell in the concepts but just communicates. Remember that the main part of communicating is being here, not the words you have found. The words are secondary. The prime, essential thing is to be here. And does that communicate? Does it? Are we here together with the birds, the fan, the body tensing or relaxing, the breath flowing?</div>

Dark, cloudy, cool, moist<br>and windy. Amazing, this whole affair of the weather!<br>We call it weather, but what is it really? Wind.<br>Rain. Clouds slowly parting. Not the words spoken about it, but just this<br>darkening, blowing, pounding and wetting, and then lightening up, blue sky<br>appearing amid darkness, and sunshine sparkling on wet grasses and leaves.<br>In a little while there'll be frost, snow and ice covers. And then warming<br>again, melting, oozing water everywhere. On an early spring day the dirt<br>road sparkles with streams of wet silver. So - what is weather other than this<br>incessant change of earthly conditions and all the human thoughts, feelings<br>and undertakings influenced by it? Like and dislike. Depression and elation.<br>Creation and destruction. An ongoing, ever-changing stream of happenings<br>abiding nowhere. No real entity weather exists anywhere except in thinking<br>and talking about it.<br>Now, is there such an entity as me or I? Or is it<br>just like the weather - an ongoing, ever-changing stream of ideas, images,<br>memories, projections, likes and dislikes, creation and destruction, that<br>thought keeps calling I, me, Toni, and thereby solidifying what is<br>evanescent? What am I really, truly, and what do I merely think and believe<br>I am?<br>Are we interested in exploring this amazing affair<br>of myself from moment to moment? Is this, maybe, the essence of this work?<br>Exploring ourselves attentively, beyond the peace and quiet that we are<br>seeking and maybe finding occasionally? Coming upon an amazing insight into<br>this deep sense of separation that we call me and other people, me and the<br>world, without any need to condemn or overcome?<br>Most human beings take it for granted that I am me,<br>and that me is this body, this mind, this knowledge and sense of myself that<br>feels so obviously distinct and separate from other people and from the<br>nature around us. The language in which we talk to ourselves and to each<br>other inevitably implies separate me's and you's all the time. All of us<br>talk I-and-you talk. We think it, write it, read it, and dream it with<br>rarely any pause. There is incessant reinforcement of the sense of me,<br>separate from others. Isolated, insulated me. Not understood by others. How<br>are we to come upon the truth if separateness is taken so much for granted,<br>feels so commonsense?<br><br>The difficulty is not insurmountable. Wholeness, our true being, is here all<br>the time, like the sun behind the clouds. Light is here in spite of cloud<br>cover.<br><br>What makes up the clouds?<br>Can we begin to realize that we live in conceptual,<br>abstract ideas about ourselves? That we are rarely in touch directly with<br>what actually is going on? Can we realize that thoughts about myself - I'm<br>good or bad, I'm liked or disliked - are nothing but thoughts, and that<br>thoughts do not tell us the truth about what we really are? A thought is a<br>thought, and it triggers instant physical reactions, pleasures and pains<br>throughout the bodymind. Physical reactions generate further thoughts and<br>feelings about myself - I'm suffering," "I'm happy," "I'm not as bright, as<br>good-looking as the others."<br>That feedback implies that all this is me, that I<br>have gotten hurt, or feel good about myself, or that I need to defend myself<br>or get more approval and love from others. When we're protecting ourselves<br>in our daily inter-relationships we're not protecting ourselves from flying<br>stones or bomb attacks. It's from words we're taking cover, from gestures,<br>from coloration of voice and innuendo.<br>"We're protecting ourselves, we're taking cover."<br>In using our common language the implication is constantly created that<br>there is someone real who is protecting and someone real who needs<br>protection.<br><br>Is there someone real to be protected from words and gestures, or are we<br>merely living in ideas and stories about me and you, all of it happening in<br>the ongoing audio/video drama of ourselves?<br>The utmost care and attention is needed to see the<br>internal drama fairly, accurately, dispassionately, in order to express it<br>as it is seen. What we mean by "being made to feel good" or "getting hurt"<br>is the internal enhancing of our ongoing me-story, or the puncturing and<br>deflating of it. Enhancement or disturbance of the me-story is accompanied<br>by pleasurable energies or painful feelings and emotions throughout the<br>organism. Either warmth or chill can be felt at the drop of a word that<br>evokes memories, feelings, passions. Conscious or unconscious emotional<br>recollections of what happened yesterday or long ago surge through the<br>bodymind, causing feelings of happiness or sadness, affection or<br>humiliation.<br>Right now words are being spoken, and they can be<br>followed literally. If they are fairly clear and logical they can make sense<br>intellectually. Perhaps at first it's necessary to understand intellectually<br>what is going on in us. But that's not completely understanding the whole<br>thing. These words point to something that may be directly seen and felt,<br>inwardly, as the words are heard or read.<br>As we wake up from moment to moment, can we<br>experience freshly, directly, when hurt or flattery is taking place?<br>What is happening? What is being hurt? And what<br>keeps the hurt going?<br><br>Can there be some awareness of defenses arising, fear and anger forming, or<br>withdrawal taking place, all accompanied by some kind of story-line? Can the<br>whole drama become increasingly transparent? And in becoming increasingly<br>transparent, can it be thoroughly questioned? What is it that is being<br>protected? What is it that gets hurt or flattered? Me? What is me? Is it<br>images, ideas, memories?<br>It is amazing. A spark of awareness witnessing how<br>one spoken word arouses pleasure or pain throughout the bodymind. Can the<br>instant connection between thought and sensations become palpable? The<br>immediacy of it. No I-entity directing it, even though we say and believe I<br>am doing all that. It's just happening automatically, with no one intending<br>to "do" it. Those are all afterthoughts!<br>We say, "I didn't want to do that," as though we<br>could have done otherwise. Words and reaction proceed along well-oiled<br>pathways and interconnections. A thought about the loss of a loved one comes<br>up and immediately the solar plexus tightens in pain. Fantasy of lovemaking<br>occurs and an ocean of pleasure ensues. Who does all that? Thought says, "I<br>do. I'm doing that to myself."<br>To whom is it happening? Thought says, "To me, of<br>course!"<br><br>But where and what is this I, this me, aside from all the thoughts and<br>feelings, the palpitating heart, the painful and pleasurable energies<br>circulating throughout the organism? Who could possibly be doing it all with<br>such amazing speed and precision? Thinking about ourselves and the<br>triggering of physiological reactions takes time, but present awareness<br>brings the whole drama to light instantly. Everything is happening on its<br>own. No one is directing the show!<br>Right at this moment wind is storming, windows are<br>rattling, tree branches are creaking, and leaves are quivering. It's all<br>here in the listening - but whose listening is it? Mine? Yours? We say, "I'm<br>listening," or, "I cannot listen as well as you do," and these words<br>befuddle the mind with feelings and emotions learned long ago. You may be<br>protesting, "My hearing isn't yours. Your body isn't mine." We have thought<br>like that for eons and behave accordingly; but at this moment can there be<br>just the sound of swaying trees and rustling leaves and fresh air from the<br>open window cooling the skin? It's not happening to anyone. It's simply<br>present for all of us, isn't it?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Do I sound as though I'm trying to convince you of something? The passion<br>arising in trying to communicate simply, clearly, may be mistaken for a<br>desire to influence people. That's not the case. There is just the<br>description of what is happening here for all of us. Nothing needs to be<br>sold or bought. Can we simply listen and investigate what is being offered<br>for exploration from moment to moment?<br>What is the me that gets hurt or flattered, time<br>and time again, the world over? In psychological terms we say that we are<br>identified with ourselves. In spiritual language we say that we are attached<br>to ourselves. What is this ourselves? Is it feeling of myself existing,<br>knowing what I am, having lots of recollections about myself - all the ideas<br>and pictures and feelings about myself strung together in a coherent story?<br>And knowing this story very well - multitudes of memories, some added, some<br>dropped, all interconnected - what I am, how I look, what my abilities and<br>disabilities are, my education, my family, my name, my likes and dislikes,<br>opinions, beliefs, and so on. The identification with all of that, which<br>says, "This is what I am." And the attachment to it, which says, "I can't<br>let go of it."<br>Let' s go beyond concepts and look directly into<br>what we mean by them. If one says, "I'm identified with my family name,"<br>what does that mean? Let me give an example. As a growing child I was very<br>much identified with my last name because it was my father's and he was<br>famous, so I was told. I liked to tell others about my father's scientific<br>achievements to garner respect and pleasurable feelings for myself by<br>impressing friends. I felt admiration through other people's eyes. It may<br>not even have been there. It may have been projected. Perhaps some people<br>even felt, "What a bore she is!" On the entrance door to our apartment there<br>was a little polished brass plate with my father's name engraved on it and<br>his titles: "Professor Doctor Phil." The "Phil" impressed me particularly,<br>because I thought it meant that my father was a philosopher, which he was<br>not. I must have had the idea that a philosopher was a particularly imposing<br>personage. So I told some of my friends about it and brought them to look at<br>the little brass sign at the door.<br>This is one meaning of identification: enhancing<br>one's sense of self by incorporating ideas about other individuals or<br>groups, or one's possessions, achievements or transgressions, anything, and<br>feeling that all of this is me. Feeling important about oneself generates<br>amazingly addictive energies.<br><br>To give another example from the past: I became very identified with my<br>half-Jewish descent. Not openly in Germany, where I mostly tried to hide it<br>rather than display it, but later on after the war ended, telling people of<br>our family' s fate and finding welcome attention, instant sympathy, and<br>nourishing interest in the story. One can become quite addicted to making<br>the story of one's life impressive to others and to oneself, and feed on the<br>energies aroused by that. And when that sense of identification and<br>attachment is disturbed by someone not buying into it, contesting it, or<br>questioning it altogether, there is sudden insecurity, physical discomfort,<br>anger, fear and hurt.<br>Becoming a member of a Zen center and engaging in<br>spiritual practice, I realized one day that I had not been talking about my<br>background in a long while. And now, when somebody brings it up'sometimes an<br>interviewer will ask me to talk about it'it feels like so much bother and<br>effort. Why delve into old memory stuff? I want to talk about listening, the<br>wind, and the birds.<br>Are we listening right now? Or are we more<br>interested in identities and stories?<br>We all love stories, don't we? Telling them and<br>hearing them is wonderfully entertaining.<br>At times people wonder why I don't call myself a<br>teacher when I'm so obviously engaged in teaching. Somebody actually brought<br>it up this morning'the projections and the associations aroused in waiting<br>outside the meeting room and then entering nervously with a pounding heart.<br>Do images of teacher and student offer themselves automatically like clothes<br>to put on and roles to play in these clothes? In giving talks and meeting<br>with people the student-teacher imagery does not have to be there; it<br>belongs to a different level of existence. If images do come up, they're in<br>the way, like clouds hiding the sun. Relating without images is the<br>freshest, freest thing in the universe.<br>So, what am I and what are you? What are we without<br>images clothing and hiding our true being? It's un-image-inable, isn't it?<br>And yet there's the sound of wind blowing, trees shaking, crows cawing,<br>woodwork creaking, breath flowing without need for any thoughts. Thoughts<br>are grafted on top of what's actually going on right now, and in that<br>grafted world we happen to spend most of our lives.<br>Yet every once in awhile, whether one does<br>meditation or not, the real world shines wondrously through everything. How<br>is it when words fall silent? When there is no knowing? When there is no<br>listener and yet there is listening, awaring in utter silence?<br>The listening to, the awaring of the me-story is<br>not part of the me. Awareness is not part of that network. The network<br>cannot witness itself. It can think about itself and even change itself,<br>establish new behavior patterns, but it cannot see itself or free itself.<br>There is a whole psychological science called behavior modification that,<br>through reward and punishment, tries to drop undesirable habits and adopt<br>better, more sociable ones. This is not what we're talking about. The<br>seeing, the awaring of the me movement is not part of the me movement.<br>A moment during a visit with my parents in<br>Switzerland comes to mind. I had always had a difficult relationship with my<br>mother. I had been afraid of her. She was a very passionate woman with lots<br>of anger, but also love. Once during that visit I saw her standing in the<br>dining room facing me. She was just standing there, and for no known reason<br>I suddenly saw her without the past. There was no image of her, and also no<br>idea of what she saw in me. All that was gone. There was nothing left except<br>pure love for this woman. Such beauty shone out of her. And our relationship<br>changed; there was a new closeness. No one changed it. It just happened.<br><br>Truly seeing is freeing beyond imagination.</div>
