              <p><br>Hi Beautiful951,</p>
              <p>up to now, i still feel upset when i accidentally kill something... i think you shouldn't need to get rid of this feeling... it's okay to feel it.</p>
              <p>Get rid of the need to get rid.... that is more ego in nature.  We can't really be humans if we feel good or unmoved at inflicting harm on others.</p>
              <p>just my opinion. hope it helps.</p>

              <p>Good to know u also "pray" too, for me, i also hope that Buddhas and Bodhisattvas (esp. Amitabha and Guanyin Pusa) can plan the way when i'm lose in the way. and it does work. even if we do things out of habit, it's out of our ignorance. but one must strongly <strong>sincerely</strong> believe that Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are planning to lead us out of suffering and that our human habits/karma are too strong to handle/sever without the help of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.  it's like stopping a water fall as represented by Ven Hui Lu(æ…§å¾‹æ³•å¸«).  sound like Christianity though. but i think we are the first to use this "Other power" method, especial in Japanese Pureland school. and it's workable in this time and age.</p>

              <p>When you claim that Christianity and Buddhism is cult, it is condemning yourself to hell realm, however, fret not and stay cool as you would be rescued and liberated as the same status as Christ and Buddha depending on your "yuan", may be in next life or many lives after this life. The cult you referring to is those extreme externalists of Christianity and Buddhism for personal motive by causing mentally and physical harm to other living beings.</p>
              <p>As for precept related to smoking - anything that cause harm to yourself and others is regarded as against the precept. So for smoking, you ought to guess and make yr own choice. Nonetheless, there are practitioners who smoke but encountered Pureland and diligently engaged in remembrance practice, attained birth in Pureland - in Buddhism, this is regarded as attainment of supremeness as well, and a leading example for many Buddhists.</p>

              <p>Hi guys, this is just a curious question that pop up my mind earlier this week- NS related issue</p>
              <p>As an Officer Cadet Trainee (OCT), everyone have to go through a 3weeks gruelling Jungle Confidence Course(JCC) in brunei. And I heard that during the JCC period, you will be given a quill and they will not issue you much combat ration. So meaning that you have to go out in the jungle to hunt for wild animals to eat. They give you the quill to keep with you so that in times of extreme hunger you can kill it instantly and satisfy your needs.</p>
              <p>Here comes my question, What if the oct personel is a buddhism and have to abstain from killing but in army especially surviving in the jungle they teach you that 'For one to survive, one must die'? If the person kill the quill or any wild animals, he is against his own personal religious beliefs and if he doesn't kill, he is against the organisational order. What must he do and in way perspective view can he sees it as so he doesn't go against his personal religious beliefs neither does he go against the organisational order?</p>

              <p>Hi Yixiang,</p>
              <p>to be frank with you, if i really can't find any edible fruit, i will kill and eat to satisfy my hunger..</p>
              <p>I will ensure fast death so that my "food" don't have to suffer so much</p>
              <p>I am not trying to encourage you.</p>
              <p>Life is precious, but I sound so contradicting.</p>
              <p>Same now i living in a more urban environment, i see pest, i will still kill. For my family's health...</p>
              <p>If there is war, I still have to kill... So sorry to my enemies lol. I am like that. I am contradicting myself. So don't think so much.</p>

              <p>There are many cause &amp; effect leading to terrorists surfaced, Basically, it is improper education that resulted in the miscommunication and mishandling of complexity of hate that arises from worldly issues. The underlying cause is mainly from incompassion of causing harm towards living beings including animals from the past, present and future. </p>
              <p>There may be alternative like shooting on the leg or immobilise the terrorist or other means of waiting, and following until they run out of ration, becoming weak and/or subsequently surrendering themselves, or other long term approach of peaceful communication, support and education that leading to everlasting peace and harmony. However, it the situation arises because the terrorists threatened the precious life of innocents, the karma of saving the innocents is more than the bad karma of sacrificing the terrorists through killing, well if training make perfect to marksmanship of aiming the right point of shooting :)</p>

              <p><br>Hi Dongchiang,</p>
              <p>Have to consider whether the soldier truly is motivated only to help others and has absolutely no anger for the terrorist but only compassion also to save the terrorist from committing such a terrible act.  If his motivation is so good, then he has created a great deal of merit. But because he has performed the act of killing, he still needs to suffer its consequences... a bodhisattva will be willing to go thru the suffering in order to save the terrorist and his potential victims.</p>
              <p>If the soldier has mixed motivation, the merit may not be there at all, and if he has hatred for the terrorist, he falls into hell for harming the terrorist...</p>
              <p>So you can see it is not so easy to use violence to save others because generally our mind is divided by attachment to frens and aversion to enemies, and unless you go beyond such a mindset, it is not possible to enact the true acts of bodhisattvas who have a pure mind of love to all beings equally.</p>
              <p>If one is an ordinary being, one has to abide by the laws of karma.  The beings to be killed by the terrorists have planted the causes in the past... (... for instance by eating meat or something like that... ) thru this killing karma, they have to go through this suffering of being killed. </p>
              <p>If one goes in and interfere without the capacity of the bodhisattva as stated above, then firstly, these beings do not exhaust their karma and may have to suffer in worse ways in future to exhaust this karma, secondly, the person who interferes doesn't create merit, but creates causes for hell-birth.  He also creates another karmic debt with the terrorist to be repaid in future.</p>
              <p>The terrorist on the other hand has lost his chance to claim his karmic debt and needs to do it in future lives too.</p>
              <p>Only bodhisattva way of doing it can resolve the whole problem nicely and take on the suffering himself.  But we must always check our own motivations.</p>
              <p>Karma is very complicated.  Can't analyse it too much. The teachings say that only a Buddha can fathom karma.  But i am just suggesting a rough way of seeing it.</p>

              <p>My understanding is by dedicating merits to the dead terrorists will enable them to meet dharma in their next life. By understanding the dharma, they will be good and eventually liberating themselves from rebirth. Afterall, they did bad deeds in their past life due to ignorance of the dharma.</p>
