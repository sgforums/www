            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>A ceremony held every year to commemorate Buddha's birthday, April 8th, where a small statue of Buddha is sprinkled with scented water or hydrangea tea. The ceremony recreates a legend that when the Buddha was born he was sprinkled with perfume by the dragon god (ryuuou 竜王<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">. A small shrine, known as the hanamidou 花御堂 is set up and decorated with flowers. A small image of the Buddha in the form of a child as he appeared at birth (tanjoubutsu 誕生仏<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">, is placed on a wide, shallow metal bowl, known as the kanbutsu-ban 潅仏盤. The statue of Buddha has the right hand held up, and the left hand pointing down, depicting the moment when Buddha took seven steps forward and pronounced the words 'Tenjou tenga yuiga dokuson (tian shang, tian xia, wei wo du jun' (I alone am honored in heaven and on earth). Visitors to the temple where the ceremony is performed use a small ladle to sprinkle scented water over the top of the statue. The kanbutsu-e ceremony was brought to Japan from China, and the first recorded celebration in Japan was at Gankouji 元興寺 in Nara in 606. It spread to become a regular part of Buddhist tradition in other temples, the court, and among ordinary citizens. A famous Kanbutsu-ban decorated with hunting scenes is preserved in Nara's Toudaiji 東大寺. It dates from the Nara Period and shows outstanding metal craftsmanship. </blockquote>Did he said that? sorry for the jap chars.. see the original page here.<br><a href="http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/k/kanbutsue.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/k/kanbutsue.htm</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes. That is right, Buddha did said this.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"><a href="http://ias.berkeley.edu/orias/visuals/buddha/life.html" rel="nofollow">http://ias.berkeley.edu/orias/visuals/buddha/life.html</a><br><br>Figure 4  depicts the Bodhisattva almost diving from his mother into the swaddle held by a maidservant. It is said that this kind of birth didnÂ’t hurt his mother at all. As soon as the Bodhisattva was born he took seven steps to the north and proclaimed: "I am chief in the world, I am best in the world, I am first in the world. This is my last birth. There will be no further rebirth." Because no child can immediately walk or talk, let alone make proclamations at birth, it is by these acts that the BuddhaÂ’s prodigious nature, even as an infant, is revealed. We are told that he was already the size of a six-month-old child and had the "thirty-two marks of a great man." The Bodhisattva was thus born among the Shakya people into a khsatriya family whose name was Gautama. Seven days after his birth his mother died and was born in the Tushita heaven. The child was named SiddharthaÂ—"he whose purpose is accomplished."[/quote]<br><br>However, the Buddha also taught no-self and therefore his 'I am chief in the world' is not the self that sentient beings know, but rather refering to the TRUE NATURE of the Buddha - that of Pure Awareness. I remembered a dharma talk by my dharma teacher on this topic. This 'self' here means Awareness, and is refering to the Buddha's true nature:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">A priest asked the Buddha:<br>Is your honour a god?<br>He replied:<br>No,indeed,i am not a god.<br>Then a heavenly spirit?<br>No,indeed.<br>Then a demigod?<br>No,indeed.<br>Then is your honour a human being?<br>No,i am not a human being.<br>You answer No to all my questions.What then are you?<br>The Buddha replied:All those defilements by which, if they had not been extinguished, i might have been a god,a heavenly spirit,a demigod or a human being,have been extinguished in me.Just as a blue,red or white lotus,although it has grown up in the water is unsoiled by the water when it reaches the surface,so although i was born in the world i have overcome the world and i abide unsoiled in the world.Take it that i am Buddha,the Awakened One.</span><br><br>Another similar post written by Sinweiy:<br><br><a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=157333" rel="nofollow">Cease your False Self and your True Self lives!</a><br><br>[quote]Originally posted by sinweiy:</div><div class="quote_body">Buddha at the very begining did show/perform abit of True Self in the idea of Hua Yen Sutra (All-in One, One-in-All) and the walking of 7 steps, one finger pointing the sky and one finger pointing the ground and said, "Heaven and Earth, Wei2 Wo3 Du2 Zhun1" (Under "My" Submit). if people don't know it can be very arrogant.<br><br>Although Buddha in the begining taught non-self for 22years, generally tell us to be selfless and be more considerate. But at the end of this preaching period of 8 years, He did taught the Lotus sutra and Nirvana Sutra that taught about the Da Wo(Biggest 'Self'). But the whole idea is that without firstly understood non-self, it's misunderstanding to precieve the True Self.<br>But this True Self does not contradict the non-self, it's not two, like all sentient beings are part of you, then helping them is as good as helping ourself so to speak.<br><br>/\<br></div></blockquote></div>
