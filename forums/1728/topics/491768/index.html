              bhikkhuni </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Bangkok Post editorial 19
              Apr 2016</span></p>
              <p class="preparagraph" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It
              is disappointing that police are dragging their feet over the investigation of
              arson at the monastery in Rayong's Muang district where female Buddhist monks
              live. Police and other authorities cannot allow this horrendous crime to go
              unpunished. This is not a case of culture, and does not in any way involve
              religion. Suspects already have been identified. Any further dragging of feet
              by security officials would be a clear case of malfeasance.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The background of
              the crime is also clear. Female monks at the International Women's Meditation
              Centre have been harassed for some time. In addition to teaching meditation and
              dhamma, it ordains female monks. This has angered some people. Ignoring the
              Buddha's teaching of moderation and cool temper, they have sought to arouse
              hatred in the surrounding community, and have intimidated the women at the
              centre.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">More than two
              weeks ago, on April 3, one or more people jumped over the centre's fence and
              set fire to a dormitory. The afternoon blaze spread quickly and burnt
              everything inside -- beds, furniture, personal belongings and more. For two
              weeks, police did nothing, despite clear testimony by the centre's residents.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The abbess at the
              centre is a US national, Bhikkhuni Lee. She has told police, and now this
              newspaper, what she believes happened, and why. The violence began on March 9,
              when a group of seven men, possibly drunk, stood outside the centre's gates and
              yelled threats. They said that because the centre was ordaining women as monks,
              they intended to burn down the temple in the compound.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Four days later,
              Bhikkhuni Lee received two consecutive death threats from an anonymous user who
              connected to her Line account. At night, women in the compound saw men with
              guns on the roof of the centre's buildings. The next day they found the CCTV
              equipment was destroyed.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">On April 2, a
              group of 50 Thai women including female monks left for Taiwan. Bhikkhuni Lee
              arranged the trip as part of awards for those the centre called Outstanding
              Women in Buddhism. With the main group gone, the US monk believes, men opposed
              to the centre got enough false courage to invade and set it alight. She calls
              the men "mafia" and says they have made it clear they intend to
              harass the centre because of the female ordinations.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The violence at
              the Rayong centre raises two unacceptable issues. The first is that police did
              nothing to protect the centre during the sustained campaign of threats and
              intimidation by known and unknown men. The second is the lackadaisical response
              to the arson attack. It takes effort for a provincial police force to be as
              unresponsive as the Rayong authorities have been since March 9, when the possibly
              drunken men first assaulted the monks and others.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Superior
              authorities must step in and respond to this violence quickly, professionally
              and responsibly. As Bhikkhuni Lee said to a reporter last week, this is not
              just a Rayong problem. It is a national one. Certain male monks have attacked
              the concept of female ordination, attempting -- too often with success -- to
              whip up anti-female feelings over the claim that women who seek change and
              reform must be met with violence.</span></p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">For police and
              other security officials including the country's top law enforcement general,
              no religious test applies. Violence by anyone, for any reason, is illegal and
              must be prevented, punished or both. Police and all decent citizens must
              recognise there is no religious justification for these actions. Those stirring
              up hatred and suggesting or calling for violence against women must be exposed
              and properly dealt with.</span></p>
