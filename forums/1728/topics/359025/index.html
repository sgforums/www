                                    more than these. Jen Chen Buddhism is exactly focused at creating a happy

                                    rewarded. Precepts may appear to restrict our freedom, but in reality they 
                                    safeguard our blessings. When we can understand this phenomenon, we wish 
                                    we knew about them sooner! </span></em></span></td>

                                    Five Precepts [1] and to perform the Ten Virtuous Deeds [2]. Naturally Jen 
                                    Chen Buddhism based its fundamentals on the Five Precepts and Ten Virtuous 
                                    Deeds. In Buddhism “Vinaya” [3] means precepts and disciplines. 
                                    Of course, every person who is learning and practicing Buddhism has to abide 
                                    by the Vinaya. But in reality it is not easy, for how many people can do 
                                    that? Buddhist monks and nuns must observe many precepts and disciplines, 
                                    and it is no mean feat if the lay-Buddhists can observe just the Five Precepts. 
                                    A person who cannot even abstain from killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, 
                                    telling lies and consuming intoxicants, would not qualify to be a lay-Buddhist 
                                    of the Humanity Vehicle, what more to say about being a Bodhisattva of the 
                                    Greater Vehicle? <br> </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">  </span>

                      <p><span style="font-size: normal;">I hope lay-Buddhists understand that they should not be 
                                      overly ambitious in their cultivation and in the process neglect the fundamentals. 
                                      The first step is to conscientiously observe the Five Precepts and perform 
                                      the Ten Virtuous Deeds, and then they can truly call themselves practitioners 
                                      of the Humanity Vehicle. It would be ideal if everybody observe the Five 
                                      Precepts and perform the Ten Virtuous Deeds first; and if the conditions 
                                      and your capacity permit, proceed further to observe the Bodhisattva Precepts 
                                      and practise the Bodhisattva path of the Greater Vehicle. </span></p>
                      <span style="font-size: normal;"> All Buddhists need to understand the concept of Vinaya. 
                                    It consists of two parts: our dignity and demeanour, and the boundary of 
                                    discipline. We must be dignified in all that we do and under all circumstances 
                                    in our daily life, including the way we walk, stand, sit and even the way 
                                    we lie down. We need to be dignified in our speech and actions, and besides </span>
                      <p><span style="font-size: normal;"> avoiding all evil deeds and performing virtuous deeds, 
                                      we also need to exercise compassion. Then, we are truly followers of Buddha. 
                                      <br> <br> All Buddhists need to observe the Vinaya. However, we are not the Vinaya 
                                      School of Buddhism which emphasizes precepts and disciplines. Many people 
                                      are afraid to embrace Buddhism because they are afraid of the many strict 
                                      precepts and disciplines, and that monks and nuns have to observe hundreds 
                                      of these. It is a pity that such good Buddhist teachings are rejected 
                                      because of this reason. Thus, to begin with, it is advisable not to place 
                                      too much emphasis on precepts and disciplines. </span></p>
                      <p><span style="font-size: normal;">It is not uncommon to hear of husbands encouraging their 
                                      wives to take refuge in Buddhism, observe the Five Precepts, and the Bodhisattva 
                                      Precepts. But, when asked why their husbands are not doing the same, a 
                                      typical reply is that their husbands feel that there are too many precepts 
                                      and disciplines in Buddhism and as businessmen these precepts and disciplines 
                                      are an inconvenience to them. <br> <br> From this point, we can see that many people have misunderstood and are 
                                      afraid of precepts and disciplines. Jen Chen Buddhism does not use precepts 
                                      to shackle oneself, but it does not mean that Jen Chen Buddhism does not 
                                      observe the precepts. On the contrary, precepts are strictly observed. 
                                      Jen Chen Buddhism, does not refer to them as precepts, but rather as “methods 
                                      to safeguard blessings”, that is to safeguard the blessings and 
                                      happiness which we already have. For example, an originally happy and 
                                      blissful family will become broken if the husband or wife neglects the 
                                      family by indulging in gambling and drinking, or night-clubbing. Therefore, 
                                      we say that “to observe the precepts” is the same as to “safeguard 
                                      our blessings”. Isn’t it a very good thing that we uphold 
                                      our existing blessing in this manner?</span></p>

                      <p><span style="font-size: normal;">Take another example: If a child shifts a plate that was 
                                      safely placed in the centre of the table to its edge, the mother will 
                                      say, “This won’t do! Put it back to the centre.” Of 
                                      course, the plate is safer when it is in the middle of the table rather 
                                      than at the edge. Should it drop and shatters, it also means that some 
                                      of our blessings are expended. If the plate costs a certain amount of 
                                      money and we need to replace it, then the total damage is doubled. Thus, 
                                      when we understand this principle, we must be alert and raise our awareness 
                                      so that regardless of where we are, we are safeguarding our blessings 
                                      and happiness all the time, and we constantly examine ourselves if our 
                                      actions are frittering away our blessings. For example, if husbands or 
                                      wives do not discipline themselves and have no sense of propriety, they 
                                      casually indulge in extra-marital affairs without regards for the consequences, 
                                      then they are ruining their own happiness. </span></p>
                      <p><span style="font-size: normal;">Therefore, Jen Chen Buddhism advocates that we constantly 
                                      safeguard the blessings which we already have. This is the way Jen Chen 
                                      Buddhism observes the precepts. If we talk about the precepts incessantly, 
                                      then it discourages people from learning Buddhism. When we understand 
                                      this principle, we must fulfill our responsibility as a human being, be 
                                      a good person, learn and practise the teachings of Jen Chen Buddhism, 
                                      avoid doing all evil deeds, do all good deeds, purify the mind, and safeguard 
                                      our blessings.</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"><img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/normalflower2.gif" alt="" width="20" height="18" align="top"></span><span style="font-size: normal;"> <br> <br> <span style="color: #cc3300;"> <strong>Notes: </strong></span></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #800080;"><strong>Are the Five Precepts hard to observe?</strong></span></p>
              <p>The Five Precepts are never meant to restrict as they protect oneself and others when observed well. Breaking a precept is not considered a sin - it is seen as an unskillful act due to the lack of Wisdom. A lay Buddhist may find the Five Precepts difficult to observe completely and constantly in the beginning, but one should not be disheartened. Even if one is able to observe only one or two precepts successfully, one is already laying the foundation for happiness now and in the future. One may make a daily renewal of one’s determination to observe the precepts to remind oneself of the ideal way of life one should lead. One should try his very best to achieve this ideal. In doing so, one will discover inner peace and always be at ease with the world. We have to remember that though we are imperfect, we can all strive towards perfection.</p>
