What is karma? Karma means action, intentional action. And every intentional action will have a karmic result, and the outcome depends on whether the karma is wholesome or unwholesome. Or perhaps it is pure karma... or the karma that leads to liberation.<br><br>Those you said above are all unwholesome karma. They create bad Action, Speech and Mind karma. Not only that it can be habit forming... the seeds can stay in our 8th consciousness and resurface as habitual tendencies even in future lifetimes.

Ego here does not mean being 'egotistic', it just means being identified with various things as 'self'. An enlightened person is completely disidentified with the 5 skhandas (the five aggregates) and have completely seen through the illusion of the self.</div></blockquote>I am also referring to the aspect of self in my explaination but then again, mental responses reflect not on only chemical reactions in the brain as well as synapses.</div>
