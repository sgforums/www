              <p><br>that mean the ghost very stubborn, don't want to let go. chance is theirs. </p>
              <p>i got saw a docu on 2 nuns helping a girl ghost liberate to pureland. the girl was killed in an accident. before that, another girl borrowed some money from her, and she came to create trouble, entered her body. they told her the benefit of pureland and Amitabha, ask her to believe, let go, and recite/listen to the Amitabha Sutra together with them. at first very playful, then slowly calm down and went.</p>

              <p>Dear Lavender,</p>
              <p>I happened to saw your message, I hope to share with you on the following.</p>
              <p>Being reborn into a ghost realms is already very unfortunate for the "girl" that seemed to have connection with you. I am sure that "she" is also hoping to have enough merits to be out of the ghost realms too.</p>
              <p>What you could is as following, this is my person suggestion and may not 100% work but I believe if you do it sincerely from your heart, it may work.</p>
              <p>Depends on which mantra or sutra that you are familar with. The mantra can be as simple as OM MANI PADME HUNG but this mantra or sutra that you chant must be one that is close to your heart and you have faith in.</p>
              <p>Remember that chanting the mantra is not chasing the ghost away but you are doing it with compassion and generating merits and eventually when you are done, you could dedicate this mertis to "her" and all 3 lower realms that are currently suffering, may them be free from suffering and be reborn into Amitabha Buddha pureland and be there to receive teaching from Amitabha Buddha.</p>
              <p>If you happen to attend any big Dharma event, you should even dedicate this merits to "her" and those who are suffering.</p>
              <p>Also, all this will take some time to have an effect which depends on your faith and how deep is the karmic connection.</p>
              <p>I hope the above sharing help.</p>
              <p>With Metta</p>

                  <p>If no one dedicates merits to them, usually hell beings will get reborn as ghosts, and then as animals before they can become human again. You may ask why they cannot just as well jump from hell to the human realm.  Well, besides the reason that their unwholesome karma needs to first be exhausted, it is also because it is very difficult for hell beings, ghosts and animals to accumulate merit.  The conditions are not conducive for them to do good deeds in such realms; and it is also not possible to practice the Buddhadharma in realms other than the human and deva realms. </p>

                  <p>Some extracts from the Shurangama Sutra:</p>
                  <p><span class="style21"><span class="style22">"A</span>nd then, Ananda, 
                  after the living beings who have slandered and destroyed rules and 
                  deportment, violated the Bodhisattva precepts, slandered the Buddha’s 
                  Nirvana, and created various other kinds of karma, pass through many 
                  kalpas of being burned in the inferno, they finally finish paying for 
                  their offenses and are reborn as ghosts. 7:161 <br> </span></p>
                  <p><span class="style21">”Ananda, such a person’s fall is due to his 
                  totally emotional level of functioning. When his karmic fire has burned 
                  out, he will rise up to be reborn as a ghost. This is occasioned by his 
                  own karma of false thinking. If he awakens to Bodhi, then in the 
                  wonderful perfect brightness there isn’t anything at all. 7:173<br> <br> ”Moreover, Ananda, when his karma as a ghost is ended, the problem of 
                  emotion as opposed to discursive thought is resolved. At that point he 
                  must pay back in kind what he borrowed from others to resolve those 
                  grievances. He is born into the body of an animal to repay his debts 
                  from past lives. 7:175</span></p>
                  <p><span class="style21">”Ananda, these are all beings that have finished 
                  paying back former debts and are born again in the human realm. They are
                   involved in a beginningless scheme of karma and being upside-down in 
                  which their lives are spent killing one another and being killed by one 
                  another. They do not get to meet the Thus Come One or hear the Proper 
                  Dharma. They just abide in the wearisome dust, passing through a 
                  repetitive cycle. Such people can truly be called pitiful. 7:192 <br> <br> ”Furthermore, Ananda, there are people who do not rely on proper 
                  enlightenment to cultivate samadhi, but cultivate in some special way 
                  that is based on their false thinking. Holding to the idea of 
                  perpetuating their physical bodies, they roam in the mountains and 
                  forests in places people do not go and become ten kinds of immortals.

              <p>If you are chanting Amituofo, it shows that you have affinity with Buddha. It is a matter of time you will become a Buddhist. If not in this life time, it will be in your future life time. I have friends and closed ones who are like you, after chanting Amituofo for sometime, they will automatically want to take the 3 refuge.  This is something very amazing, cannot be explained.</p>
              <p>I had asked shifu this question about chanting Amituofo and Nan Mo Amituofo. Shifu said chanting Nan Mo Amituofo is to show great respect, chanting Amituofo is as if you are calling someone close to you. In fact, shifu advise us to chant  Amituofo instead of Nan Mo Amituofo because it is easier to concentrate with shorter verse.</p>
