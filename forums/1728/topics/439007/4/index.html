Actually, if anything, they will try to sell you guggul in place of myrrh (to which it is related in appearance and usage but not as a plant). I buy my guggul from Potalagate http://www.potalagate.com/Qstore/Qstore.cgi and if you are not too concerned as to whether it has been blessed or not (and if you are in Europe) from here http://www.theincensestore.com/online_s ... id-50g.cfm<br> <br>Both are very good quality, the Hindu site is cheaper.</p>

              <p>However, that person must also find out whether the ghosts are karmic debtors or just normal spirits. If normal wandering spirits then burning guggul should work. If debtors, then negotiation is necessary; i.e. seek forgiveness.</p>

              <p>i agree with the article above. Especially the part on seeking forgiveness from the spiritual creditors of someone.</p>
              <p>My friend's father spiritual creditors didn't give me an easy time. Falling sick is the easiest part. I have many weird encounters after i stretched my hand to help my friend. I got scolded by strangers out of the blue, i had weird harrassment, i had bad luck for a period of time, i had accidents like nearly slipping and fell.</p>
              <p>I told my friend to do a lot of charity and transmit the merits to her father's spiritual creditors. Fortunately for me, her family had suffered so much mentally over the one year and they were so frightened that their old father would still jump that they are most willing to go around spending money on charities and praying ceremonies.</p>

              Don't worry lah. Venerable may not need to come to the centre. Just go and ask them for help! hehe :)
                          
              Eh personally, i believe if we uphold the 5 precepts and work double hard in our cultivation, we are not only protected by the Triple Gems and the Dharma Protectors. We will also be able to help others.
                          
              Attend group chanting is good. Those group chanting is  usually organized once a month/a week. I know that Pureland Marketing organized FO YI. i.e chanting amituofo a day retreat once in a month or 3 months. (Have to check their website) Group chanting is generally more effective in helping spirits than doing the chanting practice alone, unless one is a very good cultivator. Group practice is powerful, in a sense that we are harnassing collective good energy. Nevertheless, please continue to practise chanting at home if you have been doing.
                                              
              And yeah, the kathina festival is also right around the corner. You can also dedicate merits whenever you do any good deeds.
                          
              If you are still afraid, chant the Shurangama mantra or Namo Guan Shi Yin Pusa sincerely and regularly. I believe it will helps.

              <p>In Buddhism, ghost realm is one of the six realms too.</p>
              <p>With reference to the recent post of “how to get rid of ghost”, I saw that most of the answers provided is call Shifu, ask for Shifu, chant and dedicate merits or try to co-exist with them.</p>
              <p>What if the ghost is in our office? And is a Child Ghost somemore, as you know, children are very stubborn.</p>
              <p>I worked in a Child Care Centre and happen to saw in a fleeting moment a child ghost – teenager-like, long hair and wearing all white apparel. She even follow me back to my home, on a Saturday hot afternoon as I was cooking in the kitchen, she just float behind me. I quickly ran to my room and chanted the Shurangama Mantra. As I chanted, she just stood an arm length across from me, I was so scared that I chanted even louder and louder. After chanted finish, I didn’t see her – at least not in my house anymore.</p>
              <p>But then at my work place, she still carry on give me a case every week. And she like to choose Thursday or Friday to give me a case. As in every Thursday or Friday, a child under my charge would accidentally got injured then I would have to bear responsibility.<br>If not the children get it, it is me who gets it. Every Thursday or Friday, I would get injury or either I quarrel with a colleague or offended my Supervisor.</p>
              <p>1) If you ask me to get a Shifu – its impossible, its a workplace and the Principal won’t allow too, not when there’s children around.</p>
              <p>2) Chant sutras or mantra? Yes I have been chanting the Great Mantra and Vajrasattva mantra during break time inside the centre softly. Doesn’t work too.</p>
              <p>3) Throw some sweets on the floor for her – I dare not try yet. Once you did it one time, you have to carry on or else one day you don’t do it, you’ll gonna get double dose.</p>
              <p>4) Ask me to resign? Yes thinking and planning about it. Sometimes in life, the best way if you couldn’t beat your enemy is to retreat, to withdraw. I raise my white flag now, surrender.</p>
              <p>5) Co-exist with her? Huh, if I adopt her as my daughter, what if she follows me back home again, I’ll faint. And adopting is a life time thing. Think carefully before you do. One day you got your own children she’ll be jealous and wreck havoc in your family.</p>
              <p>I guess the reason she stick around the child care centre is because there are plenty of children around and also plenty of toys to play with. But why target me? I recall maybe because she saw me reprimanding one of the kids in the centre for being naughty.</p>
              <p>Any other suggestions?</p>

              <p><br>Sorry buddy, I dont know how to post pic....the pearl is unique, all different sizes, there is no pearl that looks alike. It has colours and either oval or round (not fully round or oval) shape. It is abit expensive but then it really helps you mentally to prevent any mishap from happening to you. You can also buy one and hang on top of your door to chase away dirty things from coming to the house.</p>

              <p>I think the spirit child probably needs yr help, as the spirit child cannot talk to humans directly, he will probably linger with you as u have some affinity, yuan with him, since u have started chanting, u may have activate some ability to sense or see spirits, and thats why the spirit child able to sense yr spirituality and come to you, ghost/spirits live a longtime and suffer in their spirit states, u can try do transfer of merits to him/her for a better rebirth to heaven or to buddhalands,</p>
              <p>try practising chanting Wang Shen Zhou from Amitofou Buddha, and wish that he can go for rebirth easy and smooth to Buddhalands or heavens.</p>
              <p>U can also go to WaterLoo street at Si Ma Lu Pray Guan Yin Pusa, maybe can offer lotus and sweets plus offer like $20 big packets of incense josssticks to temple, to transfer merits to him.</p>
              <p>U Can Say like this: " Namo Guan Shi Yin Pusa, I ___ (Name) live __ (address) , i buy these offerings for Guan Yin Pusa/Guan Yin Niang Niang to offer transfer merits to the child ghost at my work place ____ (state yr workplace address), there is a child spirit following me wherver i go, i wish to liberate him to go pureland/ heaven, as i have been disturb, and is scare, insecure. May this auspicious offerings bring good rebirth for this spirit child , i pray that he can be reborn in PureLands . Namo Guan Shi Yin Pusa..."</p>
              <p>As it is yr Yuan with him, u can also do Chao Do , like those 7th month puja for unborn babies and wandering spirits and ghosts, pay $10-20 for a simple puja to chao do and do å›žå�‘ ,</p>
              <p>if successful liberate him from spirit realm, in future life he may repay thanks as yr Gui ren aka Benefactor ,</p>
              <p>May the Child spirit rest in peace and have a Easy Rebirth to Pureland! Amitofou!</p>

              <p>I'm not too sure but I believe they can be reborn in human beings or go to Pureland in the midst of these because the purpose of "chao du" is to shorten their sufferings. I've heard of a devotee who has 3rd eye knew her sister was reborn in ghost realm. Her sister passed away only about a year ago. He said she saw her sister's spirit (ghost) and recently I heard her sister had reborn in human realm. The family had done a lot of "chao du" for her sister because her sister committed suicide. May be other forummers can help to answer if my reply is not correct. Actually the minimum life span of ghosts is 200 years and not they live for 200 years.</p>

              <p>if got yuan/affinity/condition to meet with a highly cultivated person, they can be liberated into the upper realm, be it human or heaven or even pureland. but they must loose their attachment. if one practice now, then a yuan/condition/seed is formulated in the storage of the mind. next time, sooner or later, the seed will grow and bear fruition. </p>

In relation with this, I recently found a story from Tsukuba and the surrounding area involving Shinran Shonin’s visit to Mt Tsukuba.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">It is said that Shinran was staying at some lodging house at the foot of Mt Tsukuba the night before his planned ascent of the mountain. While he slept he dreamed of a boy who announced himself as the messenger of Nantai Gongen ( the male god of the mountain). The boy went on to beseech the great priest to visit the middle one, of 3 caves he would find on the mountain`s slopes.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Shinran found the cave and entered. First he found two jars with a little water in them. Then deeper into the cave he found a gaki (a hungry ghost).<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">The tormented spirit told Shinran that because of past evil actions he was now suffering terrible hunger and thirst. However, due to the merciful kindness of the deities of the mountain every day, he and the other gaki could drink one drop of water each day.The Gaki then went on to beg Shinran for relief in the form of food or water.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Shinran, however, did not believe that just because one had a bad karma, one had to suffer so much. He was certain that ANYONE who said nembutsu would be saved.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">And this, according to the story, is exactly what happened. After saying nembutsu with the Gaki for a day- <span style="text-decoration: underline; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">he was saved and taken to the Pure Land by a mysterious cloud.</span><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">It is said that this story was a proof for followers of Tsukuba area that it was not necessary to make offering to gaki because they can save themselves with nembutsu of faith.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">I am asking those who know more about this story and the Jofukuji temple, to share their knowledge here. Is this temple belonging to Jodo Shinshu? And if yes, to what branch?</span></p>
