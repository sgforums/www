              Thank you Moderator AEN and Sinweiy for your advice and link.
              
              Ya Dawn, next time I go Kong Meng San maybe can ask for Pendant.
              
              To : likeyou, yes, the child ghost still give me a case every Thur or Fri. It could be me getting injured - like fall down outside or other children I looking after fall down in the childcare centre then I got to take responsibility.
              
              To : newbie- ya, sometimes I am so angry that I felt like taking the wrathful path, ask some powerful darkforces monk to bring her to reborn immediately but I got too soft a heart to do that. That's the problem with we humans.
              
              To reborn : I once chanted to Gohonzon for 13years too, from young. That time the Soka Association was known as Nichiren Shoshu. My dad also chanted. But things never improve at home, family quarrel everyday and financial problem too. Hence my dad and me give up chanting. Now I am into Mahayana and Vajrayana. 
              
              To anyone whom I miss your name, thanks for your advice too.

              <p>Hi LavendarWu, please dont misunderstand my meaning of wrathful. Is not some "dark forces" i quoted wrathful means as you know about vajrayana, In vajrayana there is many wrathful deity but their base is still purely base on compassion, loving kindness.</p>
              <p>These practices is very good in removing hindrances... But do consult a lama that is able to do divination to advice you on what path to take.</p>

              <p>Giving advices are easy for this kind of case but if the spirit is unhappy, its target  will turn towards those who help to banish it or hinder it from its original target.</p>

              <p>just to share my personal experience. I chose to help an very old friend of over 20 years to solve her father's case.  I helped in the sense that i brought the whole family to a centre to do prayer, arrange for the master to visit the home etc. I told my friend that the spirits who were stopped from disturbing her father would turn their attention to the family who lived together and to those who helped in the process.</p>
              <p>Cut story short, the son suffered an accident that injured his hand in the same week. I also took over some and fell very sick but my old friend's father finally got his peace and stopped being disturbed.</p>
              <p>My friend and her family suffered mentally over one year when the father kept wanting to jump off the flat because he heard voices telling him to. They literally had to pull him off the balcony every morning. They spent so much on seeing doctors and specialists. They don't mind spending the money but their case is not what doctor can solve.</p>
              <p>when i found out what happened , i told my friend to try the spiritual way as the last resort. I knew i would be in deep shit if all the spiritual creditors of my friend's father turned their wrath on me but i was prepared to help my friend out. Also i have the confidance i can do my own praying and chanting to help myself.</p>
              <p>my point of relating my experience is to remind all the kind souls here, if you want to help in this type of spirtual case, you have to be ready mentally and physically that you will need to take over some negativity from helping.  Of course your kind fruit will also be manifest later after you suffer first.</p>
              <p>the worst case to help is the black magic type. I know that even very powerful and experienced Thai monk could die from fighting with the other side.  Black magic is worse than the usual spirtual encounters.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>As my guru say, vajrayana is still mahayana and is good to understand mahayana before going into vajrayana.</p>
              <p>Basically majority of the puja are perform to open public, anyone can join. There is a few centres that that have frequent hindrances removal puja that many many people join in.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Those puja that not open to public are those that need to be initiated into that particular practices, but then those normally will have indication that is meant for initiated only.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This weekend have some puja that is open to public..</p>

              <p>actually you are right. The power of refuge is fantastic.</p>
              <p>There is a teaching is that with refuge in the triple gem and practice the 5 precept, no negative forces can harm you.</p>
              <p>Another teaching i came across to dispel spirit harm is also generating loving kindness, but there is many steps of self generation before can dispel the spirit harm.</p>
              <p>In simple my level of loving kindness and concentration is still far far far away... Thus i dont think i can achieve the protection level needed.</p>

              <p>Lavender Wu ,  if you can attend enough Tibetan fire puja, esp the true lineaged one or a famous rebirth rinpoche 's fire puja, you might solve your problem.</p>
              <p>Vajrayana Fire Puja is very effective for wishes.</p>
