              <p>Think of it this way..... if you don't like Peter or Mary and chant 'Namo Amituofo', will Peter or Mary disappear?  Ghosts aren't any different in that they are beings just like us.  They are mostly not harmful and they too like to listen to mantra chanting and even Dharma talks.  If they leave due to any chanting on our parts, it's probably because they have left of their own accord, or have moved on to higher realms.  If we do encounter such ghosts, it's best to dedicate merits to them so that they may be reborn in higher realms.</p>

              <p>Only saying that ghosts too are beings, and they won't disappear just because one chants something to "chase" them off.  They have to be willing to leave.  That's why they leave in some situations, and don't in others.  TS is now caught in this situation and it's obviously distressing her greatly.  Hope she can get some reprieve from this soon by following the methods recommended by several.</p>

              <p><br>i personally imho think got 2 main factors. first is the effectiveness of the chant be it sincerity, calmness, meditative state and virtue of the person. second is the strength of the harmful ghosts be it got strong revenge toward the person, and/or how malicious is it toward the person. like why it only target that particular person and not others. whether got past issues that lead to it..</p>
              <p>i heard, to a daoist who draw ç¬¦çº¸, the calmer, focus the mind while drawing, the more effective the ç¬¦çº¸. same goes with mantraå’’è¯­. as ä¿—è¯�è¯´“<strong>è¯šåˆ™ç�µ</strong>”.</p>

              <p>I see.   It is kind of strange the spirit can be making its presence known in buddhist temple when the person is kneeling down praying to amituofo.   It is puzzling.</p>

              <p>To reborn : I once chanted to Gohonzon for 13years too, from young. That time the Soka Association was known as Nichiren Shoshu. My dad also chanted. But things never improve at home, family quarrel everyday and financial problem too. Hence my dad and me give up chanting. Now I am into Mahayana and Vajrayana.</p>

              <p>Whatever practice one chose, it is depend on their <span style="font-family: MS Song;">ç¼˜ and affinity. Beside, a lot of time people want quickfix to their problems. In fact, as Buddhist, we need to bear in mind that the problem arise due to our desires and karma. </span></p>
              <p>I always tell my temple friend. Whether one is Buddhist or not, we will still face problem or obstacle somewhere in our lifetime. That's life. The critical thing is how we resolve the problem. We can seat there and blame fate, life, people even our religion. However, if we truly look at the problem, most of the time it arise due to our own desire.</p>
              <p>Example, if a practitioner lose his job and has a financial issue, yet the person keep buying 4D thinking that by chanting Namu Myoho Renge Kyo 24x7, he will strike,instead of looking for a job to resolve the issue.  If he does not strike according to his wish, he start to put the blame on his practice. However, the person fail to reflect if his actions and thoughts are proper according to Buddhist teaching.</p>
              <p>To me Buddhist practice is mean to balance my thoughts. At the end of the day, 3 treasures are meant as a guide on this journey. We are the one who will resolve the problem that we met. However, we just need to pray for wisdom,  guidance and synchronise our actions with it. This will hold true for whatever one practice one choose, Vajrayana, Mahayana or Thervada. The basic will always be the same everywhere. Alrite wish you well for your practise. Sometime, not all the problem one encounter is due to the spirit disturbance. If we focus too much on the spirit thingy, we become superstitious.</p>
