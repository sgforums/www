              In Buddhism, ghost realm is one of the six realms too. 
              
              With reference to the recent post of "how to get rid of ghost", I saw that most of the answers provided is call Shifu, ask for Shifu, chant and dedicate merits or try to co-exist with them.
              
              What if the ghost is in our office? And is a Child Ghost somemore, as you know, children are very stubborn. 
              
              I worked in a Child Care Centre and happen to saw in a fleeting moment a child ghost - teenager-like, long hair and wearing all white apparel. She even follow me back to my home, on a Saturday hot afternoon as I was cooking in the kitchen, she just float behind me. I quickly ran to my room and chanted the Shurangama Mantra. As I chanted, she just stood an arm length across from me, I was so scared that I chanted even louder and louder. After chanted finish, I didn't see her - at least not in my house anymore.
              
              But then at my work place, she still carry on give me a case every week. And she like to choose Thursday or Friday to give me a case. As in every Thursday or Friday, a child under my charge would accidentally got injured then I would have to bear responsibility.
              If not the children get it, it is me who gets it. Every Thursday or Friday, I would get injury or either I quarrel with a colleague or offended my Supervisor.
              
              1) If you ask me to get a Shifu - its impossible, its a workplace and the Principal won't allow too, not when there's children around. 
              
              2) Chant sutras or mantra? Yes I have been chanting the Great Mantra and Vajrasattva mantra during break time inside the centre softly. Doesn't work too. 
              
              3) Throw some sweets on the floor for her - I dare not try yet. Once you did it one time, you have to carry on or else one day you don't do it, you'll gonna get double dose.
              
              4) Ask me to resign? Yes thinking and planning about it. Sometimes in life, the best way if you couldn't beat your enemy is to retreat, to withdraw. I raise my white flag now, surrender.
              
              5) Co-exist with her? Huh, if I adopt her as my daughter, what if she follows me back home again, I'll faint. And adopting is a life time thing. Think carefully before you do. One day you got your own children she'll be jealous and wreck havoc in your family.
              
              I guess the reason she stick around the child care centre is because there are plenty of children around and also plenty of toys to play with. But why target me? I recall maybe  because she saw me reprimanding one of the kids in the centre for being naughty. 
              
              Any other suggestions?

              Hi Rooney
              I have just google search "The Ratana Sutta" The word Sutta is Pali, this sutra is Pali tradition. Its a Jewel Discourse given by the Buddha to Ananda to help a city plagued by famine and evil spirits. I also went to youtube to listen to the chants and see the meaning of the wordings on this discourse too. Its too chimp for that childghost lah. She won't understand the words if I chant softly during break time to her in the child care centre.
              
              If asking a buddhist monk to help, I would have done so long time ago but this is a child care centre, I can't bring any monk or ghost buster inside you see.
              
              But I doesn't want to harm her, just asking her to leave me alone. There was one period where she did leave me alone but then it came back again because as a Child Care Teacher, on and off, I'll be reprimanding naughty children. Maybe she doesn't like this.

              Currently in the centre I already chant the Great Mantra (Mahayana traditiion) and the 100 syllables Mantra (Vajrasattva Vajrayana tradition)
              
              Now if were to add on a Pali one - the jewel discourse, I think I going crazy liao. Hahahaha.

              <p>no need name lar. use your mind instead. actually even though the ghost doesnt know pali, but chanting of sutra is thru the mind, not the words though. try chanting metta sutra mentally. if u dunno the pali chanting, use your mind and heart, use loving kindness to transmit to her. she will feel it. you can rehearse this mentally, may you be well and happy for a start in office.</p>

              I also see ghost before. You should attend pujas (fa hui) and dedicate merits to the spirits in hope that they can be reborn in higher realms.

              <p>Besides you, do your colleagues know about the spirit's existence? May be you can wear some Buddha pendant to protect you. You should recite Amituofo often. I understand that people who recite Amituofo will have "Buddha light"ä½›å…‰. Those spirits are afraid of the light and they also respect people who recite Amituofo. There are also dharma protectors protecting people who recite Amituofo.</p>

              Thank you Dawn. Besides me, no other colleagues saw this child. 
              As for wearing Buddha Pendant, I am considering to wear the black tourmaline gemstone. Google search it is good for expelling negativity. 
              I dare not anyhow buy those buddha pendant from Si Bei Lou (buggis street or queens street) I heard some thai or other country master got chant certain power into the pendants and these pendants actually got "ying ling" (spirits) inside then.
              
              After buying the pendants, you want to return back is difficult already.
              A chinese proverb saying "Qin Shen rong yi, song Shen nan" meaning its easy to invite the gods into your life, but once you no longer wants it, its difficult to get rid of it.

So, in a home or more likely in temples, where many robbers, murderers and other evil people come to pray everyday, the chances are that the statues will be inhabited. The spirits follow these bad hats into the temple, and they see so many people praying to those statues, they would also like to be prayed to. So they remain behind in the temple when the murderers and robbers leave the temple and inhabit the statutes. Some huge portraits may also contain ghosts, especially if the paintings are of good quality.</span></p>

              <p>No, I don't mean buying pendant from shops. I mean those pendants distributed by temples or you buy from goldsmith shop and ask shifu to chant.</p>

              <p>Hi Lavender</p>
              <p>If u can see her, it is your Yuan, however one need not be fearful of her if you are a sincere Buddhist. According to Buddhist teaching, the hungry spirit is all over the place, we need not be fearful about them. Sometime, they just need help.</p>
              <p>I remember once I stay in Melaka hotel. I had the 3 paralysation (<span style="font-family: MS Song;">è¢«é¬¼åŽ‹) </span>experience within a nite when my wife (non Buddhist) was sleeping right beside me. In fact, she did not felt anything. The spirit will come and go away. The finally moment came when I heard someone quashing a plastic bag walking past my bed. I ask my wife did u hear the sound. She did not. Therefore, I just take out my Lotus Sutra and chanting bead, sat up on my bed to began to chant Chapter 16 &amp; Namu Myoho Renge Kyo softly for 10 mins. After that, I just delicate the merits to whatever beings that is around. I wish them well and happiness. I pray that they will be freed from the endless cycle of suffering. The next moment, I sleeping like a baby without any disturbance until morning.   </p>
              <p>Hence, through the experience I realised the spirit realm is real. We do not need to focus on them. Just focus on 3 treasure, do our practice properly and offer our compassion merits to them. We never know how it will help them.  </p>
