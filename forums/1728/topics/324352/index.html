              <div id="adlrec">

              </div>
              <p>46—year—old Venerable Ming Yi, who was also the former Ren Ci chairman, was slapped with 10 charges on Tuesday morning.</p>
              <p>The
              monk faces four charges under the Penal Code involving two counts of
              alleged criminal breach of trust. He also faces one count of forgery
              for the purpose of cheating, and one count of abetment for allegedly
              falsifying accounts.</p>
              <p>He also faces six charges under the Charities Act for allegedly providing false information over a decade.</p>
              <p>Two
              of his associates, Raymond Yeung and Phua Seow Hua, were also alleged
              to have gone into conspiracy with the venerable and were also charged
              in court on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>This is the second case in Singapore where a
              large charity and its leaders have been charged with mismanaging funds.
              The first was the National Kidney Foundation and its ex—CEO, TT Durai.</p>
              <p>Separately, a volunteer from Ren Ci was charged with possessing some 70 copies of obscene film.</p>
              <p>Venerable Ming Yi, also known as Goh Kah Heng, is out on a S$200,000 bail. His case will be heard in court on August 4.</p>
              <p>The
              monk has been on leave for five months before his arrest on Monday
              night. He had been under probe by the Commercial Affairs Department
              (CAD).</p>
              <p>The CAD was called in after auditors engaged by the
              Ministry of Health (MOH) highlighted possible irregularities in some of
              the charity’s financial transactions.</p>
              <p>The MOH had said that several transactions, which involved several million dollars, could not be satisfactorily explained.</p>
              <p>The
              venerable is said to have given false information to the Commissioner
              of Charities between 1998 and 2008. These included two instances when
              he allegedly approved million—dollar investments for the charity, but
              the funds included loans for himself.</p>
              <p>The monk is also accused of
              using S$300,000 to offset an outstanding loan by Mandala Buddhist
              Cultural Centre, of which he is a partner, and another S$50,000 was
              allegedly lent to Yeung and a helper at the monasteries.</p>
              <p>He was
              also alleged to have forged minutes of a meeting by asking a staff to
              write that it was Mandala, and not himself, that owed Ren Ci over
              S$600,000.</p>
              <p>The venerable’s lawyer, Andre Yap, said: "Our position
              would be that everything that was done was for a legitimate cause. It
              is not a case where a person has basically taken the money and used it
              to buy a house or buy shares for himself...</p>
              <p>"It’s a question of
              corporate governance; it’s a question of how you treat certain things
              in the accounts and what should be done.</p>
              <p>"Some of the charges
              relate to matters which the previous board of Ren Ci had discussed at
              board meetings and had even sanctioned. So we don’t believe that
              there’s a criminal element to many of these charges."</p>
              <p>Ren Ci and 11 other large Institutions of a Public Character were subject to the Health Ministry’s general review in July 2006.</p>
              <p>The
              organisation is believed to be the third largest health charity in
              Singapore after the National Kidney Foundation and the SingHealth
              Endowment Fund.</p>
              <p>The Commissioner of Charities has suspended
              Venerable Ming Yi from his office as Chief Executive Officer of Ren Ci
              Hospital &amp; Medicare Centre with immediate effect.</p>
              <p>He will
              also be suspended from his executive positions in five other charities:
              Foo Hai Ch’an Monastery, Foo Hai Ch’an Buddhist Cultural and Welfare
              Association, Singapore Buddhist Free Clinic, The Singapore Regional
              Centre of the World Fellowship of Buddhists, and the Katho Temple.</p>
              <p>However, he remains the religious leader of the Foo Hai Ch’an Monastery in Geylang East.</p>
              <p>Despite the monk’s departure, Ren Ci’s current services and day—to—day operations have been unaffected by the incident.</p>
              <p>Member
              of Parliament, Dr Ong Seh Hong, has taken over as CEO, while Mr Chua
              Thian Poh was appointed chairman of Ren Ci in September 2007. Both men
              did not respond to Channel NewsAsia’s queries on the case.</p>
              <p>The
              Health Ministry said the new chairman has added new members to Ren Ci’s
              board and has put in "a number of improvements in accordance with the
              recommendations made by the auditor", and he will "further strengthen
              the board in the wake of these findings".</p>
              <p>One devotee at the Foo Hai Ch’an Monastery said he hopes the case will lay everything out in the open.</p>
              <p>Benny
              Woo, a businessman, said: "It’s a sad case, but I still feel that he
              probably has his reasons (for doing what he did). Personally, it does
              not discourage or demoralise my faith. As a CEO and as a
              person—in—charge, he has to face up to it and be liable, even though he
              may not be directly involved."</p>
              <p>The high—profile monk is also abbot to several temples in Hong Kong and Malaysia.</p>

              <p>This is a good example for all of us to see that no one can escape the rule of cause and effect. Whatever actions we take, there will be aftermath outcomes that we must be accountable for. Although I must admit this is indeed a unfortunate case for the reputation of Buddhism espcially in this vulnerable period, where it is so difficult for sentient beings to plant the seed of Buddhadharma.</p>
              <p>But no matter what is the court outcome, we Buddhists should understand that Ven. Ming Yi is now standing trial as <em>a person</em>, for the alleged charges in court, <em>not</em> the Triple Gems.</p>
              <p>I may be wrong, but if the rules are to be followed, the venerable should remove his robes while in courts when facing his own charges ( or when handcuff or arrested by the police/authorities); becos one is being charged for wrong-doings himself, the Triple Gems is not involved. Buddha didn't teach anyone to commit the crime, the Buddhadharma shows the right way not wrong way, and the sangha group didn't abet it. This is to show respect to the Triple Gems, as well as to avoid misleading sentient beings into unkonwingly slandering Buddhism which may dash the hopes of some who may have interest in the Buddhadharma. æ–­ä¼—ç”Ÿæ…§å‘½ ã€‚</p>
              <p>But of cos we have to give the venerable his fair chance in court, and then everyboby must accept the truth and subsequently the the ruling outcomes.  If the venerable did found to do wrong, he will pay the price himself.</p>
              <p>Please do not give up hopes or cast a doubtful eye on all the other good and upright sangha groups. And we buddhists must ever the more practice the dharma diligently and always to have the Triple Gems in heart whenever we do or say something.</p>

              <p>Even before this incident, I had heard some unrelated allegations from sources about the venerable on certain things... that are disturbing but they are just allegations from third party sources and I do not know whether they are true (so we should not judge him base on that either), and I think these kind of things should be dealt appropriately by the appropriate authorities of sangha and we should not interfere by spreading rumours and things like that.</p>
              <p>I agree with you about the trust in Sangha. In the sutras, in the future the monks will become so corrupted and at point they will disappear altogether. When the Sangha disappears, this is the last stage of the dharma ending age. After that, disappearance of dharma will soon follow and disappear. Right now I don't think we have come to that, we should still support the sangha and cherish what they had to offer.</p>
              <p>Anyway I sincerely hope Ven Shi Ming Yi will come clean from this case.</p>

              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Some non-profit organisations in Singapore have
                  advised the public not to let the latest alleged fraud case, involving
                  Ren Ci charity, to detract them from the bigger issue of helping needy
                  Singaporeans.
                  <br> <br>Ren Ci Hospital and Medicare Centre is one of the largest charities
                  in Singapore that provides medical and step-down care for the needy.
                  <br> <br>Ren Ci's former CEO, Venerable Shi Ming Yi, was charged in court on
                  Tuesday with forgery, conspiracy and misappropriating charity funds.
                  <br> <br> The monk, whose actual name is Goh Kah Heng, is out on a S$200,000 bail. He is due to be back in court on August 4.
                  <br> <br>Venerable Ming Yi was the face of Ren Ci before this latest
                  incident, and those involved in the charity sector in Singapore said a
                  distinction has to be drawn between the individual and a charity's
                  role.
                  <br> <br>Gerard Ee, chairman of the National Kidney Foundation, said: "I
                  hope the public will see it clearly and continue to support Ren Ci
                  Hospital because the beneficiaries are in need of their support, in
                  need of continuing service. <br> <br> "So don't abandon the support for the hospital. As for the individual,
                  like I say, let it take its course, let it have a fair hearing and
                  don't prejudge."
                  <br> <br>Other non-profit organisations in Singapore are optimistic that
                  donor confidence will not waver from this recent setback. However, it
                  doesn't help that this comes shortly after the former chief of National
                  Kidney Foundation, TT Durai, was jailed for misappropriating funds.
                  <br> <br>Adrian Choo, an associate lecturer, said: "I thought that other
                  people would have learnt from him (Durai), but apparently not. It would
                  cause me to question the integrity of the heads of the charities and
                  the charities themselves. I used to donate without thinking, but now I
                  would think much more."
                  <br> <br>Susan Lee, an entrepreneur, said: "It sort of saddened me... I feel
                  that it's the people who mismanaged it, not the organisation. So I will
                  continue to donate because I wholeheartedly want to give to the charity
                  and how they manage (the money) is up to them to answer for it."
                  <br> <br>Being answerable to donors is precisely what charities have to do
                  today with the newly introduced Code of Governance, prescribing
                  guidelines on how charities should be run.
                  <br> <br>Tan Chee Koon, CEO of National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre,
                  said: "If indeed there has been wrongdoing, then justice must, of
                  course, take its natural course. <br> <br> "It's not about the amount. I think for charities, we have to be purer
                  than pure, and whiter than white. There's no shortcut to it because we
                  are operating on public trust. And public trust has to be earned."
                  <br> <br>This latest incident involving Ren Ci has certainly disappointed
                  many Singaporeans, but the consensus is to learn from any mistakes
                  made, strengthen the safeguards within the charities and move on with
                  the primary objective of helping the disadvantaged.

            <div class='col-md body'><p>As a buddhist, I have mix feelings over this incidence, feeling embarassed, sad and loss confidence over sangha.  I really hope Ven Ming Yi did not commit those crime. Personally I think it is better for sangha to devote themselves to teachings of Dharma instead of involved in management of charitable organisations especially if they are not familiar with corporate governance, it will be very unworthy if they have to spent lots of time or risk their life to support such charities and yet to get themselves into trouble.    I would be happy to see if more Buddhists groups will be promoting more lively activities for the youth, learnt from other religious group such as organising prayers session in hotels ballroom (instead of in temples or outside Ngee Ann City which is hot and non aircon). If buddhist groups has excessive funds, better to build mega-temples, joint ventures with large companies such as Capitaland, Keppeland to invest in properties, shopping centres and etc. to get good investment return and plough back the funds to promotion of buddhism and win over more believers, even though it may seems materialists but AT LEAST it will be more rewarding, otherwise other religious group will not be going for these aggressively and not in trouble and manage to win many young devotees.</p></div>

              <p>It is however important to be repentant. (also see <span><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol6no2c.htm">Repentance

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Personally i feel that he did good by founding the hospital and being in-charge of so many organisations. For this he deserves credit. whether monk or not i think its only fair that people get renumerated for the things they do. after all we are in a world where money is the only thing which can get you material stuff and not all that love care bull-XXXX. Actually the donations he raked in easily covers for all that crap.  also since he founded the hospital its obviously reasonable for him to do/make certain decisions. and when theres a board of whatever shouldn't they be equally guilty if he is guilty?  would like to  highlight a few things like when a charity is under investigation i don't think they should lose their tax exempt status. Sometimes i think its better someone covers all these unnecessary stuff instead of making it into such a big issue. i'm sure they could give him a silent warning to step down from that hospital post and continue with his religious things. Why must we have all these negative media...</p></div>

              <p>Good morning all,</p>
              <p>I find typical buddhists' mentalitly kicks in again. When a good thing or good speech done by a monk, they will be quick to say claim that he is a monk with good cultivation, what he says make sense etc.</p>
              <p>Now when a bad thing happened, as quoted from cycle, Ming Yi is now standing trial as a person and not a sangha.</p>
              <p>Double standard here?</p>
              <p>Why don't people say that when a monk did a good thing, he did it on a personal capacity and not a sangha?</p>
              <p>Think about it.</p>
              <p>The Buddhist Triplegem is the foundation for the Buddha-sansana to strive.</p>
              <p>Buddha - the Founder and the Ideal Spiritual Goal that we are aspired to achieve.</p>
              <p>Dhamma - the guidelines laid down by the Buddha that direct us to the Ideal Spiritual Goal</p>
              <p>These two, are intangible, why? Firstly, Buddha had passed into parinibbana.</p>
              <p>Secondly, the Dhamma, is literally beyond words, the values and spiritual qualities that we are cultivating, only we know our worth.</p>
              <p>Sangha - the tangible part, because we are physical beings; we are the disciples of the Buddha. The traditional interpretation is that monks and nuns, a further extended interpretation will include layman and laywoman. I prefer the latter explaination, because no one single vocation exist on their own. Ordained and laypeople have their different duties and responsibilities to sustain the Buddha-sansana. No one is superior than the other in this sense.</p>
              <p>Say a monk can be more spiritually cultivated, but he/she needs the materialistic support from the laypeople (unless it's those forest tradition hermit). So laypeople is important for the monk, by providing the monk with the necessities, thus, removing one of the problem that a monk would face, so that the monk can direct his energy into other thing. So monk, supposedly to be more spiritually attained, are obligated to live the Buddha's ideal, although I never believe that by shaving off one's hair would make one flawless.</p>
              <p>In relation to Ming Yi's case, I agree with Mack x2's, that Ming Yi did a good thing by founding a hospital, it is not easy to start that big of a something out of nothing. I genuinely give credit to that. And that he put Buddha's compassion into action, benefitting many people out there.</p>
              <p>However, why is it fast to claim that Ming Yi might have been framed (from another thread in sgforum), or that to have him put on trial as a person and not a sangha? Firstly, in Singapore, we do not have a genuine Sangha council, as cycle as said, by right should have disrobe Ming Yi before further misunderstanding might have occured, but then, we have no such council and no one has the right to have commission such a disrobe act on Ming Yi. But does it mean that if no one can disrobe Ming Yi, he is free from trial? No way right?</p>
              <p>To say that the state should show respect to Buddhism, then how much are buddhists showing respect to themselves? Are buddhists abusing the Buddha's name for something else? Why there is not a Sangha Council to regulate ordination? There are many other finer issues involved here. So before we ask the state to respect Buddhism, Buddhism must respect the state!</p>
              <p>To me, Ming Yi standing on trial is both as a person and a sangha, but probably a sangha that misrepresent that Triplegem. A monk is a human, he can flaw too. Why buddhist cannot accept that a monk can fail as a monk? Monk is not Buddha, always remember this.</p>
              <p>However at this juncture, let the courts decide. And should the verdict be against his favour, then I hope the buddhist community will learn a big lesson and for all other buddhist organisations to exercise more vigiliance in their operations, and that fellow buddhists alike will be more mindful in their practices.</p>

              <p>Hi Yamizi,</p>
              <p>Seems like U already "think" u would be "flamed"? Poor thing, who has flamed u ? Opposite opinions are not flaming...if not, then all good friends always seem to flame each other. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/smile.png" alt="smile.png"> In this sense, maybe we can be super good friends. Well, all fellow Buddhists should be friends.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I do agreed with many points u raised above. Can see that u really care about Buddhism. This is important and I must also remind myself to do so.</p>
              <p> Just want to give my point of view ( not flaming har) that Ven Ming Yi is standing trial as a person as I feel that a sangha if broken his precepts is already not considered as a sangha. That's why I always feel that untill truth are revealed, we should not help spread non substianciated rumors of the sangha ( or anyboby) around. </p>
              <p>Next, Buddhism did not disrespect the state, this is wrong speech. You can say Ven Ming Yi may have ( as not proven yet) disrespect Buddhism , not the other way round. And I mentioned that the Venerable should respect the Tripel gems by disrobing while in courts, not the state must respect the Triple Gems for the venerable alleged crimes. Maybe my post was long and boring, so it was possible u have misread them. My fault.</p>
              <p>Whenever someone, regardless he is a monk or not, do good in actions or speech, gave wise and right views of the dharma, they should be praised. Becos by recognizing the goodness of others, we learn as well and encourage others to do the same. When  the ordained ones did wrong, regardless of whether there's a sangha council or not, they pay the price for their wrong doings eventually through cause and effects. No need to beat the drums and afraid that noboby knows it. This is called doing the opposite, this is indeed quite similar to "flaming"<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/smile.png" alt="smile.png">. Please, I'm not saying about u har...I mean there are indeed many such fellow Buddhists around ie always stop at praisings, but never give up on mocking or berating the mistakes or downfall of others.</p>
              <p>Yes, sometimes eg scolding can  be seen as a form of compassion ie to help someone to realised ones' mistakes and improve, but most of the times, it became the unconcious intention to shows that one is better than the other. Then we may have practice the opposite way.</p>
              <p>I will also not reply to any "attacks". <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"> I  have a very big ego ( which explains why I must practice triple hard), that's why cannot tahan if someone say things I find buay tahan, or else I lost... See, we can be super good friends.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/smile.png" alt="smile.png">  </p>

              <p><br>There's a lot of things to be bothered and worry about.</p>
              <p>The effect of this case on the reputation of Buddhism. The effect of this case on Ren Ci Hospital and it's patients. The effect of this case on charity organisations in general.</p>
              <p>After the NKF saga, confidence in our local charity scene had already suffered a great deal of damage, mainly because NKF was one of the most trusted charity organisation in Singapore. Nevertheless, Ren Ci Hospital still received a relatively great amount of support because people see Ming Yi as a respectable, truly compassionate and uncorrupted leader. People trusted him.</p>
              <p>But now that such a widely respected venerable and leader of a charity organisation has gotten himself into such controversy, it is not unimaginable that the public's confidence level may plumet all the way down this time. People now don't know who and what to trust anymore.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, the 'cause' laid down by a person could have a seriously negative 'effect' on so much more people. It's not just about 'his own cause and effect'.There's lots to be done before maximum damages are reached.</p>
              <p>I do not know Venerable Ming Yi personally, so I guess I do not have any rights at all to judge him. Perhaps it is out of true compassion on his side when he gave out loans to his affliated companies to make investments in hope of reaping more money to benefit his patients. Maybe. I don't know.</p>
              <p>But one thing for sure is that by breaking the coporate law regardless of his initial intention, he damaged the reputation of our charity scene. And that means much.</p>

              <p>Venerable Ming Yi has indeed done a lot of good things for the welfare.<br>We can say that he do it as sangha or individual or both, it doesn't matter.<br>But if a monk did a bad thing, we cannot say that he do it as a monk/sangha, because buddhism teaching especially vinaya rule never require a monk to commit in bad thing.</p>
              <p>As a monk, even if he get hold of millions of dollars, it is unlikely that he can use it for his own use in a way like what we layperson can do. For example, buying a mercedes, condo, landed property, go for overseas trip.</p>
              <p>It is quite a sad thing that a very well known monk get arrested. We can hear without frowning hundreds cases of layperson or even buddhist commit in a crime, but if there is one case even though still on trial that involve a monk, that will make a big hooha.</p>

              <p>I may be wrong, but if the rules are to be followed, the venerable should remove his robes while in courts when facing his own charges ( or when handcuff or arrested by the police/authorities); <em>becos one is being charged for wrong-doings himself, the Triple Gems is not involved.

              <p>What you had written here would have meant that the state is not showing respect to the Triplegem. You had better re-read before saying I misunderstood you.</p>
              <p>And I didn't mean in anyway had Buddhism disrespect the state.</p>
              <p>The fact is, no one has the right to disrobe Ming Yi, so whether you like it or not, he would be trial as a buddhist monk, and not a person per se. Of course, you can continue to insist once a monk behaves in a non-buddhistic way, to you he's not a monk. But the courtroom may not see it this way.</p>
              <p>A problem with buddhists, are quick to give praises, whether substantiate or not; on the opposite end of the scale, they tend not to be forthcoming in giving honest thoughts, even if there's a serious issue. Somehow, lay buddhists have been successfully brainwash to give up critical thinking and analysis.</p>
