              <p><span lang="EN-GB">Once, during a retreat conducted 
              by   Zen Master Bankei, where many students from all over gathered to 
              learn, one of   them was caught stealing red-handed. The matter was 
              promptly reported to Bankei,   followed by the request to expel the 
              thief. However, Bankei ignored the   suggestion. A while later, the   
              same student was again caught stealing. To the shock of the others, 
              Bankei   continued to disregard the crime. This led the students to 
              petition for   his dismissal, without which they would leave the retreat
               together. </span></p>
              <p>After reading the petition,   Bankei calmly addressed his students. 
              'You are wise brothers. You know what is   right and what is not right. 
              You may go somewhere else to study if you wish, but   this poor brother 
              does not even   know right from wrong. Who will teach him if I do not? I
               am going to keep   him here even if all the rest of you leave.' Upon 
              hearing that, the thief wept   in total remorse.<em></em></p>

              <p><br>Yeah, the monk told me the same thing. I understand that the real temple (é�“åœºï¼‰is acutally in our heart. If I'm å®š, nothing can affect me. More to learn and it is not easy. Anyway, there are many nice temples with nice people in Singapore.</p>
              <p>There is an ex-Christian who puts me to shame. She is a more junior (in term of years) Buddhist than me. She stays on and did not back out from this temple and Buddhism though that person gave her a hard time. She stays on to make this temple a better place by encouraging others who are affected to stay on. In fact, she was the 1st person who brought up the matter to the monk but the monk thought was an isolated case till I brought it up to him again.</p>

              <p>very nice teaching, thanks.</p>
              <p>when we are attending buddhist events, it is natural that we see all kinds of people. But if we keep a mental commentary of their good and bad points on in our heart, then how can our recitation of sutra/mantra/Buddha name etc be pure and yield real merits?</p>
              <p>Only when the heart goes fully into the recitation can it realise the function of the chanting... so it is a good habit to cultivate to not find faults with others. It only soils your own inner purity and definitely creates fan nao (mental afflictions).  That is why before one can attain concentration, one has to keep precepts... not finding fault with others is keeping precepts. precepts guard the mind against gross mental afflictions so that mind can be calm and look into itself.</p>
              <p>As lay practitioners, our conditions are filled always with people with great mental afflictions. If we don't learn to guard our own minds, but follow the circumstance and our judging nature, then our practice will never progress. So this old lady is a good example for us to learn.</p>

              <p>I agree that we don't condemn the evil doers but I encourage Buddhists to speak up and correct the evil doers. I had done my part in encouraging the newly converted Buddhists not to lose faith in Buddhism just because of 1 person who gave them hard time. However, I can't be going round telling people all the time. So, the best thing to do is to correct the evil doer.</p>

              <p>i see. i think MCK mentioned that u can tell the doer twice, prefered in personal rather than in public, but if they stubborn and cannot change, can forget it. as it wouldn't be nice if things turn ugly and both of u become future enermies. they will also hinder one's cultivation later on.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i think this is still surface level human to human stuff. personally, i see them as samples for our learning process.  ä¸‰äººè¡Œ å¿…æœ‰æˆ‘ä¹‹å¸ˆ. when we see a good person, we are encourage to follow their good example. but when we see a bad person, we are encourage NOT to follow their bad example. if one is put inside an all good enviroment, then without a mirror reflection of the bad, also cannot learn anything. this is what i see, to learn. :-)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>we can also see how Buddha deal with Devadatta. we all know Devadatta as a very bad person, where normal bad doing cannot compare. after all the bad doing, in the end, Buddha talk in Lotus sutra on Devadatta's attainment of Buddhahood.</p>

              <p> as i heard from old master, an interesting info...about Devadatta is that even though he's in avici hell, he's not suffering at all. in fact he's experience the happiness of Trayastrimsa heaven. this can be complicated to understand. even though Devadatta treated the Buddha badly, Buddha never hold a least bit of grouch on Devadatta. on the contrary, Buddha was grateful to Devadatta, for suceeding His tolerance. and for Buddha's gratefulness, Devadatta had accumulated great merit æ»¡ä¸š. Devadatta reborn in avici hell was due to his å¼•ä¸š, created karma that attracted him to hell.</p>
              <p>for another example. a pet under an owner nowaday are well pampered. reborn in animal realm was it's "attracted" karma å¼•ä¸š and being treated well was it's accumulated merit karma æ»¡ä¸š.</p>
              <p>also some being might be reborn in heaven, but they can also be less fortunate than the very fortunate people in human realm.</p>

              <p> as i heard from old master, an interesting info...about Devadatta is that even though he's in avici hell, he's not suffering at all. in fact he's experience the happiness of Trayastrimsa heaven. this can be complicated to understand. even though Devadatta treated the Buddha badly, Buddha never hold a least bit of grouch on Devadatta. on the contrary, Buddha was grateful to Devadatta, for suceeding His tolerance. and for Buddha's gratefulness, Devadatta had accumulated great merit æ»¡ä¸š. Devadatta reborn in avici hell was due to his å¼•ä¸š, created karma that attracted him to hell.</p>

              <p>i also think compassion is better in solving problem than usage of violence or anything that is related to violation. violation can't solve problem, it only contribute to more continuing hatred. non-condemnation is more in line with eastern thinking. in TCM we say <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">è§£</span></strong>æ¯’ which mean to solve the poison by using balance. but western thinking is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">æ¶ˆ</span></strong>æ¯’, to destroy the poison. then the poison come back again.</p>
              <p>in the past there was a case where the ruler order to destroy Buddhism, and killed a lot of monks. However, the monks did not oppose the governor. they did not break the precepts. later people of the world knew about the case, and saw how good this buddhists were. and they understood that Buddhism is a religion of compassion and not a religion of violence. they accepted and allow Buddhism to grow in their own country as they know Buddhists are good citizens, and Dharma is good teaching.</p>
              <p>so we see how the precepts and compasions/love save buddhism in a long run. if the monks start to oppose the ruler, then people of the world will start to think badly about Buddhism per se. then Buddhism will disappear faster.</p>

              <p>yes, there's the Wrathful Bodhisattva Path, pretty high level stuff.  all but not least, it's still out of unconditional love that the force are use. like a mother teaching her child out of love for the child.</p>
              <p>ps: the recent protest by monks are signs of degeneration.</p>

              <p>One thing good about being kind and compassion is helps prevent the situations of creating a lot of criminals from arising in the first place.</p>
              <p>Kindness and compassion is'nt about touchy and feely sort of showing emotion. It must be tempered with wisdom to the best of ability, it is also about individual accountabilty. One must be accountable for one's own actions.</p>
              <p>Also, ever heard of "spare the rod and spoil the child"? Does that mean you are unkind and uncompassionate to the child?</p>
              <p>Legal system are deterrents, and changes with the times. As long as there are more than one person, concept of self interest exist.  Laws and regulations are meant to preserve status quo, and give a measure of equitability and some recompense to the victims.  </p>
              <p>It is the stronger that bullies people, it is also the strong that protects people. Both emerges from the weak, what values do you wish to inculcate?</p>
