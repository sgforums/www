              <p>I see it differently from you, allowing someone to continue an unhelpful act unimpeded is the more unkind thing to do,  only when his/her's bad actions have stopped, then he/she will stop creating negative karma for themselves.</p>

              <p>One one is either compassionate or one simply is not. If one is justifying, rationalizing or even trying to cultivate compassion - it is still a power trip, though subtle. Beware the folly of the mind.</p>

              <p><br>I understand that she kept falling down for no reasons and her legs were weaken due to the falls. The monk said could be the Dharma Protectors because she is obstructing others from practicing and unlike Buddha, Dharma Protectors still have anger.

One the suffering is being in contact with the enemy or hated one. I was impressed by the profundity of the truth of suffering which I can see in the daily living. The best part was I do not need believe in the Buddha in order to prove the validity of the truth in my life. </span></p>

              <p>Yeah, agree with you. Like many others, I left the temple. So, by bringing up the problem  to the monk will only benefit the new comers. She did not criticize but discriminates new comers especially young Buddhists by gossiping and cause disharmony among the Buddhists. Young Buddhists will never get a chance to participate in some of the events in the temple. Anyway, the monk is aware of the problem now as earlier he was also wondering why new comers never stayed long in this temple.</p>

              <p>I think it depends very much on what is the intention of discussing faults of others. æ…§å¾‹ fashi ever discussed  faults of another Buddhist leader who did not preach true Buddhism and advised us not to believe what that leader said. He was doing the right thing though he was discussing the faults of others. So far, he is the most outspoken Buddhist leader who dare to speak up for the sake of Buddhism.</p>
