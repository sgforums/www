              Reportedly Combats Stress with Meditation</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">BD Dipananda Buddhistdoor Global | 2018-03-15 | </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Meghan Markle, American actress, humanitarian, and fiancée of
              Britain’s Prince Harry, meditates twice a day—20 minutes in the morning and 20
              minutes in the afternoon, according to her former meditation instructor. Years
              before her royal engagement, Light Watkins, an American meditation teacher and
              author of the book Bliss More, taught her the mindfulness practice, which she
              quickly adopted into her daily wellbeing routine.<span>  </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“I met Meghan through a mutual friend of ours about five
              years ago,” Light Watkins told women’s fashion magazine InStyle. “This friend
              of ours is in the wellness space, and I think she had been working on some diet
              stuff with him. She’d been obviously familiar with the practice [of meditation]
              and had been doing it on her own and she was really intrigued by the fact that
              I was a meditation teacher and I do these trainings.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">At the time, Markle was portraying Rachel Zane on the popular
              American drama series Suits, when a friend introduced her to Light Watkins.
              Already familiar with meditation, she decided to follow one of Watkin’s
              meditation courses to receive further training and structure for her
              practice.<span>  </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Mindfulness is an ancient technique used in many
              contemplative spiritual traditions, especially Buddhism, and is has been rapidly
              growing in popularity among modern physiologists, neurologists, and physicians.
              Many recent studies demonstrate that even secular versions of mindfulness offer
              numerous well-being benefits, such as stress reduction, deep relaxation, and
              more positive states of mind. Many organizations, particularly in the West, are
              adapting mindfulness-based meditation programs to high stress environments,
              aiming to help practitioners better cope with the stressors they encounter on a
              daily basis. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Markle was reportedly already well versed in wellness
              practices and followed a very clear diet with a regular exercise as part of her
              daily self-care routine. “I think she just saw meditation as just another tool
              that she could use because she has the resources and I guess the time to
              explore,” said Watkins. “I think it ended up being a lot more profound than she
              originally thought. It seems like she was in a relatively good space beforehand
              and in a better space afterward.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Markle was so inspired by Watkins that she mentioned him in
              her now-discontinued wellness blog, The Tig. She reportedly observed to
              Watkins: “Hey look, I’ve got this news wellness blog and I want to introduce
              more people to the things that I’m benefiting from and one of the key
              components to my wellness program is meditation.” </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Watkins says that he teaches very simple meditation
              techniques that can even be practiced on a bed: “When you close your eyes, your
              mind is going to be incredibly busy. [My] technique is based off of an acronym:
              EASY. Easy stands for embrace, accept, surrender, and yield. And what I’m
              referring to are the very things that people tend to resist in meditation. It’s
              very counterintuitive.” </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">A couple of years ago, Watkins said, he was contected by
              Markle, who noted that she was meditating twice a day. With the royal wedding
              scheduled for later this spring, Watkins added, Markle is surely extremely
              busy, but still at times responds to the inspiration emails that he sends out
              every day: “I’m pretty sure she’s still meditating.”</span></p>
