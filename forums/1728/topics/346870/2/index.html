              <p>Sorry just now haven't reply your qn about Mandarin.. then the moment I remembered, my house's electricity went out <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> (they were fixing my house lamp)</p>
              <p>The Chinese at my dharma center are easy to understand. There are English speaking people there also, whose Chinese isn't too good. We don't use difficult technical terminologies to explain things but ordinary, plain and simple Chinese.</p>
              <p>In fact one of the local dharma teachers (english speaking and holds a Ph.D) couldnt understand much Chinese, but my Master chose him to teach the dharma (but he has left for Australia recently, there's another Jen Chen Buddhist community there also). Can take it as opportunity to learn Chinese also.. haha</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for age... there's adult class... youth class (teenagers) and children class.</p>
              <p>I'm still 18 but I go adult class more often... just a personal choice since the time I came, like 13 years old (though their youth class also quite fun).. or maybe my thinking very old <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>This is the first time he taught in Hokkien (the last 20 minutes on finance) in dozens of his VCDs I've watched... because he wanted to educate certain group of people (the less educated, poorer people) on that issue. Otherwise I don't think he would speak in Hokkien. I also couldnt understand that part. Haha</p>
