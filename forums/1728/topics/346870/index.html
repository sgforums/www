              <p>Hi</p>
              <p>I helped someone for close to 4 years and did
                                              it from my heart.  Now the person has disappeared and
                                              left me in a mess.  In helping this person, i lost
                                              everything.  I'm very troubled and sad and can't understand or
                                              accept how a person could inflict such pain on others.</p>
              <p>I'm a contracted employee in an MNC and worry about being
                                              retrenched during economic downturn as I
                                              have financial deadlines to meet, my own and now plus
                                              his.  The person depleted my savings and i have to
                                              service financial committments that he took under my
                                              name. </p>
              <p>A Police report was lodged but the Police progress has been slow
                                              and it's uncertain if justice will ever be served. </p>

                                              regularly and prayed for the last 4 years that this person
                                              will have a better life.  Instead, he stole everything from
                                              me, even my sunshine.</p>
              <p>With hard work, i could well recover from my financial
                                              loss but how do you ever recover from emotional
                                              loss?  Sometimes i feel like giving up on life
                                              and want to just float off my balcony.</p>

              <p>Hi, sorry to hear of your loss.</p>
              <p>Indeed this is a case that shows that nothing on earth is stable, permanent, and 'ours'... not 'wealth', not even 'health', or even 'relationships', or anything that we invest our identifications with (as 'mine'). Nothing is permanent... we start from nothing and we end with nothing (death), we can't bring it over to the next life. Hence we have to practice letting go... this is part of our practice. We have to practice letting go (everything -- our mind, body, posessions, everything) until we are free to die and move on without any regrets or attachment at any moments.</p>
              <p>The only thing we can bring over to the next life are four things... blessings (merits), wisdom, causes and conditions, and karmic strength. Therefore practicing the dharma is important.</p>
              <p>At the same time as you mentioned... money lost can be earned back. At the time when you started with nothing, you didn't see it as a problem. You just work. Similarly... don't let the current loss obstruct you. There are many people who have lost everything and are still quite well off later. Our moderator Thusness also went bankrupt before, during the 1997 financial crisis... but he did quite well years after that. But he was also grateful for the 1997 crisis because he came to know Buddhism during that time... as he wrote in <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html</a> : "<span style="font-size: 100%;" lang="EN-US">I got in touch with
                  Buddhism in 1997. Not because I wanted to find out more about the
                  experience of ‘Presence’ but rather the teaching of impermanence syncs
                  deeply with what I experience in life. I am faced with the possibility
                  of losing all my wealth and more by financial crisis."</span></p>
              <p>Also for the current crisis he also lost quite a lot of wealth but he is again grateful because it has helped him in terms of spirituality and cultivation.</p>
              <p>Sometimes without these reminders, people never realise some of the fundamental truths of life (such as suffering, impermanence, etc...) and the need to practice the dharma... so do look into the dharma, see how you can apply it in practice in your everyday life and overcome your problems.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway hope this helps, by Eckhart Tolle:</p>
              <p><br>THE LOST RING</p>
              <p><br>When I was seeing people as a counselor and spiritual teacher, I would<br>visit a woman twice a week whose body was riddled with cancer. She was a<br>schoolteacher in her midforties<br>and had been given no more than a few<br>months to live by her doctors. Sometimes a few words were spoken during<br>those visits, but mostly we would sit together in silence, and as we did, she<br>had her first glimpses of the stillness within herself that she never knew<br>existed during her busy life as a schoolteacher.</p>
              <p><br>One day, however, I arrived to find her in a state of great distress and<br>anger. “What happened” I asked. Her diamond ring, of great monetary as<br>well as sentimental value, had disappeared, and she said she was sure it had<br>been stolen by the woman who came to look after her for a few hours every<br>day. She said she didn’t understand how anybody could be so callous and<br>heartless as to do this to her. She asked me whether she should confront the<br>woman or whether it would be better to call the police immediately. I said I<br>couldn’t tell her what to do, but asked her to find out how important a ring or<br>anything else was at this point in her life. “You don’t understand,” she said.<br>“This was my grandmother’s ring. I used to wear it every day until I got ill<br>and my hands became too swollen. It’s more than just a ring to me. How can<br>I not be upset?”</p>
              <p><br>The quickness of her response and the anger and defensiveness in her<br>voice were indications that she had not yet become present enough to look<br>within and to disentangle her reaction from the event and observe them both.<br>Her anger and defensiveness were signs that the ego was still speaking<br>through her. I said, “I am going to ask you a few questions, but instead of<br>answering them now, see if you can find the answers within you. I will pause<br>briefly after each question. When an answer comes, it may not necessarily<br>come in the form of words.” She said she was ready to listen. I asked: “Do<br>you realize that you will have to let go of the ring at some point, perhaps<br>quite soon? How much more time do you need before you will be ready to let<br>go of it? Will you become less when you let go of it? Has who you are<br>become diminished by the loss?” There were a few minutes of silence after<br>the last question.</p>
              <p><br>When she started speaking again, there was a smile on her face, and<br>she seemed at peace. “The last question made me realize something<br>important. First I went to my mind for an answer and my mind said, ‘Yes, of<br>course you have been diminished.’ Then I asked myself the question again,</p>
              <p>‘Has who I am become diminished?’ This time I tried to feel rather than think the answer. And suddenly I could feel my I Amness. I have never felt that before. If I can feel the I Am so strongly, then who I am hasn’t been<br>diminished at all. I can still feel it now, something peaceful but very alive.”<br>“That is the joy of Being,” I said. “You can only feel it when you get<br>out of your head. Being must be felt. It can’t be thought. The ego doesn’t<br>know about it because thought is what it consists of. The ring was really in<br>your head as a thought that you confused with the sense of I Am. You<br>thought the I Am or a part of it was in the ring.</p>
              <p><br>“Whatever the ego seeks and gets attached to are substitutes for the<br>Being that it cannot feel. You can value and care for things, but whenever<br>you get attached to them, you will know it’s the ego. And you are never<br>really attached to a thing but to a thought that has ‘I,’ ‘me,’ or ‘mine’ in it.<br>Whenever you completely accept a loss, you go beyond ego, and who you<br>are, the I Am which is consciousness itself, emerges.”<br>She said, “Now I understand something Jesus said that never made<br>much sense to me before: ‘If someone takes your shirt, let him have your<br>coat as well.’”</p>
              <p><br>“That’s right,” I said. “It doesn’t mean you should never lock your<br>door. All it means is that sometimes letting things go is an act of far greater<br>power than defending or hanging on.”</p>
              <p><br>In the last few weeks of her life as her body became weaker, she<br>became more and more radiant, as if light were shining through her. She<br>gave many of her possessions away, some to the woman she thought had<br>stolen the ring, and with each thing she gave away, her joy deepened. When<br>her mother called me to let me know she had passed away, she also<br>mentioned that after her death they found her ring in the medicine cabinet in<br>the bathroom. Did the woman return the ring, or had it been there all the<br>time? Nobody will ever know. One thing we do know: Life will give you<br>whatever experience is most helpful for the evolution of your consciousness.<br>How do you now this is the experience you need? Because this is the<br>experience you are having at this moment.</p>
              <p><br>Is it wrong then to be proud of one’s possessions or to feel resentful<br>toward people to have more than you? Not at all. That sense of pride, of<br>needing to stand out, the apparent enhancement of one’s self through “more<br>than” and diminishment through “less than” is neither right nor wrong – it is<br>the ego. The ego isn’t wrong; it’s just unconscious. When you observe the<br>ego in yourself, you are beginning to go beyond it. Don’t take the ego too<br>seriously. When you detect egoic behavior in yourself, smile. At times you<br>may even laugh. How could humanity have been taken in by this for so long?<br>Above all, know that the ego isn’t personal. It isn’t who you are. If you<br>consider the ego to be your personal problem, that’s just more ego.</p>
              <p><br>THE ILLUSION OF OWNERSHIP</p>
              <p><br>To “own” something – what does it really mean? What does it mean to make<br>something “mine”? If you stand on a street in New York, point to a huge<br>skyscraper and say, “That building is mine. I own it,” you are either very<br>wealthy or you are delusional or a liar. In any case, you are telling a story in<br>which the thought form “I” and the thought form “building” merge into one.<br>That’s how the mental concept of ownership works. If everybody agrees with<br>your story, there will be signed pieces of paper to certify their agreement<br>with it. You are wealthy. If nobody agrees with the story, they will send you<br>to a psychiatrist. You are delusional, or a compulsive liar.</p>
              <p><br>It is important to recognize here that the story and the thought forms<br>that make up the story, whether people agree with it or not, have absolutely<br>nothing to do with who you are. Even if people agree with it, it is ultimately<br>a fiction. Many people don’t realize until they are on their deathbed and<br>everything external falls away that no thing ever had anything to do with who<br>they are. In the proximity of death, the whole concept of ownership stands<br>revealed as ultimately meaningless. In the last moments of their life, they<br>then also realize that while they were looking throughout their lives for a<br>more complete sense of self, what they were really looking for, their Being,<br>had actually always already been there, but had been largely obscured by<br>their identification with things, which ultimately means identification with<br>their mind.</p>
              <p><br>“Blessed are the poor in spirit,” Jesus said, “for theirs will be the<br>kingdom of heaven.”1 What does “poor in spirit” mean? No inner baggage,<br>no identifications. Not with things, nor with any mental concepts that have a<br>sense of self in them. And what is the “kingdom of heaven” The simple but<br>profound joy of Being that is there when you let og of identifications and so<br>become “poor in spirit.”</p>
              <p><br>This is why renouncing all possessions has been an ancient spiritual<br>practice in both East and West. Renunciation of possessions, however, will<br>not automatically free you of the ego. It will attempt to ensure its survival by<br>finding something else to identify with, for example, a mental image of<br>yourself as someone who has transcended all interest in material possessions<br>and is therefore superior, is more spiritual than others. There are people who<br>have renounced all possessions but have a bigger ego than some millionaires.<br>If you take away one kind of identification, the ego will quickly find another.<br>It ultimately doesn’t mind what it identifies with as long as it has an identity.<br>Anticonsumerism<br>or antiprivate<br>ownership would be another thought form,<br>another mental position, that can replace identification with possessions.<br>Through it you could make yourself right and others wrong. As we shall see<br>later, making yourself right and others wrong is one of the principal egoic<br>mind patterns, one of the main forms of unconsciousness. In other words, the<br>content of the ego may change; the mind structure that keeps it alive does<br>not.</p>
              <p><br>One of the unconscious assumptions is that by identifying with an<br>object through the fiction of ownership, the apparent solidity and<br>permanency of that material object will endow your sense of self with<br>greater solidity and permanency. This applies particularly to buildings and<br>even more so to land since it is the only thing you think you can own that<br>cannot be destroyed. The absurdity of owning something becomes even more<br>apparent in the case of land. In the days of the white settlement, the natives<br>of North America found ownership of land an incomprehensible concept.<br>And so they lost it when the Europeans made them signs pieces of paper that<br>were equally incomprehensible to them. They felt they belonged to the land,<br>but the land did not belong to them.</p>
              <p><br>The ego tends to equate having with Being: I have, therefore I am.<br>And the more I have, the more I am. The ego lives through comparison. How<br>you are seen by others turns into how you see yourself. If everyone lived in a<br>mansion or everyone was wealthy, your mansion or your wealth would no<br>longer serve to enhance your sense of self. You could then move to a simple<br>cabin, give up our wealth, and regain an identity by seeing yourself and<br>being seen as more spiritual than others. How you are seen by others<br>becomes the mirror that tells you what you are like and who you are. The<br>ego’s sense of selfworth<br>is in most cases bound up with the worth you have<br>in the eyes of others. You need others to give you a sense of self, and if you<br>live in a culture that to a large extent equates selfworth<br>with how much and<br>what you have, if you cannot look through this collective delusion, you will<br>be condemned to chasing after things for the rest of your life in the vain hope<br>of finding your worth and completion of your sense of self there.</p>
              <p><br>How do you let go of attachment to things? Don’t even try. It’s<br>impossible. Attachment to things drops away by itself when you no longer<br>seek to find yourself in them. In the meantime, just be aware of your<br>attachment to things. Sometimes you may not know that you are attached to<br>something, which is to say, until you lose it or there is the threat of loss. If<br>you then become upset, anxious, and so on, it means you are attached. If you<br>are aware that you are identified with a thing, the identification is no longer<br>total. “I am the awareness that is aware that there is attachment.” That’s the<br>beginning of the transformation of consciousness.</p>

              <p>Karma spans countless lifetimes. So whatever encounter in life, there is a high likelihood that it is the result of a karmic cause from a previous lifetime. So we should bring acceptance to whatever happens... see it as a form of karmic cleansing. My master did say before if you lost something and nobody returns you.. that is a sign you have taken something from others in the past (i.e. past life).</p>

              <p>Yes, human life is so much more precious than transient material wealth and posessions. It is a golden opportunity to walk the path of wisdom, self awareness, and liberation.</p>
              <p>The opportunity of a human birth is so rare that the Buddha likened the rarity to a turtle who comes to the surface of the ocean every 100 years, to actually go through a hoop. It's the 'jackpot' opportunity.</p>
              <p>p.s. Many people live in poverty in other parts of the world yet their quality of life and happiness is far more than people in our materialistic society. This is proven by research. Our identification, seeking, and attachment to 'things' are in fact the cause of our misery.</p>

              <p>Everyday is struggle just to survive.  No one at work knows of my personal crisis and i won't tell.  All they see is a drastic physical change and that i've lost my sunshine.</p>
              <p>I took my plight to the internet, but ended up taunted, bitter and bruised.  They first day i used a forum, reduced me to an emotional wreck and i almost gave up living that very night. </p>
              <p>Since become a Buddhist many years ago, each time I reach a setback, I turn to Buddhist teachings and reasonings see myself through.   My favourite place is the Kuan Yin temple in Pandan, especially in the evenings.  It is there that i can let my guard down and try to find strength to make sense of what has happened. I don't go there looking for answers but to enjoy the tranquility and be reminded of the bigger picture in life and especially Precept 1: to abstain from killing any living being.  Taking my own life is breaking that precept.  i know well the anguish of emotional pain and i won't want my family to experience the same.</p>

              <p>Especially to "An Eternal Now" and to "Isis". Thank you very much for your replies and for showing me the way out of self-created world of living hell.  My main issue is acceptance and in understanding why and through you i now have.  I hope my final tears are dropped today and i WILL move on.  It's not the loss of material wealth that i can't get over but the unexpected emotional upheaval that i have to adjust to and the betrayal of a genuine friendship that i offered.</p>
              <p>I just came from the Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Temple website at url: <a href="http://www.kmspks.org/index.php">http://www.kmspks.org/index.php</a>, and found they have a counselling service available. They will also be holding a ceremony in March, on taking the 3 Refuges and the 5 precepts and in English.  Been something I've been wanting to do, but it's hard to find such for the English speaking community.</p>

              <p>My dharma center is a place to learn dharma and practice. We also do meditation together on certain occasions, and my teacher can instruct you if you ask. I don't think we'll be doing meditation today.</p>
              <p>With regards to 'learning dharma', we teach dharma but not the academic theoretical type... we teach dharma that are practical and are inseparable from daily lives.</p>
