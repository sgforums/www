A wind from the east would blow it west, a wind from the west would blow it east. A wind from the north would blow it south, a wind from the south would blow it north. And suppose a blind sea turtle were in the great earth and came to the surface once every century. Now what do you think: would that blind sea turtle, rising to the surface once every century, come up with his neck right through the single hole of the yoke?"<br><br>"It would be a very rare occurrence, lord, that the blind sea turtle, rising to the surface once every century, come up with his neck right through the single hole of the yoke."<br><br>"To be born a human is also a very rare occurrence. Likewise a very rare occurrence for a Tathagata [The Buddha, literally 'one thus gone'], worthy and rightly self awakened, to arise in the world. Likewise a very rare occurrence that a doctrine and discipline expounded by a Tathagata is taught and flourishes in the world. Now, this human state has been obtained. A Tathagata, worthy and rightly self awakened, has arisen in the world. A doctrine and discipline expounded by a Tathagata is taught and flourishes in the world.<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Blind Turtle in Search of a Floating Wood<br><br>In the Mahaparinirvana Sutra, the Buddha used the metaphor of a blind turtle in a vast ocean to explain how difficult it is to be reborn as a human being and at the same time to have the chance of hearing the Dharma.<br><br>Suppose there is a small piece of wood floating on a vast ocean. The wood has a small hole the size of which is just enough for the head of a turtle to pop into. There is a long-lived sea turtle in the ocean. Once every one hundred years, this turtle comes out from the bottom of the ocean and pops his head into the hole of the wood.<br><br>To be able to hear the Dharma is just as hard as for the blind turtle to encounter the small piece of wood on a vast ocean and let its head go through the hole in the wood piece.<br><br>"Behold, bhikkhus, therefore you should persevere to realize as it truly is, 'This is dukkha [unsatisfactory/unpleasant/unhappiness, always changing and falling away] This is the origin of dukkha. This is the cessation of dukkha.  This is the path leading to the cessation of dukkha(stress).'"<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>USNISA VIJAYA DHARANI SUTRA </strong><br><br>Thus I heard, at Bhagavan (World Honoured One) was dwelling in the city of Shravasti at Jeta Grove, in the Garden of Anthapindada (Benefactor of Orphans and the Solitary), together with his regular disciples of twelve hundred and fifthy great Bhiksus and twelve thousand Maha Boddhisattva Samgha in all.<br><br>At that time the devas (heavenly beings) in Trayastrimsa Heaven were also having a gathering in the Good Dharma Hall. Among them was a devaputra by the name of Susthita who was, together with the other great devaputras, frolicking in the garden and courtyard, enjoying the supreme wonderful bliss of heavenly life. Surrounded by devis (female heavenly beings) they were extremely happy; singing, dancing and amusing themselves.<br><br>Soon after night fall, Devaputra Susthita suddenly heard a voice in space saying, "Devaputra Susthita, you have only seven days (earth's time) left to live. After death you will fall into the hells to undergo more suffering. Only after fulfilling your karmic retribution will you be reborn in the human realm, but to a humble and destitute family; while in the mother's worm you will be without eyes and be born blind."<br><br>On hearing this, Devaputra Susthita was so terrified that his hair stood on ends.Tormented and distressed, he rushed over to the place of Lord Sakra; bursing into tears and not knowing what to do, he prostrated himself at the of Lord Sakra, telling Lora Sakra of what had happened.<br><br>"As I was enjoying the frolics of dances and songs with the heavenly devis, I suddenly heard a voice in the space telling me that I had only seven days of life left, and that I would fall into Jambu-dvipa after death, remaining there in the animal realm for seven successive lives. Following that I will fall into the various hells to endure more suffering. Only after my karmic retribution has been fulfilled will I be reborn as a human, and even then I will be reborn without eyes in a poor and humble family. Lord of Heaven, how can I escape from such suffering?"<br><br>On hearing Devaputra Susthita's tearful appeal, Lord Sakra was greatly astonished and thought to himself, "In what seven successive evil paths and forms will this Deveputra Susthita undergo?"<br><br>Lord Sakra immediately calmed his mind to enter Samadhi and careful observations. Instantly he saw that Devaputra Susthata would undergo seven successive evil paths in the forms of pig, dog, jackal, monkey, python, crow and vulture, all feeding on filth and putrescence. Having seen the seven future rebirth forms of Devaputra Susthita, Lord Sakra was shattered and filled with great sorrow, bit could not think of any way to help Susthita. He felt that only the Tathagata, Arhat, Samyak-Sambuddha could save Susthita from falling into the evil destinies of great sufferings.<br><br>Thus, soon after night fall that very day, Lord Sakra prepared various types of wreaths, perfumes and incense, adorning himself with fine deta garments and bearing these offerings, made his way to the garden of Anathapindada, the abode of the World Honoured One. Upon arrival, Lord first prostrated himself at the feet of the Buddha in worship, before circumambulated the Buddha seven times clockwise in worship, before laying out his great puja (offerings). Kneeling in front of the Buddha, Lord Sakra described the seven successive rebirths in animals realm with details of his subsequent retribution.<br><br>Instantly from the usnisa (crown of the head) of the Tathagata sprang out multiple rays of light illuminating the world in the ten directions; the light then returned, circling the Buddha three times before entering His mouth. The Buddha then smiled and said to Lord Sakra, "Lord of Heaven, there is a Dharani known as the Usnisa Vijaya Dharani, it can purify all evil paths, completely eliminating all birth and death. It can also liberate all miseries and sufferings of beings in the realm of hell, King Yama and animal, destroy all the hells, and deliver sentient beings to the good path."<br><br>Lord of Heaven, if one hears this Usnisa Vijaya Dharani, all the bad karma incurred from his previous lives should cause him to fall into hells will be destroyed altogether. He will instead acquire a fine and pure body, and will clearly remember the Dharani wherever he is reborn, from one Buddhaland to another, from one heavenly realm to another heavenly realm. Indeed throughout the Trayastrimsa Heavens, wherever he is reborn, he will not forget."<br><br>Lord of Heaven, if someone at death's door recalls this Dharani, even for just a moment, his life-span will be extended and he will acquire purification of body, speech and mind. Without suffering any physical pain and in accordance with his meritorious deeds, he will enjoy tranquility everywhere. Receiving blessings from all the Thatagatas, constantly guarded by Devas and protected by Boddhisattvas, he will be honoured and respected by people, and his evils hindrances will be eradicated."<br><br>Lord of Heaven, if someone can sincerely read or recite this Dharani even for a short of time, all his future karmic retributions which would lead him to suffer in the realm of hell, King Yama and hungry ghost, will be completely destroyed and eradicated without leaving any trace. He will be free to go to any of the Buddhas' Pure Lands and heavenly palaces; all gateways leading to the Boddhisattvas' abode are open to him unobstructed.<br><br>" After hearing the above discourse, Lord Sakra immediately appeal to the Buddha, "For the sake of all sentient beings, may the World Honoured One please gives a discourse by which one's life-span can be lengthened.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Buddha was aware of the Lord Sakra's intention and his eagerness to hear His discourse on this Dharani and immediately proclaimed the Mantra thus: .......<br><br><strong>Then the Buddha told Lord Sakra, "The above said Mantra is as known the 'Purifying All Evil Paths Usnisa Vijaya Dharani'. It can eliminate all evil karmic hindrances, eradicating the suffering of all evil paths." </strong><br>Lord of Heaven, this great Dharani is proclaimed together by Buddhas as numerous as the sand-grains in eighty-eight hundred thousand koti of Ganges Rivers. All Buddhas rejoice and uphold this Dharani as verified by the wisdom seal of the Tathagata Maha Vairocana. I proclaim this Dharani for the purposes of removing all suffering borne by beings in the evil paths and liberate them from painful retributions in hell, animal, and King Yama's realms; to deliver being facing immediate danger of falling into the sea of birth and death (samsara); and to assist helpless beings with short life-span and poor fortune; to deliver beings who like to commit all kinds of evil deeds. Moreover,because of the power manifested by this Dharani in this Jambu-dvipa world, it would cause beings in hells and other evil realms; those with poor fortune and revolving in the cycle of birth and death; those not believing in the existing of good and evil deeds and deviated from the proper path to attain deliverance."<br><br>Again the Buddha reminded Lord Sakra, "I now entrust this Dharani to you.You should in turn convey It to Devaputra Susthita. In addition, you yourself should uphold, recite, contemplate, terasure, memorise It by heart and make reverance to it. To beings in this Jambu-dvipa world this Dharani Mudra should be widely proclaimed. Also, for the benefits of all heavenly beings, this Dharani Mudra should be proclaimed. Lord of Heaven, you should diligently uphold and protect It, never letting It be forgetten or lost."<br><br>Lord of Heave, if someone hears this Dharani even for just a moment, he will not undergo karmic retribution from the evil karma and severe hindrances accumulated from thousands kalpas ago, that would otherwise cause him to revolve in the cycles of birth and death in all kinds of forms in the evil paths-hell, hungry ghost, animal, realm fo King Yama; Asuras, Yaksa, Raksasa, ghost spirits, Putana, Kataputana, Apasmara; mosquitoes, gnats, tortoise, dogs, pythons, birds, wild animals, crawling creatures and even ants and other life-forms. Owing to the merits accrued from hearing this Dharani, once this very life is over, he will be reborn in the Buddhalands, together with all the Buddhas and Ekajati-pratibaddaha, or in distinguished Brahmin or Ksatriya family, or other wealthy and influential family. Lord of Heaven, this person will be reborn in any one of the above said excellent places or good families all because he has heard this Dharani, and hence be reborn in a good and pure place. Lord of Heaven, even acquiring a most victorious Boddhimanda is solely caused by praising the meritorious virtues of this Dharani. Hence, this Dharani is also known as the Auspicious Dharani, which can purify all evil paths. This Usnisa Dharani is like a bright precious Mani Pearl- pure and flawless, clear as space; Its brilliance is illuminating and all pervading. If any being uphold this Dharani, likewise they be bright and pure. This Dharani is similar to the Jambunada gold- bright, pure and soft, not tainted by filth and well-liked by all who see it. Lord of Heaven, beings who uphold this Dharani are just pure and virtuous. By virtue of this pure practice, they will be reborn in yhe good paths."<br><br>"Lord of Heaven, where this Dharani dwells, if it is written for distribution, to be upheld, read and recited, heard and made reverance to, this will cause all evil paths to be purified; miseries and sufferings in all hells will be completely eradicated."<br><br>Buddha again told Lord Sakra saying, "If someone could write his Dharani and place It on the top of the a tall banner, high mountain or in a tall building or eve keeping It in a stupa; Lord of Heaven, if there are bhiksus or bhiksunis, upasakas or upasikas, laymen or laywomen who have seen this Dharani atop the obove structures; or the shadows of these structures should fall on beings who come near to them, or particles of dust from the written Dharani are blown onto their bodies, Lord of Heaven! Should the accumulated evil karma of these beings causes them to fall into the paths such as realms of hell, animal, King Yama, hungry ghost or asura, they will all be spared from them, and they will not be tainted with filth and defilement. Lord of Heaven! Instead all the Buddhas will bestow prediction (Vyakarana) onto these beings who will never regress the path to Anuttara-samyak-samboddhi (complete enlightenment)."<br><br>Lord of Heaven, let alone if one makes various offerings of wreaths, perfumes, incense, banners and flags, canopies decorated with gems, clothings, necklaces of precious stones, etc. to adorn and honour this Dharani, then most respectfully with palms together circumambulate the stupa, bowing and taling refuge, Lord of Heaven, those who make such offerings are called the great Mahasattvas, true Buddhas diciples and the pillars of Dharma. Such stupas will be regarded as the Tathagata's complete body sarira-stupa." At that time, in the early parts of the night, ruler of the Hell Realm-King Yama came to the abode of the Buddha. First, using various deva garments, beautiful flowers, perfumes, and other excellencies, he made offerings to the Buddha, then circumambulating the Buddha seven times before prostrating himself at the feet of the Buddha in reverance, saying, "I heard that the Tathagata was giving a discourse in praise upholding the powerful Dharani; I have come with the intentions to learn and cultivate It. I shall constantly guard and protect those who uphold, read and recite this powerful Dharani, not allowing them to fall into hell because they followed the teachings of the Tathagata."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>At that time, the four Guardians of the World--the Catur-maharajas circumambulating the Buddha three times, and most respectfully said, "World Honoured One, may the Tathagata please explain in details the way to uphold this Dharani."<br><br>The Buddha then told the Four heavenly Kings, saying, "Please listen attentively, for your benefits as well as for the benefits of all beings with short life-span, I will now explain the method to uphold this Dharani. During a full moon day, one should first bathe oneself and put on new clean clothes, take only vegetarian food and recite this Dharani a thousand (1000) times, this will cause him to lengthen his life-span, and be permanently free from the sufferings of illness, all his karmic hindrances, including those which could cause him to suffer in hell will be completely eradicated. If birds, animals and other sentient beings hear this Dharani once, they will be reborn in the impure and gross body forms once their lives ended."<br><br>The Buddha continued, "If someone suffering from a serious disease hear this Dharani, he will be free from it. All other illness will also be eradicated, so too will the evils karma that will cause him to fall into the evils paths. He will be reborn in the Land of Ultimate Bliss after the end of his life. From then onwards he will no longer be born from the womb, instead, wherever he is reborn, he will be born as transformed from the lotus flower. He would always remember and uphold this Dharani and gain knowledge of his past lives."<br><br>The Buddha again added, "If someone has already committed all the severe evils before his death, according to his sinful his deeds, he ought to fall into one of these realm of hell, animals, King Yama or hungry ghosts, or even into one the big Avici Hells; or be reborn as aquatic animals, or as different forms of birds and animals. If someone could remove part of the skeletons of the deceased, and holding a fistful of soil, chant this Dharani twenty one (21) times and scatter them over the bones, then deceased will be reborn in heaven."<br><br>The Buddha furthwe added, "If one can chant this Dharani twenty one (21) times daily, he is entitled to accept all the immense worldly offerings and will be reborn in the Land of Ultimate Bliss after his death. If one chants this Dharani constantly, he will attain Maha Nirvana and be able to lengthen his life-span besibes enjoying the most extraordinary bliss. After his life is over, he will be reborn in any of the wonderful Buddhalands, in constant company of the Buddhas. All Tathagata will always give discourse on the profound and wonderful truth of Dharma and all World Honoured Ones will bestow a prediction of enlightenment upon him. The light illuminating from his body will pervade all Buddhaland."<br><br>The Buddha further explained, 'To recite this Dharani, one should first, in front of the Buddha's image, using some clean soil, construct a square altar, the size according to one's wish. On top of this altar one should spread different kinds of grass, flowers and burn different kinds of quality incense. Then kneeling down with right knee on the floor, mindfully reciting the Buddha's name and the hands in the Mudrani symbol ( i.e each hand dending the first finger and pressing it down with the thumb and place both palms together) in reverance, one should recite this Dharani one hundred and eight times (10<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. Then showers of flowers would rain down from the clouds onto the altar and would thus be universally making offerings to Boddhas as numerous as the sand grains of eighty-eight hundred thousand koti nayuta of Ganges rivers. These Buddhas will silmultaneously praise, "Excellent! Rare indeed! A true Buddha's diciple!" He will instantly attain Unobstructed Wisdom Samadhi and Great Boddhi Mind Adorn Samadhi. Thus is the way to uphold this Dharani."<br><br>The Buddha again exhorted Lord Sakra saying, "Lord of Heaven, I use this expedient to deliver beings which would otherwise have fallen into hells; to purify all evil paths; and to lengthen the life-span of those who uphold this practice. Lord of Heaven, please go back and convey this Dharani to Deveputra Susthita, both of you come to see me after seven days have passed."<br><br>Then, at the abode of the World Honoured One, Lord of Heaven respectfully received this Dharani practice and returned to his heavenly palace to convey it to Deveputra Sushi.ta.<br><br>Having received this Dharani, Devaputra Susthita kept to the practice as instructed for six days and six nights, after which all his wishes were completely fulfilled. The karma which should lead him to suffer in all the evil paths were all eradicated. He would remained on the Boddhi path and increase his life-span for an immeasureable period of time. Thus, he was extremely delighted, exclaiming aloud in praise, "Extrordinary Tathagata! What a wonderful Dharma! Its efficacy explicitly verified! Rare indeed! Truly I have thus obtained deliverance!"<br><br>When the seven days (Jambu-dvipa time) were over, Lord Sakra brought Devaputra Susthita together with other heavenly beings respectfully bearing excellent and wonderful offerings of wreaths, perfumes, incense, jewelled banners, canapies decorated with gemstone, deva-garments and garlands of offerings. Using heavenly garments and various of precious stones to make offerings to World Honoured One, they then respectfully circumambulated the Buddha a hundred times, paid homage to the Buddha preaching Dharma.<br><br>The World Honoured One then extended his golden arm and touch the crown of Devaputra Susthita, to whom not only He preached the Dharma but also bestowed a prediction of Deveputra Susthita's attainment to Boddhi. Finally, the Buddha said, "This Sutra shall be Known as the 'Purifying All Evil Paths Usnisa Vijaya Dharani'. You should all diligently uphold it." On hearing this Dharma, the entire assembly was extremely happy. They believed, accepted and respectfully practised It.<br><br></div>

Right?<br>Thks.</div></blockquote>If you can abide by the 5 precepts, being reborn as a human again in afterlife isn't a problem. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Furthermore we must cultivate the 10 virtuous deeds and cultivate the dharma sincerely in your life. In this way we will be cultivating blessings and merits, and will enjoy a good life in our next life.<br><br>The five precepts are as follows:<br><br>1. I undertake the precept to refrain from destroying living creatures.<br>2. I undertake the precept to refrain from taking that which is not given.<br>3. I undertake the precept to refrain from sexual misconduct.<br>4. I undertake the precept to refrain from incorrect speech.<br>5. I undertake the precept to refrain from intoxicating drinks and drugs which lead to carelessness.<br><br>And the 10 virtuous deeds are as follows: Refrain from killing, stealing, lying, sexual misconduct, frivolous and meaningless talk, tale bearing, abusive speech, covetousness, ill-will and perverted views.<br><br>And more importantly... we should cultivate wisdom and one day be free from sufferings and the cycle of birth and death and attain the highest bliss of nirvana. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Because being born as a human is so rare and so precious, we must not waste our lives away but use this opportunity to cultivate the great enlightened wisdom and supramundane bliss.</div>
