              <p> Traling is a relatively large and famous monastic complex in the Golok area. <br>Many venerable monks and great masters from this monastery are famed throughout Tibet: Tulku Tenpai Nyima Rinpoche, Khenchen PadmaLod ro, Siddha Khenpo Tarding Rinpoche, Lingtrul Rinpoche Chöying Dorje the tulku of Ling Lama Chöje Dorje, Vajra Master Khenpo Panchen Dawa, the learned Kunzang Gyaltsen <br>founder of the orphan school affiliated with the Lion &amp; Dragon Palace at Traling.<br><br>Khenpo Padma Lodro  highly valued and entrusted by Khenpo Münsel Rinpoche  was given special recognition after the passing of Münsel Rinpoche when he was enthroned. He is a great master and lineage holder of Dzogpa Chenpo and has become one of the authorities on Dzogchen teachings in Golok. He has established many retreat centers all over Tibet. Regardless of his old age and weakness, every year he travels tirelessly as far as Samye Monastery in Central Tibet, as<br>well as to mainland china, in order to propagate the Dzogchen teachings and guide disciples in retreat.<br><br>I am very fortunate that every time I return to Tibet, I have the opportunity to visit a group of practitioners who are in lifetime retreat in the hills behind Traling Monastery, and to bring them some modest offerings. Every time I do this it is a time of reconnection with my lineage and a renewal of devotion. As is well known, living conditions are quite hard and material comforts are insufficient in Golok. However, the infinite Dharma joy that radiates out from these practitioners during our communication has affected me deeply. In today’s materialistic age, it is really rare and precious that they practice the Dharma so diligently. Their perseverance is worthy of rejoicing and praise. Each and every one of these practitioners is excellent and I admire them greatly. However I would like to share with you, my dharma friends, some deeds of two of these special practitioners.</p>
              <p>The first one is called Gelok Lama. He is nearly 50 years old, with dark skin and a lanky build. It is said that he has achieved the signs of realization of the rainbow body: knowing others’ thoughts,transcending time and space without hindrance, etc. Personally, when I first met him I experienced a feeling of complete exposure – as if he were totally able to behold my entire being. I then understood that he is not at all living as an ordinary person.</p>
              <p>He was prophesied by Kyabje Kathok Moktsa Rinpoche to realize the rainbow body in this very life. His only possessions are poverty and peace, as well as a group of vultures. Every day he shares his already very limited food with this group of vultures and often chants scriptures to them. I once heard him say with my own ears, that his way of calling the vultures over was to chant the Seven Line Prayer once. If you have ever been to a sky burial ground in Tibet, you would be deeply impressed by the ferocity and barbarity of the vultures. However at the feet of this realized being they seem so gentle and obedient. One of my very dear teachers, Khenpo Kuncho, told a story about how he witnessed Gelok Lama feeding vultures yoghurt from his hand. The wild creatures would turn their heads sideways since their large beaks prevented them from holding their heads upright to eat.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: black; font-size: 9pt;  " lang="EN">Once Gelok Lama was invited to Kathok monastery in Kham by Kathok Moktsa Rinpoche. This is a distance of about 1000 miles. After he arrived the monks noticed a strange looking vulture in the area, where there usually are none. When Gelok Lama came out of his dwelling he recognized it as one of the vultures from Traling. Apparently it had followed him and when he left Kathok monastery, the vulture did as well. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: black; font-size: 9pt;  " lang="EN"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: black; font-size: 9pt;  " lang="EN">Gelok Lama is an unassuming, humble and kind person, but sometimes he shows the demeanor and miraculous power of his realization. Once he was sitting in his retreat cave meditating, locked in from the inside. Suddenly he manifested on top of the mountain. He completed a session of deep meditation on the mountain top and then returned to his cave where he found he was unable to re-enter due to the lock. He had to find a shepherd boy who was small enough to climb in through the little window and unlock the door. This is a powerful sign of his accomplishment, as he can pass through solid rock and emerge in his physical body. When he wishes to connect with his root gurus, he is able to become one with them and communicate completely through the power of his realized mind. I believe that these are special signs of outer and inner accomplishment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: black; font-size: 9pt;  " lang="EN"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: black; font-size: 9pt;  " lang="EN">One of the biggest problems for a practitioner in a mountain retreat can be a lack of water. People who have lived in this situation, like myself and my teacher Panchen Dawa, are so very aware of the significance of water to retreat practitioners. One of our favorite stories is how Gelok Lama has miraculously excavated clean and clear springs so that each and every one of the practitioners in mountain retreat can enjoy a personal spring of water. This has become a much-told story and miracle in Tibet. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: black; font-size: 9pt;  " lang="EN"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: black; font-size: 9pt;  " lang="EN">The other practitioner I will tell of is Lama Tharpa, a young man from Guangzhou. He used to study with Vajra Master Tsophu Toro Rinpoche (now passed away), then he studied with Khenchen Padma Lodro. The first time I went to see him, he had already been in retreat for four years and said that he would continue. Under his long hair – not trimmed for years – is a young and dynamic face. The harsh external environment coupled with the language barrier did not diminish his perseverance. When I met him in retreat, he was very happy and talkative. He told me that his little sister’s family had immigrated to Vancouver, Canada many years ago and had always wanted to help him immigrate abroad as well. However, he politely declined. I tentatively asked whether he still had worldly concerns, whether he still cherished the hustle and bustle of city life, and whether he still had difficulty in breaking away from the entanglement of affections. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: black; font-size: 9pt;  " lang="EN"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: black; font-size: 9pt;  " lang="EN">He told me that if he had left this pure land of snow, his life would have withered. His answer shocked me deeply. Without a deep understanding of Buddhadharma, he surely would not be able to say anything like that. In consideration for the feelings of affection of his sister’s family, I asked if I might take a picture of him and carry it to her in Canada. He agreed with joy and took some time tidying up. In the resulting photo, he looked pure and solemn.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: black; font-size: 9pt;  " lang="EN">There are more than a dozen other practitioners who are in lifetime retreat on the hill behind Traling Monastery and in the nearby sky burial ground. They are also filled with moving Dharma joy and inspiration, which I hope to have the opportunity to share with you later.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: black; font-size: 9pt;  " lang="EN"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: black; font-size: 9pt;  " lang="EN">I pray that one day I can be like these practitioners in mountain retreat who have abandoned all worldly concerns, free from the hustle and bustle of cities and free from disputes and conflicts. In the pure land of spirituality, I aspire to purify my humble heart and soul. Every moment of every day there are practitioners in profound meditation whose concerns are not the worldly attachments that so occupy our thoughts and activities and bind us to the energies of samsara. So much of our lives are spent in endless, meaningless activity. However when I think of these great practitioners, hope wells up in me and I am embraced by the beauty and truth of the Buddhadharma.
