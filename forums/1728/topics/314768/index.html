Therefore I can make my own decisions and handle my own problems.- Even if my problems become too overwhelming, I can always decide to ask others for advice.- Having self-confidence, I do not feel better than others, but I know I can do something by myself, and having the courage to follow my own inner wisdom. A special dedication prayer to counter a lack of self-confidence: “ May I be equanmious, free from attachment, anger and prejudice. May all living beings be equanimous, free from attachment, anger and prejudice. May I be able to help all living beings to become free from attachment, anger and prejudice. <span> </span>I will help all living beings to become free from attachment, anger and prejudice. May I be happy and have the causes for future happiness. May all living beings be happy and have the causes from future happiness. May I be able to help all living beings to become happy and have the causes for future happiness. <span> </span>I will help all living beings to become happy and have the cause for future happiness. May I be free from suffering and the causes for suffering. <span> </span><span> </span>May I be able to help all living beings to become free from suffering and the cause for suffering. <span> </span>May I never be separated from the ultimate happiness, free from all suffering. <span> </span>May all living beings never be separated from the ultimate happiness, free from all suffering. May I be able to help all living never to be separated from the ultimate happiness, free from all suffering. I will help all living never to be separate from the ultimate happiness, free from all suffering.</span></p>
