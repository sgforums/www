              temple in Bihar to get armed security cover</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">PTI 17th May 2017   </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">NEW
              DELHI: Four years after a terror strike at the Mahabodhi temple, the Centre is
              planning to provide an armed security cover of trained paramilitary commandos
              to the UNESCO World Heritage site in Bodh Gaya in Bihar, known as the cradle of
              Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">A
              series of blasts in and around the temple on July 7, 2013 had injured two
              monks, following which Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar had sought an armed
              security cover for the temple complex and its adjoining temples, 115-km south
              of the state capital Patna.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Officials
              said after several rounds of high-level talks, the Union home ministry has
              decided to sanction a CISF security cover to the temple complex and a few more
              meetings would be held to finalise the plan.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">They
              said the grounds for providing the armed cover have been analysed and the
              security establishment believes that the world famous temple site needs to be
              provided with a protection cover owing to its status of being a World Heritage
              site, thronged by lakh of domestic and international tourists and followers
              every year.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">"The
              first demand for an armed security cover to the temple complex was made by the
              Bihar government in 2013, right after the blasts. However, various issues like
              the pattern of deployment and CISF being provided only to high threat
              perception utilities kept the decision hanging for the last four years," a
              senior officer said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">They
              said that the Central Industrial Security Force CISF), a force which has
              expertise in securing vital installations and buildings, had carried out a
              survey of the facility immediately after the blasts.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">That
              CISF report will now be used and discussed before the security cover is
              accorded to the temple complex, they said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">"The
              final sanction for granting the security cover to the temple complex could come
              by this month-end from the home ministry. An estimated 150-200 commandos and
              personnel of the CISF have been projected in the security audit that will be
              required to guard the 4.8600-hectare complex," the senior officer said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              officials said central security agencies, in their regular intelligence
              dossiers to the home ministry, have underlined that the temple complex is
              vulnerable from the point of view of possible sabotage and terror attacks and
              hence should have a good protection paraphernalia for the building and the
              visiting devotees.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">While
              the temple trust will not be able to bear the estimated cost of Rs 20 crore per
              annum in lieu of the CISF deployment, the Bihar government may provide these
              funds in consultation with the Centre, they said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Frequented
              by Buddhist pilgrims from Sri Lanka, China, Japan and the whole of southeast
              Asian, the temple and the Bodhi Tree, under which Lord Buddha is believed to
              have attained enlightenment, did not suffer any damage in the blasts that shook
              the holy town of Gaya in 2013.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">As
              per the UNESCO, "the Mahabodhi temple complex is the first temple built by
              Emperor Asoka in the third century BC and the present temple dates from the
              5th–6th centuries.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">"It
              is one of the earliest Buddhist temples built entirely in brick, still
              standing, from the late Gupta period and it is considered to have had
              significant influence in the development of brick architecture over the
              centuries."</span></p>
