            <div class='col-md body'>When the Buddha proclaims that the 3 Vehicles (Arhat, Pratyekabuddha, Bodhisattva) are only expedient means - that ultimately, there is only 1 Buddha Vehicle, the Arhats and Pratyekabuddhas could not accept it. Shakyamuni Buddha has already from the start stated that it would be difficult for the arhats and pratyekabuddhas to comprehend this truth.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">At the beginning of Saddharmapu.n.dariika "Upaaya (ii)", in response to the thrice-spoken entreaty of `Saariputra, `Saakyamuni starts to deliver a profound sermon that the `sraavakas and pratyekabuddhas in the audience would have difficulty comprehending: that the setting up of the three vehicles was in fact merely an upaaya (expedient device), for in reality there is only one Buddha vehicle. It is recorded that, at this point, 5,000 members of the Assembly -- bhik.sus, bhik.su.niis, laymen and laywomen -- rose up as a body to take their leave. After `Saakyamuni gave them permission with a silent nod, he turned to `Saariputra and said, "It's a good thing those haughty ones have made their departure, as the Assembly has now gotten rid of a lot of unnecessary elements" (ChÃªng fa-hua, 69, b18 ff.; Sanskrit text, 38, 12 ff., gaathaas 38-41).</span></div>

Only the Buddha's state is supreme, therefore called Annutara-samyak-sambodhi: Supreme perfect enlightenment, the enlightenment of a Buddha. Also, the Great Arhants remained in the assembly... so not all have left.<br><br>Secondly, the Arhat has overcome ignorance in regards to the 4 noble truths. However he did <strong>not</strong> have Buddha's omniscience. They also cannot comprehend some of the higher truths taught to the Bodhisattvas.<br><br>The ten fetters that the Arhat has removed: <a href="http://sped2work.tripod.com/fetters.html" rel="nofollow">http://sped2work.tripod.com/fetters.html</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">10. Avijja is translated as "ignorance", but this is ignorance in a special sense. <strong>It does not mean ignorance as it is used in the everyday sense, but it means specifically ignorance of the Four Noble Truths and the delusion which prevents us from seeing the real nature of impermanence and Dukkha.</strong> Last of of The Three Poisons.</span></div>
