            <div class='col-md body'>What better way to respect and honour the Buddha is to practise the Dhamma.<br><br>I have seen and heard a lot of Buddhists like to study, read and explain to others what he has read in the books, but he didnt use that knowledge he gained by practising. His cravings, desires, anger and delusion, unfortunately increases as he thinks he has more wisdom than others now, hence he became very haughty.<br><br>There is a buddhist who keep telling me about the dhamma, yet he keep on telling lies, and when people scolded him, he is very angry and upset.<br><br>Seems to me he did not practise what the Buddha has taught.<br>How many buddhists can safely say they observe the 5 precepts faithfully?<br><br></div>

They just stayed close to the Buddha, hardly ever leaving his presence. However, there was a bhikkhu by the name of Dhammarama who kept to himself and did not go near the Buddha. His intention was to strive most ardently to attain arahatship before the passing away of the Buddha. So he strove hard in Insight Meditation Practice. Other bhikkhus, not understanding his attitude and his noble ambition, misunderstood his behaviour.<br><br>Those bhikkhus took Dhammarama to the Buddha and said to the Enlightened One, "Venerable Sir! This bhikkhu does not seem to have any affection or regard or reverence for you; he has been staying by himself while all the time other bhikkhus are staying close to Your Venerable presence." When other bhikkhus had said everything they wanted to say, Dhammarama respectfully explained to the Buddha why he had not come to see the Buddha and also reported that he had been striving his utmost in Insight Meditation Practice.<br><br>The Buddha was satisfied and was very pleased with the explanation and conduct of Dhammarama and he said, <strong>"My son, Dhammarama, you have done very well. A bhikkhu who loves and respects me should act like you. Those who made offerings of flowers, scents and incense to me are not really paying me homage. Only those who practise the Dhamma are the ones who truly pay homage to me."</strong><br><br>Then the Buddha spoke in verse as follows:<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Verse 364: The bhikkhu who abides in the Dhamma, who delights in the Dhamma, who meditates on the Dhamma, and is ever mindful of the Dhamma, does not fall away from the Dhamma of the virtuous.</span><br><br>At the end of the discourse Thera Dhammarama attained arahatship.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, thats the correct and only way to venerate and honour the Buddha.<br><br>Not by offering of incense or flowers is the right way to respect and pay homage to the Buddha. Its more like form than substance.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yup, agreed that the best way to respect the Buddha, or the best thing to offer to the Triple Gems would be one's practice and realizations. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>The act of offering forms itself can also be a way of practice.<br><br>The offering of flower - is a reminder of the Truth of Impermanence.<br><br>The offering of lamp - is a symbol of wisdom. Self-illuminating and luminating others. It's said that just one candle light (wisdom) is able to eliminate the darkness (ignorance) of thousands of years.<br><br>The offering of incense - is a representation of the virtues of the Buddha, which spreads far and wide and pervades all of space.<br><br>In fact, anything and everything (physical, verbal and mental such as virtuous thoughts) can be offered to the Triple Gems.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I used to wonder the meaning of this part of Lotus Sutra:<br><br>"Thereupon he swallowed various perfumes, sandalwood, kunduruka, turushka, prikka, aloes, and liquidambar gum, and he also drank the fragrant oil of champaka and other kinds of flowers, doing this for a period of fully twelve hundred years. Anointing his body with the fragrant oil, he appeared before the Buddha Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue, wrapped his body in heavenly jeweled robes, poured fragrant oil over his head and, calling on his transcendental powers, set fire to his body. The glow shown forth, illuminating worlds equal in number to the sands of eighty million Ganges. The Buddhas in these worlds simultaneously spoke out in praise, saying: 'Excellent, excellent, good man! This is true diligence. This is what is called a true Dharma offering to the Thus Come One. Though one may use flowers, incense, necklaces, incense for burning, powdered incensed, paste incense, heavenly silken banners and canopies, along with the incense of the sandalwood that grows by the southern seashore, presenting offerings of all such things as these, he can never match this! Though one may make donations of his realm and cities, his wife and children, he is no match for this! Good men, this is called the foremost donation of all. Among all donations, this is most highly prized, for one is offering the Dharma to the Thus Come One'"<br><br>- Chapter 23, Lotus Sutra<br><br>Is the sutra really asking for self-immolation?<br><br>Then I come across something my Shi fu said and understood it... My Master's disciple asked him why was he sometimes in Taiwan, sometimes in U.S, going overseas, in order to spread the dharma he did not rest at all, what is the reason? My master replied that there are two reasons:<br><br>(1) "Burning-Body" Body Offering to the Buddha (Ran2 Shen1 Gong4 Fo2) (2) Clear Karmic Hindrances<br><br>From this I think the "Self-Immolation" refers to wholeheartedly devoting/sacrificing oneself and one's body to the Triple Gems irregardless of anything, and that is the highest offering.<br><br>Sacrificing his own body for the practise of Bodhisattva way is also the highest offering. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
