              <p>Dear all,</p>
              <p>Just came from Hardwarezone.  I've started a thread hoping to save at least one cat from being put down by AVA.  Unfortunately, the regulations of AVA make it difficult...From there, I realised that the fate of stray cats (whether they are sent to AVA) depends on one word - Compassion, which is sorely lacking in Singapore. </p>
              <p>Hence, I hope to make a humble appeal for Buddhists here to help by spreading the word - at the very least not to complain about cats because they will most likely end up being put down by AVA. </p>
              <p>Compassion starts in small ways.  If one cannot coexist with cats, can he or she truly be compassionate?</p>

              <p><br>Because cats are less likely to be adopted and more likely to be abandoned due to the HDB by-law (since the 70s).  AVA would not allow anyone with HDB address to get his or her cat out.  AVA will even put down cats legally owned.</p>

              <p> By the way, have you tried other means to rehabilitate the dogs, such as contacting the Action for Singapore Dogs (ASD) besides complaining?  Do you know that the dogs have a high possibility of being put down after complaints?  Do you really want to be responsible for their deaths? </p>

              <p>Cats by nature are not to be home bound, thats' why they gets into trouble.</p>
              <p>Our dear MP and town council had tried for years by many means and the dogs are still there. I thought you had mentioned about cats as in TS, its seems now you are also into dogs.</p>
              <p>I wonder who is responsible for the lack of sleep and health problems due to the incessantly barkings going on.</p>

              <p>And I am not comparing the different realms or levels for human beings and animals.

              <p>the problem.. about compassion is.. there's a logic flaw, because u're usually bias.</p>
              <p>it's very natural that when cats annoy humans, humans complain. and cats get pwned.. unless somehow the cats become smart enough not to disturb humans.</p>
              <p>anyway.. all these has been said before la. so ya. i guess, those who wanna adopt adopt, the rest of the cats will be doomed if they don't become smart.</p>

              <p>Inregards to cat you posted...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cats are not allowed to keep home bound..but ....the govn bodies open and close an eye...</p>
              <p>There are many resident, who keep cats, and they didnt actually well keep the cats, they allow the cats to roam about the neighbourhood estate..they anyhow urine, any how shit..this is a hygen problem...so not totally the govn fault, the owner must really consider about other people living in the estate...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are some resident who are very compassionate, they bring left over food and feed the stray cats....and after leaving the food they just walk off...again who is going to clean up all the food....one cat see this lady, the next day, you will see more cat friends coming to join the meal....again..consideration..compassion could be practise in a tactful way...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Keeping cats is fine, but one has to watch the cat..not let the cat out of the boundary and cause problems for others...I ever saw a resident kept 9 cats at home..the 9 cats all roam about the neighbourhood..when meal time all will go back to the unit..and passing by that unit you would have a strong aroma of cats...</p>

There must be a social ladder in understanding the nature of life...to see which is more important, killing strays begets what sort of karma?

              <p>Nothing wrong being a vegan. There is also one recently reported case of a child being a vegetarian since young and now discovered that due to lack of proteins and vitamins from other food sources, the spine is compared to an 80 years old.</p>
              <p>What I am concern is that your can champion your cause but should not use religion. Dun use kindness and compassion for weakness to uphold your belief.</p>
              <p>Not everybody share your concern as there are more mundane priorities to settle and needs compassion too.</p>

              <p>The main culprit is those who abandon their pets...It will be lucky if they
              get to be put to sleep instead of leaving them outside to fend for themselves.After
              all the suffering, result still the same. But the main point is, if you cant
              commit a pet, dun buy’em. <span> </span></p>
              <p>If u dun feed the cats and just let them die out, that will be more cruel
              than putting them to slp... Ofcourse there are kind ppl around who go around
              and sterilize the cats so these cats shldnt actually be put to slp, they poses no threat.</p>
