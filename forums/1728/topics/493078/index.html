              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Last month, the Dalai Lama traveled to Mongolia, a country
              with long religious and cultural ties to Tibet. Despite the trip being
              billed as “purely religious” in nature, Chinese authorities characteristically
              demanded it be canceled and warned of potential “negative effects” were the
              trip to occur (a disclaimer that precedes nearly any trip by the Dalai
              Lama to a foreign country, and sometimes even comes ahead of visits to
              sensitive parts of India, the nation that has provided him refuge for the past
              half-century). Following the trip, Bloomberg reported on November 26 that
              Beijing had cancelled talks on “badly-needed” Chinese loans and development
              contracts. On December 2, United Press International’s Elizabeth Shim reported
              that China had raised transportation fees for shipments crossing the border
              from Mongolia in to China, resulting in cancelled shipments from
              multinational mining firms with enormous investments in Mongolia.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Beijing’s follow-through shouldn’t have surprised
              Ulaanbaatar. China has previously made good on similar threats, briefly closing
              parts of the border in 2002, and temporarily cancelling direct flights to the
              capital from Beijing in 2006 after visits from the Dalai Lama. At Foreign
              Policy, Sergey Radchenko reaches further back in modern Sino-Mongolian history
              to show how Beijing’s “raw pressure and intimidation can backfire in unexpected
              ways”:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In 1959, following the outbreak of an anti-Chinese rebellion
              in Tibet, the then 23-year-old Dalai Lama fled to India. Beijing never forgave
              him for leaving, nor forgave India for giving him refuge. Relations between
              Beijing and New Delhi, until then hailed as a shining example of peaceful
              coexistence, tanked. Border tensions escalated, and in October 1962, the two
              neighbors went to war in the Himalayas.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Although China won the battle, the real challenge was to
              persuade the world that the Indians were the bad guys — a matter complicated by
              the reality that Beijing attacked India, not the other way around. The task
              fell to the founding father of Chinese diplomacy, Zhou Enlai, who spent weeks
              explaining China’s take on the conflict to disconcerted regional players like
              Indonesia and Sri Lanka. In December 1962, Zhou attempted to convince the
              Mongolians to endorse the Chinese point of view. The records of his dramatic
              encounter with then Mongolian Prime Minister Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal have recently
              been declassified by the Mongolian Foreign Ministry, and are now
              accessible online. They make for sober reading.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Tsedenbal, who came to China to sign a border treaty and to
              ask for economic aid, seemed surprised when Zhou unexpectedly raised the
              subject of India. Zhou recounted the highlights of the Sino-Indian border
              confrontation, and condemned the Indians for selling out to
              U.S. imperialism and for pursuing anti-Chinese policies. Tsedenbal reacted
              by saying meekly that he was sorry that China and India had quarreled. “I don’t
              understand what you mean by being sorry about the Sino-Indian conflict,” Zhou
              pressed. It was a matter of black and white: China was right, India was wrong.
              There could not be neutrality in the question. But Tsedenbal would not budge,
              telling Zhou that quarreling with India over an uninhibited strip of land in
              the Himalayas would only force the Indians to turn to the West, and that would
              not help China’s cause. Zhou nearly lost it: his face “twisted in
              anger,” noted the record-taker. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Radchenko continues to detail the remainder of the heated
              exchange, and to suggest that the problems associated with the CCP’s continued
              intolerance for dissent could find their antidote in some of the Dalai
              Lama’s simplest teachings.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Dalai Lama’s itinerary while in Mongolia last month
              did seem to reinforce the claimed “purely religious” nature of the trip:
              he met with Buddhist congregations, and attended
              a conference on Buddhism and science. On his final day in Mongolia,
              however, he did brush upon politics repeatedly at a press conference. While he
              did castigate China for meddling in his travel plans, the lion’s share of
              coverage from the conference focused on his stated lack of worry over the
              recent election of Donald J. Trump as the next U.S. president. Despite ongoing
              (and rapidly proliferating) questions about Sino-U.S. relations under President
              Trump, the exiled Tibetan’s mention of the president-elect may not
              have been the one most concerning to Beijing. The Dalai Lama
              also noted his confidence that the Jebtsundampa Khatagt, the third
              highest-ranking cleric in the Gelug (aka “Yellow Hat”) sect of Tibetan
              Buddhism, had been reborn in Mongolia. This announcement comes as the
              81-year-old Dalai Lama and Beijing are engaged in a heated back-and-forth
              over who has the right to name his successor, and as Chinese authorities have
              recently made moves to politically empower their controversial choice
              for the Panchen Lama—the second highest ranked Gelug cleric. At The Diplomat,
              M.A. Alrdich explains how the Jebtsundampa Khatagt serves as a
              historical geopolitical connection between Tibet, China, and
              Mongolia (Russia also factors in to the story, and since the CCP’s
              “liberation” of Tibet and the Dalai Lama’s subsequent flight, India too):</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Zanabazar was the first of eight patriarchs officially
              recognized by the Qing Court as the ecclesiastical leaders of northern
              Mongolia. In their homeland, the patriarchs were the third most senior lamas
              after the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama. Zanabazar is remembered as both a
              distinguished polymath noted for his bronze artwork, religious texts, and
              scientific experiments as well as a shrewd political strategist who allied his
              clan’s interests with the rising Qing Empire. After Zanabazar’s death in 1723,
              the Second Patriarch was found in northern Mongolia in the person of the one of
              the great-grandsons of Zanabazar’s brother and duly enthroned with the support
              of the Manchu throne and the Yellow Hat clergy in Lhasa.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">[…] Despite the official line of the Communist authorities,
              the lineage did not die out. In 1936, the Reting Rinpoche, the ruling regent of
              Tibet for the interregnum between the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Dalai Lamas,
              recognized a boy named Jambal Namdo Choiji in Lhasa as the reincarnation of the
              Eighth Patriarch. The boy’s identity remained a carefully guarded secret
              because of possible assassination attempts by Communist Mongolian agents.
              Jambal Namdo was inducted incognito into Lhasa’s clergy without the
              financial support usually provided to important tulkus. In the 1940s,
              he left the clergy, started a family, and earned his living peacefully as a
              farmer. However, in the aftermath of the Tibetan Uprising in 1959, he fled to
              India with the Dalai Lama because of his fear of being discovered and used as a
              propaganda tool by the Chinese Communists. In the 1980s, he resumed his
              monastic vows and lived a quiet life in Karnataka.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">[…] Toward the end of his life, the Ninth Patriarch told
              the Dalai Lama of his desire to return to Mongolia for his passing. In November
              2011, the Ninth Patriarch, in poor health, took up residency at the Gandan
              Tegchenling Monastery. He died there in March 2012.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">According to Buddhist tradition, the Ninth Patriarch’s wish
              to pass away in Mongolia was a significant indication that his next rebirth
              would be in Mongolia. By spending his last days at the Gandan Tegchenling
              Monastery, the Ninth Patriarch helped to set the stage for the discovery of the
              first Mongolian-born patriarch in nearly 300 years. </span></p>
