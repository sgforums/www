              <p class="p1">Hello, I've recently started reading the book, <em>Awakening to Reality, </em>as well as the blog of the same name. The information contained in both has been excellent and incredibly helpful. Much thanks to An Eternal Now, Thusness, and any other contributors to the book and site.</p>
              <p class="p1">As I've read over Thusness' 7 Stages many times, I've encountered several things which I'm a little unclear about. I would like to summarize my understanding below in the hopes that any misunderstandings I have will be pointed out and clarified. In addition, there are some things I'm not sure about at all. In those areas where I don't really know, I will ask questions. Thank you to anyone who takes the time to help clarify these questions.</p>
              <p class="p1"> </p>
              <p class="p1">Stage 1 - I AM</p>
              <p class="p1">Stage 1 is the experience of I AM, When one realizes I AM, one feels an incredible certainty of Being. Being in this case refers to Awareness, and the practitioner is certain of Awareness. Things are happening and there is awareness of these things. Awareness is a constant. It underlies experience. It is with the person throughout all experiences, and it is the source from which phenomena arise. A person at I AM identifies themselves as awareness.</p>
              <p class="p2"> </p>
              <p class="p2"> </p>
              <p class="p1">Stage 2 - I AM Everything</p>
              <p class="p1">I am a little unclear about this stage, but as I understand it, one recognizes that this Beingness or Awareness extends to all things, and as such, one is everything. </p>
              <p class="p2"> </p>
              <p class="p1">Questions about Stage 1+2: Does the experience of I AM (Stage 1 or 2) impact how one perceives non-mental phenomena? For example, are objects brighter, clearer or more luminous? Does the mind feel clearer or more spacious?</p>
              <p class="p2"> </p>
              <p class="p1">Stage 3 - Entering into a State of Nothingness</p>
              <p class="p1">Unclear about this stage. If I understand correctly, it is also more of a state than a stage. It seems that one moves beyond the state of I AM and moves to a point of identification with not the I AM itself, but the knower of the I AM, or the nothingness, that precedes the I AM. It is that which is not contingent on manifestation. Awareness and Manifestation rely on one another, but nothingness doesn't rely on anything.</p>
              <p class="p2"> </p>
              <p class="p2"> </p>
              <p class="p1">Stage 4 - Presence as Mirror Bright Clarity</p>
              <p class="p1">In stage 4, one realizes that things do not arise out of some Absolute Source. In the absence of an absolute, the subject-object split starts to crumble, and one's sense of identity and sense of self changes as well. Selfing type phenomena still arise, however, they are not relegated a higher status relative to other phenomena.</p>
              <p class="p2"> </p>
              <p class="p2"> </p>
              <p class="p1">Questions about Stage 4: </p>
              <p class="p1">Is MCTB 4th path equivalent to Stage 4? Are there other practices besides noting that lead directly to Stage 4? What is the experience of stage 4 characterized by: sensory clarity, brightness, a feeling of spaciousness?</p>
              <p class="p2"> </p>
              <p class="p1">Stage 5 - No Mirror Reflecting</p>
              <p class="p1">Anatta is realized. This includes: no subject/object division, no doership, and absence of agent.</p>
              <p class="p2"> </p>
              <p class="p1">Questions about Stage 5:  If one has realized stage 4, what is the best method for proceeding onto the realization of Anatta? Is how one proceeds affected by whether one has also had I AM realizations?</p>
              <p class="p2"> </p>
              <p class="p1">Stage 6 - The Nature of Presence is Empty</p>
              <p class="p1">At this stage, one realizes the emptiness of all things.</p>
              <p class="p2"> </p>
              <p class="p1">Questions about Stage 6: Is the realization of emptiness the same as the realization of dependent origination?</p>
              <p class="p2"> </p>
              <p class="p1">Stage 7 - Presence is Spontaneously Perfected</p>
              <p class="p1">All the preceding insights are refined and sync up at the moment of spontaneous perfection.</p>
              <p class="p2"> </p>
              <p class="p1">Questions about Stage 7: Is this the point when maha is realized?</p>

              <p>Hi John Kelly, welcome. I very much wanted Thusness to reply you but unfortunately he seldom reads or replies messages nowadays and does not want to give the impression of being a teacher.</p>
              <p>I will try to reply... with my limited knowledge and experience.</p>

                                                          AM, one feels an incredible certainty of Being. Being in this case
                                                          refers to Awareness, and the practitioner is certain of Awareness.

                                                          Awareness is a constant. It underlies experience. It is with the
                                                          person throughout all experiences, and it is the source from which
                                                          phenomena arise. A person at I AM identifies themselves as
                                                          awareness.</em></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Yes. It is just Awareness in one of the eighteen dhatus - pure mind realm. As Thusness pointed out, <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.sg/2007/03/mistaken-reality-of-amness.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.sg/2007/03/mistaken-reality-of-amness.html</a></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-size: 100%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">When consciousness experiences the pure sense of “I AM”, overwhelmed by 
                                   the transcendental thoughtless moment of Beingness, consciousness 
                                  clings  to that experience as its purest identity. By doing so, it 
                                  subtly  creates a ‘watcher’ and fails to see that the ‘Pure Sense of 
                                  Existence’  is nothing but an aspect of pure consciousness relating to 
                                  the thought  realm. This in turn serves as the karmic condition that 
                                  prevents the  experience of pure consciousness that arises from other 
                                  sense-objects.  Extending it to the other senses, there is hearing 
                                  without a hearer and  seeing without a seer -- the experience of Pure 
                                  Sound-Consciousness is  radically different from Pure 
                                  Sight-Consciousness. Sincerely, if we are  able to give up ‘I’ and 
                                  replaces it with “Emptiness Nature”,  Consciousness is experienced as 
                                  non-local. No one state is purer than  the other. All is just One Taste,
                                   the manifold of Presence.</span></span></em></p>

              <p><em>Questions about Stage 1+2: Does the experience of I AM
                                                          (Stage 1 or 2) impact how one perceives non-mental phenomena? For
                                                          example, are objects brighter, clearer or more luminous? Does the

              </blockquote>
              <p>Yes, intense luminosity is experienced. Space-like pure presence is experienced. In Stage 2, there can be passing glimpses of non-dual experience (with everything) but one returns to the Subject, the background, the pure identity. There is no insight into non-dual or anatta. There is also the experience of impersonality, so the Self becomes infinite and impersonal, conceived as a universal source even. One feels like one is being lived or expressed by this common source. Despite having such experiences, the view one holds is still dualistic (subject/object duality) and inherent (an inherently existing Self)</p>
              <p>As Thusness wrote in March 2005:</p>
              <p><em>Hi LongChen,<br><br> The blankness is a form of absorption where the knowing faculty of

                                                      Presence without a 'Self' is more crucial. </em> <em><img title="Smile" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"><br><br> The 'Self' that is created over countless lives of attachment

              <p>It is the 'substantial nonduality' of <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.sg/2011/08/substantial-and-insubstantial-non.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.sg/2011/08/substantial-and-insubstantial-non.html</a></p>

              <p>MCTB 4th path is beyond stage 4, it is one aspect of Stage 5 but not its entirety. For example, it is skewed to Thusness's first stanza of anatta, but missing the second stanza. While AF (also beyond stage 4) is about the second stanza of anatta, but overlooking the first stanza. (Stanzas: <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/03/on-anatta-emptiness-and-spontaneous.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/03/on-anatta-emptiness-and-spontaneous.html</a>) My comments on AF: <a href="http://www.box.net/shared/sbyi64jrms">http://www.box.net/shared/sbyi64jrms</a></p>
              <p>Practices that lead to Stage 4 include contemplating on the 2nd stanza, Advaita contemplations like Greg Goode's 'Direct Path', challenging the sense of inside/outside, subject/object, objectivity, investigating the seamlessness of awareness and manifestation (where does awareness end and manifestation begin) etc.</p>
              <p>Stage 4 is characterized by the dissolution of subject/object division into an undivided luminosity by the realization of no subject/object division, there is total intimacy, sensory clarity, brightness, feeling of spaciousnessness altogether but most important factor is there is no more observer-observed dichotomy - that dichotomy is seen through to be delusional. No longer is Awareness seen as an eternal Witness behind thoughts and phenomena, but the Witness-witnessed has collapsed into one seeing, one awareness.</p>

              <p>One who realizes anatta will have accessed both stanzas of anatta somewhat but there is a skewing depending on his conditions. One who had I AM realization previously, the second stanza becomes very apparent while one progresses by looking into first stanza and then emptiness. One who does not have I AM realization and realizes anatta through vipassana/etc, the first stanza becomes very apparent first while the second stanza becomes more apparent as a later progression.</p>

                                  Kegon doctrine that phenomena do not exist individually but interdependently,
                                  that the manifold depends on the unit and the unit on the manifold. A
                                  refinement of this principle in Kegon philosophy is called the mystery of
                                  principal and satellites: this means that every element in a conditional nexus
                                  can be looked upon as the hub, or "principal," whereupon all the
                                  other elements become the cooperative conditions, or "satellites"-hence
                                  all elements are at once "principal" and "satellite" to all
                                  other elements. It is the mutuality, the complementarity, of the elements which
                                  makes them functionally what they are. Dogen presents this idea by likening
                                  life to riding in a boat-one is naught without the boat, yet it is one's riding
                                  in it that makes it in effect a "boat." Furthermore, "the boat
                                  is the world-even the sky, the water, and the shore are circumstances of the
                                  boat. . . . The whole earth and all of space are workings of the boat."

              <p>It is a universal realization, in Hinduism you find that also, in Islamic sufism (a mystical contemplative tradition) there is such realization in their contemplatives as well. Judaism Kabbalah, Taoist mysticism, etc.. as well.</p>
              <p>In an early Christian, non-canonical, gnostic gospel - Gospel of Thomas, you hear Jesus describing this universal mystical realization:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>77. Jesus said, "I am the light that is over all things. I am all: from me all
                            came forth, and to me all attained. </em></p>
              <p><em>Split a piece of wood; I am there. </em></p>
              <p><em>Lift up the stone, and you will find me there." </em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is also as described in <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">1) Thusness/PasserBy's Seven Stages of Enlightenment</a></p>
              <p>And in Hinduism it also mentioned:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Him the sun does not illumine, nor the moon, nor the stars, nor the<br>lightning--nor, verily, fires kindled upon the earth.  He is the one light<br>that gives light to all.  He shines; everything shines.<br><br>        Hinduism.  Katha Upanishad 5.15; Mundaka Upanishad 2.2.10;<br>                        Svetavatara Upanishad 6.14</p>
              <p> <br> <em> Brahma is the Light of lights.<br> He is Self-luminous.          <br> He is Supreme Light.          <br> He is ultimate light.         <br> He is an embodiment of Light. <br> By His Light all else shines.13 </em></p>

              <p>Thank you very much for your reply. It was very helpful and clear. I read through all of the links you provided, which has helped clarified a few things. I very much like your blog and book and really appreciate all the info they both provide. Some of it is difficult to understand as I am not familiar with a lot of the terminology and come from a different insight background which explains things differently. I think this is why I am confused about certain terms and other details. However, I really do appreciate that your material deals with insight beyond what the traditions I am familiar with refer to as awakening. That said, I still have a couple more things which aren't fully clear. </p>

              <p>I am a little confused by this. Isn't seeing that consciousness/source is non-dual without subject/object division the realization of MCTB 4th path and therefore stage 4? Also, as I understand it, stage 4&amp;5 are sort of on a continuum for the realization of Anatta. Stage 4 is a partial realization of Anatta in that one no long perceives a subject/object divison, yet one lacks the realization of no agency and no doership. Is this correct? Also, is the realization of no agency separate than the realization of no doership or do they both occur simultaneously?</p>

              <p>Thanks. As I understand it, I believe I have realized non-duality. This occured 3 months ago and I am therefore interested in how to realize Anatta.</p>

              <p>I am going to focus on the first part. I have never really done contemplation before. Is there a preferred posture for doing it? Can it be done while doing activities? Does it matter if eyes are open or closed?</p>
              <p>Also, I understand that meditation is still a very worthwhile practice and should be done in addition to contemplation. Do you have any suggested forms of meditation I should pursue?</p>
              <p>Lastly, in my everyday life while doing normal activities, I often notice a lot of sensory clarity and really tune into the sensate world. I assume this is supportive of realization and I will continue to do so, perhaps asking HAIETMOBA on occassion. Is this good? Or is it simply better to recall and contemplate Thusness' stanza instead of asking HAIETMOBA?</p>
              <p>Thank you very much for your help. It really is greatly appreciated.</p>

              <p>Not just that. Dharma Dan is very clear that consciousness is not some source, substratum, Self, agent, watcher, observer, etc. He sees only arising and passing sensations.

              <p>No. In Stage 4, only the non-division of subject and object is clear. Anatta, no agent, is not clear.</p>
              <p>This is why in Stage 4, one is still understanding no-self through Self. In other words, one sees a metaphysical essence, an unchanging, independent Self/Awareness that is inseparable with all its display. So it is the Self/Awareness 'expressing itself inseparably as' appearances rather than standing behind, watching its play.</p>

                                      phenomena. This is my understanding in the I AMness phase of
                                      insight, for example. Or even further, the construct of personality
                                      dissolves and one feels like one is being lived by a higher power
                                      or source. But even this is not the insight or experience of
                                      anatta.</p>
              <p>Yesterday, someone asked me “It is seen that all action is
                                      occuring spontaneously, effortlessly …what is different? (From the
                                      realization of anatta)”</p>
              <p>I replied:</p>
              <p>“Hi, what you spoke of is not what I meant by anatta… perhaps
                                      this might be relevant:</p>
              <p>(What Thusness wrote to me at my earlier phase of insight):</p>
              <p>Also what you said about the no observer can be quite
                                      misleading. It does not mean there is ‘no one doing anything’ and
                                      ‘everything is arising spontaneously’. You should understand anatta
                                      from below quotations taken from ‘The Sun My Heart’ by Zen Master
                                      Thich Nhat Hanh:</p>
              <p>(Excerpt from: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2008/10/sun-of-awareness-and-river-of.html"> http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2008/10/...</a> )</p>
              <p>“Sunshine and Green Leaves</p>
              <p>“When we say I know the wind is blowing, we don’t think that
                                      there is something blowing something else. “Wind’ goes with
                                      ‘blowing’. If there is no blowing, there is no wind. It is the same
                                      with knowing. Mind is the knower; the knower is mind. We are
                                      talking about knowing in relation to the wind. ‘To know’ is to know
                                      something. Knowing is inseparable from the wind. Wind and knowing
                                      are one. We can say, ‘Wind,’ and that is enough. The presence of
                                      wind indicates the presence of knowing, and the presence of the
                                      action of blowing’.”</p>
              <p>”..The most universal verb is the verb ‘to be’’: I am, you are,
                                      the mountain is, a river is. The verb ‘to be’ does not express the
                                      dynamic living state of the universe. To express that we must say
                                      ‘become.’ These two verbs can also be used as nouns: ‘being”,
                                      “becoming”. But being what? Becoming what? ‘Becoming’ means
                                      ‘evolving ceaselessly’, and is as universal as the verb “to be.” It
                                      is not possible to express the “being” of a phenomenon and its
                                      “becoming” as if the two were independent. In the case of wind,
                                      blowing is the being and the becoming….”</p>
              <p>“In any phenomena, whether psychological, physiological, or
                                      physical, there is dynamic movement, life. We can say that this
                                      movement, this life, is the universal manifestation, the most
                                      commonly recognized action of knowing. We must not regard ‘knowing’
                                      as something from the outside which comes to breath life into the
                                      universe. It is the life of the universe itself. The dance and the
                                      dancer are one.”“</p>

              In my e-book I also wrote:
              
              A few months later, even though it has been seen that â€˜seeing is always the sights, sounds, colours and shapes, never a seerâ€™, I began to notice this subtle remaining tendency to cling to a Here and Now. Somehow, I still want to return to a Here, a Now, like 'The actual world right here and now', which I can 'ground myself in', like I needed to ground in something truly existing, like I needed to return to being actual, here, now, whatever you want to call it. At that point when I detected this subtle movement I instantly recognised it to be illusory and dropped it, however I still could not find a natural resolution to that. 
              
              Until, shortly maybe two weeks later, a deeper insight arose and I saw how Here/Now or something I can ground myself in doesn't apply when the "brilliant, self-luminous, vivid, alive, wonderful textures and forms and shapes and colours and details of the universe", all sense perceptions and thoughts, are in reality insubstantial, groundless, disjoint, unsupported and spontaneous, there was a deeper freedom and effortlessness. It is this insight into all as insubstantial, ephemeral, bubble-like, disjoint manifestations that allows this overcoming of a subtle view of something inherent. There is no observer observing something changing: simply that the "sensate world" is simply these disjoint manifestations without anything linking each sensation to another, without some inherent ground that could link manifestations, so manifestations are 'scattered' and disconnected. Somewhere around this time, Thusness wrote me a post in blog: http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2011/02/putting-aside-presence-penetrate-deeply.html
              
              Prior to this insight, there wasn't the insight into phenomena as being 'scattered' without a linking basis (well there already was but it was not strong enough to remove the subtle view or construct of an inherent ground that remained)... the moment you say there is an â€˜Actual World Here/Nowâ€™, or a Mind, or an Awareness, or a Presence that is constant throughout all experiences, that pervades and arise as all appearances, you have failed to see the 'no-linking', 'disjointed', 'unsupported' nature of manifestation â€“ an insight which breaks a subtle clinging to an inherent ground, resulting in greater freedom.

                                          Can it be done while doing activities? Does it matter if eyes are

              <p>It can be done any time, anywhere. I contemplated on Bahiya Sutta and realized anatta when I was marching in basic military training. I have heard countless masters who attained enlightenment when hearing a sound, seeing something, all in a non-sitting setting.</p>
              <p>Meditative posture is for the purpose of developing meditative samadhi. It is important for that purpose. But not exactly necessary for insight training. If I am doing sitting meditation I prefer to sit full lotus in sitting meditation with dhyana mudra, others find it preferable to sit half lotus. They are fine as long as your back is straight, mudra is right.</p>

              </p><p class="p1">Yes, I can try and describe it. However, the difficulty in describing it is that the apparent moment of realization came while I was taking a nap. After awaking from the nap, I was aware that something was different. This was in July of this year and whatever shift in perspective that took place then has stuck around.</p>
              <p class="p2"> </p>
              <p class="p1">So, looking over some of my notes from back then, what sticks out was this slightly poetic phrase to describe what had been realized: "experience is already intimate, always dancing." Somehow the apparent gap between experiencer and what is experienced seemed to fall away.</p>
              <p class="p2"> </p>
              <p class="p1">In the aftermath of the apparent realization, I was quite unsure about what had happened, and was uncertain if even anything had been realized. My doubts started to fall away as my experience continued. In addition, I also noticed that people from KFD who had realized MCTB 4th path often didn't recall a definitive moment when it occurred, and it was mostly confirmed by a feeling of being "off the ride." I had a similar sense of being finished with something, feeling less struggle to attain anything, but at the same time, I felt that there was more to do, more to realize. This sense of wanting to keep going was encouraged by some dreams and synchronicities.</p>
              <p class="p2"> </p>
              <p class="p1">I mention synchronicities as my main practice back then had been magick and meditation. Magick as a vehicle for awakening mainly focuses on employing techniques that are quite similar to guru yoga. Doing magick can also lead to a fair amount of synchronicities in daily life.</p>
              <p class="p2"> </p>
              <p class="p1">Also of a note and for some more backstory, I attained what is referred to as MCTB 1st path in March of 2011. This happened around the time of a Kundalini awakening and was at a time when I practiced noting. However, I evolved away from that practice shortly after.</p>
              <p class="p2"> </p>
              <p class="p1">I have had extensive experience with witness consciousness. There were two 7-10 day periods in 2011 where I was in continual witness consciousness. I mention this because what is going on now is very different from witness consciousness. With witness consciousness, it always felt like someone was looking through me, or that I was on the outside looking into reality through my eyes. It had a bit of a dissociative quality to it which I didn't like. However, this is not the case now. Whereas before with witness consciousness, it was like being in the outside looking in, now there's no sense of being an outsider or that awareness or consciousness of experience is separate from experience.</p>
              <p class="p2"> </p>
              <p class="p1">I hope this clarifies things. I'm not sure if any of this constitutes Non-duality or I AM or even anything at all. Whatever it is, I am keenly interested in refining and deepening my insight. This is why I have asked so many questions and feel so fortunate to have found the Awakening to Reality site and book.</p>

Your Witness consciousness is related to I AM but not exactly the same as I AM realization - which is the realization and utter certainty of Being, one's Existence (as related to the first post: <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/09/realization-and-experience-and-non-dual.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/09/realization-and-experience-and-non-dual.html</a>).</p>

              <p>This is certainly non-duality. However, you must also know that there is a difference between realization and experience. That means there is a difference between realizing that there is no experiencer apart from experience than it happening as a sort of peak experience or stage where the sense of an experiencer suddenly falls away. Without realization, the experience will not be effortless or seamless because the wrong view is obscuring perception like a magical spell.</p>

                       thinker, a watcher, etc, cannot be found apart from the moment to 
                      moment flow of manifestation or as its commonly expressed as ‘the 
                      observer is the observed’; there is no self apart from arising and 
                      passing. A very important point here is that Anatta/No-Self is a Dharma 
                      Seal, it is the nature of Reality all the time -- and not merely as a 
                      state free from personality, ego or the ‘small self’ or a stage to 
                      attain. This means that it does not depend on the level of achievement of a practitioner to experience anatta but <strong>Reality has always been Anatta</strong> and what is important here is the intuitive insight into it as the nature, characteristic, of phenomenon (dharma seal). <br><br>To put further emphasis on the importance of this point, I would like to borrow from the Bahiya Sutta (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/ud/ud.1.10.irel.html">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/ud/ud.1.10.irel.html</a>)
                       that ‘in the seeing, there is just the seen, no seer’, ‘in the hearing,
                       there is just the heard, no hearer’ as an illustration. When a person 
                      says that I have gone beyond the experiences from ‘I hear sound’ to a 
                      stage of ‘becoming sound’, he is mistaken. When it is taken to be a 
                      stage, it is illusory. For in actual case, there is and always is only 
                      sound when hearing; never was there a hearer to begin with. Nothing 
                      attained for it is always so. This is the seal of no-self. Therefore to a
                       non dualist, the practice is in understanding the illusionary views of 
                      the sense of self and the split. Before the awakening of prajna wisdom, 
                      there will always be an unknowing attempt to maintain a purest state of 
                      'presence'. This purest presence is the 'how' of a dualistic mind -- its
                       dualistic attempt to provide a solution due to its lack of clarity of 
                      the spontaneous nature of the unconditioned. It is critical to note here
                       that both the doubts/confusions/searches and the solutions that are 
                      created for these doubts/confusions/searches actually derive from the 
                      same cause -- our karmic propensities of ever seeing things 
                      dualistically</p>

                  <p>Kenneth's technical 4th path has to do with completing a physio-energetic circuit (kundalini, energy, chi, etc) and feeling 'i'm done'. Nothing that he indicated in that description suggests any realization of no-self. Whatever understanding of no-self at that time is still dissociative and one is still a bystander watching phenomena as not-self. (More info: <a href="http://kennethfolkdharma.wetpaint.com/page/The+Progress+of+Insight+%28Part+One%29">http://kennethfolkdharma.wetpaint.com/page/The+Progress+of+Insight+%28Part+One%29</a>)</p>
                  <p>Whereas, Dharma Dan's 4th path has nothing to do with energy/circuit, just realizing anatta, no agent:</p>
                  <p><a href="/forums/1728/topics/">http://dharmaoverground.org/web/guest/discussion/-/message_boards/message/2740040;jsessionid=55167E9EB91D7AA26570FB19EB6F6B88#_19_message_0</a></p>
                  <p><em>Since the topic has come up so often and been so bandied about so many 
                                              times by so many people, let me state here what I mean by 4th path, 
                                              regardless of what anyone else means by it. It has the following 
                                              qualities:<br><br>1) Utter centerlessness: no watcher, no sense of a 
                                              watcher, no subtle watcher, no possibility of a watcher. This is 
                                              immediately obvious just as color is to a man with good eyesight as the 
                                              old saying goes. Thus, anything and everything simply and obviously 
                                              manifest just where they are. No phenomena observe any others and never 
                                              did or could.<br><br>2) Utter agencylessness: meaning no agency, no 
                                              sense of doing, no sense of doer, no sense that there could be any agent
                                               or doer, no way to find anything that seems to be in control at all. 
                                              Whatever effort or intent or anything like that that arises does so 
                                              naturally, causally, inevitably, as it always actually did. This is 
                                              immediately obvious, though not always the forefront of attention.<br><br>3)
                                               No cycles change or stages or states or anything else like that do 
                                              anything to this direct comprehension of simple truths at all.<br><br>4)
                                               There is no deepening in it to do. The understanding stands on its own 
                                              and holds up over cycles, moods, years, etc and doesn't change at all. I
                                               have nothing to add to my initial assessment of it from 9 years ago.<br><br>5)
                                               There is nothing subtle about it: anything and everything that arises 
                                              exhibits these same qualities directly, clearly. When I was third path, 
                                              particularly late in it, those things that didn't exhibit these 
                                              qualities were exceedingly subtle, and trying to find the gaps in the 
                                              thing was exceedingly difficult and took years and many cycles. I had 
                                              periods from weeks to months where it felt done and then some subtle 
                                              exception would show up and I would realize I was wrong yet again, so 
                                              this is natural and understandable, and if someone claims 4th as I 
                                              define it here and later says they got it wrong, have sympathy for them,
                                               as this territory is not easy and can easily fool people, as it did me 
                                              many, many times over about 5 years or so. However, 4th, as I term it, 
                                              ended that and 9 years later that same thing holds, which is a very long
                                               time in this business.<br><br>There are other aspects that may be of 
                                              value to discuss at some other time, but those are a great place to 
                                              start for those who wish to claim this. If you truly have those, then 
                                              perhaps we can talk about a few other points that are less central and 
                                              essential.<br><br>Now, how there can still be affect (though quite 
                                              modified in many ways) when there is centerlessness and agencylessness, 
                                              this is a mystery to the AF kids and to me as well, and that brings me 
                                              to my next point: there seems to be areas of development depending on 
                                              what you look for and aim for that may arise independently, and not 
                                              everything seems to come as a package necessarily. Those things are what
                                               I looked for really hard for about 7 years, and that is what I found. 
                                              Now I find that the interest in the unraveling of what drives that 
                                              residual affect is arising, and so that investigation happens on its own
                                               also.<br><br>Perhaps people will find this helpful in some way. </em></p>

                  <div>It depends. If you have read my article <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.sg/2011/12/experience-realization-view-practice.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.sg/2011/12/experience-realization-view-practice.html</a> , you should know that there are different degrees/faces of self/Self or no-self.</div>
                  <div><br></div>
                  <div>In many cases that I see in LU, their so called "insight of no self" is only non-doership or impersonality. This is not even I AM realization yet! They know nothing about non-duality or anatta. That is why for many, their progress after 'entering the gate' through LU is to go into I AMness.<br></div>
                  <div><br>Yet, some people in LU are talking about I AM. Some are talking about One Mind/non dual - even non dual realization requires a direct insight that there is no separate self or watcher, but it still sinks back into some metaphysical unified Self - therefore as Thusness said, 'understanding no-self through Self'. Only very few are talking about anatta. In fact very rarely or hardly do you see people have clarity on that. Thusness and I reckon that only a number of people which can be counted by the fingers truly realized non dual and higher at that place.<br></div>
                  <div><br></div>
                  <div>Because their founder, Ciaran, despite having some insight into anatta and no-agent, has no clarity about the difference faces of self/no-self, his students also lack this clarity. They land into very different territories and get 'confirmed' too easily after having some experineces without knowing exactly what they have seen and the big picture of it.<br></div>
