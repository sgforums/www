            <div class='col-md body'>I think the general christian shouldn't be too narrow minded on what neutral onliner commented, he is talking abt the evangelist that commited in all this unwholesome deeds, right from the 1st posting, he already mentioned that he is not condemning the entire christian community, but the black sheep that claimed to follow jesus's teaching and yet did all these temple destruction, killing and so on. Unless you support what these evangalists have done.<br><img src="http://www.buddhapia.com/eng/tedesco/pic1/ashes4.gif"><br><img src="http://www.buddhapia.com/eng/tedesco/pic1/ashes.gif"><br><br>When I see this, I was shocked. I will call these acts as terrorism.<br>How pain it is to see the scripture and buddha's teaching to be burnt into ashes...<br>We need more people like neutral onliner to bring out this to the public to prevent the same tragedy to happen again in the future, instead of the wait-to-be-killed for the sake of peace attitude. I don't want in the midst of meditation, a group of barbarian forced in to destroy our temple, hurting/killing the people protecting the dharma.<br>Now, I ask you, what is your stance on their actions?<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by laoda99:<br>And.......very ironically, the same person post niceties such as this:<br>....<br></blockquote>That's why he posted articles promoting interreligious contact and dialogue, instead of religious conflict. If he is an anti-christ like what you have label him as, why he even bother to post this picture.<br><img src="http://theoldbill.typepad.com/photos/images_of_jesus/buddha_and_christ2.jpg"><br>If that is your definition of anti-christ, pls count me in.<br><br>Maybe you should learn from our muslim friends in singapore. For example, there are terrorists who claimed to be muslim.<br>They created bomb blast, hijack plane and so on. But they are not supported by the local muslim here just because they are of the same religion. You get what I meant? A christian judge shouldn't set free a christian raper even he has repented using the christian way.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by laoda99:<br>2. Haha....he phrase very good liao.....he is very clever...<br>3. Refer back to 2. I find that his phrasing and disclaimers are very good. But a few posts by him as pasted above still reveal that he is anti-christian inside him.<br></blockquote>In my opinion, neutral onliner has been very tactful in his words, sometimes to the extent of causing some incomplete statement.<br>If I were him, I will list down more things to elaborate, I heard a lot of bible hyprocrites from ex-christians including my dad.<br>If you want to know, I don't mind to share with you. For your info, the romans catholics no longer swears by truth of the bible. Are you going to scold them and resort to personal attack just like what you did here.<br><br>I suggest that we all cool down and discuss point by point, like which evangalist act is right/wrong, which statement from who need rephrase all this, y temple should be closed down.<br><br>Or you want to do it in christian forum to get more christian's comments or even irc so public can't see the discussion.<br>What do you think?</div>
