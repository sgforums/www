              <p>On first impression, <a title="Tergar.org: About Mingyur Rinpoche" href="http://tergar.org/about/bio.shtml">Mingyur Rinpoche</a> seemed to have everything well set up for a high profile career as a 
              globe-trotting meditation teacher in the Kagyu tradition of Tibetan 
              Buddhism. The youngest of three sons of the late, much venerated <a title="Wikipedia: Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulku_Urgyen_Rinpoche">Tulku Urgyen</a>, by the age of 36 he had a bestselling book (The Joy of Living) to his name, a monastery in India and <a title="tergar.org" href="http://tergar.org/">Tergar</a>, an international organisation based in the US with branches worldwide.</p>
              <p>Mingyur
               Rinpoche was living comfortably with a retinue of attendants. He was in
               high demand as a teacher and admired by developed world devotees in 
              particular, for his interest in the scientific implications of 
              meditation – specifically its effect on brain function and the nervous 
              system. He already had 10 years of solitary meditation retreat behind 
              him and Tibetan Buddhist aficionados were impressed with his personal 
              qualities.</p>
              <p>But Mingyur Rinpoche was not content to rest on his 
              laurels. Nor was he interested in becoming yet another celebrity guru, 
              living in luxury and spoiled by the adulation accorded to important 
              lamas. One morning in June this year his attendants knocked on the door 
              of his room at his monastery in Bodhgaya, India, and when there was no 
              response they went in to find it empty – except for a <a title="Tegar.org: Letter from Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche upon Entering Retreat" href="http://tergar.org/resources/2011-6-letter-from-rinpoche.shtml">letter explaining that he had left for an indeterminate period to become a wandering yogi</a>, meditating wherever he alighted in the Himalayas.</p>
              <p>"He
               took no money, and no possessions," explained his brother Tsoknyi 
              Rinpoche. "He didn't take his passport, his mobile phone or even a 
              toothbrush."</p>
              <p>In his letter Mingyur Rinpoche said that from a young
               age he had "harboured the wish to stay in retreat and practise, 
              wandering from place to place without any fixed location". He advised 
              his followers not to worry about him, assuring them that in a few years 
              they would meet again. To this day no one has any idea of his 
              whereabouts and he has not been in touch with his family.</p>
              <p>Mingyur Rinpoche (the title Rinpoche means Precious One) left on his journey from <a title="Wikipedia: Bodh Gaya" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhgaya">Bodhgaya</a>, the place where the historical Buddha Siddhartha attained enlightenment.</p>
              <p>"There's
               an interesting parallel with the Buddha," says Donald Lopez, professor 
              of Buddhist and Tibetan studies at the University of Michigan. "Since 
              the fall of the Tibetan monarchy in 842, incarnate lamas have served as a
               kind of aristocracy in Tibet, so a high-ranking tulku is not unlike a 
              prince. Mingyur Rinpoche has renounced royal life, just as Prince 
              Siddhartha did. This radical step that he has taken is essentially a 
              return to the lifestyle that the Buddha prescribed for all monks."</p>
              <p>The
               life of a mendicant monk may have been a viable option for followers of
               the Buddha in 400BC India and for Tibet's great yogi Milarepa, but 
              among Tibetan tulkus (incarnate lamas) it is virtually unprecedented in 
              the present day. Mingyur Rinpoche's disappearance was greeted by the 
              Tibetan Buddhist establishment with a mixture of astonishment and awe, 
              accustomed as they are to many young tulkus heading off to America in 
              search of fame, fortune and an extravagant lifestyle. They follow 
              precedents set by an older generation of lamas like the late Trungpa 
              Rinpoche, who made no secret of his fondness for vodka and the pleasures
               of the flesh, and more recently by Sogyal Rinpoche, a notorious 
              womaniser.</p>
              <p>Long retreats have become established among western 
              Tibetan Buddhist practitioners, but they usually take place at secure 
              locations and are conducted on a group basis. They are also expensive – 
              especially for people who have to put their careers on hold in order to 
              take part. So is it likely that more aspirant yogis and young lamas will
               follow Mingyur Rinpoche's example?</p>
              <p>"We see his decision as very 
              positive," says Cortland Dahl, the director of Mingyur Rinpoche's 
              organisation Tergar. "It's an inspiration. You read about people doing 
              this in the past, but no one seems to want to do it in this modern age."</p>
              <p>Dahl
               points out that it must have taken some courage: "Rinpoche suffered 
              from panic attacks when he was a child and there he was, heading off 
              into the unknown in Bihar – one of the most bandit-ridden states in 
              India."</p>
              <p>The British yogi-lama Ngakpa Chogyam, however, does not fear for Mingyur Rinpoche's wellbeing:</p>
              <p>"Religious
               mendicancy is understood in the Himalayan regions – but it is probably 
              only viable for Tibetans and Indian sadhus. I imagine that Mingyur 
              Rinpoche would be likely to find sponsors wherever he went. The main 
              problem he might face would be people wanting to do too much for him – 
              and he would probably have to spend some time escaping from generous 
              benefactors."</p>
              <p>Cortland Dahl says Mingyur Rinpoche is not only 
              uninterested in fame and money, he is also a "pure monk" who maintains 
              vows that include celibacy. He has this in common with a small number of
               young tulkus – including Kalu Rinpoche and the 17th Karmapa Orgyen 
              Trinley Dorje. It seems as if Tibetan Buddhism might be at a turning 
              point – away from widespread allegations of corruption and towards a 
              revival of the principles laid down by the historical Buddha.</p>

              <h3>Letter from Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche upon Entering Retreat</h3>
              <p><strong>Dear friends, students, and fellow meditators,</strong></p>
              <p>By the time you read this letter, I will have 
              begun the long retreat that I announced last year. As you may know, I 
              have felt a very strong connection with the tradition of retreat since I
               was a young boy growing up in the Himalayas. Even though I didn't 
              really know how to meditate, I would often run away from home to a cave 
              nearby, where I would sit quietly and chant the mantra "om mani peme 
              hung" over and over again in my mind. My love of the mountains and the 
              simple life of a wandering meditator called to me even then.</p>
              <p>It wasn't until I was in my early teens that I 
              got my first chance to do a formal retreat. Until that time, I lived at 
              Nagi Gompa, a small hermitage on the outskirts of Kathmandu. It was 
              there that my father, Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche, first taught me how to 
              meditate. After training with him for a number of years, I heard that a 
              traditional three-year retreat was scheduled to begin at Sherab Ling, 
              Kenting Tai Situ Rinpoche's monastery in India.</p>
              <p>Though I was still only eleven years old, I 
              begged my father to let me go. He was happy to see my enthusiasm, since 
              he himself had stayed in retreat for more than twenty years over the 
              course of his life. When we talked about the idea of me going into a 
              strict, traditional retreat, he told me about the great yogi Milarepa 
              and how important his example has been to generations of Tibetan 
              Buddhist meditators.</p>
              <p>Milarepa's early life was filled with misery 
              and hardship. Despite all the bad karma he created as a young man, he 
              eventually overcame his dark past and attained complete enlightenment 
              while living in isolated caves deep in the mountains. Once he was 
              enlightened, Milarepa thought that there was no longer any need for him 
              to stay in the mountains. He made up his mind to go down to more 
              populated areas where he could directly help alleviate the suffering of 
              others. One night, not too long after he decided to depart, Milarepa had
               a dream about his teacher Marpa. In the dream, Marpa encouraged him to 
              stay in retreat, telling him that through his example he would touch the
               lives of countless people.</p>
              <p>After telling me about Milarepa's remarkable 
              life, my father said, "Marpa's prophesy came to pass. Even though 
              Milarepa spent most of his life living in remote caves, millions of 
              people have been inspired by his example over the centuries. By 
              demonstrating the importance of practicing in retreat, he influenced the
               entire tradition of Tibetan Buddhism. Thousands and thousands of 
              meditators have manifested the qualities of enlightenment because of his
               dedication."</p>
              <p>A few years later, during my first three-year 
              retreat, I had the good fortune to study with another great master, 
              Saljey Rinpoche. In the middle of the third year, I and a few of my 
              fellow retreatants approached Rinpoche to ask his advice. We had derived
               tremendous benefit from the retreat and asked him how we could help 
              uphold this precious lineage. "Practice!" Saljey Rinpoche responded, 
              "I've been in retreat almost half my life. This is a genuine way to help
               others. If you want to preserve the lineage, transform your minds. You 
              won't find the true lineage anywhere else."</p>
              <p>The teachings and example of both my father and
               Saljey Rinpoche deeply inspired me. This inspiration, coupled with my 
              own natural desire to practice in retreat, has been a guiding light 
              throughout my life.</p>
              <p>When my first formal retreat ended, Saljey 
              Rinpoche passed away and Tai Situ Rinpoche asked me to take his place as
               retreat master. I accepted my new role and have now been leading 
              retreats and teaching meditation for twenty years. In particular, the 
              last ten years I have spent a great deal of time teaching around the 
              world. I've been to more than thirty countries, sharing my experience of
               overcoming the panic attacks I experienced as a child and passing on 
              the teachings that my masters entrusted to me. Over the years, I've come
               to see the truth of the words of my father and Saljey Rinpoche. As they
               both taught me, the experience gained in retreat can be a powerful tool
               in helping others.</p>
              <p>In my early years, I trained in a number of 
              different ways. The time I spent with my father involved rigorous 
              meditation training, but I was not in strict retreat, in the sense that I
               met other people and could come and go freely. My three-year retreat at
               Sherab Ling Monastery, on the other hand, was held in complete 
              isolation. A small group of us lived in an enclosed compound and didn't 
              have any contact with the outside world until the retreat ended. These 
              are two forms of practice, but they are not the only ways. As 
              demonstrated by the great yogi Milarepa, there is also a tradition of 
              wandering from place to place, staying in remote caves and sacred sites 
              with no plans or fixed agenda, just an unswerving commitment to the path
               of awakening. This is the type of retreat that I will be practicing 
              over the coming years.</p>
              <p>This tradition isn't very common these days. My
               third main teacher, the great Dzogchen yogi Nyoshul Khen Rinpoche, was 
              one of the few recent masters to practice in this way. Khen Rinpoche 
              practiced in closed retreats when he was younger, but later he took up 
              the life of a wandering yogi. He completely dropped his normal life and 
              activities. Nobody knew where he was or what he was doing. He spent time
               meditating in isolated caves and other places where the great masters 
              of times past, such as Milarepa and Longchenpa practiced, and at one 
              point he even lived among the Hindu sadhus of India. His story is a 
              perfect example of a modern, carefree yogi.</p>
              <p>More recently, Tai Situ Rinpoche, the last of 
              my four main teachers, talked about meditating in mountain retreats 
              during a teaching he gave in 2009. Over four months, Rinpoche passed on 
              the lineage of an important meditation text called The Ocean of the 
              Definitive Meaning. This is one of the main instruction manuals used by 
              meditators in the Kagyu lineage.  I mention my teachers here because 
              their wisdom and compassion has nurtured my desire to make retreat a 
              focal point of my life. My father and Saljey Rinpoche encouraged and 
              supported my first experiences in retreat, while Nyoshul Khen Rinpoche 
              and Tai Situ Rinpoche inspired me to embark on the path of a wandering 
              yogi. Like a tiny firefly in the midst of the sun's radiance, I can 
              never hope to compare to my precious teachers, but without their example
               and inspiration, I would not have followed this path.</p>
              <p>You might think that while I'm on retreat we 
              won't be able to stay connected to each other. Of course, we won't be 
              able to see each other for a few years, but don't forget that our 
              connection is through the Dharma. It isn't simply seeing our teachers, 
              or even hearing them, that creates a spiritual bond. It's when we take 
              the teachings we've received and bring them into our own experience that
               an unshakeable connection is formed. The more we practice, the stronger
               the bond with our teacher becomes.</p>
              <p>Three of my four teachers have long since 
              passed away. At times, I remember what it was like being with them and 
              hearing them teach. I remember how joyful and light they were, and how 
              they carried themselves with such dignity and freedom. These memories 
              make me a little sad, but when I remember what they taught me and let 
              their wisdom fill my being, I can feel their presence anywhere and 
              anytime. So while you and I may be apart physically over the next few 
              years, through our practice we will always be together.</p>
              <p>I feel a great sense of warmth and love when I 
              think of all of you, like we're one big family. So don't worry, I'm not 
              having a mid-life crisis. I'm not going on retreat because I'm sick of 
              traveling, or sick of teaching students. In fact, it's just the 
              opposite. During this time our practice will bring us closer.</p>
              <p>There are times in our lives when we focus on 
              learning and study, and others where we take what we've learned and 
              bring it deeply into our experience. These are processes that each of us
               goes through individually, but having the support of a community can be
               a great help as we follow the path. It has been wonderful to see how 
              many of you have come together in recent years to help form and shape 
              our growing community. Though I've helped support the community through 
              my teachings, the community itself is yours. It is there to support you 
              on the path of awakening, and it will be your commitment and support 
              that will allow for the flourishing of the community in years to come. 
              Receiving support and guidance from the community, and giving back in 
              whatever way we can, is an integral part of the journey.</p>
              <p>To help you continue along the path, I've 
              prepared many teachings over the past few years that will be delivered 
              by my emanations. These emanations can appear magically almost anywhere 
              and will teach you just what you need to deepen your practice. What am I
               talking about? Modern technology, of course! We recorded hundreds of 
              hours of teachings on a whole range of topics, and these teachings will 
              be made available over the coming years. Some will be used for online 
              courses and seminars, others will be shown at Tergar centers and groups,
               and some will be freely available online. In some ways, my video 
              emanations are better than the real me. You won't have to feed them or 
              put them up in a hotel. They will wait patiently until you're ready for 
              them. And most importantly, they won't feel bad if you get bored and 
              turn them off!</p>
              <p>Don't mistakenly think that your DVD player 
              will be your new root guru. Recorded teachings can never take the place 
              of a direct transmission from teacher to student. What I'm trying to say
               is that there will still be plenty of opportunities to study and 
              practice, especially for those of you who are following the Joy of 
              Living and Path of Liberation programs. There are also other wonderful 
              lamas to study with, including His Holiness Karmapa, Orgyen Trinley 
              Dorje, and my teacher Tai Situ Rinpoche. My brother, Tsoknyi Rinpoche, 
              is also an excellent teacher and has agreed to guide the Tergar 
              community while I'm away. Finally, we have our own Tergar lamas and 
              instructors who will lead retreats and workshops all over the world. In 
              fact, there will be so much happening, you may not even notice I'm gone!</p>
              <p>In parting, I would like to give you one small 
              piece of advice to keep in your heart. You may have heard me say this 
              before, but it is the key point of the entire path, so it bears 
              repeating: All that we are looking for in life — all the happiness, 
              contentment, and peace of mind — is right here in the present moment. 
              Our very own awareness is itself fundamentally pure and good. The only 
              problem is that we get so caught up in the ups and downs of life that we
               don't take the time to pause and notice what we already have.</p>
              <p>Don't forget to make space in your life to 
              recognize the richness of your basic nature, to see the purity of your 
              being and let its innate qualities of love, compassion, and wisdom 
              naturally emerge. Nurture this recognition as you would a small 
              seedling. Allow it to grow and flourish.</p>
              <p>Many of you have generously asked how you can 
              help support my retreat. My answer is simple: Keep this teaching at the 
              heart of your practice. Wherever you are and whatever you are doing, 
              pause from time to time and relax your mind. You don't have to change 
              anything about your experience. You can let thoughts and feelings come 
              and go freely, and leave your senses wide open. Make friends with your 
              experience and see if you can notice the spacious awareness that is with
               you all the time. Everything you ever wanted is right here in this 
              present moment of awareness.</p>
              <p>I will keep you in my heart and in my prayers.</p>
              <p>Yours in the Dharma,</p>

              <p>Quite inspiring, but there is also a great deal over concern for his 
              safety. Living the life of a wandering yogi was never a particularly 
              safe practice, which is reflected in many of the life stories and myths 
              regarding the great Mahasiddhas, and beyond that, the world has changed a
               lot in recent centuries and there are surely new dangers. In the video 
              below, Mingyur Rinpoche's brother, Tsoknyi Rinpoche, explains that upon 
              hearing the news their mother cried for seven days out of worry for her 
              son. Tsoknyi Rinpoche asks that people pray for his brother's safety, 
              and notes that the main message in his brother's letter is that 
              "practice is the most important thing."</p>
