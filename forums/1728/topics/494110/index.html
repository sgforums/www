              Buddhism: Six Examples</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">May 23, 2017 Daniel P.
              (Danny) Coleman Patheos</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">A
              small but growing number Christians in the West are turning to Buddhism for
              spiritual guidance.  Many are reading books about Buddhism, and some are
              also meditating, participating in Buddhist retreats, and studying under
              Buddhist teachers.  They are drawn to Buddhism’s emphasis on “being
              present” in the present moment; to its recognition of the interconnectedness of
              all things; to its emphasis on non-violence; to its appreciation of a world
              beyond words, and to its provision of practical means — namely meditation — for
              growing in one’s capacities for wise and compassionate living in daily
              life.   As they learn from Buddhism, they do not abandon
              Christianity.  Their hope is that Buddhism can help them become better
              Christians.  They are Christians influenced by Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">1. 
              Julia is typical of one kind of Christian influenced by Buddhism.  She is
              a hospice worker in New York who, as a Benedictine sister, turns to Buddhism
              “to become a better listener and to become more patient.”   As a
              student of Zen she has been practicing zazen for twenty years under the
              inspiration of the Vietnamese Zen teacher, Thich Nhat Hanh, whose book Living
              Buddha/Living Christ gave her new eyes for Christ, proposing that Jesus himself
              was “mindful in the present moment.”   She practices meditation in
              order to deepen her own capacities for mindfulness, particularly as it might
              help her be more effective in her life’s calling.  As a hospice worker she
              feels called to listen to dying people, quietly and without judgment, as a way
              of extending the healing ministry of Christ.  Like many people in consumer
              society, she sometimes finds herself too hurried and distracted, too caught up
              in her own concerns, to be present to others in patient and healing ways. 
              She turns to Zen practice because it has helped her become more patient and
              attentive in her capacities to be available to people in a spirit of
              compassion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">From
              Julia’s perspective, “being present” to people in a compassionate way is a
              spiritual practice in its own right.  She calls this attention “practicing
              the presence of God,” and she believes that this listening participates in a
              deeper Listening – an all-inclusive Love — whom she calls God, and whom she
              believes is everywhere at once.  She turns to Zen meditation, then, not to
              escape the world, but to help her drawn closer to the very God whose face she
              sees in people in need, and to help her become gentler and more attentive in
              her own capacities for listening.  In her words: “I hope that my Zen
              practice has helped me become a better Christian.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">2. 
              John, too, is a Christian who practices meditation, but for different
              reasons.  He suffers from chronic back pain from a car accident several
              years ago.  He has turned to meditation as a way of coping more creatively
              with his pain.  “The pain doesn’t go away,” he says, but it’s so much
              worse when I fight it.  Meditation has helped me live with the pain,
              instead of fighting it all the time.”  When people see John, they note
              that he seems a little more at peace, and a little more joyful, than he used to
              seem.   Not that everything is perfect.  He has his bad days and
              his good days.   Still, he finds solace in the fact that, even on the
              bad days, he can “take a deep breath” and feel a little more control in his
              life.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">When
              John is asked to reflect on the relation between his meditation practice and
              Christianity, he reminds his questioner that that the very word Spirit is
              connected to the Hebrew word ruach, which means breathing.  John sees
              physical breathing—the kind that we do each moment of our lives–as a portable
              icon for a deeper Breathing, divine in nature, which supports us in all circumstances,
              painful and pleasant, and which allows us to face suffering, our own and that
              of others, with courage.  “Buddhism has helped me find strength in times
              of pain; it has helped me find God’s Breathing.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">3. 
              Sheila is an advertising agent in Detroit who turns to Buddhism for a different
              reason.  She does not practice meditation and is temperamentally very
              active and busy. But over the years her busyness has become a compulsion and
              she now risks losing her husband and children, because she never has time for
              her family.  As she explains: “Almost all of my daily life has been
              absorbed with selling products, making money, and manipulating other people’s
              desires.  Somewhere in the process I have forgotten what was most
              important to me: helping others, being with friends and family, and
              appreciating the simple beauties of life.  Buddhism speaks to my deeper
              side.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">When
              Sheila reflects on the relationship between Buddhism and Christianity, she
              thinks about the lifestyle and values of Jesus.  She recognizes that Jesus
              himself had little interest in appearance, affluence, and marketable
              achievement, and that he was deeply critical of the very idea that “amassing
              wealth” should be a central organizing principle of life.   She
              doubts that Jesus would approve of the business culture in which she is
              immersed, in which the accumulation of wealth seems to be the inordinate
              concern.  For her, then, Buddhism invites her to rethink the values by
              which she lives and to turn to values that are closer to the true teachings of
              Christ.   “I find this simpler way challenging,” she says, “but also
              hopeful. I hope that Buddhism can help me have the courage to follow Christ
              more truly.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">4. 
              Robert is an unemployed social worker in Texas, who feels unworthy of respect
              because he does not have a salaried job like so many of his
              friends.   He, too, has been reading books on Buddhism, “Most people
              identify with their jobs,” he says, “but I don’t have one.  
              Sometimes I feel like a nothing, a nobody.  Sometimes I feel like it is
              only at church, and sometimes not even there, that I count for anything.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Robert
              turns to Buddhism as a complement to the kind of support he seeks to find, but
              sometimes doesn’t find, in Christianity.  Buddhism tells him that his real
              identity—his true self, as Buddhists put it—lies more in the kindness he
              extends to others, and to himself, than in the making money and amassing
              wealth.   Like Sheila, he sees this as connected with the teachings
              of Jesus.  “Jesus tells me that I am made in the image of God; Buddhism
              tells me that I possess the Buddha-Nature.   I don’t care what name
              you use, but somehow you need to know that you are more than money and wealth.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">5. 
              Jane is a practicing physicist who works at a laboratory in Maryland who goes
              to a local Methodist church regularly.   For her, a religious
              orientation must “make sense” intellectually, even as it also appeals to a more
              affective side of life, as discovered in personal relations, music, and the
              natural world.   But she also finds God in science and in scientific
              ways of understanding the world.   She is troubled that, too often,
              the atmosphere of church seems to discourage, rather than encourage, the spirit
              of enquiry and questioning that are so important in the scientific life. 
              Jane appreciates the fact that, in Buddhism as she understands it, this spirit
              is encouraged.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">This
              non-dogmatic approach, in which even religious convictions can be subject to
              revision, inspires her.  In her words: “I plan to remain a Christian and
              stay with my Methodist church, but I want to learn more about Buddhism.  I
              sense that its approach to life can help me see the spiritual dimensions of
              doubt and inquiry and help me integrate religion and science.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">6. 
              Sandra is a Roman Catholic nun in Missouri who leads a retreat center. 
              Twelve months a year she leads retreats for Christians, Catholic and
              non-Catholic, who wish to recover the more contemplative traditions of their
              prayer life and enter more deeply into their interior journey with
              God.   At her workshops she offers spiritual guidance and introduces
              participants to many of the mystics of the Christian tradition: John of the
              Cross, Teresa of Avila, Meister Eckhart, Hildegard of Bingen.  Even as she
              does this, she herself is on the very journey to God, and she makes this clear to
              people who come her way.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Sandra
              turns to Buddhism because she believes that its teaching of no-ego or no-self,
              when understood experientially and not just intellectually, is itself an
              essential dimension of the journey to God.    She sees this
              teaching as complementary to, and yet enriching, the teaching of “death and
              resurrection” that is at the heart of Christian faith.   In her
              words: “Christianity and Buddhism agree that the spiritual pilgrimage involves
              an absolute letting go, or dropping away, of all that a person knows of self
              and God.  Indeed, this is what happened in Jesus as he lay dying on the
              cross, and perhaps at many moments leading up to the cross.  Only after
              the dying can new life emerge, in which there is in some sense ‘only God’ and
              no more ‘me.’  I see the cross as symbolizing this dying of self and
              resurrecting of new life that must occur within each of us.  
              Buddhism helps me enter into that dying of self.”</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">As
              you listen to their stories, perhaps you hear your own desires in
              some of them.  If so, you have undertaken an empathy experiment.  You
              need not be “Christian” or “Buddhist” to do this.  There is something to
              learn from them even if you are not religious at all.  Don’t we all need
              to live by dying?  Don’t we all need to listen better?  Don’t we all
              need to inquire and seek truth?  There is something deeply human in their
              searching, and deeply human in our willingness to learn from them, even if we
              don’t share their faith.  And even if we do.</span></p>

Sometimes I feel that it could be the influence of Japan in the coastal areas such as California. It is paradoxical at times. Coastal China is abandoning Buddhism and even Christianity in favour of irreligious divorces, atheist pollutions, communist matricides, revolutionary patriacides and hedonist carnisms, yet in what used to be a military and capitalist powerhouse the United States, I have folks in Irvine that would rather eat VeganBurg and sit still meditating than to care a sh1t about politics.</p></div>
