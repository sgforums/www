              <p class="p-block" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    ' lang="EN">YANGON, Myanmar — A bar manager from New Zealand and two Burmese men were
              sentenced to two years in prison in Myanmar on Tuesday for posting an image
              online of the Buddha wearing headphones, an effort to promote an event.</span></p>
              <p class="p-block" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    ' lang="EN">The court in Yangon said the image denigrated Buddhism and was a violation
              of Myanmar’s religion act, which prohibits insulting, damaging or destroying
              religion. “It is clear the act of the bar offended the majority religion in the
              country,” said the judge, U Ye Lwin.</span></p>
              <p class="p-block" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    ' lang="EN">The image was posted in December on the Facebook page of the VGastro bar
              and restaurant in Yangon. After an outcry from hard-line Buddhist groups, the
              police arrested the restaurant’s general manager, Philip Blackwood, 32, of New
              Zealand, along with the bar owner, U Tun Thurein, 40, and the manager, U Htut
              Ko Ko Lwin, 26. The three have been held in Insein prison in Yangon.</span></p>
              <p class="p-block" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    ' lang="EN">In addition to the two-year prison term for violating the religion act, the
              three were also sentenced to six months for illegally operating a bar after 10
              p.m. Mr. Blackwood said after the verdict that the men had expected they would
              be convicted.</span></p>
              <p class="p-block" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    ' lang="EN">The case has added to growing concerns about religious and ethnic
              intolerance in majority-Buddhist Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, where
              Muslims have faced increasing discrimination and <a title="Times article." href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/29/business/sectarian-violence-in-myanmar-threatens-the-livelihoods-of-muslims.html">violence</a>. Hundreds of people were killed in
              sectarian violence in western and central Myanmar in 2012 and 2013. The
              country’s Parliament is also considering new laws that critics fear will be
              used to discriminate against minorities.</span></p>
              <p class="p-block" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    ' lang="EN">Phil Robertson, the deputy director of Human Rights Watch’s Asia division,
              who is based in Bangkok, called the verdict “outrageous.”</span></p>
              <p class="p-block" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    ' lang="EN">“This is a clear instance of criminalizing free expression,” he said. “This
              will resonate in a very significant, negative way internationally when people
              decide how to engage with Burma.”</span></p>
              <p class="p-block" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    ' lang="EN">The three convicted men faced possible prison terms of as long as four
              years in connection with the image, which was posted on the bar’s Facebook
              page. The image was quickly removed, and the bar issued an apology, saying it
              had not intended to cause offense.</span></p>
              <p class="p-block" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    ' lang="EN">“Our ignorance is embarrassing for us, and we will attempt to correct it by
              learning more about Myanmar’s religions, culture and history, characteristics
              that make this such a rich and unique society,” the apology said.</span></p>
              <p class="p-block" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    ' lang="EN">The online image of the Buddha wearing headphones was flanked by the name
              of the Yangon bar and restaurant and the words “Buddha.bar,” an echo of the
              franchise that was founded in Paris in 1996 and is famous for its electronic
              music mixes. The franchise has run into occasional problems for its use of
              depictions of the Buddha. In 2010, a Buddha Bar in Jakarta, Indonesia, was
              forced to close after protests from Buddhists there.</span></p>
              <p class="p-block" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    ' lang="EN">Myanmar will hold a general election this fall, and rights groups say the
              blasphemy conviction is an indicator that the government is pandering to
              hard-line Buddhist groups to win votes.</span></p>
              <p class="p-block" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    ' lang="EN">“Not only is this a rights violation, but this is very ill advised from a
              political and social perspective,” Mr. Robertson said. “Burma is heading into
              dangerous territory.”</span></p>

              someone to your faith is to undermind their teachings. One can also do
              so by making a ‘joke’ out of it or in this case making use of it for financial gain.
              If such acts are allowed to continue, there will be no ends to what other ‘innovations’
              someone is going to come up with to take advantage of all these Buddha images
