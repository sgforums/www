              <div class="chapter">
              <p>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <a id="savatthi" name="savatthi">Savatthi</a> in Jeta's Grove, <a id="anatha" name="anatha">Anathapindika</a>'s monastery. There he addressed the monks: "Monks!"</p>
              <p>"Yes, lord," the monks replied.</p>
              <p>The Blessed One said: "Monks, I will teach you a statement &amp; its analysis. Listen &amp; pay close attention. I will speak."</p>
              <p>"As you say, lord," the monks responded.</p>
              <p>The Blessed One said this: "A monk should investigate in such a way 
              that, his consciousness neither externally scattered &amp; diffused, nor
               internally positioned, he would from lack of clinging/sustenance be 
              unagitated. When — his consciousness neither externally scattered &amp; 
              diffused, nor internally positioned — from lack of clinging/sustenance 
              he would be unagitated, there is no seed for the conditions of future 
              birth, aging, death, or stress."</p>
              <p>That is what the Blessed One said. Having said it, the One Well-gone got up from his seat and went into his dwelling.</p>
              <p>Then, not long after the Blessed One had left, this thought occurred 
              to the monks: "This brief statement the Blessed One has made, after 
              which he went into his dwelling without analyzing the detailed meaning —
               i.e., 'A monk should investigate in such a way that, his consciousness 
              neither externally scattered &amp; diffused, nor internally positioned, 
              he would from lack of clinging/sustenance be unagitated. When — his 
              consciousness neither externally scattered &amp; diffused, nor 
              internally positioned — from lack of clinging/sustenance he would be 
              unagitated, there is no seed for the conditions of future birth, aging, 
              death, or stress': now who might analyze the unanalyzed detailed meaning
               of this brief statement?" Then the thought occurred to them, "Ven. Maha
               Kaccana is praised by the Teacher and esteemed by his knowledgeable 
              companions in the holy life. He is capable of analyzing the unanalyzed 
              detailed meaning of this brief statement. Suppose we were to go to him 
              and, on arrival, question him about this matter."</p>
              <p>So the monks went to <a id="kaccana" name="kaccana">Ven. Maha Kaccana</a> and, on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an 
              exchange of friendly greetings &amp; courtesies, they sat to one side. 
              As they were standing there, they [told him what had happened, and 
              added,] "Analyze the meaning, Ven. Maha Kaccana!"</p>
              <p>[He replied:] "Friends, it's <a id="heartwood" name="heartwood">as if</a> a man needing heartwood, looking for heartwood, wandering in search of 
              heartwood — passing over the root &amp; trunk of a standing tree 
              possessing heartwood — were to imagine that heartwood should be looked 
              for among its branches &amp; leaves. So it is with you, who — having 
              bypassed the Blessed One when you were face to face with him, the 
              Teacher — imagine that I should be asked about this matter. For knowing,
               the Blessed One knows; seeing, he sees. He is the Eye, he is Knowledge,
               he is Dhamma, he is Brahma. He is the speaker, the proclaimer, the 
              elucidator of meaning, the giver of the Deathless, the lord of the 
              Dhamma, the Tathagata. That was the time when you should have questioned
               him about this matter. However he answered, that was how you should 
              have remembered it."</p>
              <p>"Yes, friend Kaccana: knowing, the Blessed One knows; seeing, he 
              sees. He is the Eye, he is Knowledge, he is Dhamma, he is Brahma. He is 
              the speaker, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the giver of the
               Deathless, the lord of the Dhamma, the Tathagata. That was the time 
              when we should have questioned him about this matter. However he 
              answered, that was how we should have remembered it. But you are praised
               by the Teacher and esteemed by your knowledgeable companions in the 
              holy life. You are capable of analyzing the unanalyzed detailed meaning 
              of this brief statement. Analyze the meaning, Ven. Maha Kaccana!"</p>
              <p>"In that case, my friends, listen &amp; pay close attention. I will speak."</p>
              <p>"As you say, friend," the monks responded.</p>
              <p>Ven. Maha Kaccana said this: "Concerning the brief statement the 
              Blessed One made, after which he entered his dwelling without analyzing 
              the detailed meaning — i.e., 'A monk should investigate in such a way 
              that, his consciousness neither externally scattered &amp; diffused, nor
               internally positioned, he would from lack of clinging/sustenance be 
              unagitated. When — his consciousness neither externally scattered &amp;

              he would be unagitated, there is no seed for the conditions of future 
              birth, aging, death, or stress' — I understand the detailed meaning to 
              be this:</p>
              <p>"How is consciousness said to be scattered &amp; diffused? There is 
              the case where a form is seen with the eye, and consciousness follows 
              the drift of (lit.: 'flows after') the theme of the form, is tied to the
               attraction of the theme of the form, is chained to the attraction of 
              the theme of the form, is fettered &amp; joined to the attraction of the
               theme of the form: Consciousness is said to be externally scattered

              <p>"There is the case where a sound is heard with the ear... an aroma is
               smelled with the nose... a flavor is tasted with the tongue... a 
              tactile sensation is felt with the body... an idea is cognized with the 
              intellect, and consciousness follows the drift of the theme of the idea,
               is tied to the attraction of the theme of the idea, is chained to the 
              attraction of the theme of the idea, is fettered &amp; joined to the 
              attraction of the theme of the idea: Consciousness is said to be 
              externally scattered &amp; diffused.</p>
              <p>"And how is consciousness said not to be externally scattered &amp; 
              diffused? There is the case where a form is seen with the eye, and 
              consciousness does not follow the drift of the theme of the form, is not
               tied to... chained to... fettered, or joined to the attraction of the

              <p>"And how is agitation caused by clinging/sustenance? There is the 
              case where an uninstructed, run-of-the-mill person — who has no regard 
              for noble ones, is not well-versed or disciplined in their Dhamma; who 
              has no regard for men of integrity, is not well-versed or disciplined in
               their Dhamma — assumes form to be the self, or the self as possessing 
              form, or form as in the self, or the self as in form. His form changes 
              &amp; is unstable. Because of the change &amp; instability of form, his 
              consciousness alters in accordance with the change in form. With the 
              agitations born from the alteration in accordance with the change in 
              form and coming from the co-arising of (unskillful mental) qualities, 
              his mind stays consumed. And because of the consumption of awareness, he
               feels fearful, threatened, &amp; solicitous.</p>
              <p>"He assumes feeling to be the self...</p>
              <p>"He assumes perception to be the self...</p>
              <p>"He assumes (mental) fabrications to be the self...</p>
              <p>"He assumes consciousness to be the self, of the self as possessing 
              consciousness, or consciousness as in the self, or the self as in

              the change &amp; instability of consciousness, his consciousness alters 
              in accordance with the change in consciousness. With the agitations born
               from the alteration in accordance with the change in consciousness and 
              coming from the co-arising of (unskillful mental) qualities, his mind 
              stays consumed. And because of the consumption of awareness, he feels 
              fearful, threatened, &amp; solicitous.</p>
              <p>"This, friends, is how agitation is caused by clinging/sustenance.</p>
              <p>"And how is non-agitation caused by lack of clinging/ sustenance? 
              There is the case where an instructed disciple of the noble ones — who

              Dhamma; who has regard for men of integrity, is well-versed &amp; 
              disciplined in their Dhamma — doesn't assume form to be the self, or the
               self as possessing form, or form as in the self, or the self as in 
              form. His form changes &amp; is unstable, but his consciousness doesn't —
               because of the change &amp; instability of form — alter in accordance 
              with the change in form. His mind is not consumed with any agitations 
              born from an alteration in accordance with the change in form or coming 
              from the co-arising of (unskillful mental) qualities. And because his

              <p>"This, friends, is how non-agitation is caused by lack of clinging/sustenance.</p>
              <p>"So, concerning the brief statement the Blessed One made, after which
               he entered his dwelling without analyzing the detailed meaning — i.e., 
              'A monk should investigate in such a way that, his consciousness neither
               externally scattered &amp; diffused, nor internally positioned, he 
              would from lack of clinging/sustenance be unagitated. When — his

              internally positioned — from lack of clinging/ sustenance he would be 
              unagitated, there is no seed for the conditions of future birth, aging, 
              death, or stress' — this is how I understand the detailed meaning. Now, 
              if you wish, having gone to the Blessed One, question him about this 
              matter. However he answers is how you should remember it."</p>
              <p>Then the monks, delighting in &amp; approving of Ven. Maha 
              Kaccayana's words, rose from their seats and went to the Blessed One. On
               arrival, having bowed down to him, they sat to one side. As they were 
              sitting there, they [told him what had happened after he had gone into 
              his dwelling, and ended by saying,] "Then Ven. Maha Kaccayana analyzed 
              the meaning using these words, these statements, these phrases."</p>
              <p>"Maha Kaccayana is wise, monks. He is a person of great discernment. 
              If you had asked me about this matter, I too would have answered in the 
              same way he did. That is the meaning of this statement. That is how you 
              should remember it."</p>
              <p>That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words.</p>
