              <p>Thusness sent me links to the following two videos, though I can't watch it now as I can't install adobe flash in camp.</p>

              <h2 class="selected"><a href="http://kiloby.com/videos.php?offset=0&amp;videoid=276">NEW   The Middle Way, Part 1</a></h2>
              <p>The Middle Way is freedom from dualistic extremes.  It is freedom 
              from fixed viewpoints about yourself, others, and the world.  But it is 
              also freedom from fixed viewpoints that there is no self, no other, and 
              no world.  It is freedom from fixed views such as "everything exists 
              separately" and "nothing exists."  Freedom from "I am a separate person"
               and from "All is Oneness," as fixed views.  It is freedom from personal
               viewpoints and impersonal viewpoints.  It is freedom from relying 
              exclusively on thinking in your life.  Yet it is freedom from denying 
              thought altogether. 
              The Middle Way is, ultimately, the view of this site and Scott's 
              message.  Scott's Living Realization text is a Middle Way view.  When 
              you have no fixed conception of reality, every viewpoint is allowed to 
              be just as it is.  You are not stuck in the belief in separation, yet 
              you do not deny conventional existence.  All of this may or may not 
              sound really heavy, conceptual, or transcendent, but it is what the 
              great traditions have talked about for centuries. In Zen, it is the 
              "return to the marketplace."  In Advaita, it is Shankara's "Brahman is 
              the World." And in Buddhism, it is the Middle Way. In the Middle Way, 
              love, compassion, joy, peace, and freedom are your constant companions.</p>

              Hi AEN,
              
              My intention isnâ€™t about the middle path as Scott Kilobyâ€™s explanation isnâ€™t really clear yet.  However what is important about the 2 videos is the pointing out of the disease of extrapolating direct experience of non-dual into Global Awareness.  The wrong view has the natural tendency of transforming whatever experience into extremes. 
              Realizing the anatta and empty nature of all arising simply liberates them.  All diversities are still intact; individual stream of consciousness remains as individual stream of consciousness, there is no collapsing of diversities into One Global Awareness.   Experience however is seamlessly whole, non-dual, gapless, stainless and liberating.  The experience remains, the view is refined. :)

              <p>Hi Amitayus,</p>
              <p>'What is' cannot really be defined.</p>
              <p>The natural tendency is for the mind to find a fixed viewpoint/position, even of transcendental experiences.</p>
              <p>So 'what really is' is simply open-ended... There is no way to define it.</p>
              <p>Liberating is in keeping it open-ended... there is no definition of any experience as cosmic consciousness, oneness, God, non-duality, emptiness, individual self, etc. All these definitions are just the mind grasping at what is being experienced. It is not letting 'what is' be undefinable...</p>

              <p>The nature of reality does not only apply to good emotions.</p>
              <p>As the sutra states:</p>
              <p><em><br></em></p>
              <p> <em>"Good sons, all 
                          hindrances are none other than          ultimate enlightenment. Whether 
                          you attain mindfulness or lose          mindfulness, there is no 
                          non-liberation. Establishing the Dharma and          refuting the Dharma
                           are both called nirvana; wisdom and folly are          equally prajna; 
                          the method that is perfected by bodhisattvas and false          teachers
                           is the same bodhi; ignorance and suchness are not different          
                          realms; morality, concentration and wisdom, as well as desire, hatred   
                                 and ignorance are all divine practices; sentient beings and lands
                           share          the same dharma nature; hell and heaven are both the 
                          Pure Land; those          having Buddha-nature and those not having it 
                          equally accomplish the          Buddha's enlightenment. All defilements 
                          are ultimately liberation. The          reality-realms's ocean-like 
                          wisdom completely illumines all marks to be          just like empty 
                          space. This is called           'the TathÄ�gata's          accordance 
                          with the nature of enlightenment.'          "<br></em></p>
              <p><em>~ The Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>note: it does not mean we should remain ignorant, deluded, and suffer... it just means the nature of reality exhibits itself in all experiences.</p>
              <p>Anger is equally luminous and empty as compassion. Suffering is equally luminous and empty as peace and freedom.</p>
              <p>As an arising sound, thought, feeling, sight, taste, etc... everything is of one taste, luminous and empty.</p>

              <p>i thought i tie the middle view to turbidity of views, especially Prejudiced views è¾¹è§�(ä¸�å�ˆä¸­é�“), and 'grasping at views' è§�å�–è§�(é�žæžœè®¡æžœ) .  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>"The second turbidity is views. In the past, people saw everything as clean. But when the turbid kalpa arrives, people see things as unclean. The turbidity of views is composed of the Five Quick Servants: A view of the body, prejudiced views, views of prohibitions, views of views, and deviant views.</p>
              <p>"The view of a body: all living beings are attached to having bodies. They love their bodies. 'I certainly have to take care of myself. I can't let anything happen to me.' They look upon their own bodies as extremely important. They want to wear good clothes, eat good food, live in a good place. They always look upon their bodies as priceless gems. Right, your body is a priceless gem, but if you misuse it, your priceless gem turns into something not even as good as excrement. Why? Because you tend only to its superficial aspects, and don't discover the true gem of you self-nature. All you know is that your body is yours, and you can't put it down. From morning to night you are busy on behalf of your body. That's the view of a body. èº«è§�(æ‰§èº«æ˜¯æˆ‘)</p>
              <p><strong>"Prejudiced views for one side or the other. If you don't favor emptiness, then you favor existence. In general, it means not being in accord with the Middle Way. è¾¹è§�(ä¸�å�ˆä¸­é�“) </strong></p>
              <p>"The third 'quick servant' is the view of prohibitions. Precepts an turn into something bad when they are based on mistaking for a cause something that is not a cause. Such a mistake leads to the cultivation of unbeneficial ascetic practices. I explained earlier how some people imitate the habits of cows or dogs, or sleep on beds of nails, or undertake other unbeneficial ascetic practices. People who do this have a view of prohibitions. 'See me,' they think, 'I hold precepts.l None of you can do what I do; you can't compare to me.' They always have this arrogance in their minds. æˆ’ç¦�å�–è§�(å®ˆç‰›ç‹—æˆ’ã€�é�žå› è®¡å› )</p>
              <p><strong>"The fourth is the 'view of views', or 'grasping at views'. This is to mistake for an effect something that is not an effect. People with this problem think that they have obtained effects which they have not obtained. è§�å�–è§�(é�žæžœè®¡æžœ)</strong></p>
              <p>"The fifth is deviant views. People with deviant knowledge and views are always thinking about things in an improper way. These are the Five Quick Servants, which comprise the turbidity of views.</p>
