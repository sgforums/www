                      cultivation. Some people think that cultivation means not having an occupation but to be
                      engaged in the daily activities of prayers to the Buddha, meditation or chanting the
                      sutras. The actual purpose of cultivation is to eradicate our undesirable conduct and to

                      which is to eradicate our self serving and evil habits and thus reduce our negative karma.
                      However, many people do not understand this principle and they misinterpret its meaning.
                      Actually, not only those who have renounced to be Buddhist monks or nuns need to
                      cultivate, lay-Buddhists also need to cultivate, if not more diligently. Even those who do
                      not subscribe to any religion need to cultivate. Cultivation is not only a matter for
                      monks or nuns alone.</span></strong></td>
              </tr>
              </tbody>
              </table>
              <p><span style="color: #0000a0;"><strong>What is cultivation? Where do we practise cultivation?
                  Let me tell you a story: More than twenty years ago, I took four years to cultivate as I
                  travelled across the country. Step by step, I covered Taiwan by walking. Once when I was
                  in Hua-Lian, an elderly Buddhist asked me, "Master! A monk should reside in the
                  temple to meditate, pray and chant sutras, but when you travel about what are you
                  cultivating? I replied, "That’s right! I am cultivating. Sakyamuni Buddha
                  teaches us to cultivate our conduct. He does not encourage us to cultivate sitting down!
                  In the past few years I had been practising sitting meditation, now I wish to travel
                  about. While walking and also amidst all my other activities, I do not commit evil deeds,
                  I chant the names of the Buddhas, I praise and commend others, I tell people about the
                  Dharma, I avoid the places of vice, this is the way I cultivate."</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000a0;"><strong>Thus, to cultivate means cultivating in the midst of our
                  activities. This is a point that many people do not understand. They think that
                  cultivation will result in a society that is pessimistic and low-spirited. This is a
                  mistake. Jen Chen Buddhism advocates cultivating in the midst of our daily activities.
                  Many retired old folks have no need to attend to household chores anymore, thus they can
                  afford to spend their time to chant the names of the Buddhas and to cultivate in the midst
                  of their leisure. However, there are many housewives who need to tend to their children,
                  household chores and many other matters. How do you expect them to cultivate in their
                  leisure? Thus, the need to cultivate in the midst of their activities; while cooking they
                  could chant the names of the Buddhas and the Bodhisattvas. No matter what activities they
                  are engaged in, it is always possible to cultivate. Instead of gossipping about our
                  neighbours and friends or engaging in other frivolous talks, why not refrain from all
                  these. This is cultivation. Therefore, only when we cultivate in the midst of our
                  activities do we understand the meaning of cultivation. To cultivate in our leisure may
                  cause others a lot of frustrations. For example, a husband may be upset because his wife
                  neglects the household by spending too much time chanting or running from temple to
                  temple. For her to introduce Buddhism to her husband, thus, would not be an easy task. If
                  she understands the principle of cultivating in the midst of her activities, it would be
                  acceptable to the husband. Should he be invited to places of vice, he would know how to
                  turn them down because his wife is a diligent cultivator. Both husband and wife are then
                  cultivating at the same time. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000a0;"><strong>There will be progress in our society when we understand
                  the principle of cultivation. Otherwise, society will backslide. Over the last few
                  decades, I have come to realize that we need to cultivate wherever we are. When we possess
                  the correct concept of cultivation, any time is an appropriate time for cultivation, any
                  place can be the place for us to seek enlightenment. If each and everyone of us conduct
                  ourselves in this way, then the world will become a pure land. If we think that we can
                  only cultivate in the temples, or that we cannot cultivate when we are working, then it is
                  very possible that we commit evils deeds without even knowing. When we are with Buddha
                  every moment, and cultivate constantly, then we are truly practitioners of Buddhism.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000a0;"><strong>As to when in the cultivation process does one awaken and
                  what it is like to be awakened, only when you follow the guidance of the Dharma and put it
                  into practice, will you know you have awakened: when you drink the water, only you know
                  how warm or cold it is.</strong></span></p>

                  other activities, but, Buddhism is best practised amid these activities. Should one be

                  all sorts of other problems not related to their work. In short, they may be occupied
                  physically, but mentally, their minds are not free or empty. As such, does learning and
                  practising Buddhism really pose a problem to our heavy schedules? This is definitely not
                  so. A verse from the "Seven Buddhas" reads: "Avoid all evils; do all that
                  are good; purify one’s mind. These are the teachings of all Buddhas". </strong></span></p>

                      thoughts. This is practising Buddhism, and in fact it is the right approach. With this in

                      forests or temples to meditate or to chant.</strong></span></td>

                  does not wander. Naturally the mind will become pure and calm. Learning Buddhism means
                  emulating the mental purity of the Buddha. Buddha is one who has already attained perfect
                  enlightenment, sublime wisdom and blessings. On the other hand the commoner has lesser
                  blessings and wisdom. Still, he would have made tremendous advancements if he merely
                  practises Buddhism amid his daily activities to the extent that he attains purity in his
                  bodily actions, speech and thoughts.</strong></span></p>

                  advocates practising amid the activities of our daily lives; practising without attaching
                  to the notion of practice; maintaining awareness without attaching to the notion of
                  awareness; and attaining without attaching to the notion of attainment. When we understand
                  this principle and have no more confusions, we can be considered great practitioners of
