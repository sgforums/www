              This is why master shen kai recommends æŠ¤èº« (protection of animals) than æ”¾èº« (releasing animals)
              
              If we wish to release animals, we have to make sure others don't catch them back as a business (some people capture animals for people to release), and we must make sure they are released into habitable place otherwise it will kill them. Otherwise rather than releasing animals, we are killing them instead.

              ....
              
              TAIPEI - Tens of millions of animals, mostly fish and birds, are dying every year in Taiwan because of so-called "mercy releases" by Buddhists trying to improve their karma, according to animal welfare activists.
              
              The government is now planning to ban the practice, saying it damages the environment and that a large proportion of the 200 million or so creatures released each year die or are injured due to a lack of food and habitat.
              
              Around 750 such ceremonies are carried out in Taiwan each year, according to the Environment and Animal Society of Taiwan.
              
              Negotiations have seen some groups agreeing to halt the practice, but others have yet to accept a ban, Lin Kuo-chang, an official from the government's Council of Agriculture, told AFP on Sunday.
              
              Proposed amendments to current wildlife protection laws would see offenders facing up to two years in jail or fined up to 2.5 million Taiwan dollars (US$85,000) for such unauthorised releases, he said.

              <p>The temples bought the fishes on the day when we were to release the fishes, meaning they did not inform the sellers before hand. These fishes were meant to be sent to the restaurants on other days if the temples did not purchase them for releasing. Meaning there will be lesser supplies to the restaurants. This is my understanding. The temples also know that if the fishes were reared for releasing, it is just defeating the purpose of releasing and saving these fishes from the dinning tables.</p>
              <p>The people from the temples also know what types of fishes to be release into the deep sea. It is legal to release into deep sea. This is my understanding.</p>

              <p>I know you are a Christian and this is a common misconception that Christians have because you guys do not understand Buddha's teachings. Eating animals or killing a person is definitely not relieving them from sufferings. By doing so,  we are just creating bad affinity and bad karma. Actually, Buddha's teachings is all about not to go against nature. All living things are supposed to die naturally. Buddha's teachings is mainly about law of nature (karma) and not to go against law of nature. To kill animals for consumption is definitely going against law of nature.</p>

              <p>My understanding is it is their karma to be born in the animals realm and it is their karma to be part of the food chain. It is considered law of nature. I remember a monk said that tigers do not kill for nothing, they kill only when they are hungry. We humans are of higher intelligence and can live without eating animals. Thus, if we kill for food, our karma is definitely heavier.</p>
              <p>According to Buddha's teachings, it is the intention of doing good or bad deeds that is important. If you do good deeds for selfish reason, that's not considered good deeds. Some may appear doing bad deeds but may not be so because they have good intentions for doing so. Anyway, karma (law of nature) which is a "no man operation", will not be deceived and will not go wrong.</p>

              <p>I know you are a Christian and this is a common misconception
                  that Christians have because you guys do not understand
                  Buddha's teachings. Eating animals or killing a person is
                  definitely not relieving them from sufferings. By doing so, 
                  we are just creating bad affinity and bad karma. Actually, Buddha's
                  teachings is all about not to go against nature. All living things
                  are supposed to die naturally. Buddha's teachings is mainly
                  about law of nature (karma) and not to go against law of nature. To
                  kill animals for consumption is definitely going against law of
                  nature.</p>

              <p>I know that as long as the monk did not see, hear or suspect the animal killed for his purpose, the person can eat the meat. That means you CAN eat meat. But if you don't, and you had the choice to eat the meat but you didnt, can it then be said that you are not participating in this natural order of things by choosing not to eat it? Or does eating meat suddenly become an indulgence.</p>

              <p>Buddha did not put a rule that you can't eat meat.  However, Buddha did teach about cause-and-effect.  When you eat meat, you create killing karma.  This is going to ripen someway through illnesses, accidents etc. Things that affect you physically and even mentally in a negative way.  Because you gave harm and pain to others, therefore harm and pain arises for you later.</p>
              <p>It has never been a issue about rules and regulations of what Buddhists can or cannot do.  You just have to bear the responsibility for what you do.  Everyone has their own choice and freedom.</p>
              <p>Buddha's teachings are about wisdom.  Which means he teaches you to see and understand both long-term and short-term consequences.  As regular people, we are short-sighted and see only immediate benefits or at most in terms of a few decades.  But Buddha see much further than that.  Therefore he educated us based on his omniscient vision and understanding.  </p>
              <p>If you understand consequences, then you will not be so anxious to accumulate the causes now even if they seem enjoyable.  Just like you will not swallow a delicious poison that will kill you later.  Then by changing your choices now, you can change your future.  Some people say they don't care, therefore they will create a suffering future.  At that time, even if they decide to care, it will be very limited to do anything to save the situation.</p>

              <p>I don't quite understand your questions. Buddhists did not interrupt the animals' food chain. Humans should not be in the animals' food chain. We can survive by being a vegetarian. Natural death is considered suffering in Buddhism ç”Ÿè€�ç—…æ­»è‹¦. Killing them is more suffering than natural death but natural death is also suffering.</p>
              <p>Karma is not 1 + 1=2, it is not so straight forward and only the enlighten ones or Buddhas are able to discern karma.</p>
              <p>Doing good deeds is only part of Buddhism, Buddhism emphasize more on wisdom. Thus, do good deeds with wisdom. Don't do things which you think are good deeds but have bad outcomes. If animals liberation will cause imbalance to the nature, that means we are doing it without wisdom but I think that is only minority. Majority of the Buddhists release fishes into the deep sea which is their habitat.</p>

               Good point! However,remember there are different degrees to being a Buddhist, as there are many approaches to Buddhism. There main intention is to end our craving, intentionally depriving a live to satisfy our craving is creating negative karma for ourselves and create intense suffering for the living being. If you regard whatever food is offered to you as sustenance then it is what it is, sustenance for the body. As this is being said, we should also remind ourselves, are we really free from craving (meat)?!

               Main aim of Buddhism is to be released from cycle of samsara, subject  of endless rebirth of suffering. However, it is not unusual for some devotees wanting to be reborn to higher realms for a more pleasurable next life and less suffering!

                 The arousal of compassion, when one is devoid of compassion, one will be unable to empathize another's suffering.  By imbibing with mantras, one is invoking goodwill, however, efficacy of one dedication of merits depends on karmic affinity. For example, I may show kindness to you, but karmic affinity depending, you may or may not be able to arouse a feeling of relief and gladness. With the planting the seeds of gratitude, affinity to good will and loving kindness is created!
