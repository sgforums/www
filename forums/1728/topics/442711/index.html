              <p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://media.yachenlama.com/2011/11/crying-buffalo-.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1133" title="crying buffalo" src="http://media.yachenlama.com/2011/11/crying-buffalo--300x260.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="260"></a>According to the news release from China’s <em>People’s News (April 16, 2011)</em>, whether people believe it or not, this incident actually happened in Hong Kong. The <em>Weekly World News</em> reported that a group of workers were bringing a water buffalo into a 
              packaging factory, ready to slaughter it to make steak and beef stew.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">When they approached the front door of 
              the slaughterhouse, the sorrowful buffalo suddenly stood still, refusing
               to move forward, kneeling on its two front knees, and with tears 
              streaming from its eyes.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">How could the buffalo have already been 
              aware that it was going to be slaughtered, before entering the 
              slaughterhouse? This shows that it was even more alert than human being.
               “When I saw what is believed to be a stupid animal actually crying, and
               when I noticed that its eyes were full of fear and sadness, I could not
               help but shiver.”</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Extremely shocked by this, butcher Shiu 
              Tat-Nin recalled: “I quickly called other people to come and see, and 
              they were as surprised as I was! We pushed and pulled the water buffalo,
               but it would not move; it just sat there crying constantly.”</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Billy Fong, the boss of the Hong Kong 
              packaging plant said, “Mankind has always thought that animals are not 
              like people who can cry, but this buffalo is really sobbing like a 
              baby!”</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://media.yachenlama.com/2011/11/crying-buffalo-2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1134" title="crying buffalo 2" src="http://media.yachenlama.com/2011/11/crying-buffalo-2-219x300.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="300"></a>At
               that time there were at least a dozen strong, burly men present, but 
              their hearts were softened by the buffalo’s crying, and those who were 
              responsible for killing water buffaloes were even more touched by this, 
              tears welling out of their eyes.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">When workers from other slaughterhouses 
              heard the news, they also ran to the crying and kneeling buffalo, and 
              the site was soon crowded with people who were astonished at what they 
              saw. Three of them were so shocked that they said that from now on, even
               when they slaughter other kinds of animals, they will never forget that
               buffalo tears.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">At the point when a buffalo was crying 
              and people were crying as well, we could all be sure that none of them 
              would kill the buffalo. Then the question was how to take care of this 
              matter. Finally, they decided to buy the water buffalo with cash, and 
              then they sent it to a Buddhist temple, for the monastic to take good 
              care of it, so that it could be assured of living out its life 
              peacefully.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">When this decision was made, an amazing 
              thing happened again: “When there was an assurance that the buffalo 
              would not be killed, it finally agreed to move, got up, and it is here 
              with us.” How could a water buffalo understand human words?</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Shiu said: “Whether you believe it or 
              not, this is really true, although it sounds really incredible.” 
              Undoubtedly, this buffalo has changed the lives of these butchers.</p>

              <p>I heard from my friend that it is common that the buffalos and cows kneel down and cry when they were about to be slaughtered. My colleagues heard it from her colleagues who are from China. Her colleagues' family rear cows. However, not all the butchers are like those reported who are moved by the sight of cows or buffalos kneel down and beg for mercy. Those butchers reported in the above newspapers are kind hearted.</p>
              <p>I've heard from a Ven. that he witnessed the cows, buffalos and other animals in Indonesia kneeled down when a crane was raising a big statue of Buddha  in a newly built temple. These animals can feel the Buddha's compassion. </p>

              <p>I am actually appalled by this report. I feel that the butchers are more concerned with the surprising human behaviour of the cow rather than becoming aware of the suffering the animals go through. I don't believe that after all these years of killing animals cruelly(as deemed so if it was done to human), they have all along been merely ignorant of animals sufferings and were suddenly enlightened by the crying cow. Even though their ultimate actions are kind, it does little to change the meat guzzling world of indifferent people today. Many cows that do not cry still get and will continue to get slaughtered.</p>
              <p>therefore I somehow feel the foolishness of the butchers is sadder than if they were ignorant or even indifferent.</p>

              <p>the butchers are already immune to killing. It's just like a job for them, to earn money to keep themselves warm.</p>
              <p>I saw this movie about this girl who has high EQ but born with asthetic. She became a professor in designing animals living environment and she can empathy the fear of the animals before they walk into the slaugherhouse. She invented a new design for a slaughterhouse that allow the cow to walk slowly instead of being chased in a round about path with soothing music and water spraying at the cow.</p>
              <p>It helps to reduce the toxic in the flesh of the cow.  Her invention was finally accepted by one slaughterhouse when she proved her theory. From then onwards the old fashion slaugherhouse in USA is slowly converting to her design.</p>
              <p>She helps the animal to calm down and be relaxed before their death.</p>
              <p>I think this has not reached Hong Kong yet.</p>

              <p>IMO, this way of dying for the animals is far more peaceful than the kicking, pushing , whipping the animal into the slaughterhouse. Or the way how some kill the chickens. (KFC case). At least the animals still die with some dignity.</p>
