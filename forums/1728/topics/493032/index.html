              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify;">To many practitioners of the Mahayana schools of Buddhism of
              East Asia and the esoteric traditions of the Himalayas and Japan, bodhisattvas,
              or “enlightenment beings,” hold as much importance in daily practice and
              beliefs as Shakyamuni Buddha himself. Unlike the Buddha, who attained
              enlightenment and then transcended the human realm, bodhisattvas are said to
              have postponed their own enlightenment, or nirvana, to remain in this world to
              help other sentient beings attain enlightenment. Of the many bodhisattvas in
              the Buddhist pantheon, the most widely revered is Avalokiteshvara (meaning “the
              lord who gazes down”), a compassionate being who is believed to possess the
              ability to look in all directions to see who is suffering and to offer
              salvation. One of the most fascinating figures in Asian Buddhist imagery,
              Avalokiteshvara is represented in a multitude of forms, from a simple princely
              bodhisattva holding a lotus, to a complex, multi-armed deity, and even a mother
              holding a child. In recent years, this bodhisattva’s presence has extended
              beyond the realm of Buddhism and into areas of secular life.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Avalokiteshvara’s devotion to helping others is understood to
              be limitless, and to many Buddhists he is seen as embodying the compassion of
              all Buddhas. According to certain Buddhist texts, the deity took a vow to
              postpone his own enlightenment until all blades of grass and grains of sand
              have become enlightened; only then will he transcend this material realm to
              become a Buddha. In the Lotus Sutra, a text revered by many practitioners
              throughout East Asia, the deity is the subject of a whole chapter, which
              describes him as possessing many different powers and the ability to assume
              many forms in order to share the Buddha’s teachings and relieve the suffering
              of followers. This colorful description accounts for his diverse
              representations in Buddhist imagery. In many paintings and sculptures,
              Avalokiteshvara is shown in the typical garb of a bodhisattva, a prince-like
              figure wearing robes, a crown, and jewelry (to symbolize his presence in our
              material realm). Avalokiteshvara can be distinguished from other bodhisattvas
              by the lotus he holds in one hand, symbolizing the potential in us all to
              attain enlightenment (just as a pure lotus can grow in the muddiest water). He
              also typically wears a small image of Amitabha Buddha (or Amitayus), in his
              crown, representing his spiritual association with this particular Buddha.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In China, the deity is known as Guanyin, and for several
              centuries has been depicted in both male and female forms. The fluid gender of
              this deity in a number of Buddhist cultures has been the subject of copious
              research in Asia and beyond, but may best be explained as a consequence of his
              freedom to assume any form to respond to the many needs of followers. Many
              Chinese Guanyin figures have a graceful feminine appearance, but are either
              considered male or without gender. However, from around the 12th century
              onwards in China, the deity became associated with a princess named Miaoshan, a
              figure in an ancient tale who demonstrated tremendous compassion. From this
              period, female figures of Guanyin became very popular, with some renderings
              depicted the deity with prominent breasts and cradling a baby, representing her
              power to give and protect children. With the arrival of Jesuit missionaries in
              southern China in the early 17th century, these images of Guanyin became
              associated with images of the Virgin Mary and the baby Jesus, and Guanyin
              became known in the West as the Buddhist “Goddess of Compassion,” or “Goddess
              of Mercy.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">One of the bodhisattva’s most powerful and complex forms has
              11 heads and 1,000 arms. This form of Avalokiteshvara is portrayed most often
              in the esoteric traditions of Tibet and Japan. The heads represent his 11
              principal virtues (including non-attachment, non-violence, and faith), which he
              uses to conquer the 11 desires that obstruct the path to enlightenment.
              Avalokiteshvara’s 1,000 arms symbolize his many powers, which he uses to save
              all beings and lead them toward enlightenment. The central pair of arms is
              shown in a gesture of prayer, and the outer arms hold many different
              attributes, including weapons that represent the various ways in which he can
              offer help to his followers. The hands are often adorned with eyes that signify
              his omniscience and ability to see in all directions to identify suffering. To
              Vajrayana Buddhists, Avalokiteshvara (or Chenrezig), has particular
              significance in all of his forms and is considered the patron deity of Tibet,
              watching over the Land of the Snows. His Holiness the Dalai Lama is believed to
              be an incarnation of this bodhisattva and, as such, a living symbol of infinite
              compassion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In Japan, Avalokiteshvara (or Kannon), has been one of the
              most influential Buddhist deities. Because Japanese Buddhism includes
              devotional sects, esoteric practices, and Zen meditational Buddhism, it is
              perhaps in Japan where images of Avalakiteshvara are most diverse, and have
              long been depicted in paintings, cast in bronze, sculpted into stone, and
              carved out of wood, coated with lacquer, and sprinkled with gold powder. In the
              Zen tradition, which usually rejects iconic imagery, the deity has been the
              subject of many monochrome brush paintings and is a reminder of the importance
              of compassion. In these paintings, the deity is often depicted with a playful
              or mischievous expression.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">One of the most surprising depictions of the Avalokiteshvara
              dates to 1934. In 1930, two Japanese brothers, Goro and Saburo Uchida, founded
              a company that specialized in precision optical instruments. Four years later,
              they created their first camera, which they named the Kwanon, after the deity
              Kannon, presumably because of his association with flawless, precise vision.
              Their logo featured a simple black-and-white image of Kannon with 1,000 arms.
              In 1947, the company’s name was changed to Canon, and the Buddhist logo was
              dropped. Despite fluctuations in Japan’s economic circumstances, the company remains
              one of the country’s largest public companies to this day. Inspired by the most
              compassionate of all Buddhist deities, the name was an auspicious choice
              indeed!</span></p>
