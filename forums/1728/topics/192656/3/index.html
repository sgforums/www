            <div class='col-md body'>Ordinally happiness when ended, suffering occur there after.<br>Know that suffering is real, and happiness is false. As suffering don't become happiness, but happiness can become suffering. Unchanging is real, while changing is false.<br>Example, when eating good food. Eating my favourite food is happiness. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> But, if were to continue to eat bowl after bowl of the same food, it becomes a suffering. This is how happiness become suffering. happiness if continuous become suffering. But suffering if continuous will not become happiness.<br>Example, when hungry, i am experiencing suffering. If continue to stay hungry for 7 days, i will experience more suffering, not happiness. So suffering is real, and happiness is false.<br><br>Now neither suffering nor happiness is a good experience/realm. But one cannot sustain this state as time waits for no man.<br>Example when we are born, we are already walking towards the deathbed. Who can stop moving? None.<br>But it's said that in Nirvanic Bliss, there's no all above three forms of sufferings.<br>In this samsara world there's duality. Suffering and happiness is Prejudiced view for one side or the other. If Nirvana has no suffering, then happiness is also gone. As it's  on the same side with suffering. One gone, the other will too have to go with it. It's when both suffering and happiness is ended that bring forth the Ulitmate Reality of Nirvana (aka Ji2 Le4, Utmost Bliss). Thus called True bliss/happiness. If there happiness, then happiness is suffering and False. Ji le/Ulitmate Bliss is indeed inconcievable! Inconcievable mean cannot be said, nor cannot be think nor cannot be percieve.<br>Samsara is dimension of matter/karma controlling, you can't have your own wish or doing, hence suffering. Nirvana is a state/dimension of Mind/will/vow controlling, hence no suffering. there's this Utimate reality Buddha discovered!<br><br>/\<br></div>

For example an arhant is already liberated from Samsara and samsaric sufferings. A Buddha is liberated from both samsara and nirvana dharma and the subtle discrimination of nirvana and samsara is also removed. Bodhisattvas also attain various stages of enlightenment. To enter the 'path of seeing' of the Bodhisattva one also has to attain a direct perception on Emptiness, therefore also attaining a level of realisation/enlightenment.</div>

So if you ask me, I would say, no.  Because u are not taught to accept everything in face value in Buddhism, instead you are encourage to investigate, practise and realise it for yourself.  In fact, Buddhism is not even a religion to begin with, because there is no supreme being to worship to.</div>

One needs to have a sense of belief, an attitude of faith. First, one needs to have faith in oneself. What kind of faith? One needs to have faith that one certainly can become a Buddha. One has to believe that there is no difference between the Buddha and oneself. Yet that lack of difference is in one's Buddha-nature. Cultivation is still required in order to actually become a Buddha. If one cultivates, one will become a Buddha. In order to do so, one must have an initial belief in this principle.<br><br>"Second, not only is it necessary to believe that one can become a Buddha oneself, but also to believe that all people can become Buddhas. Moreover, not only can all people become Buddhas, one should believe that all living beings have the Buddha-nature and are capable of becoming Buddhas. If one has that kind of faith, then one should begin by following the rules oneself. To follow the rules means to hold the moral precepts. First one holds the precepts, and then one can become a Buddha. One does it oneself and also encourages others to do so as well.<br><br>"Faith must be solid, like a rock, firm and sturdy. Faith shouldn't be like a pile of ashes which seems to have some substance to it but which crumbles at the slightest disturbance. Don't be too soft. One's faith must be strong and solid." (HD 44 45)<br><br>THE IMPORTANCE OF FAITH<br><br>"Faith is the foundation of cultivation of the Way and the mother of merit and virtue, because it is capable of nourishing wholesome roots. The Buddhadharma is like a vast sea; only by faith can it be entered. Therefore, the single word 'faith' is the essence of escape from birth and death and is the wonderful means for returning to the source. It is a precious raft on the stream of affliction, a torch in the dark cave of ignorance, and a guide who leads us out of the path of confusion. It is a compass for those floundering in the waves on the sea of suffering, and a sagely teacher for those in the Three Paths (Arhat, Pratyekabuddha, and Bodhisattva) and Eight Difficulties ( ). It is the origin of awakening for the Four Kinds of Creatures born (from wombs, eggs, moisture, and transformation) within the Six Paths (see entry). Faith cannot be ignored. An author of ancient times said, 'If a man has no faith, I do not know what can be made of him.'<br><br>"Once two bhikshus were travelling to see Shakyamuni Buddha, the World-Honored One. As they travelled they became extremely thirsty but could not find any water. As they walked they happened upon a human skull containing water in which some small bugs were swimming, enjoying themselves tremendously. One of the bhikshus picked up the water and offered some to his companion. The companion replied, 'This water contains bugs, and the moral precepts do not permit drinking such water. I would rather die of thirst than to violate the precepts in order to stay alive.' After this incident he died of thirst.<br><br>"When the bhikshu who had drunk the water reached the place where the Buddha was residing, he bowed and said to the Lord, 'Your disciple was travelling in the company of another bhikshu who perished of thirst on the road. I hope the Buddha will be compassionate and rescue him.'<br><br>"The Buddha said to the bhikshu who had drunk the water, 'Because he stringently maintained the moral precepts and was so firm in his faith that he would not violate them even in the face of death, he received the awesome power of the Buddhas and arrived here before you. He has already seen the Buddha and heard the Dharma before you. He is a bhikshu who has true faith in the precepts." (WM 53-54; also S42 75-76)<br><br>Hymn of Faith<br><br>Faith is the source of the Way;<br><br>Faith is the mother of merit and virtue.<br><br>As they arise by faith,<br><br>All wholesome dharmas must by faith be nurtured.<br><br>Faith cuts the tangled web of doubt,<br><br>Escaping loves delusive flow,<br><br>And opens wide to reveal the true and unsurpassed Nirvana's road.<br><br>Faith has no stain or mar,<br><br>Bringing the turbid mind purification,<br><br>Eradicating pride,<br><br>Of all respect and reverence the foundation.<br><br>Within the Dharma Treasury<br><br>faith's jewel outshines the fairest gold;<br><br>Hence every conduct our hands by faith made pure receive and surely hold.<br><br>Faith is the healing source<br><br>By which our faculties are cleansed and quickened.

For the person who can commit him or herself to a fully monastic life the Gradual way may offer more hope than the Sudden way. For those who can not make such a dramatic commitment it may be the Sudden way that offers the hope. Like all religious and philosophical views various rational arguments can be made to support either a Gradualist or Suddenist approach, but the bottom line is that neither can be logically proven nor disproven. <span style="color: red;">[b]Both, in the final analysis, depend largely upon faith. Indeed, all schools of Buddhism, if not all religious traditions, require a strong faith component before any real Spiritual Awakening can occur. </span></strong><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>As you can see the faith statement comes from the above quote provided by the mod. You see how it will confuse people?[/b]</blockquote>The Zen masters would tell you, for enlightenment to occur, you need doubt. And as my Master said, and many other Zen masters said, we Not only need doubt, as small doubt can only produce small realisations, but GREAT DOUBT (of intense questioning) will produce Great Enlightenment. By great doubt, a person persistantly inquires on his Koan until he reaches breakthrough. 'Great Faith, Great Doubt, Great Determination' are three needs of zen practise.<br><br><blockquote><a href="http://www2.bc.cc.ca.us/resperic/science_and_spirituality.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www2.bc.cc.ca.us/resperic/science_and_spirituality.htm</a><br><br>Â“Great faithÂ” in Zen practice refers to a trust in the process, as demonstrated by the many who have gone on before, as well as a firm trust in oneÂ’s capabilities to see the essential nature of reality for oneself.   In scientific work, Â“great faithÂ” refers to a trust in the scientific method, successfully applied by scientists of the past, as well as an underlying belief in oneÂ’s inherent capability to understand the phenomena being studied.<br><br>Â“Great doubtÂ” in Zen refers to a willingness to profoundly question all of oneÂ’s most cherished beliefs, and ultimately to uproot them.  Beliefs are but concepts, floating on the surface.  The conceptual realm may be useful at times, but compulsive attachment to particular concepts is a hindrance to penetrating to deeper levels of realization of the fundamental nature of reality, which is beyond all concepts.  An ancient Chinese saying states that when a wise man points his finger to the moon, the fool sees only his finger.  In science, Â“great doubtÂ” is based on a realization that the model is not the reality.  Being too attached to a particular hypothesis or theory can prevent one from arriving at a better theory that reflects a deeper understanding of the phenomena of interest.<br><br>Â“Great determinationÂ” in Zen is required in order to not give in to laziness.  The process may take some time, and without determination one may never attain deep realization.  In fact, there is no deepest realization, and only by great determination will one keep going deeper.  Of course the same can be said of scientific research.</blockquote></div>

When we do not understand somethings, this does not mean it is wrong but either do we blindly accept it as right. As we have faith in the buddhism teachings, we will continue to investigate and improve to understand what are do not understand.<br></div>
