Thanks.[/b]</blockquote>can read HH Dalai Lama's explaination:<br><span style="font-style: italic;"><br>The "creator of the world," basically, is the mind. In the Sutras, the mind is described as an agent. It is said that consciousness has no beginning, but we must distinguish here between gross consciousness and subtle consciousness. Many gross consciousnesses appear as dependents of the physical aggregates, of the body. This is evident when you consider the different neurons and the functioning of the brain, but just because physical conditions are met does not mean that this is enough to produce a perception. In order for a perception which will have the faculty to reflect and know an object to arise, it must have a consubstantial cause. The fundamental consubstantial cause, of the same substance as its result, will in this case be the subtle consciousness. It is this same consciousness or subtle mind which penetrates the parental cells at the moment of conception. The subtle mind can have no beginning. If it had one, the mind would have to be born of something that is not the mind. According to the Kalacakra Tantra, one would have to return to the particles of space to find the fundamental consubstantial causes of the external physical world as well as of the bodies of sentient beings.</span><br><br>cont...<br><br><a href="http://hhdl.dharmakara.net/hhdlquotes22.html" rel="nofollow">http://hhdl.dharmakara.net/hhdlquotes22.html</a><br>/\<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The difference between Christianity and Buddism is this, for the sake of making things clearer.<br><br>Ultimately these two systems are going in opposite directions, and following either means that one would have less and less of either teachings until one is quite purely in the attitude of mind of either. In any case, I do feel that those who follow either ought to make their choice on facts.<br><br>Firstly these two agree on many things, kindness to others, making the world a better place and finally reaching this state of being. However the results which either desire couldn't be more different.<br><br>Buddhism seeks union with the Eternal Mind and awarness, a state where there are no more passions and the value of illusion of this world has passed away.<br><br>The end result of Christianity is an eternal, seperate awareness of this Eternal Mind as an individual, a state where passions are far more powerful and vivid then the strongest we have today, and having a world that is even more real and vivid that we have now.<br><br>Hence it seems that if Buddhism is a way to escape the illusion of this world, Christianity is a kind which calls this 'illusion' good and seeks to make it even stronger.<br><br>Obviously one has to choose between the two in the end.</div>

Also modern Christianity teaches about ascending to heaven, in Buddhism ascending to heaven is not ultimate but liberation is.<br><br>My Shi Fu used to be a Christian pastor, he turned to Buddhism after reading the Buddhist teachings.

In any case, I do feel that those who follow either ought to make their choice on facts.<br><br>Firstly these two agree on many things, kindness to others, making the world a better place and finally reaching this state of being. However the results which either desire couldn't be more different.<br><br>Buddhism seeks union with the Eternal Mind and awarness, a state where there are no more passions and the value of illusion of this world has passed away.<br><br>The end result of Christianity is an eternal, seperate awareness of this Eternal Mind as an individual, a state where passions are far more powerful and vivid then the strongest we have today, and having a world that is even more real and vivid that we have now.<br><br>Hence it seems that if Buddhism is a way to escape the illusion of this world, Christianity is a kind which calls this 'illusion' good and seeks to make it even stronger.<br><br>Obviously one has to choose between the two in the end.</div></blockquote>Well it would depend on what you know about Christanity and Buddhism wouldn't it?<br><br>People as a species, have very little understanding no matter how much you want to protest; when it comes to "spiritual" and "eternal" matters.<br><br>Unless you are Born Again like what Jesus said and unless you become Enlightened like what Buddha speaks of, you can but only speculate. It is fine to speculate, but the whole point of seeking (speculating) is to be Born Again and to be Enlightened. As long as you understand that.<br><br>What you just did is scratched the surface ot Buddhism and Christianity. You have not touched on the ultimate aim of both. It is good to seek (speculate) but it is better to have found. Million dollar question: Can one find without seeking?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Our minds and the whole universe are like that. This world is impermanent. <strong>Everything is always changing, changing, changing, moving, moving, moving, nonstop.</strong> Even one second of our lives seems full of so much movement and change in this world that we see. <span class="large"><strong>But your mind--right now--is like a lens whose shutter speed is one divided by infinite time</strong>.</span> We call that <strong>moment-mind.</strong> If you attain that mind, then this whole world's movement stops. <strong>From moment to moment you can see this world completely stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop</strong>. Like the film, you perceive every frame--this moment--which is infinitely still and complete. In the frame, nothing is moving. There is no time, and nothing appears or disappears in that box. But this movie projector--<strong>your thinking mind--is always moving, around and around and around, so you experience this world as constantly moving and you constantly experience change, which is impermanence. You lose moment-mind by following your conceptual thinking, believing that it is real."</strong><br><br><strong>When you transcend your thinking mind in the realization of your own pure, timeless, ever-present Awareness, then the illusion of time completely collapses, and you become utterly Free of the samsaric cycle of time, change, impermanence, and suffering. </strong>This, my friend, is nothing at all to be "depressed" about! Rather, the fact that your own Buddha Mind exists beyond time, in <span class="large"><strong>THIS very moment</strong></span>, is itself the key to your permanent and eternal (timeless) Liberation.<br><br></div>
