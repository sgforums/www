            <div class='col-md body'>interesting read on how things are created in Shurangama Sutra:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The Buddha said, "Purna, you have asked why in fundamental purity the mountains, the rivers, and the great earth suddenly arise.<br>"Have you not often heard the Thus Come One expound upon the wonderful light of the enlightened nature and the bright wonder of fundamental enlightenment?"<br>Purna said, "Yes, World Honored One, I have often heard the Buddha expound upon that subject."<br>The Buddha said, "You speak of understanding enlightenment; does the nature understand and is that called enlightenment? Or does enlightenment initially lack understanding and so you speak of understanding enlightenment?"<br>Purna said, "If a lack of understanding is called enlightenment, then there would be no understanding at all."<br>The Buddha said, "If there were no understanding at all, then there could be no understanding of enlightenment. If understanding is added, then that is not enlightenment. If understanding is not added, then thereÂ’s no understanding. But a lack of understanding or ignorance is not the lucid bright nature of enlightenment.<br>"The nature of enlightenment certainly includes understanding. ItÂ’s redundant to speak of understanding enlightenment.<br>"Enlightenment is not a kind of understanding. Understanding sets up an objective realm. Once that objective realm is set up, your false subjective state arises.<br>"Where there was neither sameness nor difference, suddenly difference appears. What differs from that difference becomes sameness. Once sameness and difference mutually arise, and due to them, what is neither the same nor different is created.<br>"This turmoil eventually brings about weariness. Prolonged weariness produces defilement. The combination of these in a murky turbidity creates afflictions with respect to wearisome defilements.<br>"The world comes about through this arising; the lack of any arising becomes emptiness. Emptiness is sameness; the world, difference. Those that have neither difference nor sameness become conditioned dharmas.<br>"The understanding added to enlightenment creates a light that stands in mutual opposition with the darkness of emptiness. As a result, wind wheels that support the world come into being.<br>"The tension between emptiness and that light creates movement. The false, persistent light congeals into a solidity that becomes metal. A lack of enlightenment nurtures that persistence and causes metal wheels to secure all lands.<br>"That tenacious unenlightened state creates metal, while the fluctuations of light cause the wind to rise. The friction between wind and metal creates fire, which is mutable in nature.<br>"Metal produces moisture, which causes flame to rise from the fire. Thus the wheel of water that encompasses all realms in the ten directions comes about.<br>"Fire rises and water falls, and the combination becomes tenacious. What is wet becomes the oceans and seas; what is dry becomes the continents and islands.<br>"Because of this, fire often rises up in the oceans, and on the continents the streams and rivers ever flow.<br>"When the power of water is less then that of fire, high mountains result. That is why mountain rocks give off sparks when struck, and become liquid when melted.<br>"When the power of earth is less then that of water, the outcome is grasses and trees. That is why the vegetation in groves and marshes turns to ashes when burned and oozes water when twisted.<br>"The interaction of that false dichotomy in turn creates these elements as seeds and from these causes and conditions comes the continuity of the world.<br>"Moreover, Purna, the false understanding is none other than the mistake of adding understanding to enlightenment.<br>"After the falseness of the objective realm is established, the subjective understanding cannot transcend it. Due to that, hearing does not go beyond sound, and seeing does not surpass form.<br>"Forms, smells, tastes, objects of touch and the others of the six falsenesses are realized. Because of them there is a division into seeing, sensation, hearing, and knowing.<br>"Similar karma binds beings together; union and separation bring about their transformations.<br>"The manifestation of light is caused by false view and ignorance. Competitive views generate hatred; compatible views create love. The flow of love becomes a seed; the potential fetus is taken in and conception occurs. When intercourse takes place, beings with similar karma are drawn in. From these causes and conditions, the kalaka, arbuda, and other fetal stages evolve.</span><br><br><a href="http://www.buddhistinformation.com/shurangama_sutra.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.buddhistinformation.com/shurangama_sutra.htm</a><br><br>/\<br><br></div>

To work out one's salvation and not be dependent on others (whether pastors or priests or holy books.)

            <div class='col-md body'>From another topic, on why the words of Buddha are not held as absolute (<a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=192355&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=192355&amp;page=1</a>):<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by laoda99:</div><div class="quote_body">so in short, u r saying:<br><br>1) guidelines are for beginners<br><br>2) when u are more advanced can discard all the guidelines liao?</div></blockquote>Ok first, you need to know what are the 8 fold path to enlightenment. If guidelines are held as absolute it will inevitably become a dualism. In Christianity, the essential two commandments is <span style="font-style: italic;">"Thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might." (Deut 6:5, Mat 22:37) and " Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself." (Lev 19:18, Mat 22:39.)</span>. Why are they the essentials? Because when there is the Unconditional Love which is itself without discriminations as Jesus always taught, things will fall in place, everything will become One and naturally all other 'commandments' are met without fail.<br><br><blockquote>Book: Buddhism Plain and Simple by Steve Hagen<br><br>Page 53:<br><br><strong>5. The Art of Seeing</strong><br><br>THE FOURTH TRUTH OF THE BUDDHA-dharma, also known as the eightfold path, offers us a realisation and a practice for bringing about the cessation of dukkha.<br><br>This is not a path we can take to get from point A to point B. Its peculiar nature is that the moment we step on it, the entire path is realised at once. Still, with each step we take we can deepen our understanding.<br><br>The eight aspects of this path are <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">right view. right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">right meditation.</span></strong><br><br>We'll preview each of these in a moment, but first let's consider the word "right." <strong>The word the Buddha actually used was <span style="font-style: italic;">samma. Samma</span> is translated as "right" - but not "right" as opposed to "wrong," or "bad," or "evil." Normally, the moment we say "right," we've already implied "wrong." We've implied dualism.<br><br>For those unfamiliar with the term as it's being used here, dualism simply refers to the world of left and right, dark and light, good and bad, pure and impure. It's the psychological backdrop for our everyday world of chasing after something and running away from others, the world in which if you differ from me, then there's something wrong with you.<br><br>Obviously, this isn't what the Buddha meant by <span style="font-style: italic;">samma</span>. The term suggests something far more subtle. It's better that we understand right as "this is appropriate," "this works," "this is in sync with Reality." Right, on the eightfold path, doesn't mean right versus wrong so much as it means <span style="font-style: italic;">seeing</span> versus <span style="font-style: italic;">not seeing.</span> It refers to being in touch with Reality as opposed to <span style="font-style: italic;">Samma</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">refers to Wholeness rather than fragmentation.</span></strong><br><br>Thus, when I use the word "right" in the chapters to come, I intend it to refer to what is conducive awakening, rather than something that can be compared against something wrong.<br><br>................................<br><br>--------------------------<br><br>6. Wisdom<br>................................<br>page 66:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Right view</span> is <span style="font-style: italic;">seeing</span> reality in all its fullness and fluidity. Yet there's nothing in particular to be <span style="font-style: italic;">seen</span>.<br><br>In the world of our common ordinary mind, everything is divided up: left and right, good and bad, above and below.<br><br>For example, we see the puma stalking the deer and we want to call out to the deer to help him escape. And when the puma pounces on the deer, our heart goes out to the deer.<br><br>So we look for a way to protect the deer. We put bells on the puma so the deer knows when she's around. As a result, the puma suffers. Eventually, she starves.<br><br>With no more puma to keep the deer population in check, the number of deer increases. Before long there are more deer than the local environment can support. The deer overgraze the land and strip the trees and shrubs bare of leaves.

To the extent we don't <span style="font-style: italic;">see</span>, we waste our compassion.<br><br><strong>If you <span style="font-style: italic;">see</span> Reality in its fluidity and fullness, then you <span style="font-style: italic;">see</span> the puma as well as the deer.

Morality<br><br>.............<br>page 78:<br><br>What's the point of <span style="font-style: italic;">right speech?</span> It's to remind ourselves, to constantly bring ourselves back to this moment - not only for ourselves, but for others as well. It's to do whatever leads us out of confusion and bondage. It's to <span style="font-style: italic;">see</span> what's really going on.<br><br><strong>The Buddha did not lay down any commandments. If we say, "Thou shalt not lie," applying it as a rule, what are we to do when the Gestapo pounds at our door and we're harbouring a family of innocent fugitives in the attic? If not lying were an absolute rule to live by, we'd be in deep moral trouble.<br><br>Nevertheless, it's not the case that buddhas simply live out of their own individual truths. The buddha-dharma - what the awakened teach - is about directly <span style="font-style: italic;">seeing</span> Truth itself, prior to forming any ideas about it.</strong> It is about responding to each particular situation as it comes to be, not according to some lockstep programs of do's and don'ts. We can't use a hard and fast rule to deal with the dilemmas and uncertainties and ambiguities of life. A rule - any rule - would only open the door for more relativism and contradiction.<br><br>Nevertheless, we can <span style="font-style: italic;">see</span> what's morally appropriate in each situation. We can easily <span style="font-style: italic;">see</span> what actions and speech will lead us and others into hatred, confusion, difficulty, and suffering. And we can <span style="font-style: italic;">see</span> what actions and speech will lead us and others into hatred, confusion, difficulty, and suffering. And we can <span style="font-style: italic;">see</span> what words and actions will not. It all has to do with our intention. Is our intention to hoodwink, mislead, inflate, or deceive others - or is it to be awake?<br><br>Here is the focus for <span style="font-style: italic;">right speech</span>. In any given moment, our eyes must be open to <span style="font-style: italic;">see</span> our situation fully for what it is. Our intent- and the action, speech, and though that arise from the intent - is that we all become free of our confusion. For this, it's not necessary that we see one thing pitted against another.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Right speech</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">omits nothing. It includes the whole picture: the Gestapo, the fugitive family, yourself, and the world in which you live.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Right speech</span> doesn't rely on judgment or discriminative thinking. In judging we weigh everything out. We base our speech on some conceptual frame that we've arranged to accommodate ourselves and process ideas - like, for example, the idea that the Gestapo are inherently bad, and the people upstairs are inherently good. This is precisely the thinking that got us into trouble in the first place. Indeed, it's the very thinking that produces both the Gestapo and the fugitives.<br><br>Instead, we have to simply <span style="font-style: italic;">see</span> the situation in all its pain, conflict, difficulty, and contradiction, and <span style="font-style: italic;">see</span> how it is we become so confused. Then, and only then, can we speak and act in a way that's conducive to awakening.<br><br>We must also observe our own intent, so that we can <span style="font-style: italic;">know</span> when we're speaking or acting out of a leaning mind, out of a desire to bring about some particular end. <span style="font-style: italic;">Right speech</span> concerns your intention. Are you using speech because you're trying to manipulate the world and other people? Or are you speaking in order to help yourself and others wake up?</blockquote></div>

We only need to realise that (not just conceptually) to awaken. Mind in essence is fundamentally pure, it should not be confused with our mind of ordinary sentient thoughts. Sufferings is caused by not seeing the true nature of our Mind, and ignorance is caused by various causes and conditions.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Investigating hua to or "looking into who is reciting Buddha's name" is contemplating Mind. Hence, contemplating Mind is illuminating pure awareness. It is also illuminating the Buddha-nature within oneself. Mind is nature, pure awareness, Buddha. Mind has no form, no characters, no directions; it cannot be found in any particular place. It cannot be grasped. Originally, Mind is purity, universally embracing all Dharma realms. No inn or out, no coming or going. Originally, Mind is pure Dharmakaya.</span><br><br>The <strong>nature of</strong> Sufferings, incessant thinking, attachments, Samsara itself, is Dharmakaya. But it is NOT dharmakaya. Thus once we realise the nature of sufferings, when it is seen in its essence, then it no longer affects us anymore just as passing clouds cannot obstruct the vast sky. We are liberated.</div>
