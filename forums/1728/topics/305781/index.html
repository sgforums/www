              <p>Thusness told me in the past it is dangerous to practice such things as focusing on third eye especially without guidance, and can lead to lots of trouble, and opening a channel into the spirit realm, possibly resulting in spiritual interferences, possession, etc. Maybe if he's here he can share on this..?</p>
              <p><br>In the first place, if you want to gain enlightenment, you HAVE to practice Buddhist meditations... no other meditations can lead to enlightenment, most are only forms of shamatha, pure-concentration practices. They may lead to samadhi but not wisdom or insight.</p>

              <p>Is the teacher a qualified Buddhist dharma/meditation teacher? Can you provide a few more details about the method of practice?</p>
              <p>Focusing on third eye is merely a shamatha form of practice and cannot lead to enlightenment, so I wonder why is this taught. I have never heard of third eye meditation being taught in Buddhism, and I would advise you never to try that unless somehow your Buddhist teacher tells you to do so.</p>
              <p>E-Sangha:</p>
              <p>"NEVER take one of the chakras, especially internal to the head,
              as an object of meditation. NEVER, EVER - unless your teacher is
              guiding you. And unless they are Taoist, this would be very suspect.
              I've never heard of this practice in Zen. Doing this without guidance
              is very, very dangerous. If you are doing Zen or other Buddhist
              practice go back to your teacher and get clarification. If you are
              sitting zazen, keep your mind in the hara.<br><br>I cannot emphasize this enough.<br><br>Kirt"</p>

              <p>Ic.. if it's being taught by a qualified guru its best to clarify these things with him. I do not know what exactly is that practice, but third eye meditation outside Buddhism is used to open some psychic channel and is an object of concentration, but does not lead to wisdom. I think it is no good to ask around on third eye practice, because non-Buddhist paths also have their own way of concentrating on third eye and it is best not to get confused.</p>
              <p>From what I have read, Dzogchen have their own night practice of visualising a white letter A in between the eyebrow, thus gaining control of all vital energies, and due to the concentration and not being polluted by discursive thoughts, the natural clear light appears while we fall asleep. Of course all these cannot be practiced without instructions/initiations from a qualified guru. This is just an example, I am not saying it is similar to what you are saying... but it isn't exactly the same thing as the common 'third eye meditation' we hear elsewhere.</p>
              <p>If you follow a qualified Buddhist teacher there shouldn't be a problem. Even if that dharma teacher isn't in Singapore, you should probably wait or ask another qualified teacher to guide you and answer your doubts. Especially when it is a Vajrayana practice and not any common practice, Vajrayana practices are usually esoteric and requires instructions from a guru.</p>

              <p><em><br> I think when we are young, somehow we are very attracted by all
                                      these, itÂ’s OK. You know when I was very young, probably 20 years
                                      ago. I can stare at a candle day and night for six hours, ten
                                      hours. Then everytime I practise one hour, one and a half hour,
                                      without blinking my eyes, then tears kept running down my eyes. I
                                      just stared at the candle only. This is what we call Â“Qi Men Tian
                                      ShuÂ”, one of the practise. We are so excited by all these. Then
                                      because of the power of concentration, because you kept on
                                      concentrating, it was so intense... then your concentration becomes
                                      very powerful and it just stays there. Then one day, you close your
                                      eyes, the next stage, I practised that for a few months and then
                                      just close your eyes, and you just focus something on your
                                      forehead... Wah, that one is very.... Then later the thing that you
                                      focus in your forehead, you just cannot get rid of it. You know how
                                      painful is that? When you sleep, it is also there. It is something
                                      like sticking down there, you know. But itÂ’s fun mah, just dunno
                                      mah, read some books {laughs} then looked for some master and then
                                      start practising. Can you see what I mean? That is very dangerous.
                                      You see, everybody goes through certain phases. So the right kind
                                      of understanding is very important.</em></p>

                      <p>Practicing focusing between eyebrow can make things worse, depending on how your practice.</p>
                      <p><br>The best is to practice the Buddhist way, when your practice reach certain level, naturally things like spirit possession cannot take place and there will be no opening to spiritual interference.</p>

                      <p>Have you practised concentration without proper guidance

                                                          it. But if one practices wrongly, that level stays and is

              <p><br>Ok wat i know bout these spirits from my fren who has natural 3rd eye</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some of them are just a shadow. be it white, black , or worse red.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My fren says. he can feel that the black or red one is usually evil one. i mean real evil that can do something to u. this kind usually have enough power to show u their real face or even tough or even speak to u or worse possession.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i think i can believe what he say bout red is really the evil one cuz my company has this one inhibit the warehouse. plenty of sightings. and even possesion takes place.</p>
              <p>Believe it or not. This red thing can cause u harm by just touching u. A worker here said she felt like some1 touching her leg during stockcheck. Her husband saw the red mark on her touched leg but she didnt. Only after few days she able to see it while her husband insisted that he really saw it. She even said its painful to even splash the water on the area. and i saw the mark.. it looks like 3 snake bites vertically and on left side of these, theres another one. the weirdest thing i ever see.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Another of my fren said she only saw a the body of the spirits. i mean real human body. the body parts are there just like humans but just pale and some body parts are missing or the head are missing just flying around. She never seen a red spirit and even said im a lier cuz all these years she really never see it at all until one day she saw the reflection of the red dressed long haired ghost floating in the office during lunch hour just right behind ,above her head facing and looking at her. Only then she believed me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Forgot to mention. This red thing has possesed 2 or more ppl in the day. not night.</p>
              <p>Some medium did something and they say its too powerful and not something to messed up. Believe it or not up to u.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>FRom wat my fren said, all movies are not as scary as the real one. Its undescribable to my fren whom seen their real face. I asked how to describe.. Just one word, undescribable</p>

              <p>I agree with AEN and Thusness... pls don't try it. Practise the dharma at our own pace, no matter how slow that may be we must be patient. Many other non-Buddhism practices or mediums also hv third eye or similar to that, but as AEN mentioned, they may not have Wisdom or insight.
