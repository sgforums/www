              Joy”—Mindfulness-based Dementia Care</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Caitlin Dwyer Buddhistdoor

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify;">Imagine a difficult situation that many of us experience: an
              aging parent is beginning to forget things, to have difficulty speaking, to
              struggle physically, and is diagnosed with dementia. As they lose the capacity
              to function independently, their family begins to make decisions for them, to
              respond to emergencies, and to support them financially. While helping aging
              parents is often seen as a filial duty, dementia brings other, more tangled
              aspects to the relationship. For family members, the stressful role of
              caregiving can often lead to depression, guilt, and anxiety, diminishing the
              quality of life and the care that is being provided to the beloved parent.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“If you come away feeling like a horrible caregiver, and you
              feel like you’re falling short all the time, your lens for seeing what is going
              well becomes distorted,” says Laura Rice-Oeschger, lead teacher and program
              director of the Presence Care Project, a nonprofit that brings the
              Buddhist-derived principles of mindfulness, loving-kindness, and meditation to
              dementia and end-of-life care. She observes that many people caring for loved
              ones with Alzheimer’s or dementia put off their own health and well-being:
              “There’s this hyper-vigilance and stress reactivity in caregiving. . . . We’re
              setting conditions on ourselves all the time about when it is we will
              experience relaxation or peace.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Presence Care Project was founded in San Francisco by
              Marguerite Manteau-Rao, a social worker and meditation practitioner, to bring
              mindfulness into dementia care. Buddhist-inspired practices help family
              members, whom they refer to as “care partners,” to remain resilient throughout
              the stressful routines of the day. The six-week curriculum teaches care
              partners to incorporate mindfulness into their daily role—from feeding someone
              to calming them down, to just sitting and enjoying their company. Based on Jon
              Kabat-Zinn’s Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), a secular derivative of
              Buddhist mindfulness, the program encourages awareness of everyday life and
              uses familiar Buddhist ideas of walking and sitting meditation and counting the
              breath. Created, run, and taught entirely by women, who combine their own
              meditation practices with social work and medical science, the Presence Care
              Project also forms an informal sangha of sorts; a group of mutually supportive
              caregivers who can help each other. This is applied Buddhism—using techniques
              and tools learned on the cushion to deal with one of life’s most stressful
              events: the slow loss of a loved one.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Caring for someone else is inextricably linked to
              self-awareness. “How is it that we tune in to hear what someone else needs? We
              have to be able to be aware of our own body and presence to see it in someone
              else,” says Rice-Oeschger, who co-founded the Ann Arbor Center for Mindfulness
              and is a certified MBSR teacher. “We’re adding [additional stress] to
              caregiving when we’re not aware, when we’re on autopilot.” The approach
              Manteau-Rao developed, called Mindfulness-Based Dementia Care (MBDC), makes
              caregiving itself the practice: taking a deep breath before walking into a care
              facility. Seeing chores such as cooking meals as an opportunity for connection
              and creativity, rather than a burden. Sitting with someone whose sense of time
              no longer flows linearly and simply being in the present moment with them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Dementia patients often experience a deep sense of loss. A
              person with Alzheimer’s may feel like the world is constantly shifting under
              their feet and many do not understand why names, memories, and abilities are
              disappearing from their lives. As a clinical social worker, Rice-Oeschger meets
              weekly with diagnosed patients and talks with them about the loss of the
              knowledge and ability they once valued in themselves. Buddhist ideas of
              attachment often surface. “What they tend to explore is, what is the attachment
              with my sense of self, with knowledge, and with memory?” she says. With
              mindfulness as part of the process, “an opportunity for a new kind of identity
              emerges. Rather than the focus being on the loss, it’s on what is emerging.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Often, what emerges are simple, wordless moments of
              relationship: simply being in the now with a loved one, sometimes without
              speaking. A dementia diagnosis is not the end, points out Rice-Oeschger: “There
              are many years of enjoyment, of slowing down . . . of friendship.” Learning to
              be present with the current reality is part of maintaining a shifting
              relationship with family members and caregivers. Tibetan Buddhist teacher Pema
              Chödrön has written about being “groundless” and watching what happens when
              life sucks the stability out from under us. In a sense, caring for someone with
              dementia is an exercise in groundlessness, requiring constant reassessment of
              where you stand. “We don’t have the answers,” Rice-Oeschger observes. “We don’t
              have a cure for Alzheimer’s, we can’t stop it . . . but that doesn’t mean
              there’s not room for healing.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">That’s where MBDC comes through—encouraging moments of
              compassion, both for the person being cared for and the caregiver. “Care
              partners typically are carrying a lot of guilt and shame, so to suggest right
              from the beginning that there’s self-compassion doesn’t feel right for a lot of
              care partners. It feels self-indulgent,” explains Rice-Oeschger. Instead, the
              approach allows compassion to arise naturally through mindfulness practice—and
              later, once practitioners are more comfortable, confronts it directly through
              teachings on metta (Pali; often translated as loving-kindness).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">With MBDC, a cure or a solution is not the goal, rather it is
              being in a relationship with the changing, shifting reality of another person,
              without feeling over-taxed. “Most care partners want to connect with their family
              member, whether that family member is also really engaged and conversing and
              really insightful, or whether the journey is much longer and they are no longer
              in verbal communication,” says Rice-Oeschger. MBDC strives to help maintain
              that healthy relationship for both parties, the caregiver and care receiver, by
              rewriting the narrative of decline. Moments of awareness and healing are
              interspersed throughout the times of frustration and loss, and in MBDC,
              stepping back to observe and acknowledge those small moments matters. The
              driving question, says Rice-Oeschger, is “how can we support autonomy, a sense
              of self, of worth and dignity, all of these human values, without denying
              suffering? Without denying that there is also joy?” </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The leaders of the Presence Care Project do not necessarily
              consider themselves Buddhist teachers—they are students of Buddhism and
              teachers of the mindfulness practices of MBSR. Still, they often see that
              caregivers and people with dementia begin to embody Buddhist principles of living
              in the present moment, expressing compassion, and letting go of attachment.
              “I’ve spent the majority of the last 20 years working toward that stillness,
              and trying to let go more and be less attached, and here they are: perfectly
              open,” says Rice-Oeschger, laughing. “From a Buddhist perspective, I think
              that’s just amazing. The irony is that someone is experiencing what we would
              define as “decline” in the medical sense and in a social and cognitive sense,
              but they are embodying this practice which we’re looking so hard to do on the
              cushion every day.”</span></p>
