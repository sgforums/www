            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, I'm a very bad practitioner but my understanding of the path is that it has a lot to do with mindfulness and maintaining a mindful presence both in sitting as well as in the midst of doing things. With mindfulness we will also not be lost in our thoughts, seeking, and rejecting things we perceive from our senses -- this is also guarding our six sense doors. You are merely aware 'choicelessly' of phenomena arise and pass away without seeking or rejecting. By guarding our six sense doors we do not give rise to unwholesome states of thoughts, or even evil thinking.<br><br>With this mindfulness, we are attentive of every moment of our mind, speech and action, we are conscious of every arising thought and our habitual behaviors. We are most of the time much less conscious of ourselves than we know.<br><br>Our behaviors and doings are mostly conditioned behaviors, like it has become so much of a habit that we no longer notice it anymore. It becomes mechanical. Mindfulness is about being NOT mechanical, but alive, mindful/aware every moment.<br><br>This mindfulness will also affect not only our thinking but also our behavior and speech. For example if someone wants to argue or fight with you, you merely maintain a mindful presence like an unstained mirror... like my dharma teacher said, just like space, everything that comes just drops away instantaneously because it has nothing/nowhere to stick to. You did not receive his insults, you merely hear attentively, and as a result you do not give rise to anger or hatred. This by the way, is also a training of equanimity.<br><br>If you are on the other hand not mindful of your thinking, and then thoughts of anger or hatred arises which developes into hateful speech and then physical violence. It is frightening how a thought can develope into something much more dangerous. So we must not be 'controlled' by thoughts, by our conditioning or habits which can lead us astray.<br><br>I mentioned earlier about our behaviors being conditioned and mechanical most of the time. As a result we unconsciously react and strengthen our bad habits. When we practise the Buddhadharma, we no longer continue our unconscious and negative habitual behaviors. We also gradually reduce and eliminate our negative habits that are harmful to ourselves and others, whatever habits that might be. Our actions will arise from wisdom and awareness, not from ignorance.<br><br>I also just posted this just now:<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by An Eternal Now:<br><strong>[b]No desire to be or not to be</strong><br><br>Self-knowledgeÂ…is not a process to be read about or speculated upon: it must be discovered by each one from moment to moment, so that the mind becomes extraordinarily alert. In that alertness there is a certain quiescence, a passive awareness in which there is no desire to be or not to be, and in which there is an astonishing sense of freedom. It may be only for a minute, for a secondÂ—that is enough. That freedom is not of memory; it is a living thing, but the mind, having tasted it, reduces it to a memory and then wants more of it. To be aware of this total process is possible only through self-knowledge, and self-knowledge comes into being from moment to moment as we watch our speech, our gestures, the way we talk, and the hidden motives that are suddenly revealed. Then only is it possible to be free from fear. As long as there is fear, there is no love. Fear darkens our being and that fear cannot be washed away by any prayer, by any ideal or activity. The cause of fear is the Â‘meÂ’, the Â‘meÂ’ which is so complex in its desires, wants, pursuits. The mind has to understand that whole process, and the understanding of it comes only when there is watchfulness without choice.<br><br>The Collected Works, Vol. VII - 327<br><br>~ J Krishnamurti[/b]</blockquote></div>

The 'noticing' is mindfulness/awareness/buddha. To be aware is to step out of the unconscious momentum.<br><br>That is why there is the saying -- if you put down your knife, immediately you attain Buddhahood (fang xia tu dao, li di cheng fo). It does not mean you attain Great Enlightenment like Shakyamuni Buddha, but it means at that moment your Buddha Nature shines through, you are in touched with your innate awakeness. If we can be aware moment to moment, we will not be misled by our ignorance. If we can maintain this awareness moment to moment, then all our egoic problems, habits, identifications and attachments can be dissolved. We maintain a mindful presence that is not identified and attached to what is happening and to seeking. This is how we can liberate. But we must sustain in our practise.<br><br>There are also other antidotes to strong emotions of anger and lust, for example anger can be pacified by giving rise to thoughts of Metta, and lots of Patience. There is also a type of patience called Transcendental Patience. Such a person merely maintains pure perception of what is happening, whatever is happening can't affect him because he is 'transparent'. This is called the endurance of non endurance, ren wu ke ren, there is nothing to tolerate at all. One is liberated.<br><br>Lust can be pacified by the three contemplations which I wrote in another thread. <a href="http://sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=268057" rel="nofollow">How do i overcome 'lust' thoughts?</a><br><br>As for not enough merits, there are many ways to cultivate merits, but one must have the correct understanding otherwise no real merits will come out of it.</div>

One can be kind to animals, which is a v gd thing, but not to the point of being obsessed with them.<br><br>What I am saying is the case of a person who becomes overly obsessed with cats to the point where he can't really live without them. His whole life revolves around them and he/she is very attached to them. Such a person is likely to be reborn in the cat realm because the seeds of his/her cats is already deeply planted in his 8th consciousness. At the time of death it is easy that such seeds ripen and conditions his rebirth in the cat realm.<br><br>I suddenly thought about the cat thing because it has been discussed some weeks ago in a dharma discussion session with my dharma teacher and a few others. Someone brought up about his friend's case which is rather similar as what I described -- being someone very kind to cats and becoming obsessed and dependent on them. My dharma teacher did warn that there is a likelihood for her to fall into the cat realm, and advise that she advise her friend not to be too attached to them.</div>

Q: What are the Â‘three methods of training (to be performed) at the same levelÂ’ and what is meant by per-forming them on the same level?<br><br>A: They are discipline (vinaya), concentration (dhyana) and wisdom (prajna)."<br><br>Q: Please explain them one by one.<br><br>A: Discipline involves stainless purity. Concentration involves the stilling of your minds so that you remain wholly unmoved by surrounding phenomena. Wisdom means that your stillness of mind is not disturbed by your giving any thought to that stillness, that your purity is unmarred by your entertaining any thought of purity and that, in the midst of all such pairs of opposites as good and evil, you are able to distinguish between them without being stained by them and, in this way, to reach the state of being perfectly at ease and free of all dependence. Furthermore, if you realize that discipline, concentration and wisdom are all alike in that their substance is intangible and that, hcnce, they are undivided and therefore one - that is what is meant by three methods of training performed at the same level.</div>
