            <div class='col-md body'>2007 INTERNATIONAL BUDDHIST FILM FESTIVAL DEBUTS IN SINGAPORE Â– FIRST TIME IN ASIA<br><br><a href="http://www.ibff.org/index.cfm?pg=E0" rel="nofollow">http://www.ibff.org/index.cfm?pg=E0</a><br><a href="http://www.asianbuddhistfilmfest.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.asianbuddhistfilmfest.org/</a><br><br>Films from Nine Nations; Seven Singapore Premieres Opening Night Benefits Two Charities<br><br>Â“These films can change the way people see the world.Â”<br><br>The first International Buddhist Film Festival (IBFF) in Asia opens in Singapore, Thursday, May 17 for a four day run. Showcasing a diverse program with the theme Â“Medium of Reflection,Â” the 2007 IBFF features works from nine nations, with seven Singapore premieres.<br><br>The opening night film is the Singapore premiere of the award-winning Shower, by Zhang Yang, from China. A portion of the proceeds from the opening night program will benefit two Singapore charities, The PresidentÂ’s Challenge and ChildrenÂ’s Cancer Foundation, and the guest of honor is SingaporeÂ’s Minister for Health, Mr. Khaw Boon Wan.<br><br>Ranging from dramas and comedies to documentaries and animation, the IBFF includes the Singapore premiere of the recent AFI Festival Grand Jury Prize winner, BuddhaÂ’s Lost Children, a Dutch documentary filmed in Thailand about a former Thai boxer turned Buddhist monk who builds an orphanage, school and clinic--a haven for the children of that strife-ridden region.<br><br>Among the other Singapore premieres are rare screenings of Buddhist-themed episodes of international hit television shows The Simpsons and King of the Hill, along with films from China, Bhutan, India, Canada, England and the US. Several of the filmmakers are traveling to Singapore to be on hand for Q &amp; A sessions following their films. A guest speaker, British-born monk Venerable Ajahn Brahm, will give a talk on Sunday, May 20.<br><br>Three films connected with noted Bhutan-born Tibetan lama Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche will be shown. Two dramatic features he directed, The Cup, and Travellers &amp; Magicians, were filmed on location in India and Bhutan respectively. The third is the Singapore premiere of a documentary by Canadian Leslie Ann Patton, Words of My Perfect Teacher, which follows him from the World Cup in Europe all the way to Bhutan in search of a better understanding of the teacher-student relationship in Tibetan Buddhism.<br><br>The Asian premiere of renowned German director Doris DÃ¶rrieÂ’s new feature-length documentary How to Cook Your Life will be screened on Sunday, May 20. This profile of San Francisco chef, author and Zen priest Edward Espe Brown explores principles of Zen Buddhism as they apply to the preparation of food as well as life itself. The award-winning DÃ¶rrieÂ’s comedy Enlightenment Guaranteed, filmed on location in a Japanese Zen monastery, will be screened on May 19.<br><br>Rounding out the program is the Singapore premiere of Compassion In Exile, the award-winning portrait of the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, filmed on location in India by Mickey Lemle.<br><br>The IBFF is presented by SingaporeÂ’s Asian Buddhist Film Festival (ABFF), a newly formed organization dedicated to this emerging cinema arena. Â“The festival has been organized to encourage fresh thinking through contemporary reflections on Buddhist ideas, using the internationally potent medium of film. We want to make these films, some of which are not readily available, more accessible to wider audiences,Â” said Bhavna Vedhara, executive director of ABFF.<br><br>The ABFF is in strategic partnership with Buddhist Film Society (BFS), the independent non-profit educational organization based in Oakland, California that founded the IBFF in 2000. BFSÂ’s Advisory Council includes Philip Glass, Lisa Lu, Richard Gere, Maxine Hong Kingston, Robert Thurman and Alice Walker. The Singapore IBFF comes after successful IBFF presentations in Los Angeles, Washington, D.C. and San Francisco in the US, and Amsterdam in Holland.<br><br>BFS, through its International Buddhist Film Festival and Festival Media distribution service, offers cinema as a vehicle for wider appreciation and better understanding of Buddhism by general audiences, particularly for the remarkable ethnic and cultural diversity evident among Buddhists worldwide today. Â“Many of the filmmakers arenÂ’t Buddhists. TheyÂ’re all artists exploring issues and ideas that are in alignment with any of the wisdom traditions that value compassion. These films can change the way people see the world,Â” said IBFFÂ’s executive director, Gaetano Kazuo Maida, who will be attending.<br><br>Works are chosen through a combination of program committee invitations as well as through international Call For Entries solicitations. The films include English language or subtitled works from all over the world, and embrace a very broad and fluid definition of Â“Buddhist.Â”<br><br>Visit the ABFF website for more information about the IBFF program in Singapore, including screening schedule, locations and ticket sales.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Synopsis of Movies: </span><br><br><strong>1) THE CUP (1999) </strong><br><br>Cast:            Jamyang Lodro, Orgyen Tobgyal, Neten Chokling, Kunsang Nyima<br>Directed by:  Khyentse Norbu<br>Run-time:      94 mins<br>Country:       Bhutan/Australia<br>Genre:          Comedy<br>Website:      <a href="http://www.finelinefeatures.com/thecup/frameset.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.finelinefeatures.com/thecup/frameset.html</a><br><br>Buddhism is their philosophy. Soccer is their religion. A hit at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival, this sweet, engaging comedy is about a group of mischievous, soccer-obsessed child monks determined to smuggle a television set into their monastery so they can watch the World Cup. Featuring wonderful comic turns by a cast of actual monks from the monastery where the movie was shot, this film - the first ever produced in Bhutan - examines the tenets of Buddhism through gentle humour and the awe-inspiring beauty of Bhutan's landscape.<br><br><strong>2) King of the Hill: Won't you Pimai My Neighbour? (2000)</strong><br><br>Creator:    Mike Judge<br>Producer:  John Altschuler and Dave Krinsky<br>Run-time:  22 mins<br>Country:   USA<br>Genre:      Comedy<br>Website:  <a href="http://www.fox.com/kingofthehill/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fox.com/kingofthehill/</a><br><br>A long running animation success on FOX, Bobby is the son of Hank and Peggy Hill, just-folks Americans (often self referenced as "rednecks") living in the suburbs as the world changes rapidly around them. Immigration and contemporary culture challenge them and their friends at every turn. The show thrives on sharp satire and no subject is sacred or spared.<br><br><strong>3) Shower (1999)</strong><br><br>Cast:            Zhu Xu, He Zheng, Pu Cun Xin, Zhang Jin Hao and Jiang Wu<br>Directed by: Zhang Yang<br>Run-time:     95 mins<br>Country:      China<br>Genre:         Drama<br>Website:     <a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/classics/shower/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sonypictures.com/classics/shower/index.html</a><br><br>Set in a neighborhood on the outskirts of modern Beijing, this is the tale of a prodigal son. The elder son returns to the place of his youth and his father's old age - an antique bathhouse that draws the neighborhood men to bathe, gossip, pit cricket fights, quarrel and sing. This is a deceptively simple film wearing the veneer of a family comedy but with real depth. A unique look at how the Buddhist spirit survived China's Cultural Revolution in the hearts of the stubborn and compassionate.<br><br>This film recently won Best Film and Best Director at the Seattle Film Festival.<br><br><strong>4) Enlightenment Guaranteed (2000)</strong><br><br>Cast:            Uwe Ochsenknecht and Gustav-Peter Wohler<br>Directed by:  Doris Dorrie<br>Run-time:     109 mins<br>Country:      Germany<br>Genre:         Comedy<br>Website:      <a href="http://www.german-films.de/app/filmarchive/film_view.php?film_id=331" rel="nofollow">http://www.german-films.de/app/filmarchive/film_view.php?film_id=331 </a><br><br>Having won the Bavarian Film Awards for Best Actor and Best Production in 2000, this delightful fish-out-of-water comedy follows two mismatched brothers - one an uptight family man whose wife just left him, and the other a naÃ¯ve New Age enthusiast - traveling to Japan for a retreat at a Buddhist monastery. After a hilariously disastrous night in Tokyo leaves them broke, confused, and humiliated, the brothers accidentally find themselves fully prepared for their immersion in Buddhist spirituality.</div>

Showcasing a diverse program with the theme Â“Medium of Reflection,Â” the 2007 IBFF features works from nine nations, with seven Singapore premieres.<br><br>The opening night film is the Singapore premiere of the award-winning Shower, by Zhang Yang, from China. A portion of the proceeds from the opening night program will benefit two Singapore charities, The PresidentÂ’s Challenge and ChildrenÂ’s Cancer Foundation, and the guest of honor is SingaporeÂ’s Minister for Health, Mr. Khaw Boon Wan.<br><br>Ranging from dramas and comedies to documentaries and animation, the IBFF includes the Singapore premiere of the recent AFI Festival Grand Jury Prize winner, BuddhaÂ’s Lost Children, a Dutch documentary filmed in Thailand about a former Thai boxer turned Buddhist monk who builds an orphanage, school and clinic--a haven for the children of that strife-ridden region.<br><br>Among the other Singapore premieres are rare screenings of Buddhist-themed episodes of international hit television shows The Simpsons and King of the Hill, along with films from China, Bhutan, India, Canada, England and the US. Several of the filmmakers are traveling to Singapore to be on hand for Q &amp; A sessions following their films. A guest speaker, British-born monk Venerable Ajahn Brahm, will give a talk on Sunday, May 20.<br><br>Three films connected with noted Bhutan-born Tibetan lama Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche will be shown. Two dramatic features he directed, The Cup, and Travellers &amp; Magicians, were filmed on location in India and Bhutan respectively. The third is the Singapore premiere of a documentary by Canadian Leslie Ann Patton, Words of My Perfect Teacher, which follows him from the World Cup in Europe all the way to Bhutan in search of a better understanding of the teacher-student relationship in Tibetan Buddhism.<br><br>The Asian premiere of renowned German director Doris DÃ¶rrieÂ’s new feature-length documentary How to Cook Your Life will be screened on Sunday, May 20. This profile of San Francisco chef, author and Zen priest Edward Espe Brown explores principles of Zen Buddhism as they apply to the preparation of food as well as life itself. The award-winning DÃ¶rrieÂ’s comedy Enlightenment Guaranteed, filmed on location in a Japanese Zen monastery, will be screened on May 19.<br><br>Rounding out the program is the Singapore premiere of Compassion In Exile, the award-winning portrait of the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, filmed on location in India by Mickey Lemle.<br><br>The IBFF is presented by SingaporeÂ’s Asian Buddhist Film Festival (ABFF), a newly formed organization dedicated to this emerging cinema arena. Â“The festival has been organized to encourage fresh thinking through contemporary reflections on Buddhist ideas, using the internationally potent medium of film. We want to make these films, some of which are not readily available, more accessible to wider audiences,Â” said Bhavna Vedhara, executive director of ABFF.<br><br>The ABFF is in strategic partnership with Buddhist Film Society (BFS), the independent non-profit educational organization based in Oakland, California that founded the IBFF in 2000. BFSÂ’s Advisory Council includes Philip Glass, Lisa Lu, Richard Gere, Maxine Hong Kingston, Robert Thurman and Alice Walker. The Singapore IBFF comes after successful IBFF presentations in Los Angeles, Washington, D.C. and San Francisco in the US, and Amsterdam in Holland.<br><br>BFS, through its International Buddhist Film Festival and Festival Media distribution service, offers cinema as a vehicle for wider appreciation and better understanding of Buddhism by general audiences, particularly for the remarkable ethnic and cultural diversity evident among Buddhists worldwide today. Â“Many of the filmmakers arenÂ’t Buddhists. TheyÂ’re all artists exploring issues and ideas that are in alignment with any of the wisdom traditions that value compassion. These films can change the way people see the world,Â” said IBFFÂ’s executive director, Gaetano Kazuo Maida, who will be attending.<br><br>Works are chosen through a combination of program committee invitations as well as through international Call For Entries solicitations. The films include English language or subtitled works from all over the world, and embrace a very broad and fluid definition of Â“Buddhist.Â”<br><br>Visit the ABFF website for more information about the IBFF program in Singapore, including screening schedule, locations and ticket sales.<br></div></blockquote>interested to go watch ,but now no $<br>maybe will go to make Bodhi vow in future set up a Buddhist Movie Hall<br><br>for  Asia Pacific Buddhist Congregation<br><br>Om Ah Hung<br><br></div>
