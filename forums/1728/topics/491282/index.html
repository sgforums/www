              Buddhism, at its base, has "four noble truths." There will be
              suffering. That suffering has a cause. That suffering will end.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">And
              there's a way to get there.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">In
              Leicester - where the population is 0.4 percent Buddhist per the most recent
              census - some soccer fans believe their team has found that path from longtime
              relegation and second-tier status to nirvana: a group of Buddhist monks, a
              ritual, a new karmic balance allowing The Foxes to exceed expectations. It
              seems silly, of course, this conflation of sports and the supernatural. But
              everything about this season is a little silly.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">It's
              important to note that something near-impossible is happening. Leicester City
              currently sits atop the English Premier League standings, five points ahead of
              Tottenham and Arsenal.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Why is
              that notable? Because Leicester started the season at 2500-to-1 odds to win the
              league. For context, the Philadelphia 76ers were 300/1 to win the NBA title
              this year. No team outside of Manchester United, Manchester City, Chelsea or
              Arsenal has won the EPL since 1994-95.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">So what's happening? Better soccer. But another explanation is
              going viral: Leicester's Thai, Buddhist monks.</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";'></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Leicester
              is owned and chaired by Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, a Thai businessman and CEO of
              King Power - a big player on the duty-free market. And it appears
              Srivaddhanaprabha has allowed for an infusion of Thai culture into Leicester -
              and it has taken root. Thai monks have appeared at matches, as well as in The
              Foxes' dressing room.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">But it
              doesn't stop there. And this isn't as new as viral fame (and American
              late-to-the-party storytelling) would have you believe. As early as 2011, the
              Leicester Mercury was crediting the presence of Buddhist monks as a spiritual
              boost for the soccer club. Leicester striker Jamie Vardy told The Telegraph in
              December of 2014 that the club's surge and avoidance of relegation could be, in
              part, attributed to rituals brought into the clubhouse by the Buddhist monks.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">"I
              have to pinch myself all the time about how my career has gone but I certainly
              didn’t expect I’d be visited by monks and covered in holy water,” Vardy said at
              the time. “They come with their water and literally dip it in and then just
              slap you over the head as hard as they can with little sticks.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">"Before
              that United game it was almost like I’d had a bath - heads, shoulders, legs. It
              worked though didn’t it? They need to come back here more often."</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">And for
              Srivaddhanaprabha, it's not just a show. The owner's son, Aiyawatt, took time
              away from the club last year after being ordained at Bangkok's Thepsirin
              Bhuddist Temple.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">"The
              Buddhist monks have been in," Leicester forward David Nugent told the
              Leicester Mercury at the time. "I hope we'll see them more often."</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">And so
              they have. And who can argue with the results? The Foxes - stick-beaten but
              Buddhist-strong - are beating odds.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Of
              course, there is much more at play than the presence of the Buddhist monks, as
              Malaysian national team coach Datuk Ong Kim Swee was quick to point out to The
              Star.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">"You
              cannot rely only on religion to win trophies," he said. "You need to
              work very, very hard. You have to have the belief and hardwork to succeed …
              only then will God help you.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">“At the
              end of the day, if you do not work hard and you expect things to drop in your
              lap, you won’t get it.”</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Be it by
              divine intervention, good karma or, simply, good soccer, Leicester is surging,
              sitting in first just one season removed from finishing 14th. Before that, the
              club spent a decade in the second- and third-tier leagues of English
              professional football.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">That
              suffering - in sports terms - has ended. Rebirth began by avoiding relegation.
              And now, this trip to the top of the standings? That must feel a lot like
              soccer nirvana.</span></p>
