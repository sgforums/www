Peto (Las Vegas, NV USA) - See all my reviews<br>(REAL NAME)   <br>Amazon Verified Purchase(What's this?)<br>This review is from: What the Buddha Taught: Revised and Expanded Edition with Texts from Suttas and Dhammapada (Paperback)<br>The Ven. Dr. Walpola Sri Rahula has produced one of the best texts I have ever read on Buddhism! There are many out there that incorrectly talk about Buddhism and they also have many incorrect interpretations of the Buddha.<br><br>Venerable Rahula does an outstanding job in his correct translations/interpetations of important teachings of Siddhattha.<br><br>The reader is introduced to key Buddhist teachings such as:<br><br>-The Buddhist attitude of Mind<br><br>-The Four Noble Truths (each one having it's own chapter!) And the eightfold path as well as the five aggregates.<br><br>-The doctrine of No-Soul: Anatta. This is one of the most important ones and the author talks about how 'self' is incorrectly being introduced by some authors, etc.<br><br>-Meditation: Everything from a few 'basic' meditation techniques to such things as why meditate...<br><br>-What the Buddha Taught and the World Today: This great section shows how to apply the Buddhas teachings into every day life. There is even the 10 duties of a ruler (Government) which would be great if some politicians read!<br><br>And finally there is 'selected texts' which provide even more insight...it was a refreshing thing to read after the chapters and after reading the book it made sense when reading these selected texts!<br><br>There is even a Glossary to help you understand words used in Buddhism. In fact throughout the book you are introduced to the correct sayings and words...<br><br>All in all you should get this book even if you are already 'into' Buddhism.<br>Help other customers find the most helpful reviews <br>Was this review helpful to you?

It includes translations of selected Buddhist texts and a glossary of Buddhist vocabulary.<br><br>When I first read "What the Buddha Taught" in college, it helped spark my interest in Buddhist practice, and one bit in particular has fundamentally shaped my approach to life and religion (Christianity as well as Buddhism): the story of the man wounded by a poisoned arrow, a parable illustrating the Buddha's utter noninterest in metaphysical speculation and his pragmatic and compassionate focus on liberation from suffering.<br><br>I'd also recommend "Awakening the Buddha Within," an introduction to Buddhist teachings by Lama Surya Das, an American teacher of Tibetan Buddhism. (If you're looking for a "how to" book on meditation, I'd recommend "The Three Pillars of Zen.")<br>Help other customers find the most helpful reviews <br>Was this review helpful to you?

I was born into Buddhism and had practiced, even intensely at times, the Mahaparinirvana Sutra. So I had good experience going into my class. This book answered and made clear many of the questions I had been pondering for many years. It is the definitive book on Buddhism. The Chair of the Buddhism department at Oxford, use to tell us that "What The Buddha Taught" by Walpola Rahula will change the way you think about life and Buddhism. It has. I encourage everyone to buy this jewel of a book. It is rare you find a book so masterfully written.<br>Help other customers find the most helpful reviews <br>Was this review helpful to you?
