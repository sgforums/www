              <p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 11px;">4. Sorry can't find the barrier are harmful theory. I haven't read the site's content for a very long time. I suggested Souldivine to the site because i don't think he is ready or interested in real enlightenment path, but this info gives him something beneficial to work on that is more inline with his intended purpose. Once a person have understood no-self and emptiness, there are paradigm shifts that make these kind of work feels likes working with illusions... like bluffing oneself.</p>

              <p>Ideally, the disturbances should be seen within the framework of non-dual and empty (holographic). Under such a level of mastery everything will seems to be occuring within a non-dual, luminous, empty, transparent 'space'. </p>
              <p>However, i have yet to reach such a level of mastery in a stable manner. But it can be seem that this is the way to go... instead of dealing it as something solid and objectified.</p>
              <p>This is also the way that healing(including soul-retreviel) will progress towards after realisations.</p>

              <p>I am not sure what how each you handle with negative astral entities (refering soul fragments/ghosts) when you do encounter them. Personally, I do have a "standard procedure" which I suggest.</p>
                                      <p>1. First, you will need to have non-dual perception. Meaning, you should not judge people/astral entities as good/evil, right/wrong. You also should not judge emotions as something that need to be suppressed or denied. If an astral entity comes to you, it means either you have done something that attract their attention or you have what it takes to help them move on.</p>
                                      <p>2. If possible, try to ask them questions like : "What is your name?" "Why are you here?" "How can I help?". For me, there is no need to ask how they feel because I can sense how they are feeling. Commonly, they come with either one of these 3 types of emotions: very sad, very angry or very scared.</p>
                   <p>3. Attempt to <strong>accept</strong> them, <strong>forgive</strong> them and <strong>release</strong> them to the light. This is the most compassionate thing you can do to help them move on. Whether it will work or not, I think it depends on whether they like/agree with you or not.</p>
                                      <p>4. If they just come and surprise attack suddenly without giving you a chance to talk, jump to step 5 immediately. In this kind of situation, you will panic and the worst case scenario is that they will attempt to possess your body. You will know you are being possess when you become paralyse or lose control of your astral body. Since they are astral entities, they can only attack your astral body or your mind, and lucky so far, I have not received any physical injuries due to astral entities attack.</p>
                                     
                                      <p>5. Last resort, really cannot resolve by yourself. Call for help from higher beings -<a title="http://www.rainbowjigsaw.com/2011/03/creatorsourcegod-speaks-exorcism.html" href="http://www.rainbowjigsaw.com/2011/03/creatorsourcegod-speaks-exorcism.html">http://www.rainbowjigsaw.com/2011/03/creatorsourcegod-speaks-exorcism.html<br></a> Guan Yin also will/may help you <a title="http://www.rainbowjigsaw.com/2010/03/kuan-yin-speaks-space-clearing-ghosts.html" href="http://www.rainbowjigsaw.com/2010/03/kuan-yin-speaks-space-clearing-ghosts.html">http://www.rainbowjigsaw.com/2010/03/kuan-yin-speaks-space-clearing-ghosts.html</a></p>
                                      <p>6. Lastly, not all ghosts that you encounter are really soul fragments. Some are just thought forms created by some intelligent beings <strong>with the intention to attack/disturb you</strong>. These type, you can just ignore them completely and they will eventually go away.</p>

              <p>There is a need to clarify the different meanings of the term non-duality.</p>
              <p>It has been discussed so many times that i think it should be a stickied topic :)</p>
              <p>Non-duality can be used to describe 'no right or wrong' aka being <strong>non-judgemental</strong>. Because when we can come to a state of non-judgementalness, the mind is not agitated and is thus peaceful, there is often a misconception that this is the state of enlightenment. But this is not entirely correct.</p>
              <p>Non-duality that is used to describe enlightenment is the realisation and experience of '<strong>no subject/object division</strong>'. Subject-object division refers to the typical impression that there is a 'me/self' and there are things outside 'me/self' which the 'me/self' experiences. 'No subject/objection division' thus is the experience where this typical impression does not applies. </p>
              <p>By the time someone realises no-self, he/she would have firstly realised non-duality (<strong>no subject/object division)</strong>. If in experiencing events, there is no 'me' in the experience, then there is only the 'being observed'. In the words of Buddha: "In seeing, there is just seeing. No seer and nothing seen. In hearing, there is just hearing. No hearer and nothing heard."</p>
              <p>Therefore, there is a need to understand the various meanings of non-duality in order to avoid misunderstanding and misinterpretation.</p>
