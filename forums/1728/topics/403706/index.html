              <h1>Original Mind</h1>
              <h3>By Shodo Harada Roshi</h3>
              <p>In Buddhism, its often said that humans’ Original Mind, that 
              Mind 
                            we have at birth, is like a clear mirror, pure and 
              uncluttered, 
                            without shape, form, or color, with nothing in it 
              whatsoever. If 
                            something comes before it, the mirror reflects it exactly,
               but the 
                            mirror itself gives birth to nothing. If what has been 
              reflected 
                            leaves, its image disappears, but the mirror itself loses 
              nothing. 
                            Within the mirror there is no birth, no death. No matter 
              how dirty 
                            a thing that is reflected might be, the mirror doesn’t get
               dirty, 
                            nor does it become beautiful because something beautiful 
              is reflected 
                            in it. Just because additional things are reflected, that 
              doesn’t 
                            mean anything increases in the mirror itself, nor does 
              anything 
                            ever decrease when fewer objects are reflected. A mirror 
              is without 
                            increase or decrease.</p>
              <p>Humans’ pure Original Nature is just this. Without shape,
               form, 
                            or color; without birth and death; not clean or dirty; not
               increasing 
                            or decreasing; not male or female; not young, not old; not
               intelligent, 
                            not stupid; not rich, not poor. There are no words, no 
              explanation 
                            possible, no description that will apply here, only a pure
               mirror-like 
                            base. This is humans’ true quality; this is an actual 
              experience. 
                            From our zazen (sitting meditation), cut all nen 
              (mind-instants), 
                            dig down completely to the source of those nen—dig, dig, 
              dig until 
                            we reach the place where the human character has been 
              totally cleared. 
                            When the source point is reached, this state of Mind can 
              be touched.</p>
              <p>This clear human character, which is like a mirror, 
              can accept 
                            and receive everything, but nothing that is reflected can 
              get stuck 
                            to this mirror. It reflects everything exactly as it is, 
              but the 
                            mirror itself stays untouched. This mirror-like Mind has 
              no sense 
                            of "that’s me" or "that’s him, not me." It has no dualism;
               it makes 
                            no distinctions like that. At that true base, there 
              actually is 
                            no differentiation between self and others. The world that
               is reflected 
                            in—reflected by—that mirror is not one of self and other; 
              it has 
                            no such separation, it accepts everything as one unified 
              whole. 
                            From the origin there is only one world, with no division 
              into "my" 
                            world and "your" world.</p>
              <p>To understand this as an actual fact with your own 
              experience 
                            is the wisdom of the Buddha. From there arises the 
              functioning of 
                            the human Mind that naturally feels another’s pain as 
              one’s own 
                            pain, feels another’s joy as one’s own joy. A warm, 
              encompassing 
                            Mind naturally arises from this wisdom and experience. 
              That is what 
                            is called the compassion of the Buddha.</p>
              <p>If we can realize the source point of our human 
              character, then 
                            naturally all of the world becomes One. Not divided, it is
               encountered 
                            as one unified Whole, a great, expansive, and huge world 
              of One. 
                            Wisdom works here and humans’ joy, suffering, and sadness 
              become 
                            our own joy, suffering, and sadness. It is not somebody 
              else’s joy; 
                            it is one’s very own joy as well. This is how a warm, 
              all-encompassing 
                            Mind becomes naturally revealed and serves as the source 
              of our 
                            action. Simply put, this is what the Buddha meant when he 
              said, 
                            "Seek the light within yourself."</p>

              <div><span style="font-size: small;">At some point we realize the quest to find 
              enlightenment, even the desire to be a Buddhist or whatever, are both 
              just more ego-grasping.  We think that enlightenment is some other state
               than what is presenting Itself in each moment just as It appears 
              already.  We don't see that all feelings, emotions, thoughts, 
              sensations, perceptions and actions are already the pure function of our
               Buddha Nature.  We hope for a better <span id="lw_1271174764_0" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: medium none;">Buddha Nature or 
              Awareness experience</span> than the one we are now having, yet not 
              noticing that this moment just as it is, is already the Ultimate Buddha 
              Nature in full display!  And lastly, whatever reaction you are now 
              having regarding what you are now reading in this email, is also the 
              Buddha Nature arising as those thoughts and impressions!  And even when 
              we don't "know" this...
              that is the Buddha Nature appearing as that "not knowing".  Whichever 
              way you turn there is only "just This".  </span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-size: small;">Don't think that the ego itself is something "other"
               for it too is the Buddha Nature... but in the recognition  of this 
              fact, the ego itself is no where to be found. Where has it gone?  When 
              the ego-self is seen as it truly is, it transforms and reveals itself to
               be pure Wisdom or Awareness, which is its essential nature.  This 
              Wisdom is experienced as a sudden flash of Self Recognition, the Knowing
               of one's True Nature.</span> That flash of Knowing is the essential 
              energy of the ego itself as it dissolves into Emptiness. That energy 
              isn't destroyed but now appears nakedly to be itself Buddha Nature in 
              the form of an arising of Gnosis. That's why all the realized masters 
              say that at the moment of the complete dissolution of ego, they Self 
              Realize.  That realiztion is the released <span style="text-decoration: underline;">energy</span> of the ego 
              complex in total
              dissolution,  experienced as a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">burst</span> of insight, enlightened 
              insight.  That's why in Tantra, nothing is rejected or considered 
              negative because everything is known to be the Buddha Nature when 
              transformed through sadhana or practice. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>In Dzogchen it is taught that it is not even necessary to transform
               energies into their essential basis as Buddha Nature, because even 
              before transformation, all things are already perfect Buddha Nature and 
              require no further transformation to be something they already are...  
              So the practice of Dzogchen is no-practice, by just leaving things as 
              As-is, all is accomplished because the result is our experience just as 
              it is already!  Everything is already the perfect Buddha Nature and it 
              can't be further improved upon!</div>

               his realization that even the quest for enlightenment was just another 
              form of stress and ego-grasping in this video:</span></div>
