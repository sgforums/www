              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 16.0pt;">The Later Buddhist Logic on Causation
              (Pratityasamutpada)</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The usual realistic view of causation implies the
              simultaneous existence of two things of which one operate in producing the
              other. Cause and effect must exist simultaneously at least during some of the
              time. To the realist, the potter and the pot exist simultaneously. To the Buddhist,
              the potter is only a series of point instants. In one of this instant, it is
              followed by the first moment of the series of point instant called a pot. It is
              an impersonal process, they is no enduring Ego’s working on the pot. The cause
              ceased to exist when the effect is produced. To the Buddhist, simultaneous
              existence of cause and effect is not possible. It is only possible when both
              are static and causation is than an imagination.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Existence in Buddhism is a dynamic process, not
              static. What does not work, what is inefficient does not exist. Existence is
              composed of a sequence of point instants which are interdependent. Every point
              instant is a cause for the subsequence point instant. Things cannot be produced
              by another thing. All things and people are momentary existences. There is no
              real motion, because there is no duration. There is no real production as
              production requires time. It is only a limitation of our cognition that we do
              not perceive the distinctness of similar moments and assume that they represent
              substance and duration.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It is an illusion to assume that a thing can exist
              placidly, without acting, and then suddenly rise and produce an action. Whatsoever
              exists is always acting, is always a cause. Existence is change. What is
              non-cause does not exist. It is also a non-reality.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">There are two different realities, a direct one which
              is pure, it is the reality of the point instant and an indirect one attached to
              that point instant. The indirectly one is an image constructed by our imagination
              it is the reality of the empirical object. Consequently there are also two
              different causalities, an ultimate one and an empirical one. The first being
              the efficiency attached to the point instant, the transcendental reality. The
              other, is the object attached to that point instant, an empirical reality of
              limited duration.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">A thing does not produce anything alone. Result come
              into being only when there is a combination of other elements. This totality is
              composed of causes and conditions. To the realists, causation consists of a
              succession of two static things. It is a one-to-one relationship. To the
              Buddhist, there is no destruction or creation of things. There is always the
              present of constant, uninterrupted, infinitely graduated changes going on. A
              result can be produced by human cooperation, but it is just one cause at a
              meeting point of the convergent stream of causes. There is infinite variety of
              circumstances that can influence the production of an event. Needless to said,
              there are some fairly predictable regularities of sequence that can be cognized
              by us in different lines of causation. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">To the Buddhists, empirical existence is a state of
              Bondage comparable to a prison. To the determinist, the Buddha declared that there
              is freewill, free action but there is also responsibility. As to liberty, there
              is also retribution based on the laws of causality. The teaching of karma is
              just one form of causality. Life is a constant movement towards a final
              deliverance. It is this movement, this life that is subjected to strict causal
              laws. When final deliverance has being attained in Nirvana, causation is then
              extinct.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">We can distinguish four main shapes of the theory of
              Causation or Dependent Origination, two from early Buddhism and two others of
              the Mahayana tradition. The early discourses on the Dependent Origination
              doctrine are found in the Suttas. It is describe in a series of twelve or less
              conditioned links with moral bearing where there is bondage and deliverance.
              The general one is found in the later philosophical treatises where all the
              elements are explained and the different line of causation concluded. In early
              Buddhism, the elements exist but are impermanence.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The Mahayana interpretation of the doctrine of Dependent
              Origination is quite different. In the first period, interdependence means
              relativity. Relativity means the unreality of the separate elements as each
              element only arises when the right causes and conditions are present. The
              elements are nothing by themselves. The twelve conditioned links of Dependent
              Origination is declared as a reference to phenomenal life only. The general
              theory of causation is likewise declared as conditional and unreal as well. Thus,
              there is no plurality, no differentiation, no beginning and no end. The cosmos is
              only a motionless illusive reality. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In the last period of the idealistic and logical school
              of Mahayana development, the Dependent Origination doctrine is concluded by
              Santiraksita as follows: ‘I salute the Buddha who has proclaimed the principle
              of Dependent Origination, according to which everything is kinetic, there is no
              God, no matter, no substance, no quality etc., but there is strict conformity
              between every fact and its result… Dependent Origination here means motion, a
              Cosmos which is essentially kinetic.  In
              both these periods, non-duality and emptiness becomes the central theme of the
              teaching of Causation of the Mahayana tradition. </span></p>

              <p style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The Buddhist theory of momentariness implies that every duration in time consists of point-instants following on one another. Every extension in space consists of point instants arising in very close nearness and in very rapid succession to each other giving the impression of stability to things we detect. </span></p>
              <p style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">It is like the electricity that operates the lightings in our house that cause it to emit light. The electrical supply is operating at a speed of 50 cycles per second. But our eyes are only able to detect it as stable continuous stream, an illusion, instead seeing it flickering in flashes. <span> </span></span></p>
              <p style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">When we talk about time, we are referring to duration and when we talk about space, it is the extension of this duration. Both these terms refer to a thing that is in the past. It is only considered to be real in a conventional, empirical world. The realist considered both time and space as two all embracing receptacles containing each of them the entire universe. </span></p>
              <p style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In early Buddhism, space is a real element. The later Buddhist logicians do not consider it to be real. Only subtle time of the point instants is real, to them, space and gross time are not two separate entities. What does not work, meaning if they are not efficient, they do not exists. Space and time cannot be separated from the things that exist in them. There is causality, there is dependent origination here. </span></p>
