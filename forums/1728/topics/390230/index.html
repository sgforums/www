              <p>What if the Buddha upon his Enlightenment finds that what he realised was too profound for the people to understand, and he did not turn the wheel of Dharma?! </p>
              <hr>
              <h1>THE BRAHMA'S REQUEST</h1>
              <p>THE Blessed One having attained Buddhahood while resting under the shepherd's Nigrodha tree on the banks of the river Neranjara, pronounced this solemn utterance:</p>
              <p>"How sure his pathway in this wood,<br>Who follows truth's unchanging call!<br>How blessed, to be kind and good,<br>And practice self-restraint in all!<br>How light, from passion to be free,<br>And sensual joys to let go by!<br>And yet his greatest bliss will be<br>When he has quelled the pride of 'I'.</p>
              <p>"I have recognized the deepest truth, which is sublime and peace-giving' but difficult to understand; for most men move in a sphere of worldly interests and find their delight in worldly desires. The worldling will not understand the doctrine, for to him there is happiness in selfhood only, and the bliss that lies in a complete surrender to truth is unintelligible to him. He will call resignation what to the enlightened mind is the purest joy. He will see annihilation where the perfected one finds immortality. He will regard as death what the conqueror of self knows to be life everlasting. The truth remains hidden from him who is in the bondage of hate and desire. Nirvana remains incomprehensible and mysterious to the vulgar whose minds are beclouded with worldly interests. Should I preach the doctrine and mankind not comprehend it, it would bring me only fatigue and trouble."</p>
              <p>Mara, the Evil One, on hearing the words of the Blessed Buddha, approached and said: "Be greeted, thou Holy One. Thou hast attained the highest bliss and it is time for thee to enter into the final Nirvana."</p>
              <p>Then Brahma Sahampati descended from the heavens and, having worshiped the Blessed One, said: "Alas! the world must perish, should the Holy One, the Tathagata, decide not to teach the Dharma. Be merciful to those that struggle; have compassion upon the sufferers; pity the creatures who are hopelessly entangled in the snares of sorrow. There are some beings that are almost free from the dust of worldliness. If they hear not the doctrine preached, they will be lost. But if they hear it, they will believe and be saved."</p>
              <p>The Blessed One, full of compassion, looked with the eye of a Buddha upon all sentient creatures, and he saw among them beings whose minds were but scarcely covered by the dust of worldliness, who were of good disposition and easy to instruct. He saw some who were conscious of the dangers of lust and wrong doing. And the Blessed One said to Brahma Sahampati: "Wide open be the door of immortality to all who have ears to hear. May they receive the Dharma with faith."</p>
              <p>Then the Blessed One turned to Mara, saying: "I shall not pass into the final Nirvana, O Evil One, until there be not only brethren and sisters of an Order, but also lay disciples of both sexes, who shall have become true hearers, wise, well trained, ready and learned, versed in the scriptures, fulfilling all the greater and lesser duties, correct in life, walking according to the precepts-until they, having thus themselves learned the doctrine, shall be able to give information to others concerning it, preach it, make it known, establish it, open it, minutely explain it, and make it clear-until they, when others start vain doctrines, shall be able to vanquish and refute them, and so to spread the wonderworking truth abroad. I shall not die until the pure religion of truth shall have become successful, prosperous, widespread, and popular in all its full extent-until, in a word, it shall have been well proclaimed among men!"</p>
              <p>Then Brahma Sahampati understood that the Blessed One had granted his request and would preach the doctrine.</p>

              <p>There may others who think differently .I believe it is more of an emphasis of aspiration than anything else. Was'nt the Buddha a Noble Bodhisattva, before his Parinirvana, turn the wheel of Dharma.</p>

              <p>what the Buddha has taught, whether arhatship or bodhisatvva, are Truths. its a matter of choices really. if you strive for arhatship or bodhistavva, its up to you really, as the path for both are different. you need many aeons to practise your perfections if you strive for bodhisatvvahood. so is striving for arhatship inferior?

              <p>For myself, it is easier to practice Mahayana Vehicle as a layman, concept of selflessness in outward compassion is easier to practise, and were it not because of Mahayana Buddhism, would I have even become a Buddhist at all?! </p>
              <p>Arahatship is the path of the Sons of the Conqueror, I have the utmost respect for them!</p>
              <p>To follow their path entails renunciation, which I am not ready to do!</p>

              <p>I may have been wrong, but the most effective method advocated by Buddha himself is still monkhood.</p>
              <p>Anyway, one of the 14 root downfalls of the Bodhisattva Vows is:-</p>
              <p>"Causing the Shravaka family to abandon completely their vows of self liberation(pratimoksha)  and embrace the Mahayana without any special purpose"</p>
              <p>Another vow:-</p>

              <p>The fundamental difference is the treatment of defilements, anger,lust etc., Theravada attitude towards them are to see them as negative. While Mahayana embrace them, or rather as positive to order to experience and understand them.  </p>
