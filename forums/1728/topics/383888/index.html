              <p>SUMEDHA, the wise man inherited a vast fortune from his parents who left
               them upon their deaths. Realizing the unsatisfactoriness he gave away 
              his fortune and became an ascetic in the forest. He soon gained mastery 
              in meditation and was well known for his supernormal powers.<br> <br></p>

              of Rammavati, he took part in preparing the road for the Buddha. He was 
              still repairing it when the Buddha arrived but he was determined to 
              complete it by prostrating himself into the muddy hollow, in fulfillment
               of his vow to become a Buddha. Beside him was a young lady named 
              Sumitta bearing eight stalks of lotus flowers. She gave the Ascetic five
               stalks and kept for herself three stalks for her own aspiration. When 
              the Buddha Dipankara saw this, He omnisciently declared the Ascetic 
              Sumedha a future Buddha, while He stated that the aspiring young lady 
              Sumitta would be his constant companion and helpmate.<br> <br></p>

              Pajapati Gotami , who was His former foster mother desirous of joining 
              the Order, approached the Buddha who was then, residing at Kapilavathu 
              and begged permission for women to be admitted into the Order. After 
              hearing and turning down their pleas, Buddha returned to Vesali for the 
              Rains Retreat . Undaunted by the rebuff, Maha Pajapati Gotami cut off 
              her hair and wearing yellow garments went on foot to Vesali, accompanied
               by many other Sakyan ladies. They stood outside the porch of the 
              Pinnacled Great Hall in Mahayana where the Buddha was residing. 
              Interceded by Venerable Ananda , the Buddha finally consented to 
              establish the Bhikkhuni Sasana when Maha Pajapati Gotami and other 
              Sakyan ladies agreed to observe the Eight Disciplinary Rules for nuns. 
              Henceforth Maha Pajapati Gotami and other Sakyan ladies were admitted 
              into the Order.<br> Later, the Nuns Khema and Uppalavanna were appointed the two Chief 
              female Disciples; as were Sariputta and Moggalana the two Chief Male

              Ahimsa. His jealous fellow students poisoned the mind of their teacher 
              against him. As a result the teacher asked Ahimsa for a garland of one 
              thousand right index fingers as tuition fee. Eager to discharge his 
              obligation, he went into the Jalini forest in Kosala and started to 
              waylay the passing travellers to collect an index finger from the right 
              hand of each victim. The garland was almost completed except for one 
              more single finger. Ahimsa decided to kill even his own mother for the 
              sake of completing the one thousandth finger in the garland. However, 
              Ahimsa was intercepted by the Compassionate Buddha who came to his aid. 
              After listening to His preaching and being convinced, Ahimsa now known 
              as Angulimala (garland of fingers ) joined the Sangha and became a 
              Bhikkhu (monk) . The Angulimala Sutta, a discourse ascribed to this

              and spewing hot poisonous smoke to prevent the Buddha and his disciples 
              from reaching lake Anotatta. Thereupon Maha Moggalana, (the second Chief
               Disciple) at once transformed himself into a dragon and likewise coiled
               round the mountain, crushing Nandopananda. Watched by the Buddha and 
              His disciples, Maha Moggalana too began spewing hot poisonous smoke 
              which greatly distressed Nandopananda who soon lost the challenge and 
              upon realization of his folly, sought refuge in the Triple Gem of 
              Buddhism.<br> <br></p>
