              <p>I too have read his books, in addition to many of those by many Eastern authors (relative to where I'm from in the UK). To save you a long journey and alot of time (whilst accepting that this is only my view and isn't perhaps "Truth"), the questions I've been left with are as follows:</p>
              <p>1)     Where would most of us have found the concepts of God - or Zen - or enlightenment if they had not been given to us by our Teachers, Priests and Peers who only have as much authority as we place in them - or otherwise? How else would you or I have stumbled upon these concepts? We CHOOSE OURSELVES whether to believe these people. We don't <em>KNOW </em>that they really know anything other than us - otherwise religious leaders of all faiths and the like would be in agreement. It is largly through respect that we follow the teachings of our peers . So, firstly, we are told to chase a rainbow that we don't even know actually exists and then our own minds - the ones that must've actually decided to place  some authority in these teachings - start either running after them or attempting to worhip them. Therefore, are we merely chasing a projection of our own minds in the hope that we'll attain some "thing?" No offence is intended with this question. I might be a 'westerner' but I have given a lot of serious thought to all this.</p>

              <p>First of all I would like to say that I find Eckhart Tolle's books to be very transformative and inspiring. I still refer back to some of the pointers in it from time to time, just a reminder of the ever-present Nowness/Presence. I would recommend it to those who have not read his books -- even non-Buddhists, since it is written in a non-religious context yet embraces the truths of all the world's contemplative traditions.</p>
              <p>Now regarding meditation, it should be noted that it is not the length of one's meditation that determines the quality and success of that meditation.</p>
              <p>As Ajahn Chah replied,</p>
              <p><em>Q: Is it necessary to sit for very long stretches? </em></p>
              <p><em>Answer: No, sitting for hours on end is not necessary. Some people think that the longer you can sit, the wiser you must be. I have seen chickens sit on their nests for days on end! Wisdom comes from being mindful in all postures. Your practice should begin as you awaken in the morning. It should continue until you fall asleep. Don't be concerned about how long you can sit. What is important is only that you keep watchful whether you are working or sitting or going to the bathroom. Each person has his own natural pace. Some of you will die at age fifty, some at age sixty-five, and some at age ninety. So, too, your practice will not be all identical. Don't think or worry about this. Try to be mindful and let things take their natural course. Then your mind will become quieter and quieter in any surroundings. It will become still like a clear forest pool. Then all kinds of wonderful and rare animals will come to drink at the pool. You will see clearly the nature of all things (sankharas) in the world. You will see many wonderful and strange things come and go. But you will be still. Problems will arise and you will see through them immediately. This is the happiness of the Buddha. </em></p>
              <p>But certainly 30 min to 1 hour of sitting meditation every day is recommendable everyday, but beginners may start with something less. But in any case 'quality' is more important than the 'length' of meditation. 1 hour of non-mindful meditation amounts to little or nothing. Eckhart Tolle himself recommends spending time each day practicing inner body or breathe awareness meditation.</p>
              <p>On the other hand there's a Zen story which goes:</p>
              <p><em><span style="font-family: Tahoma;" lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Tahoma; font-size: normal;">Day after day Ma-tsu sat in meditation, until his Master
                                              finally questioned him about it. Ma-tsu explained that he was hoping to attain
                                              Buddhahood. The Master picked up a piece of tile and began to rub it with a
                                              stone. When Ma-tsu asked him what he was doing, he replied that he was
                                              polishing the tile to make it a mirror.<br> "How can you polish a tile into a
                                              mirror?" </span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma; font-size: normal;">Ma-tsu asked.<br> </span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;" lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Tahoma; font-size: normal;">"How can one become a buddha by sitting in meditation?" the
                                              Master shot back</span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';" lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Tahoma; font-size: normal;">.</span></span></em></p>
              <p>Even though meditation is very important, we should not view it as a gradual way of seeking to 'contact' spirit. Our Buddha-Nature is not something that can be reached after periods of practice, it has never been lacking nor will it gain anything after realisation -- it is already fully complete, right here and now. We only 'overlook' it but it is actually very obvious and intimate, like space, but our attention always 'absorbs' in the particular (i.e. attached and identified to our thoughts, emotions and feelings) and overlook the obvious and simple. Our ever-present Presence is never lost at any single moment, and if we do meditation to seek Spirit instead of noticing the Obvious, then we are like sitting on a bull searching for the bull. We should not seek anything (including 'enlightenment' which is just our mental projection arising from the false notion of a 'separate self' that can 'have' an 'enlightenment experience').</p>
              <p>Just notice Presence Awareness and rest in that. It is always here and can be noticed at all moments, that is why 'spontaneous awakenings' can occur. Presence being Ever-Present is not the result of a gradual process -- though through practice we rest in Presence more frequently and easily and automatically/effortlessly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Eckhart Tolle may not have done formal sitting meditation, but his intense suffering (almost to the point of suicide) led him to deeply inquire 'Who am I'? That inquiry finally resolved all doubts and he gained an intuitive insight into his true nature.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is the mental 'dialogue' that happened right before his realisation:<em></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: normal;"><br> ‘I cannot live with myself any longer.’ This was the thought that kept
                                                                                                  repeating itself in my mind. Then suddenly I became aware of what a
                                                                                                  peculiar thought it was. ‘Am I one or two? If I cannot live with
                                                                                                  myself, there must be two of me: the ‘I’ and the ‘self’ that ‘I’ cannot
                                                                                                  live with.’ ‘Maybe,’ I thought, ‘only one of them is real.’</span></em></p>
              <p>It should be noted another case of spontaneous awakening, Ramana Maharshi, who experienced rigor mortis and similarly did self-inquiry that led to his spontaneous awakening at 16.</p>
              <p>Our forum moderator Thusness also did the 'Who am I' inquiry for some time, and then one day realised pure presence. (see <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html</a>) But even that is just an initial realisation, the start of the path to greater unfolding of insights into the nature of reality or Presence.</p>
              <p>Therefore, we should not make the mistake of thinking that the experience Eckhart Tolle had on that day, or Ramana Maharshi, or anyone, is the 'final experience'.</p>
              <p>Also, for most people even though there are glimpses of the ever-present Presence, it usually takes a period of 'settling in'. For example in the account of awakening of Candice,</p>
              <p style="padding-left: 10.5px; padding-right: 10.5px; text-indent: 1.8em; text-align: justify;">"<em>She then went through an profound personal crisis which led her

              <p>Even Eckhart Tolle talked about deepening of his experience over the course of years after his initial experience. People like Ramana Maharshi (I've read somewhere) also talked about this.</p>
              <p>Douglas Harding author of "On Having No Head: Zen and the Rediscovery of the Obvious" also said:</p>
              <p><em>"while this simple in-seeing is potentially all we have claimed for it (and much more), it is actually -- for almost everybody -- just another passing experience among the myriads that go to make up a human life. You couldn't even call it a first step along the Way; or, if you could, it's the sort of first step that doesn't count. Some, however, do go on."</em></p>
              <p><em>"Now the 'hard' part begins, which is the repetition of this headless seeing-into-Nothingness till the seeing becomes quite natural and nothing special at all; till, whatever one is doing, it's clear that nobody's here doing it."</em></p>
              <p><em>"At first, the essential practice requires much effort of attention. Normally, one takes years or decades to arrive at anything like steady and spontaneous in-seeing. Nevertheless, the method is quite simple and the same throughout. It consists of ceasing to overlook the looker -- or rather, the absence of the looker. Some find the practice very hard going for a very long time. Others -- notably younger seers who have devoted fewer years and less effort to building the fictitious person at the centre of their universe -- take to it more readily."</em></p>

                          seems to be a notion that enlightenment is just one final state. Many
                          also believe that when one has certain transcendental or mystical
                          experience, that experience is final and complete. This assumption is
                          perhaps popularised by the classic stories of enlightenment that are
                          widely known. Also there is much granduer associated with this notion
                          of Enlightenment which, in my opinion, is totally overhyped and
                          uncalled for.</p>

              <p class="style4">My opinion is that 
                                              enlightenment is not just one 'standard' final state but is a gradual and progressive 
                                              establishing of states of consciousness. The process is a 
                                              succesive unfoldment and transformation, leading to increasingly clear understanding 
                                              of the dynamics of consciousness. So perhaps, enlightenment 
                                              as described by various persons and traditions can be referring to different 
                                              states of consciousness.<br> <br> I, myself have not reach the end of the road. But from years 
                                              on a spiritual path, I can confidently say that enlightenment 
                                              happens in a series or stages of self-realisations and self-discoveries. 
                                              There are, in fact, more than one type of transcendental or 
                                              mystical experience.<br> <br> Almost all stages of enlightenment can be said to be associated 
                                              with states of Presence. However, the Presence comes in various 
                                              degrees of clarity and intensity. The degree of intensity 
                                              is directly dependent on the level and depth of one's clarity 
                                              as well as one's realisations/discoveries.</p>
              <p class="style4">Usually there is a difference between an initial 
                                              awakening and a later stabilisation of that stage.<br> <br> Also, as one progresses along, the relationship or connections 
                                              of oneself to the universe and existence in general also becomes 
                                              clearer.<br> <br> Below is an attempt to illustrate the stage-based characteristic 
                                              of enlightenment:<br> <br> When one first begin meditating, one may have an initial experience 
                                              of <a href="http://www.dreamdatum.com/who-are-we.html">all-pervading Presence</a>. This Presence, is most often experienced 
                                              when thoughts are momentarily suspended. This Presence which 
                                              exists in the timeless Present Moment is our true characteristic 
                                              or nature.<br> <br> However such an experience can only be classified as an initial awakening 
                                              to the true nature.. which ironically have no sense of being 
                                              an individual self. This is because, after the meditation, 
                                              the Presence seems to have disappeared. One cannot understand 
                                              and find the connection of Presence to our everyday life. 
                                              Because of that, one will have difficulties re-acquiring the Presence. 
                                              And it takes many stages and series of realisation to understand 
                                              the relationship of Presence to our phenomenal world. It can 
                                              be said that the prolonged sustaining of Presence is dependent 
                                              upon the stages and depth of realisation.<br> <br> Also, during the earlier stages we may mistaken another state to be the
                          pure pristine presence. For example, we may mistaken 'I AM' or the
                          Eternal Witness for pure presence. This is because the thinking mind
                          has created a seemingly constant image of Pure Presence. This image is
                          the I AM or Eternal Witness, as it is commonly described. Basically, at
                          this stage, the true characteristic of Presence is not being clearly
                          understood.<br> <br> Usually, in order to pass through the so-called 'I AM' stage, 
                                              the person must move towards even deeper understandings of 
                                              consciousness. These understandings may include realising 
                                              that one's sense of self or <a href="http://www.dreamdatum.com/doer-beingdone.html">personality 
                                              is not the doer or controller of action</a>. This realisation 
                                              allows one to loosen the 'sense of self's compulsive grip 
                                              and in the process, a state of NOWness can be experienced. 
                                              By NOWness, I am referring to a peaceful state where the mind 
                                              is not chasing after thoughts but rather is abiding in the 
                                              Present Moment.</p>

                                              stage may persist for sometime before the person realises 
                                              the <a href="http://www.dreamdatum.com/subject-object.html">illusion of subject-object 
                                              division</a>.
                          This stage involves discovering and recognising the hypnotic impression
                          of there being an observer (which is oneself) and the being observed.
                          Typically, this is where one begins to see through the illusionary
                          nature of our phenomenal world. This entire band of realisation stage
                          is often known as non-dual experience or non-duality.
                          After the intial experiences of non-duality, the person may reach a
                          even more profound realisation. This is the realisation that everything
                          that is being experienced is truely spontaneously manifesting. This
                          realisation is more subtle than the previous realisation and represents
                          a major leap in understanding.</p>
              <p class="style4">Also, in the further stages of the enlightenment 
                                              process, there are experiences of increasing brightness to 
                                              one's consciousness. This brightness is the result of mind's 
                                              deconstruction which allows for intense penetration into consciousness.</p>

                                              described here, nevertheless, one can still see from the above 
                                              description that enlightenment is not so straight-forward

              <p>So as you can see, enlightenment isn't a 'one final event' but a gradual unfoldment of insights.</p>
              <p>Now in the case of Eckhart Tolle, his experience and teachings is still on the 'I AM' -- he teaches that we are not our thoughts, we are the eternal Witness/Watcher of our thoughts. He teaches that we are not the transient, but the eternal void background underneath all forms that comes and goes. That is the experience of "I AM" -- the sense of presence-being-awareness that stays forever as the aware-void ground reality that give rises to all things and into which all things return, yet itself unmoved. He has undoubtedly experienced 'Stage 1' and 'Stage 2' of Thusness's Six Stages of Experience: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html</a></p>
              <p>However, this is still not the full insight. Further insights will clarify that Consciousness can never be separated from manifestation. In seeing there is always only the seen, no seer. In hearing only sounds, no hearer. In thinking there is no watcher of thoughts nor thinker -- only thoughts.</p>
              <p>Each thought, sound, phenomena, are all self-luminous, 'knowing' phenomena. No watcher needed, the process itself knows and rolls as Venerable Buddhaghosa writes in the Visuddhi Magga. One no longer sinks back to a source or a void background, because it is seen that All Manifestation/Appearance is the Source. There is no 'one' behind it all -- no one 'watching', only the self-luminous display of appearances. This also explains the difference between Hinduism's Atman-Brahman (Self = God) and Buddhism's Anatta (No-Self).</p>
              <p>Further insights will clarify that not only is the nature of reality empty of a self/observer/subject, all phenomena are also empty, and dependently originated. (Stage 6 of Thusness's Six Stages of Experience)</p>

              <p>I too have read his books, in addition to many of those by many
                          Eastern authors (relative to where I'm from in the UK). To save you
                          a long journey and alot of time (whilst accepting that this is only
                          my view and isn't perhaps "Truth"), the questions I've been left
                          with are as follows:</p>
              <p>1)     Where would most of us have found the
                          concepts of God - or Zen - or enlightenment if they had not been
                          given to us by our Teachers, Priests and Peers who only have as
                          much authority as we place in them - or otherwise? How else would
                          you or I have stumbled upon these concepts? We CHOOSE OURSELVES
                          whether to believe these people. We don't <em>KNOW</em> that they
                          really know anything other than us - otherwise religious leaders of
                          all faiths and the like would be in agreement. It is largly through
                          respect that we follow the teachings of our peers . So, firstly, we
                          are told to chase a rainbow that we don't even know actually exists
                          and then our own minds - the ones that must've actually decided to
                          place  some authority in these teachings - start either
                          running after them or attempting to worhip them. Therefore, are we
                          merely chasing a projection of our own minds in the hope that we'll
                          attain some "thing?" No offence is intended with this question. I
                          might be a 'westerner' but I have given a lot of serious thought to
                          all this.</p>

              <p>Something that might 'clarify' your doubts:</p>
              <p><a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/05/some-writings-on-non-duality-by-ken.html">Some Writings on Non-duality by Ken Wilber</a></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 100%;">(excerpt)</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 100%;"><br>There are many things that I can
                      doubt, but I cannot doubt my own consciousness in this moment. My
                      consciousness IS, and even if I tried to doubt it, it would be my
                      consciousness doubting. I can imagine that my senses are being
                      presented with a fake reality – say, a completely virtual reality or
                      digital reality, which looks real but is merely a series of extremely
                      realist images. But even then, I cannot doubt the consciousness that is
                      doing the watching…<br><br>The very undeniability of my present
                      awareness, the undeniability of my consciousness, immediately delivers
                      to me a certainty of existence in this moment, a certainty of Being in
                      the now-ness of this moment. I cannot doubt consciousness and Being in
                      this moment, for it is the ground of all knowing, all seeing, all
                      existing…<br><br>Who am I? Ask that question over and over again, deeply. Who am I? What is it in me that is conscious of everything?<br><br>If
                      you think that you know Spirit, or if you think you don’t, Spirit is
                      actually that which is thinking both of those thoughts. So you can
                      doubt the objects of consciousness, but you can never believably doubt
                      the doubter, never really doubt the Witness of the entire display.
                      Therefore, rest in the Witness, whether it is thinking that it knows
                      God or not, and that witnessing, that undeniable immediacy of
                      now-consciousness, is itself God, Spirit, Buddha-mind. The certainty
                      lies in the pure self-felt Consciousness to which objects appear, not
                      in the objects themselves. You will never, never, never see God,
                      because God is the Seer, not any finite, mortal, bounded object that
                      can be seen…<br><br>This pure I AM state is not hard to achieve but
                      impossible to escape, because it is ever present and can never really
                      be doubted. You can never run from Spirit, because Spirit is the
                      Runner. To put it very bluntly, Spirit is not hard to find but
                      impossible to avoid: it is that which is looking at this page right
                      now. Can’t you feel That One? Why on earth do you keep looking for God
                      when God is actually the Looker?<br><br>Simply ask, Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?<br><br>I
                      am aware of my feelings, so I am not my feelings – Who am I? I am aware
                      of my thoughts, so I am not my thoughts – Who am I? Clouds float by in
                      the sky, thoughts float by in the mind, feelings float by in the body –
                      and I am none of those because I can Witness them all.<br><br>Moreover,
                      I can doubt that clouds exist, I can doubt that feelings exist, I can
                      doubt that objects of thought exist – but I cannot doubt that the
                      Witness exists in this moment, because the Witness would still be there
                      to witness the doubt.<br><br>I am not objects in nature, not feelings
                      in the body, not thoughts in the mind, for I can Witness them all. I am
                      that Witness – a vast, spacious, empty, clear, pure, transparent
                      Openness that impartially notices all that arises, as a mirror
                      spontaneously reflects all its objects…<br><br>You can already feel
                      some of this Great Liberation in that, as you rest in the ease of
                      witnessing this moment, you already feel that you are free from the
                      suffocating constriction of mere objects, mere feelings, mere thoughts
                      – they all come and go, but you are that vast, free, empty, open
                      Witness of them all, untouched by their torments and tortures.<br><br>This
                      is actually the profound discovery of… the pure divine Self, the
                      formless Witness, causal nothingness, the vast Emptiness in which the
                      entire world arises, stays a bit, and passes. And you are That. You are
                      not the body, not the ego, not nature, not thoughts, not this, not that
                      – you are a vast Emptiness, Freedom, Release, and Liberation.<br><br>With
                      this discovery… you are halfway home. You have disidentified from any
                      and all finite objects; you rest as infinite Consciousness. You are
                      free, open, empty, clear, radiant, released, liberated, exalted,
                      drenched in a blissful emptiness that exists prior to space, prior to
                      time, prior to tears and terror, prior to pain and mortality and
                      suffering and death. You have found the great Unborn, the vast Abyss,
                      the unqualifiable Ground of all that is, and all that was, and all that
                      ever shall be.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">But why is that only halfway home? </span>Because
                      as you rest in the infinite ease of consciousness, spontaneously aware
                      of all that is arising, there will soon enough come the great
                      catastrophe of Freedom and Fullness: the Witness itself will disappear
                      entirely, and instead of witnessing the sky, you are the sky; instead
                      of touching the earth, you are the earth; instead of hearing the
                      thunder, you are the thunder. You and the entire Kosmos because One
                      Taste – you can drink the Pacific Ocean in a single gulp, hold Mt.
                      Everest in the palm of your hand; supernovas swirl in your heart and
                      the solar system replaces your head…<br><br>You are One Taste, the
                      empty mirror that is one with any and all objects that arise in its
                      embrace, a mindlessly vast translucent expanse: infinite, eternal,
                      radiant beyond release. And you… are… That…<br><br>So the primary
                      Cartesian dualism – which is simply the dualism between… in here and
                      out there, subject and object, the empty Witness and all things
                      witnessed – is finally undone and overcome in nondual One Taste. Once
                      you actually and fully contact the Witness, then – and only then – can
                      it be transcended into radical Nonduality, and halfway home becomes
                      fully home, here in the ever-present wonder of what is…<br><br>And so
                      how do you know that you have finally and really overcome the Cartesian
                      dualism? Very simple: if you really overcome the Cartesian dualism,
                      then you no longer feel that you are on this side of your face looking
                      at the world out there. There is only the world, and you are all of
                      that; you actually feel that you are one with everything that is
                      arising moment to moment. You are not merely on this side of your face
                      looking out there. “In here” and “out there” have become One Taste with
                      a shuddering obviousness and certainty so profound it feels like a
                      five-ton rock just dropped on your head. It is, shall we say, a feeling
                      hard to miss.<br><br>At that point, which is actually your ever-present
                      condition, there is no exclusive identity with this particular
                      organism, no constriction of consciousness to the head, a constriction
                      that makes it seem that “you” are in the head looking at the rest of
                      the world out there; there is no binding of attention to the personal
                      bodymind: instead, consciousness is one with all that is arising – a
                      vast, open, transparent, radiant, infinitely Free and infinitely Full
                      expanse that embraces the entire Kosmos, so that every single subject
                      and every single object are erotically united in the Great Embrace of
                      One Taste. You disappear from merely being behind your eyes, and you
                      become the All, you directly and actually feel that your basic identity
                      is everything that is arising moment to moment (just as previously you
                      felt that your identity was with this finite, partial, separate, mortal
                      coil of flesh you call a body). Inside and outside have become One
                      Taste. I tell you, it can happen just like that!<br><br>(Source:

              <p>Just my opinion only,</p>
              <p>I think Eckhart Tolle may have been suffering alot and suddenly he 'let go' of trying to work out his problems. This results in a dissociation from thoughts which give rise to the experience of Presence.</p>
              <p>To me,  'I AM' is an experience of Presence, it is just that only one aspect of Presence is experienced which is the 'all-pervading' aspect. The non-dual and emptiness aspect are not experienced.. Because non-dual is not realised (at I AM stage), a person may still use effort in an attempt to 'enter' the Presence. This is because, at the I AM stage, there is an erroneous concept that there is a relative world make up of thoughts AND there is an 'absolute source' that is watching it. The I AM stage person will make attempts to 'dissociated from the relative world' in order to enter the 'absolute source'.</p>
              <p>However, at Non-dual (&amp; further..) stage understanding, one have understood that the division into a relative world and an absolute source has NEVER occcured and cannot be... Thus no attempt/effort is truly required.</p>

              <p>Well explained... thanks for the sharing.</p>
              <p>Thusness has also said before the different six stages are related to degrees of effortlessness... even stage 4, 5 and 6 are about the degrees of effortlessness.</p>
              <p>Thusness: 'For such an understanding and insight, Awareness should not only be only 
                          non-dual, all points of manifestation must also be effortless.'</p>
              <p>'From stage 4 to 6 is all about non-dual, it is just the degree of 
                                  effortlessness.'</p>
              <p>'you must see that non-dual is already experience from stage 4
              onwards and from there on, it is the degree of 'effortlessness' that
              counts.'</p>
              <p>'in stage 5, it is already almost effortless in non-dual presence, but insight of emptiness and DO helps so much in 'effortless' of non-dual in 
                              sync view with experience'</p>
              <p>--------</p>
              <p><br> <span>(9:52 PM)</span> Thusness: for it is the tendency to
                  divide due to our inherent view that continously prevent us from
                  being effortless.</p>
              <p><span>(9:53 PM)</span> Thusness: it is
                  also the replacement of this view totally by one that can
                  completely use to articulate this non-dual experience that will
                  non-dual experience effortless.        </p>
              <p><span>(9:54 PM)</span> Thusness: However if a practitioner
                  has not experienced non-dual to quite an extend, it is difficult to
                  appreciate.</p>
              <p><span>(9:55 PM)</span> Thusness: That is how I
                  put it at stage 6.  Stage 6 is to enhance stage 5
                  non-dual present to make it completely effortless.</p>
              <p><span>(9:55 PM)</span> Thusness: But many will not understand and
                  there is no point explaining.</p>

              <p>I would like to add on to what Longchen said... about dissociation leading to the realisation of pure presence.</p>
              <p>Self-inquiry, such as that done by Eckhart Tolle (in his enlightenment story), Ramana Maharshi, Thusness's Stage 1, and so on, when done will lead to a total dissociation from all thoughts and phenomena.</p>
              <p>By questioning "Who am I", or "Before Birth, Who am I" and not answering verbally (the answers cannot be found there), but rather by dissociating from every single thought and phenomena including the thoughts of who we are as "neti, neti" or "not this, not this", we begin to sense Presence as the timeless, spaceless unmanifest that is prior to birth, prior to all thoughts and feelings. One realises one's nature as a primordial purity, that "I am not anything [object] in particular, but I am". That is why Eckhart said talked about entering into a void that is in himself, after his realisation -</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: x-small;"><em><br> ‘I cannot live with myself any longer.’ This was the thought that kept
              repeating itself in my mind. Then suddenly I became aware of what a
              peculiar thought it was. ‘Am I one or two? If I cannot live with
              myself, there must be two of me: the ‘I’ and the ‘self’ that ‘I’ cannot
              live with.’ ‘Maybe,’ I thought, ‘only one of them is real.’<br><br> I was so stunned by this strange realization that my mind stopped. I
              was fully conscious, but there were no more thoughts. Then I felt drawn
              into what seemed like a vortex of energy. It was a slow movement at
              first and then accelerated. I was gripped by an intense fear, and my
              body started to shake. I heard the words ‘resist nothing,’ as if spoken
              inside my chest. I could feel myself being sucked into a void. It felt
              as if the void was inside myself rather than outside. Suddenly, there
              was no more fear, and I let myself fall into that void. I have no
              recollection of what happened after that.</em></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: x-small;"> </span> This sort of self-inquiry is a primary technique in the Jnana path in Hinduism/Advaita Vedanta. The dissociation from all mental identification results in the realisation of pure consciousness prior to form and content. The pure subject that cannot be an object of observation. A person with such realisations will want to abide in that pure consciousness by dissociating from all forms and contents.</p>
              <p>However, this is only the first half side of the story. In non-dual realisation, one realises that all form are the divine manifestation of pure emptiness. In fact, Form is Emptiness, and Emptiness is Form, they are not two, cannot be separated. Observer cannot be separated from the observed.</p>

This withdrawal must have been so complete that this false, suffering self immediately collapsed, just as if a plug had been pulled out of an inflatable toy. What was left then was my true nature as the ever-present <em>I am</em>: consciousnessness in its pure state prior to identification with form. Later I also learned to go into that inner timeless and deathless realm that I had originally perceived as a void and remain fully conscious. I dwelt in states of such indescribable bliss and sacredness that even the original experience I just described pales in comparison."</p></div>
