              <p>All along Spain´s southernmost Atlantic coastline, the bluefin tuna is 
              king. For several weeks at this time every year, menfolk in coastal 
              towns head out to sea and trap hundreds of these behemoth fish using an 
              artisanal system of nets known as the  <em>almadraba</em>. They lay walls 
              of mesh to guide the migrating fish into a catch net, to later haul them
               out by hand. It is a dramatic, timeless spectacle, and it is under 
              threat. Watch it <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3lyUOSPKaM&amp;feature=related">here</a>.<br> <br> Out in the Mediterranean this month, the Greenpeace flag ship Rainbow Warrior is <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/where-have-all-the-tuna-gone/blog/11943">campaigning </a>to
               save the bluefin tuna. Stocks are on the verge of collapse and the fish
               faces extinction. But in the corridors of power in the capitals of 
              Europe, the bureacrats are not listening. Despite calls for a ban on 
              commercial bluefin fishing, officials have barely managed a nod in the 
              direction of reduced quotas. But if we´re going to carry on eating tuna -
               and let´s face it, most of us want to - the species must be allowed 
              time to recover.<br></p>

              <p>Governments
               gathered at the meeting of the Convention on International Trade in 
              Endangered Species in March failed to approve a ban on the lucrative 
              trade in Atlantic bluefin meat, a measure which could have helped avert 
              rapid bluefin tuna extinction. The International Commission for the 
              Conservation of Atlantic Tuna, which sets catch quotas, seems equally 
              powerless to ease pressure on the fisheries. Instead, short term 
              interests are repeatedly put ahead of the long term survival of the 
              species. “Time and tuna are running out and urgent action to save our 
              oceans is needed now from governments and the public," said Oliver 
              Knowles,  Greenpeace International oceans campaigner. "Consumers must 
              not buy or eat bluefin tuna and governments should put healthy oceans 
              ahead of short-term profits by changing fishing policies and creating 
              marine reserves." <br> <br> Greenpeace is campaigning to establish a global network of marine 
              reserves- areas of ocean off-limits to fishing, mining, drilling and 
              other extractive activities- to cover 40 percent of the world’s oceans, 
              including the Mediterranean. It says this is a necessary step to 
              restoring the world´s oceans and fish stocks back to health. You can 
              support the campaign <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/marine-reserves-pledge/">here</a>.<br> <br> All of this takes me back to the coastal villages of southern Spain, 
              just an hour or two´s drive from my home in Gibraltar. In Barbate 
              recently, 50 of Spain´s best known Michelin-starred chefs descended on 
              the town of Barbate to witness the first catch, or <em>levantá</em>, at 
              first hand. With the fish on land, they watched as the largest specimen,
               a 350-kilo monster, was cut up and filleted into lush, deep ruby-red 
              hunks of flesh. Then off they went to a famous local restaurant, <a href="http://www.restauranteelcampero.es/">El Campero</a> de Barbate, where they sampled a range of tuna dishes including a local recipe prepared with bluefin tuna semen, <em>piruleta de hueva con leche</em>. In this part of the world, no part of this beautiful fish is wasted.<br></p>
              <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_HGDpr_2hG9k/S_7lD6cMQYI/AAAAAAAAAOw/lLb1o_2Nvqg/s1600/At%C3%BAn+1.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_HGDpr_2hG9k/S_7lD6cMQYI/AAAAAAAAAOw/lLb1o_2Nvqg/s400/At%C3%BAn+1.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="400" height="267"></a></div>
              <p>The
               chefs were in Barbate at the invitation of the local mayor and 
              fishermen, who wanted to raise awareness about sustainable fishing at a 
              time when tuna quotas are under close scrutiny. They wanted to ensure 
              that this artisanal form of fishing does not disappear along with the 
              tuna. But without a clampdown on commercial trawlers and purse seiners 
              out at sea, and unless the likes of Greenpeace gather weight behind 
              their campaigns, bluefin, and the fishermen of towns like Barbate, may 
              well have their days counted.<br> <br> You can understand the good intentions of these 50 Spanish chefs, who 
              want to protect a way of life in coastal towns. But with bluefin 
              teetering on the edge of extinction, perhaps a better message would have
               been to keep tuna off the menu altogether, at least for while. Your
