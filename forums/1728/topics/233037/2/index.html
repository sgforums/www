Humans are not made for eating meat.<br><br>Unfortunately, human greed &amp; gluttony knows no bounds. Humans eat up everything that is living.<br><br>Thats why there are so many cases of cancer, heart disease, etc in human beings. That is nature's way of telling us humans to revert back to our original non-meat diet. But nature's message is not yet heeded by humans. It may take several more generations.</div>

But other than these extreme cases, it is still much healthier to be a vegeterian. Better still, consume only organic vegeterain food. I had consumed before a full 8 days organic vegetarian food during Refuge Taking in Taiwan. Wah.... the food taste better than those meals I had in S'pore with meat...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Cherrio</div></blockquote>Tell that to those who can't take seaweed due to allergy and see what happens to their iodine deficency.

I have never heard about quicker pace. But I have never heard of monks having trouble healing, etc, due to their vegetarian diet. Lots of monks live till old age, many are over 100, some like the famous Zen Master Hsu Yun of modern times, who lived till 120 years old. Plus if you become vegetarian you take in a lot less unhealthy stuff. And have less chance of heart attack, etc.</div>
