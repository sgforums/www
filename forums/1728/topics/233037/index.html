My master recommend people to take vegetarian breakfast. But if you can, it will be best you just become a vegetarian straight away.<br><br>There is some karma in eating any kind of meat... just that it will be lighter if you eat the meat under the 5 clean meat principle:<br><br><blockquote>See whole article: <a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol5no4a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol5no4a.htm</a><br><br>(1) That he did not slaughter the animal personally<br>(2) That he did not instruct others to slaughter<br>(3) That the slaughter was not committed for his sake<br>(4) That he did not witness the slaughter<br>(5) That he did not hear the cries associated with the slaughter </blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Now I cut down on the eating of seafood, especially like clams, oysters, prawns and crabs. This is because logically speaking, the numbers just don't seem good. A plate of chicken probably just required one chicken to sacrifice. A plate of chilli clams or oysters or prawns required so many lives to be sacrificed. And if these seafood were ordered in those "Fresh Seafood" restaurant, their deaths will be decided by me and just because I "itchy mouth long time no eat liao leh", they will have to die.<br><br>So now I just stick to a plate of chicken 1st. If I try hard enough, maybe next time chicken also don't have to die for me (indirectly)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> .</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What is the purpose of becoming vegetarian?<br><br>Very obvious: Great Compassion! The Buddha says eating meat destroys the very root of compassion, therefore Bodhisattva practitioners whom compassion is so important, must avoid eating meat.<br><br><blockquote>Surangama Sutra (Mahayana)<br><br>In the Chapter entitled "The enlightenment of others" and the section Prohibition against Killing, page 154. The Buddha said:<br><br>"If a man can (control) his body and mind and thereby refrains from eating animal flesh and wearing animal products, I say he will really be liberated."<br><br>Also from the Surangama Sutra:<br><br>"The reason for practicing dhyana and seeking to attain Samadhi is to escape from the suffering of life, but in seeking to escape from the suffering ourselves why should we inflict it upon others? Unless you can so control your minds that even the thought of brutal unkindness and killing is abhorrent, you will never be able to escape from the bondage of the worldÂ’s lifeÂ…After my Parinirvana in the last kalpa different kinds of ghosts will be encountered everywhere deceiving people and teaching them that they can eat meat and still attain enlightenmentÂ… How can a bhikshu, who hopes to become a deliverer of others, himself be living on the flesh of other sentient beings?"<br><br>Brahmajala Sutra, (What the Teaching is Not), from the Pali Canon; "Long Discourses of the Buddha", Sutta 1: Translation by Maurice Walshe pages 69 and 70.<br><br>"Whereas some ascetics and Brahmins, feeding on the food of the faithful, remain addicted to the enjoyment of stored-up goods such as food, drink, clothing, carriages, beds, perfumes and meat, the ascetic Gotama refrains from such enjoyment."<br><br>Lankavatara Sutra (Mahayana) translated from Sanskrit by D. T. Suzuki. This Sutra was a discussion of the fundamental concepts of Mahayana Buddhism. Chapter Eight is entirely devoted to the prohibition of meat eating.<br><br>"The Blessed One said this to him: For innumerable reasons, Mahamati, the Boddhisattva, whose nature is compassion, is not to eat any meat."<br><br>"Now, Mahamati, the food I have permitted (my disciples to take) is gratifying to all wise people but is avoided by the unwise; it is productive of many merits, it keeps away many evils; and it has been prescribed by the ancient Rishis. It comprises rice, barley, wheat, kidney beans, beans, lentils, etc., clarified butter, oil, honey, molasses, treacle, sugar cane, coarse sugar, etc.; food prepared with these is proper food."<br><br>"If, Mahamati, meat is not eaten by anybody for any reason, there will be no destroyer of life. Mahamati, in the majority of cases the slaughtering of innocent living beings is done for pride and very rarely for other causes."<br><br>"It is not true, Mahamati, that meat is proper food and permissible for the Sravaka ( a hearer, hence a pupil or beginner) when (the victim) was not killed by himself, when he did not order others to kill it. When it was not specially meant for him."<br><br>Scripture of BrahmaÂ’s Net translated from the Chinese by Rev. Hubert Nearman with Rev. Master Jiyu-Kennett and Rev. Daizui MacPhillamy as consultants and editors. Page 138.<br><br>Third Less Grave Precept:<br><br>On eating meat.<br><br>"Disciples of the Buddha, should you willingly and knowingly eat flesh, you defile yourself by acting contrary to this less grave Precept. Pray, let us not eat any flesh or meat whatsoever coming from living beings."</blockquote></div>

Because they do not forget the hard work that cows have helped in their agriculture.

However, those who choose to eat meat should eat meat under only three conditions:<br><br>did not see the killing, did not hear the killing, and do not suspect that they were killed.<br><br>In this way, the meat is karmically purer.</blockquote>If want to be vegetarian, don't eat any meat, not just don't eat beef!</div>
