              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Blake Smith February 22, 2018 America Magazine</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Christianity has been intertwined with the Indian
              subcontinent almost from the beginnings of the faith. The apostles Thomas and
              Bartholomew are both said to have traveled to India to preach the Gospel. And
              Christianity has been influenced by India in return. Two of medieval Europe’s
              most popular saints, Barlaam and Josaphat, were in fact Christianized versions
              of the Buddha, whose life story and teachings were adapted to the message of
              Christ. The transformation of the Buddha into a Christian figure demonstrates
              how much the two spiritual traditions share—and reveals the special beauty of
              medieval Christian piety.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Buddha, or Siddhartha Gautama, was born to a noble family
              in India in the fourth or fifth century B.C. Renouncing his wealth to pursue
              wisdom, he founded what became one of the world's most important spiritual traditions.
              Hagiographies began to appear soon after his death, combining fantastical
              versions of his biography with his sermons and parables. The stories traveled
              throughout Asia, reaching the frontiers of Europe by the 10th century A.D.
              Monks in the Byzantine Empire took the story for their own. They replaced the
              Buddha with the fictitious Indian saint Josaphat (the name of an Old Testament
              king) and created the character of Barlaam from Bodhisattva, the Buddhist term
              for an enlightened person. But the story itself hardly changed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">According to the Buddhist legend and its Byzantine
              adaptation, a king was granted a son after many years of childlessness. Raised
              in a palace, the young prince never saw poverty, sickness, old age or death.
              But one day, he snuck out of the palace and encountered on the road beggars,
              victims of disease and a funeral procession. Realizing that suffering was
              omnipresent, the prince could not return to the comfort of his father’s house.
              He began a quest for truth, in which he was helped, depending on the version,
              either by the supernatural beings of the Buddhist pantheon or by Barlaam, a
              Christian priest.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Byzantine story was translated into Latin and became one
              of the key texts of the medieval European church. Preachers in need of a sermon
              could find inspiration in its parables, which had been given a Christian
              interpretation by the Greek and Latin translators. A particularly famous one
              describes how a man chased by a tiger tripped over a cliff. Grasping onto a
              vine to stop his fall, the man sees another fearsome animal below him, the
              tiger still above him and a pair of mice gnawing through the vine, from which
              hangs a ripe fruit. With his free hand, he plucks the fruit and finds to his
              delight that it is the most delicious he has ever tasted.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">This story is today often interpreted among Western Buddhists
              of the Zen tradition as a call to enjoy life in the moment. In its medieval
              Christian interpretation, it was a stern warning: The sweetness that comes from
              the vine is the false pleasure of the world, by which people are so taken in
              that they forget the danger that pursues them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Greek and Latin versions of Barlaam and Josaphat’s story
              represent a fascinating moment in the encounter between different cultures and
              spiritual traditions. Reading them, however, does not reveal much about why
              Barlaam and Josaphat became two of the era’s most beloved saints. The real
              appeal of the two Indian saints can be found in works of theater and poetry
              written for popular audiences in French, Spanish and other emerging languages
              of medieval Europe. Rather than focus on theological points or the
              interpretation of parables, these plays and poems explore the relationship
              between Josaphat and his father, the pagan king.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">When a son is finally born to him, the king is overcome by
              joy. He tells Josaphat in one 13th-century play, “You are my son and all my
              pleasure, my love and all my happiness.” He watches over his child, worrying
              that Josaphat “might be lost to death or that he might convert to the Christian
              faith” and thus be lost to him. When the king learns that his fears have come
              true, he confronts his son in desperation: “Why, son, have you put me in such
              sadness and dishonored my old age?” Finally, moved by his son’s explanation of
              the Gospel or by a miracle (depending on the particular version), the king
              recognizes that his beloved son is not his alone but also “that of the heavenly
              Father. How I must give him thanks for you!” Father and son, torn apart by
              religious difference, find each other again.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Here medieval Christianity reveals its treasures of
              compassion. The Buddhist version of the story and the first Christian
              adaptations in Greek and Latin are rather cold, individualist affairs. They are
              concerned almost exclusively with the figure of the son, who must escape from
              the pleasures of the world and the gilded cage created by his father. Indeed,
              the father and his watchful love are merely obstacles to be overcome as the son
              pursues his spiritual journey. Faith itself is a question of intellect rather
              than emotion, with the Buddha achieving enlightenment through meditation and
              Josaphat accepting the Gospel after being convinced by the teachings of
              Barlaam.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The medieval plays and poems, in contrast, portray the father
              as having a heart and soul of his own. They present his attachment to his son
              as a genuine paternal love, one that the love of God will improve, not abolish.
              Rather than escaping from his father and the world in general, the son must
              rescue and enrich them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Focused on the anguish of family strife and the power of
              divine love to redeem our everyday relationships, these medieval stories are
              far more than historical curiosities. Read today, the popular medieval versions
              of the life of Josaphat not only remind us that Christianity has long been in
              conversation with other faiths, borrowing and adapting from them, but also that
              the Christian tradition has something special to bring to these encounters. The
              tender treatment of a pagan father’s love in these poems and plays offers a
              particularly Christian reminder that dialog and conversion take place within
              vital, fraught relationships that are worthy of respect.</span></p>
