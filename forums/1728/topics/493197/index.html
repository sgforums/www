              You Lose Weight With Ancient Wisdom and Modern Science </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Michael Gollust December
              27, 2016 Health.com</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">This intermittent fasting plan entails looking at food in a
              whole new way. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Buddha may have been the world's first yo-yo dieter: Raised
              in luxury, the young prince Siddhartha had a taste of decadence before he swung
              hard in reaction, living as a wandering ascetic, starving himself nearly to
              death, until he finally arrived at his “middle way.” The Buddha
              was, of course, in search of something more profound than a svelte physique.
              But the insights he gleaned from his quest can be enlightening for the modern
              dieter. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Writer, data scientist, and Zen priest Dan Zigmond (with
              co-author Tara Cottrell) has condensed wisdom gleaned from the Buddha’s
              teachings and from modern diet science into Buddha’s Diet: The Ancient Art of
              Losing Weight Without Losing Your Mind ($17, amazon.com).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">And you don’t have to be Buddhist to try it. All you
              need is a clock, a scale, an open mind, and a willingness to endure some
              late-night stomach grumblings for a few weeks. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The key to Buddha’s Diet is time-restricted dieting—sometimes
              known as intermittent fasting. The concept is simple: Instead of worrying
              about what or how much you eat, the diet asks you to concentrate on when you
              eat, and to gradually shrink the window in which you consume each day.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Research (in mice and people) shows that various forms of
              time-restricted feeding are safe and effective methods for weight
              loss. The idea is that to run most efficiently, your metabolism needs a
              daily break from food, something the modern Western eating style (with its
              round-the-clock nibbling and fueling) does not provide.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">To start on Buddha’s Diet, you begin by limiting your eating
              window to 13 hours each day for two weeks (which may be harder than it sounds,
              given that many of us habitually eat over the course of 15 hours or more each
              day). You then reduce your window to 12 hours per day, then 11, then 10, till
              you arrive at a daily 9-hour eating window. That might mean breakfast at
              9am (at home or at work), then dinner no later than 6pm, followed by ...
              nothing else, until the next day's breakfast.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">If you think the 9-hour window is extreme, Zigmond reminds us
              that Buddhist monks (who practice the tradition set forth by the Buddha himself
              some 2,500 years ago) tend to eat only between dawn and noon, and they seem to
              do just fine in terms of nourishment and stamina.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“We tried to come up with our version of a ‘middle way,’”
              Zigmond told Health.com, “a path that we think most people could follow
              pretty comfortably and still get the health benefits of an intermittent fasting
              diet.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Here are 7 surprising tips from the book that can help
              you get lean and stay healthy the Buddha’s way.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Go ahead, look at the
              scale</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Zigmond urges Buddha’s Dieters to weigh themselves every day.
              Tracking your weight is a way of taking control of your diet and health,
              Zigmond notes, and a way to keep tabs on what is and isn’t working in your
              diet. Daily fluctuations, of course, are to be expected. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Eat what you want (just
              not junk)</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">A nice thing about Buddha’s Diet: there are no hard and fast
              rules about what and what not to eat. “It’s most important to eat food you like
              and find filling,” writes Zigmond. “A diet that makes you miserable is not one
              that is going to last.”  In place of labeling foods as “good” or “bad,”
              think about what’s “useful” (healthy fats, fiber, and veggie- or meat-based
              protein) and what’s not (sugar, processed foods, more than two alcoholic drinks
              per week).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">And since you won’t be eating in the late evening anymore,
              you’ll naturally be less likely to overdo it at happy hour or to pound Ben
              &amp; Jerry’s by the pint, since, as Zigmond notes, almost 70% of all ice cream
              is consumed after 6pm.  Who knew?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Have a cheat day, really</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">That said, treats are not off-limits. Not only does
              Buddha’s Diet permit occasional cheat days, it encourages them. Why? 
              Zigmond notes that your body adapts to the “food environment” around it,
              slowing down your metabolism and pumping out hunger hormones if it thinks food
              is scarce. He cites research showing that splurging with some regularity
              can actually give a burst to the metabolism, causing us to burn more calories
              and reset those appetite-controlling hormones. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Buddha’s diet allows one cheat day per week. On that
              day, you can eat outside your schedule (a great occasion for taking advantage
              of parties, birthdays, work events, date nights, and such).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Exercise for its own
              sake</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Zigmond points out that exercise typically doesn’t burn as
              many calories as you think, and it often has the effect of making you
              hungry. So the diet doesn’t require exercise, but encourages it if you
              enjoy it (the Buddha taught that staying physically fit helps “keep our minds
              strong and clear”). When to fit it in? Zigmond recommends first thing
              in the morning and cites research showing that exercising on an empty stomach
              burns 20% more fat than doing it after a meal.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Quit the clean plate
              club</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Americans waste a staggering amount of food, roughly 42%, but
              the solution to waste, Zigmond argues, is not to clean your plate. Buddha’s
              Diet asks you to consider, once you’ve finished eating, whether the rest of
              your meal is better of in the trash or in your body.  “You have a choice
              to make,” Zigmond writes. “You can use the garbage can or you can be the
              garbage can.”  While you get the hang of it, you might start out throwing
              more food into the trash (or better yet, the compost bin) than you’d like, but
              once you learn to be more attentive to your own hunger and satiety clues (in
              other words, eating more mindfully), you’ll be able to right-size your
              portions, meaning less surplus food going into the trash or into your belly.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Say grace</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Zigmond explains that thinking more deeply about the origin
              of our food can help us make better eating choices. And part of developing
              a mindful approach to eating involves cultivating gratitude for the food we
              eat. Try saying grace the way your family may have when you grew up. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Or you can borrow from this recitation from the American Zen
              Buddhist tradition: “We reflect on the effort that brought us this food and
              consider how it comes to us. We reflect on our virtue and practice, and
              whether we are worthy of this offering. We regard it as essential to keep
              the mind free from excesses such as greed. We regard this food as good
              medicine to sustain our life. For the sake of enlightenment we now receive
              this food.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Pay attention</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Because Buddha’s Diet asks you to watch the clock and think
              about what we’re eating and when, Zigmond explains, “it causes us to focus a little
              more." And when you really tune in, he adds, you begin to realize how
              much we eat when we’re not actually hungry. “When we start paying attention, we
              naturally start to achieve a kind of moderation in our eating.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“The Buddha didn’t want anyone to take what he was saying on
              faith,” Zigmond adds. “He wanted people to try things out and follow those
              things that worked, all the while experimenting and adapting based on their own
              experiences.”</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">So try these tips, read the book, and see for yourself. 
              You’ll find that Buddha’s Diet is not merely an eating plan, but a whole-life
              calibration and balancing system. You might end up dropping a few pounds,
              but you may also come out with an overall more enlightened approach to
              wellbeing.</span></p>
