            <div class='col-md body'>Just to comment on some points I missed out just now...<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">how do you make buddhism relevant to your life?</span><br><br>Buddhist practise is meant to be practised in life. Or else... practise when you are dead?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote>rather than meditate all day and try to reach nirvana</blockquote>This is one of the misconceptions of Buddhism. A Buddhist who wishes to attain Nirvana does not necessarily have to practise meditation all day. There are 84000 dharma doors, sitting meditation is only one of them. In fact I think it is good if you can do sitting meditation. My dharma teacher recommends that we sit 30 minutes meditation everyday. But even if you can't, it does not mean you cannot practise. It depends on what dharma you are practising. The dharma that my taiwanese teacher transmitted to us can be practised wherever we go - even during sleep!<br><br>Actually cultivation is a simple thing. You have to understand what Buddhist cultivation is about. Buddha himself was not a person who spend all his life meditating! He walked throughout India helping people and teaching the dharma.<br><br>--------<br><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/cultivat.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/cultivat.htm</a><br><br><strong>The correct concept of cultivation</strong><br><br>First of all we need to understand what is cultivation. <strong>Some people think that cultivation means not having an occupation but to be engaged in the daily activities of prayers to the Buddha, meditation or chanting the sutras. The actual purpose of cultivation is to eradicate our undesirable conduct and to maintain our good conduct. In other words, to follow the Bodhisattva path in emulating the practices of the Bodhisattvas.</strong> When we know the meaning of cultivation, then we understand its purpose, which is to eradicate our self serving and evil habits and thus reduce our negative karma. However, many people do not understand this principle and they misinterpret its meaning. Actually, not only those who have renounced to be Buddhist monks or nuns need to cultivate, lay-Buddhists also need to cultivate, if not more diligently. Even those who do not subscribe to any religion need to cultivate. Cultivation is not only a matter for monks or nuns alone.<br><br>What is cultivation? Where do we practise cultivation? Let me tell you a story: More than twenty years ago, I took four years to cultivate as I travelled across the country. Step by step, I covered Taiwan by walking. Once when I was in Hua-Lian, an elderly Buddhist asked me, "Master! A monk should reside in the temple to meditate, pray and chant sutras, but when you travel about what are you cultivating? I replied, "ThatÂ’s right! I am cultivating. Sakyamuni Buddha teaches us to cultivate our conduct. He does not encourage us to cultivate sitting down! In the past few years I had been practising sitting meditation, now I wish to travel about. While walking and also amidst all my other activities, I do not commit evil deeds, I chant the names of the Buddhas, I praise and commend others, I tell people about the Dharma, I avoid the places of vice, this is the way I cultivate."<br><br>Thus, to cultivate means cultivating in the midst of our activities. This is a point that many people do not understand. They think that cultivation will result in a society that is pessimistic and low-spirited. This is a mistake. Jen Chen Buddhism advocates cultivating in the midst of our daily activities. Many retired old folks have no need to attend to household chores anymore, thus they can afford to spend their time to chant the names of the Buddhas and to cultivate in the midst of their leisure. However, there are many housewives who need to tend to their children, household chores and many other matters. How do you expect them to cultivate in their leisure? Thus, the need to cultivate in the midst of their activities; while cooking they could chant the names of the Buddhas and the Bodhisattvas. No matter what activities they are engaged in, it is always possible to cultivate. Instead of gossipping about our neighbours and friends or engaging in other frivolous talks, why not refrain from all these. This is cultivation. Therefore, only when we cultivate in the midst of our activities do we understand the meaning of cultivation. To cultivate in our leisure may cause others a lot of frustrations. For example, a husband may be upset because his wife neglects the household by spending too much time chanting or running from temple to temple. For her to introduce Buddhism to her husband, thus, would not be an easy task. If she understands the principle of cultivating in the midst of her activities, it would be acceptable to the husband. Should he be invited to places of vice, he would know how to turn them down because his wife is a diligent cultivator. Both husband and wife are then cultivating at the same time.<br><br>There will be progress in our society when we understand the principle of cultivation. Otherwise, society will backslide. Over the last few decades, I have come to realize that we need to cultivate wherever we are. When we possess the correct concept of cultivation, any time is an appropriate time for cultivation, any place can be the place for us to seek enlightenment. If each and everyone of us conduct ourselves in this way, then the world will become a pure land. If we think that we can only cultivate in the temples, or that we cannot cultivate when we are working, then it is very possible that we commit evils deeds without even knowing. When we are with Buddha every moment, and cultivate constantly, then we are truly practitioners of Buddhism.<br><br>As to when in the cultivation process does one awaken and what it is like to be awakened, only when you follow the guidance of the Dharma and put it into practice, will you know you have awakened: when you drink the water, only you know how warm or cold it is.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">continued in the webpage...</span><br>----------------<br><br>There is another saying by my Master:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">To cultivate our actions is not as good as to cultivate the body,<br>To cultivate the body is not as good as to cultivate the mind,<br>To cultivate the mind is not as good as not having arising of the mind.</span><br><br>---<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">My daily activities are not unusual,<br>I'm just naturally in harmony with them.<br>Grasping nothing, discarding nothing...<br>Supernatural power and marvelous activity -<br>Drawing water and carrying firewood.<br><br>Layman Pang-yun</span></div>
