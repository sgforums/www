              <p>Someone asked me:</p>
              <p><em>Nagarjuna said that ultimate truth is free of the four extremes.
                                              By saying that conventional truth is ultimately false, does that
                                              fall into one extreme?</em></p>
              <p><em> </em></p>
              <p><em>I was thinking more about like the 'self' . If we say that it
                                              doesn't exist at all, does it fall into one extreme?  Or is it
                                              the best way to explain through dependent origination? That is, the
                                              self is a composite of factors?  But frankly, from the
                                              presentation i have been reading, the self is not even a composite
                                              of factors, it seem to be totally absent.</em></p>
              <p><em> </em></p>
              <p><em>What is the difference between emptiness and dependent
                                              origination?</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My answer:</p>
              <p>There is no self, and relative truth/conventional truth is false, 
                          that is why Buddha does not conceive of relative - a Buddha only 
                          perceives wisdom.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Namdrol says:</p>
              <p><em><br> Relative truth is not true. <br> <br> But even NÄ�gÄ�rjuna rejects the two truths:<br> <br> "Since the Jina proclaims that nirvana alone is true, <br> what wise person would not reject the rest as false?"<br> <br> N</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nagarjuna says, <em>"The elements do not themselves exist individually,<br> So how could their own individual characters exist?<br> What do not themselves indiivdually exist cannot predominate.<br> Their characters are regarded as conventionalities.<br> <br> ...<br> <br> Other than as the imputation of a convention<br> What world is there in fact<br> Which would exist or not?"</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Candrakirti says,<em> "The very coming to rest, the non-functioning, of perceptions as signs 
                          of all named things, is itself nirvana.... When verbal assertions cease,
                           named things are in repose; and the ceasing to function in discursive 
                          thought is ultimate serenity."</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Heart Sutra says, <em>"Here, O Sariputra, all dharmas are marked with 
                          emptiness; they are not produced or stopped, not defiled or immaculate, 
                          not deficient or complete. Therefore, O Sariputra, in emptiness there is
                           no form nor feeling, nor perception, nor impulse, nor consciousness ; 
                          No eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind ; No forms, sounds, smells, 
                          tastes, touchables or objects of 
                          mind ; No sight-organ element, and so forth, until we come to : No 
                          mind-consciousness element ; There is no ignorance, no extinction of 
                          ignorance, and so forth, 
                          until we come to : There is no decay and death, no extinction of decay 
                          and death. There is no 
                          suffering, no origination, no stopping, no path. There is no cognition, 
                          no attainment and no non-attainment."</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore understand that what dependently originates is empty - in other words there is no eyes, no nose, etc.... no self. You do not say 'there is an existence of eyes that is nonetheless composite' - the Heart Sutra is clear cut - there is no eyes.</p>
              <p>Why? What dependently originates, what is composite, is utterly empty.</p>
              <p>What you call a car is simply a label imputed on a composite that via dependent origination leads to a function or activity called 'driving'. In actuality the composite is empty of anything that can be pinned down as a 'car'. Actually there is no car, just like there is no weather-ness of weather, and so on. It is just a conventionality that has no truth in it, but is nonetheless used for convenient communication. When emptiness is realized, all signs cease and nirvana is attained in the manner Chandrakirti explains: <em>The very coming to rest, the non-functioning, of perceptions as signs 
                          of all named things, is itself nirvana.</em></p>
              <p>Such a state is described by the Buddha in the Kalaka Sutta: <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.024.than.html">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.024.than.html</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nagarjuna says,</p>
              <p><em>Whatever is dependently co-arisen,<br> That is explained to be emptiness.<br> That, being a dependent designation,<br> Is itself the middle way.  (<strong>Treatise</strong>, 24.18)<br><br> Something that is not dependently arisen,<br> Such a thing does not exist.<br> Therefore a nonempty thing<br> Does not exist.  (<strong>Treatise</strong>, 24.19)</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All talks of eyes, nose, etc.... self, even karma, rebirth, and so on are all conventionalities, there is no reality to them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You may ask then, how does this not fall into the fault of the extreme of non-existence?</p>
              <p>Namdrol clearly states:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: small;"><em>"The great 11th Nyingma scholar
                                                  Rongzom points out that only Madhyamaka accepts that its critical
                                                  methodology "harms itself", meaning that Madhyamaka uses
                                                  non-affirming negations to reject the positions of opponents, but
                                                  does not resort to affirming negations to support a position of its
                                                  own. Since Madhyamaka, as Buddhapalita states <strong>"does not
                                                  propose the non-existence of existents, but instead rejects claims
                                                  for the existence of existents"</strong>, there is no true
                                                  Madhyamaka position since there is no existent found about which a
                                                  Madhyamaka position could be formulated; likewise there is no false

              <p><em><br> Dependent origination is not a view. It is the pacification of
                                                  views. Emptiness is not a view, it is the pacification of views.
                                                  This is stated countless times in Madhyamaka texts.<br> <br> Where there is no view, there is no proliferation. Where there is
                                                  no proliferation, there is no view.<br> <br> view = proliferation.<br> <br> N</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Elsewhere, he has explained that 'no self', 'no eyes, no nose' etc 
                          does imply non-existence: the 'no' here is the non-asserting rejection of existence, 
                          and therefore also the rejection of other extremes like non-existence, 
                          both and neither, since the all extremes dependent on the establishment of an existent.</p>
              <p>So when you say 'no', immediately all 4 extreme positions are rejected.</p>
              <p>This is similar to what the Buddha said:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>"And so, Anuradha — when you can't pin down the Tathagata as a truth

                          'Friends, the Tathagata — the supreme man, the superlative man, attainer

              <p>Today's post by Namdrol:</p>
              <p><br>First things first -- truths (satyas) are objects of cognitions -- 
              which can be either correct (ultimate) or false (relative). Since you 
              are studying Gelug influenced discourse, this may not be immediately 
              evident to you. <br><br>This means that if you see something that you 
              identify as salt, and it functions as salt, this cognition is true in so
               far as it is efficient. <br><br>When you analyze that appearance for 
              some fundamental saltiness in that appearance of salt, that cognition of
               salt fails because no fundamental saltiness will or can be found. In 
              other words, relative truths are true so long as they are not 
              investigated, that is, so long as the appearance which produces the 
              cognition which lables that appearance is not analyzed to discover 
              whether or not there is an essence which produces the identification of 
              the given appearance in question. <br><br>A relative truth is the 
              subject of a cognition that is not in possession of the fact that the 
              given apparent phenomena being perceived as an object of said cognition 
              lacks the identity imputed to it. An ultimate truth is an object of a 
              cogniton which is in possession of the fact that the given apparent 
              phenomena being perceived as an object of said cognition lacks the 
              identity imputed to it and does not perceive the identity which is 
              non-existent in that object of cognition. <br><br>The function of the 
              two truths is to lead to the cessation of proliferation about identity. 
              The lack of identity within phenomena and persons alone is emptiness and
               nothing else. <br><br>N</p>

              <p>Basically, i think that the imputed convention of any phenomenon like 'self' cannot be said to be completely non-existing, as the imputed convention is the result of dependent arising... which is why it says in the text above that 'dependent origination' is <strong>unbetraying. </strong>  </p>
              <p>Yet at the same time, the realisation of emptiness discovers that there is no underlying essence to this 'self' either.</p>
              <p>There are some schools who say that Buddha can perceive relative truth and suffering too.  I think it may have to do with this understanding...</p>

The mundane plane comprises those levels at which the things of the world have control over the mind. Very briefly, three levels are recognized in the mundane plane, namely: the sensual level (Kamavacara-bhumi), or the level of a mind still content with pleasures of every kind; the level of forms (Rupavacara-bhumi), the condition of a mind uninterested in sensual objects, but finding satisfaction in the various stages of concentration on forms as objects; and lastly the formless level (Arupavacara-bhumi), the yet higher level of a mind finding satisfaction in the bliss and peace of concentration on objects other than forms. These three levels in the worldly plane are the mental levels of beings in general. Regardless of whether we presume to call them human beings, celestial beings, gods, beasts, or denizens of hell, they are all included within the three worldly levels. The mind of a worldling can at any particular time exist in any one of these three. It is not impossible. It is quite normal. As a rule, though, it will tend to fall back naturally to the unconcentrated sensual level; the human mind normally falls under the influence of the delightful in colors and shapes, sounds, odors, tastes and tactile objects. Only on certain occasions is it able to escape from the influence of these seductive things and experience the tranquillity and bliss which comes from practicing concentration on forms or other objects. It all depends on concentration. At certain times, then, a person's mind may be located in any of these levels of concentration. In India at the time of the Buddha this must have been fairly common, because people who had gone in search of the tranquillity and bliss associated with the various levels of concentration were to be found living in forests all over the country. At the present time such people are few, but it is nevertheless possible for the ordinary man to attain these levels. If someone in this world is in the process of experiencing the bliss of full concentration on a form, then for him "the world" consists of just that form, because he is aware of nothing else. At that time and for that person, "the world" is equivalent to just that one form, and it remains so until such time as his mental condition changes.</span></div>

Also present are various kinds of desire, albeit of the finest and most tenuous sort, such as dissatisfaction with the state in which he finds himself, which prompts him to go in search of a new state. That desire for change constitutes karma, so such a person has not yet transcended the worldly state. He is not yet in the supramundane plane. A mind dwelling in the supramundane plane has transcended the world. It views the worldly state as devoid of essence, self, or substance, and will have nothing of it. </span></div>

The Buddha divided the impurities in this group into ten kinds. He called them the Fetters (Samyojana). These ten fetters bind man and all beings to the world, keeping people in the mundane plane. If a person starts to cut through these fetters and break loose, his mind gradually and progressively becomes freed from the worldly condition; and when he manages to cut through them completely, his mind becomes completely free, transcends the world for good and comes to dwell permanently in the supramundane plane.</span></div>

The Buddhist practice, based on Morality (Sila), Concentration (Samadhi), and Insight (Panna), is a tool to be used for completely cutting out grasping and clinging. The objects of our clinging are the five aggregates: body, feeling, perception, active thinking and consciousness. When we have come to know the true nature of the five aggregates, we understand all things so well that desire gives way to disenchantment, and we no longer cling to any of them.</span></span></div>

This limits aimless wandering of the thoughts and makes it possible to concentrate and to have clear insight at all times. Then if conditions are right, the result is disenchantment, struggle to break loose, slipping free, or even complete Nirvana.</span></span></div>

              <p>Tsongkhapa's view of two truths is unique - no other traditions of Tibetan Buddhism shares his view of relative existence.</p>
              <p>My view is same as Namdrol, who have a negative view about Tsongkhapa's understanding. I don't like to comment on people especially great masters but I guess what needs to be said should be said.</p>
              <p>When you realize anatta and emptiness, you realize that there is no such thing as 'relative existence'. There is no self, no eye, no .... up to the entire eighteen dhatus and five skandhas, up to nirvana. Relative truth is false. There is no 'relative existence of something which is a composite or dependently originates', or a 'self that is relative', you simply realize that what is composite, what is dependently originated is utterly empty.</p>

              <p><br>Catmoon: I wonder tho, if I start digging into 
                      Pransangika-Madhyamaka, is that going to throw me into conflict with my 
                      foundation in Gelug orthodoxy?<br><br>Namdrol: Yes, since you will discover that gelug "prasanga" is not the "prasanga" of the founder of Prasanga, Batsab Nyima Drag. <br><br>N</p>
              <p>..................</p>
              <p>It is fairly straightfoward.<br><br>Gelugpas care very much about what Tsongkhapa says, and accept his as the supreme authority, even over NÄ�gÄ�rjuna. <br><br>Non-gelugpas don't, and don't accept him as an authority at all, let alone as an authority more important than NÄ�gÄ�rjuna. <br><br>N</p>
              <p>..................</p>
              <p>Caz: Thats true Gelugpa's Believe Tsongkhapa's Doctrine distills the essence of Nagarjunas teachings.  <img title="Wink" src="http://www.dharmawheel.net/images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)"><br><br>Namdrol: yes, whereas non-Gelugpas think he was deluded by a spirit posing as Manjushri.</p>
              <p>..................<br><br>The problem is that pramanas and prameyas are just conventional 
                      fictions, as Nagarjuna shows in the Vigrahavyavartani. In other words, 
                      there are no ultimate pramanas, so elaborating a Madhyamaka systems 
                      which makes use of this kind of language is very faulty indeed. <br><br>In other words, valid cognitions, like all relative truths, are the objects of faulty cognitions. <br><br>N</p>
              <p>..................</p>
              <p>Gorampa mentions this as possibility in his differentiation of 
                      views, and basically asserts that Tsongkhapa was lead astray by Umapa's 
                      channeling of "Manjushri". <br><br>N</p>
              <p>..................</p>
              <p><br>Faulty is quite correct, since that is what Candrakirti says i.e.:<br><br>mthong ba brdzun pa kun rdzob bden par gsungs<br><br>"False perception is said to be relative truth". <br><br>N</p>
              <p>..................</p>
              <p><br>You are not at liberaty to invent your own Dharma - well you are, just don't call it Candrakirti's intent. <br><br>False, faulty, incorrect, etc. All of these apply to relative truth. <br><br>N</p>
              <p>..................</p>
              <p><br><br>Ok, you are not understanding something -- kiun rdzob is relative truth, but actually means "totally obscuring" in Tibetan. <br><br>But
                       false perception is mthong brdzun, so what Candrakirti is clearly 
                      saying is that false/faulty/incorrect perception is relative, or totally
                       obscuring, truth. <br><br>The two truths are about how objects are 
                      perceived. They can be perceived in only two ways, correctly and 
                      incorrectly. Perceiving them incorrectly, a false perception of them is 
                      called relative truth. The word brdzun pa means "to lie" as well. 
                      Further, for example, there are two schools in Yogacara rnam bden pa and
                       rnam brdzun pa i.e. true aspect and false aspect. The latter is the 
                      higher of the two. The term brdzun pa means false.<br><br>So a false perception is relative truth. <br><br>When
                       Shantideva is taking about the two truths, he says - ultimate truth is 
                      beyond the mind, because the mind itself is relative. The mind can never
                       apprehend ultimate truth. <br><br>N</p>
              <p>..................</p>
              <p><br>Have you ever read Candrakirti? If not, I suggest you do. <br><br>It
                       is pointless for me to educate you. But in breif, Candra says "all 
                      phenomena have two natures, one ultimate, the other, relative" and 
                      "Whatever is correctly perceived, that is real; false perception is said

              <p>The point is, I can argue for or against any position and win. I
                       don't really have a stake in a position. But I know perfectly well what
                       NÄ�gÄ�rjuna says, Aryadeva, Buddhapalita, Candra, JñÄ�nagarbha, 
                      á¹ Ì�antaraká¹£ita, Sapan, Gorampa, Dolbuwa,Tsongkhapa, etc. have to say. <br><br>I
                       have studied Madhyamaka for 25 years. On this forum, the only people 
                      who have anything to share with me about Madhyamaka is JñÄ�na and Ratna, 
                      and even then, it is only more sources, and different information. They 
                      have nothing to share with me concerning the essential principles of 
                      NÄ�gÄ�rjuna and other tenet systems. <br><br>So, you can either benefit 
                      from my extensive knowledge of these teachings, honed by years of 
                      constant study with the best Tibetan lamas in the world, mastery of 
                      classical Tibetan, and personal experience in meditation, or not. It is

              <p><br>Yes, I understand that this is what you believe. You will forgive me
                       for pointing out that Tsongkhapa is not universally regarded as someone
                       who attained the path of seeing. We can respect Tsongkhapa as a great 
                      pracitioner and scholar without acquiescing to your demand that we 
                      perceive him to be an aryan pudgala. <br><br>N</p>

              <p>..................</p>
              <p><br><br>No, Tsongkhapa was a good yogi, and had experience. He received 
                      the transmissions of the tantras, practiced them, was skilled in the 
                      arts of Vajramaster, and conveyed them properly, he was am interesting 
                      and novel scholar. However, it is precisely his novelty that landed him 
                      in hot water with those who were not his students. <br><br>In this 
                      instance, his students had lots of faith in him and thus there is a new 
                      lineage. Those who were not his students rather resented the Sakya 
                      sarmas as they were called for a while, these new Sakyapas later known 
                      as Gelugpas. <br><br>So while we all respect Tsongkhapa, we do not all assume that he achieved awakening. <br><br>N</p>

              <p>I do not think that other schools do not adopt Tsongkhapa's interpretation.  For instance, HH Jigme Phuntsok who is a Nyingma mainstream master has had a vision of Tsongkhapa and asked his tens of thousands of monastic disciples to commit this very text to memory.    </p>

              <p>I think that the union of relative and absolute truth is quite in tandem with the other paths of primordial purity, afflictions is bodhi, samsara indivisible with nirvana, cow's herd.  From the basis of cause, they will seem different; but from the result POV, they will be the same.

              <p>Samsara being primordially pure simply means all phenomena are empty. It does not mean relative truth is truly true. It does not contradict the fact that relative truth is false cognition and ultimate truth is correct cognition.</p>

              <h1>The Theory of Two Truths in Tibet</h1>
              <div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Thu Feb 17, 2011</em></div>
              <p>Tibetan philosophers argue that the two truths theory is not only
                          core ontological doctrine as it is understood within the Indian
                          Buddhist thought, it also makes the central theory behind epistemology
                          and soteriology. The Indian Buddhist schools are named after the
                          theories of the two truths they each upheld as in the
                          entry on the
                           <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/twotruths-india/">theory of the two truths in India</a>. 
                           The same cannot be said about the schools of thought in Tibet.
                          All Tibetan philosophers and the
                           schools<sup>[<a name="note-1" href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/twotruths-tibet/notes.html#1">1</a>]</sup>—Nyingma,
                           Kagyü, Sakya, and Gelug—they established are
                          self-confessed followers of the PrÄ�saá¹…gika Madhyamaka
                          school of thought, and follow CandrakÄ«rti closely. Tibetans agree
                          that CandrakÄ«rti is the undisputed authority in commenting and
                          interpreting NÄ�gÄ�rjuna's Madhyamaka theory of the two
                          truths. The Tibetan PrÄ�saá¹…gikas however disagreed, debated
                          and fought fiercely amongst themselves concerning many philosophical
                          questions.  Who is the PrÄ�saá¹…gika? Does the
                          PrÄ�saá¹…gika hold any position? What is it that constitutes
                          the PrÄ�saá¹…gika's core philosophical position? How should
                          CandrakÄ«rti's hermeneutic approach towards NÄ�gÄ�rjuna be
                          assessed, evaluated and interpreted? The debate amongst the Tibetan
                          philosophers stems on a large part from the way in which they each
                          differently interpreted and understood CandrakÄ«rti's theory of
                          the two truths and its philosophical implications. The parameters
                          within which this debate is conducted either in the monastic debate
                          courtyards or in their philosophical writings, took a form around
                          certain philosophical themes. Those themes later became the standard
                          paradigmatic focus of any discussion on the subject of the two
                          truths.</p>

              <p>Keeping with the Tibetan Madhyamaka traditions, the present essay on
                          the theory of the two truths in Tibet focuses on the philosophical
                          issues arising from and associated with these themes. Therefore our
                          concern in this article is not historical evolution of the schools, or
                          the philosophers and the ideas to which they each are associated, our
                          concern is rather, first and foremost philosophical.</p>

              <h2><a name="Nyi">1. Nyingma</a></h2>
              <p>Longchen Rabjam sets out the course of the Nyingma theory of the truths 
                          and the later philosophers of the school took similar stance
                          without varying much in essence. In <em>Treasure</em> he begins the
                          section on the Madhyamaka theory of the two truths as follows:
                          “The Madhyamaka tradition is the secret and profound teachings of
                          the [ÅšÄ�kya]mÅ«ni. Although it constitues five ontological
                          categories, the two truths subsume them.” (Longchen, 1983:
                          204f)</p>
              <p>Nyingma defines conventional truth as consisting of unreal phenomena
                          that appear to be real to the erroneous cognitive processes of the
                          ordinary beings while ultimate truth is reality which transcends any
                          mode of thinking and speech, one that unmistakenly appears to the
                          nonerroneous cognitive processes of the exalted and awakened beings. In
                          other words (1) ultimate truth represents the perspective of
                          epistemically correct and warranted cognitive process of exalted beings
                          (‘phags pa); whereas (2) conventional truth represents the
                          perspective of epistemically deceptive and unwarranted cognitive
                          processes of the ordinary beings. (Mipham Rinpoche 1993d: 543–544)</p>
              <p>Let us consider these two definitions turn by turn. Nyingma supports
                          definition (1) with two premises. The first one says that cognitive
                          processes of the exalted (‘phags pa) and awakened beings (sang
                          rgyas) are epistemically correct and non-deceptive, because “It
                          is in relation to this cognitive content that the realisation of the
                          ultimate truth is so designated. The object of an exalted cognitive
                          process consists of the way things really are (gshis kyi gnas lugs),
                          phenomena as they really are (chos kyi dbyings) which is undefiled by
                          its very nature (rang bzin dag pa).” (Longchen 1983: 202f)
                          However ultimate truth for Nyingma is not an object per se in the usual
                          sense of the word. It is object only in the metaphorical sense.
                          “From the [ultimate] perspective the meditative equipoise of the
                          realised (sa thob) and awakened beings (sangs rgyas), there exists
                          neither object of knowledge (shes bya) nor knowing cognitive process
                          (shes byed) and so forth, for there is neither object to apprehend nor
                          the subject that does the apprehending. Even the exalted cognitive
                          process (yeshes) as a subject ceases (zhi ba) to operate.”
                          (Longchen 1983: 201f) Therefore “At this stage, [Nyingma] accepts
                          the total termination (chad) of <em>all</em> the continua (rgyun) of
                          the cognitive processes (‘jug pa) of the mind (sems) and mental
                          factors (sems las byung ba). This exalted cognitive process which is
                          inexpressible beyond words and thoughts (smra bsam brjod du med
                          pa'i yeshes), and thus is designated (btags pa) as a
                          <em>correct</em> and <em>unmistaken</em> cognitive process (yang dag
                          pa'i blo ma khrul ba) as it knows the reality as it
                          is.” (Longchen 1983:201f)</p>
              <p>The second premise comes from Nyingma's transcendent theory.
                          According to this theory ultimate truth constitutes reality and the
                          reality constitutes transcendence of all elaborations. Reality is that
                          which cannot be comprehended by the means of linguistic and conceptual
                          elaboration, as it is utterly beyond the grasp of words and thoughts
                          which merely defile the cognitive states. Given that exalted beings are
                          free of defiled mental states, all forms of thoughts and conceptions
                          are terminated in their realization of the ultimate truth. Ultimate
                          truth transcends all elaborations, thus remains untouched by the
                          philosophical speculations. (Longchen, 1983: 203f) “In short the
                          characteristic of [ultimate truth] is that of nirvÄ�á¹‡a, which
                          is profound and peaceful. It is intrinsically unadulterated domain
                          (dbyings). The cognitive process by means of which ultimate truth is
                          realized must therefore be free from all cognitive limitations (sgribs
                          pa), for it is disclosed to the awakened beings (sangs rgyas) in whose
                          exalted cognitive processes appear the objects as they really are
                          without being altered.” (Longchen, 1983: 204f)</p>
              <p>Nyingma's defence of the definition (2) also has two premises.
                          The first one comes from its theory of error, the most commonly used by
                          the Nyingma philosophers. According to this theory, conventional truth
                          is, as matter of fact, an error confined to the ordinary beings (so so
                          skye bo) who are blinded by the dispositions (bag chags) of confusion
                          (ma rig pa). It is argued that under the sway of confusion the ordinary
                          beings falsely and erroneously believe in the reality of entirely
                          unreal entities and the truth of wholly false epistemic instruments,
                          just like the people who mistakenly grasps cataracts and falling hairs
                          to be real objects. Conventional truths are mere errors that appear
                          real to the ordinary beings, but they are in fact no more real than the
                          falling hairs that are reducible into the “modes of
                          apprehensions” (<em>snang tshul</em>). (Mipham Rinpoche 1993c: 3,
                          1977: 80–81ff, 1993d: 543–544)</p>
              <p>The second premise comes from its representationalist or
                          elaboration-theory which says that conventional truths constitute
                          merely mental elaborations (spros pa) represented to appear (rnam par
                          snang ba) in the minds of the ordinary beings as if they are realities
                          having the subject-object relation. They are thus deceptive since they
                          are produced through the power of the underlying cognitive confusion or
                          ignorance, and that they do not cohere with any corresponding reality
                          externally. Confusion is
                          <em>saá¹ƒvá¹›ti</em> because it conceals (<em>sgrib)</em> the nature, it fabricates all
                          conditioned phenomena to appear as if they are real. Even though
                          conventional truths are to be eventually eradicated (spang bya), the
                          representational images of the conventional reality will nevertheless
                          continue to appear in the minds of even those who are highly realized
                          beings, that is, until they achieved a complete cessation of mind and
                          mental states. (Longchen, 1983: 203f) It is argued that when the eye
                          that is affected by cataracts mistakenly sees hairs falling in
                          containers, the healthy eye that is not affected by cataracts does not
                          even perceive the appearances of falling hairs. Likewise, those who are
                          affected by the cataracts of afflictive confusion see things as
                          intrinsically real, hence for them things are conventionally real.
                          Those noble beings who are free from the afflictive confusion and the
                          awakened beings who are free from even the non-afflictive confusion see
                          things as they are (ultimate truth). Just as the person without
                          cataracts does not see the falling hairs, the noble beings and awakened
                          beings do not see any reality of things at all.</p>
              <p>Mipham Rinpoche also proposes another definition of the two truths
                          which diverges significantly from the one we saw. As we saw
                          Longchen's definition is based on two radically opposed epistemic
                          criteria whereas Mipham's definition, as we shall see, has two
                          radically opposed ontological criteria—one that withstands
                          reasoned analysis and the other that does not withstand reasoned
                          analysis. In his <em>Clearing Dhamchoe's Doubts</em> (<em>Dam
                          chos dogs sel</em>), Mipham says that: “Reality as it is (de
                          bzhin nyid) is established as ultimately real (bden par grub pa).
                          Conventional entities are actually established as unreal, they are
                          subject to deception. Being devoid of such characteristics ultimate is
                          characterized as real, not unreal and not non-deceptive. If this
                          [reality] does not exist,” in Mipham's view, “than it
                          would be impossible even for the noble beings (Ä�rya / phags pa) to
                          perceive reality. They would, instead, perceive objects that are unreal
                          and deceptive. If that is the case, everyone would be ordinary beings.
                          There would be no one who will attain liberation.” (1993a:
                          602)</p>
              <p>Mipham anticipates objections to his definition from his Gelug
                          opponents when he writes, “Someone may object: although ultimate
                          truth is real (bden p), its reality is not established ultimately (bden
                          grub), because to be established ultimately is for it to withstands
                          reasoned analysis (rigs pas dpyad bzod).” (Mipham 1993a: 603) The
                          response from Mipham makes it even clearer. “Conventional truth
                          is not ultimately real (bden par grub pa) because it is not able to
                          withstand reasoned analysis, in spite of the fact that those that are
                          conventionally real (yang dag kun rdzob) are nominally real (tha snyad
                          du bden pa) and are the objects of the dualistic cognitive
                          processes.” (Mipham 1993a: 603) In contrast: “Reality
                          (<em>dharmatÄ� / chos nyid)</em>, ultimate truth, is really
                          established (bden par grub pa) on the ground that it is established as
                          the object of nondual exalted cognitive process<em>.</em> Besides, it
                          withstands reasoned analysis, for no logical reasoning whatsoever can
                          undermine it or destroy it<em>.</em> For that reason so long as it does
                          not withstand reasoned analysis, it is not ultimate, it would be
                          conventional entity.” (Mipham 1993a: 603) According to
                          Mipham's argument, that an object that cannot withstand reasoned
                          analysis is the kind of object that mundane cognitive processes find
                          dually, and it is not the kind of object found by the exalted cognitive
                          processes that perceive ultimate truth nondually. (Mipham 1993a:
                          603)</p>
              <p>As we have noticed, Mipham's definition seems to have departed
                          from Longchen's some what significantly. In the final analysis,
                          however, there does not seem to be much variation. Mipham Rinpoche also
                          is committed to the representationalist argument to ascend to
                          nonduality: “In the end,” he says, “there are no
                          external objects. It is evident that they appear due to the force of
                          mental impressions … All texts that supposedly demonstrate the
                          existence of external objects are provisional [descriptions of] their
                          appearances.”(Mipham 1977: 159–60ff) Consequently whatever
                          appears to exist externally, according to Nyingma, “is like a
                          horse or an elephant appearing in a dream. When it is subjected to
                          logical analysis, it finally boils down to the interdependent inner
                          predispositions. And this is at the heart of Buddhist
                          philosophy.” (Mipham 1977: 159–60ff )</p>
              <p>Following on from its definition, Nyingma argues that there is no
                          one entity that can be taken as the basis from which divides the two
                          truths; since there is no one entity which is both real (true) and
                          unreal (false). Hence it proposes the two truths division based on the
                          two types of epistemic practices “because it confirms a direct
                          opposition between that which is free of the elaborations and that
                          which is not free of the elaborations, and between what is to be
                          affirmed and what is to be negated excluding the possibility of the
                          third alternative. Thus it ascertains the two.” (Longchen, 1983:
                          205–206ff) Nyingma has two key arguments to support the claim the two
                          truths division is an epistemic. The first argument states, “It
                          is definite that we posit the objects (yul rnams) in dependence upon
                          the subjects (yul can). The subjects are exclusively two types—they 
                          are either ultimately (mthar thug pa) fallacious cognitive
                          processes (khrul ba'i blo) or ultimately (mthar thug pa)
                          non-fallacious cognitive processes (ma ‘khrula ba'i blo).
                          The fallacious cognitive processes posit [conventional truth]—all 
                          saá¹ƒsÄ�ric phenomena—whereas as the non-fallacious
                          cognitive processes posit the [ultimate] reality. Therefore it is due
                          to the cognitive processes that we posit the objects in terms of two
                          [truths]” (Longchen, 1983: 206f) The second argument states that
                          ultimate truth is not an objective domain of the cognitive processes
                          with the representational images (dmigs bcas kyi blo'i spyod
                          yul), for the reason that it may be known by means of the exalted
                          cognitive processes (yeshes) with no representational image (dmigs pa
                          med). (Longchen, 1983: 206f) In contrast conventional truth is an
                          objective domain of the cognitive processes with the representational
                          images (dmigs bcas kyi blo'i spyod yul), for the reason that it
                          may be known by means of the cognitive processes having the
                          representational images (dmigs bcas kyi blo'i spyod ul).</p>
              <p>Nyingma categorically rejects commitment to any philosophical
                          position, for it would entail a commitment to, at least, some forms of
                          elaborations. This is so since “the PrÄ�saá¹…gika rejects
                          all philosophical systems, and does not accept any self-styled
                          philosophical elaboration (rang las spros pas grub mtha’).
                          (Longchen, 1983: 210ff) The PrÄ�saá¹…gika therefore presents
                          the theory of the two truths and so forth by merely designating them in
                          accordance with the mundane fabrications (sgro btags). (Longchen 1983:
                          211f) “Therefore ultimate truth which is transcendent of all
                          elaborations cannot be expressed either as identical to or separate
                          from the conventional truth. They are rather <em>merely different in
                          terms of negating the oneness</em>. (Longchen<em>,</em> 1983<em>:</em> 192–3ff, Mipham 1977: 84f) Interestingly Mipham Rinpoche also says that
                          “the two truths constitute a single entity but different
                          conceptual identities <em>(ngo bo gcig la ldog pa tha dad)</em>.
                          “This is because,” he says, “appearance and emptiness
                          are indistinguishable. This is ascertained through reliable cognitions
                          (tshad ma) by means of which the two truths are investigated. What
                          appears is empty. If emptiness were to exist separately from what
                          appears, the reality of that [apparent] phenomenon would not be empty.
                          Thus the two [truths] are not distinct.” (Mipham 1977: 81f) The
                          identity of ultimate truth at issue here, according to Mipham, is that of
                          absolute ultimate (rnam grangs min pa'i don dam ste), rather than
                          provisional ultimate. This is because the kind of ultimate truth under
                          discussion when we are discussing its relation with conventional truth
                          is the ultimate truth “which is beyond the bound of any
                          expression, although it is an object of direct perception.”

              <h2><a name="Kag">2. Kagyü</a></h2>
              <p>According to Karmapa Mikyö Dorje, Ä€tisha and his followers
                          in Tibet, are the authoritative former masters of the
                          PrÄ�saá¹…gika. It is this line of reading of the
                          PrÄ�saá¹…gika that Kagyü takes it to be authoritative
                          which the later Kagyü wholeheartedly embraces as the standard
                          position. (Mikyö Dorje, 2006: 272–273) Karmapa Mikyö Dorje
                          cliams that it is a characteristic of Kagyü masters and their
                          followers to recognise the ancient PrÄ�saá¹…gika tradition to
                          be philosophically impeccable (‘khrul med). (2006: 272)</p>
              <p>Unlike the other Tibetan schools, Kagyü rejects the more
                          dominant view that each philosophical school in Indian Buddhism has its
                          own distinctive theory of the two truths. “There are those who
                          advance various theories proclaiming that the VaibhÄ�á¹£ika on
                          up to the PrÄ�saá¹…gika Madhyamaka, for the purpose of
                          distinctive definitions of the two truths, unique rational and unique
                          textual bases. This is indeed,” says Karmapa Mikyö Dorje, an
                          indication “of the failure to understand the logic, and the
                          differentiation between the definition (mtshan nyid) and the defined
                          example (mtshan gzhi).” (Mikyö Dorje 2006: 293) The Indian
                          Buddhist philosophical schools only disagree, according to Kagyü,
                          on the issue concerning the defined example (mtshan gzhi) of the two
                          truths. The instances of ultimate truth in each lower school are, it
                          argues, their philosophical reifications, hence, they are the ones the
                          higher schools logically refute. There is evertheless no disagreement
                          between the Indian Buddhist schools as far as the definiendum (mtshon
                          bya / laká¹£ya) and the definition (mtshan nyid /
                          laká¹£aá¹‡a) of the two truths are concerned. If they disagree
                          on these two issues, there would be no commonly agreed definition, but
                          there is a definition of the ultimate which is common to all schools,
                          even though there is no commonly agreed defined example to illustrate
                          such definition. (Mikyö Dorje 2006: 293)</p>
              <p>Where the Indian Buddhist philosophical schools party their company,
                          Kagyü argues, is their conception of the defined example of the
                          ultimate. For the realists (dngos smra ba) ultimate truth is a
                          foundational entity (rdzas su yod pa) that withstands rational
                          analysis. The Madhyamaka rejects this, and argues that if ultimate
                          truth is a foundational entity, it is not possible to attain an
                          awakening to it. If it is possible to attain awakening, then ultimate
                          truth is impossible to be a foundational enity, for the two mutually
                          exclude each other. The foundational entity, like substance of the
                          Brahmanical metaphysicians, does not allow modification or change to
                          take place whereas the attainment of awakening is an ongoing process of
                          modification and change. (Mikyö Dorje 2006: 294)</p>
              <p>From the position Kagyü takes, it is clear then, that it does
                          not endorse Gelug's position that the PrÄ�saá¹…gika has
                          its own theory of the two truths which affords a unique framework
                          within which a presentation of the definition and the defined example
                          of the two truths can be set out. Kagyü argues that the
                          PrÄ�saá¹…gika's project is purely for pedagogical and
                          heuristic reasons, “for it seeks to assuage the cognitive errors
                          of its opponents—the non-buddhists, our own-schools such as
                          VaibhÄ�á¹£ika on upto the SvÄ�tantrika—who assert
                          philosophical positions based on certain texts.” (Mikyö
                          Dorje 2006: 294) The non-PrÄ�saá¹…gika philosophical schools
                          equate the definition of the ultimate with the defined example, and
                          this is the malady that the PrÄ�saá¹…gika seeks to allay.
                          Therefore the PrÄ�saá¹…gika's role, as Kagyü sees
                          it, is to point out the absurdities in the non-PrÄ�saá¹…gika
                          position and to show that the definition of the ultimate and the
                          defined example are rather two separate issues, and that they cannot be
                          identified with each other. (Mikyö Dorje 2006: 294–95) The
                          PrÄ�saá¹…gika does not, like Nyingma, entertain any position of
                          its own, except for the purpose of a therapeutic reason, and for which
                          “the PrÄ�saá¹…gika relies on the convention as a
                          framework for things that need to be cultivated and those that are to
                          be abandoned. For this our own position does not need to base the
                          linguistic conventions on the concepts of definition and the defined
                          example. Instead [our position],” says Kagyü,
                          “conforms to the non-analytical mundane practice in which what
                          needs to be abandoned and what needs to cultivated are undertaken in
                          agreement with the real-unreal discourses of the conventional
                          [truth].” (Mikyö Dorje 2006: 295)</p>
              <p>Therefore according to Kagyü, the position of all Indian
                          Buddhist philosophical schools—be it higher or lower—agree 
                          in so far as the definitions of the two truths are concerned. (1)
                          “[Ultimate truth] is that which reasoned analysis does not
                          undermine and that which withstands reasoned analysis. Conventional
                          truth is the reverse. (2) Ultimate is the non-deceptive nature and it
                          exists as reality. Conventional [truth] is the reverse. (3) Ultimate is
                          the object of the non-erroneous subject. Conventional [truth] is the
                          object of the erroneous subject.” (Mikyö Dorje 2006: 294) Of
                          these three definitions, the first one proposes conventional truth as
                          one that does not withstands reasoned analysis whereas ultimate truth
                          does indeed withstand the reasoned analysis. “Conventional
                          [truth] is a phenomenon that is found to exist from the perspective of
                          the cognitive processes that are either non-analytical (ma dpyad pa) or
                          slightly analytical (cung zad dpyad pa), whereas ultimate [truth] is
                          that which is found either from the perspective of the cognitive
                          process that is thoroughly analytical (shing tu legs par dpyad pa) or
                          meditative equipoise.” (Mikyö Dorje 2006: 274) Conventional
                          truth is non-analytical in the sense that ordinary beings assume its
                          reality uncritically, and become fixated to its reifications in virtue
                          of how it appears to their uncritical minds, rather than how it really
                          is from the critical cognitive perspective. When conventional truth is
                          slightly analysed, however, it reveals that it exists merely as
                          collocations of the codependent causes and conditions. (Mikyö
                          Dorje 2006: 273) Therefore conventional truth is “one that is
                          devoid of an intrinsic reality, rather it is <em>mere name</em> (ming
                          tsam), <em>mere sign</em> (rda tsam), <em>mere linguistic
                          convention</em> (tha snyad tsam), <em>mere conception</em> (rnam par
                          rtog pa tsam) and <em>mere fabrication</em> (sgro btags pa tsam)—one 
                          that merely arises or ceases due to the force of the
                          expressions or the conceptual linguistic convention.” (Mikyö
                          Dorje 2006: 273) Ultimate truth is defined, on the other hand, as one
                          that is found by analytical cognitive process or by a meditative
                          equipoise of the exalted beings, for the reason that when it is
                          subjected to analysis, phenomena are fundamentally, by its very nature
                          transcendent of the elaborations (spros pa) and all symbolisms (mtshan
                          ma). (Mikyö Dorje 2006: 273)</p>
              <p>On the second definition “Conventional truth is that which
                          does not deceive the perspective to which it appears (snang ngor), or
                          that which does not deceive an erroneous perspective (‘khrul
                          ngor), or that which is non-deceptive according to the standard of the
                          mundane convention.” (Kun Khyen Padkar, 2004: 66) Ultimate truth,
                          on the other hand, is defined as “that which does not deceive a
                          correct perception (yang dag pa'i mthong ba), or that which does
                          not deceive reality as it is (gnas lugs la mi bslu ba), or that which
                          does not deceive an awakened perspective (sang rgyas kyi gzigs
                          ngor).” (Kun Khyen Padkar, 2004: 74)</p>
              <p>The third definition is based on the two conflicting epistemic
                          practices. Here ultimate is defined as an ultimate object from the
                          perspective of exalted beings (Ä�rya / ‘phags pa). The
                          ultimate reality, although, is not one that is regarded as cognitively
                          found to exist in and of itself inherently (rang gi bdag nyid).
                          Conventional truth is defined as the cognitive process that sees unreal
                          phenomena (brdzun pa mthong ba) from the perspective of the ordinary
                          beings whose cognitive processes are obscured by the cataracts of
                          confusion. Conventional truth is unreal, for it does not exist in the
                          manner in which it is perceived by the confused cognitive processes of
                          the ordinary beings. (Mikyö Dorje 2006: 269–70) Karmapa Mikyö
                          Dorje puts the point in this way. “Take a vase as one entity, for
                          instance. It is a conventional entity, for it is a reality for the
                          ordinary beings, and it is found to be the basis from which arise
                          varieties of hypothetical fabrications. The exalted beings,” he
                          argues, “however, do not see any of these [fabrications],
                          anywhere, whatsoever, and this mode of <em>seeing by way of not seeing
                          anything at all</em> is termed as <em>the seeing of the ultimate</em>.
                          Therefore the two truths, in this sense, are not distinct. They are
                          differentiated from the perspective of the cognitive processes that are
                          either erroneous or non-erroneous.” (Mikyö Dorje, 2006:
                          274)</p>
              <p>Although, like Nyingma and Sakya it is the view of
                          Kagyü to maintain that erroneous cognitive process represents the
                          nature of the ordinary beings, whereas non-erroneous cognitive
                          processes represent the exalted beings. However, unlike Nyingma and
                          Sakya, Kagyü insists that the distinctions between the two truths
                          has nothing to do with the perspective of the exalted beings.
                          Everything, it claims, has to do with how ordinary beings fabricate
                          things erroneously—one more real than the other—and
                          that it has nothing to do with how exalted beings experience things.
                          “Even this distinction is made from the point of view of the
                          cognitive process of the childish beings. Since all things the childish
                          beings perceive are characteristically unreal (brdzun pa) and deceptive
                          (bslu ba), they constitute the conventionality. The exalted beings,
                          however, do not perceive at all anything in the way in which the
                          childish beings perceive and fabricate. So ultimate truth is, according
                          to Kagyü, that which is unseen and unfound by the exalted beings
                          since it is the way things really are. Therefore both the truths are
                          taught for the pedagogical reasons in accord with the perspective of
                          the childish beings, but not because the exalted beings experienced the
                          two truths or that there really exist the two truths. (Mikyö Dorje
                          2006: 274)</p>
              <p>What follows from the above discussion is that Kagyü
                          is monist about truth (Karmapa Mikyö Dorje, 2006: 302) in that it
                          claims only one truth and that truth it equates with transcendent
                          wisdom. Despite minor differences, Nyingma, Kagyü and Sagya all
                          emphasize the synthesis between transcendent wisdom and ultimate truth,
                          arguing that “there is neither separate ultimate truth apart from
                          the transcendent wisdom, nor transcendent wisdom apart from the
                          ultimate truth.”(2006: 279) For this reason Kagyü advances
                          the view similar to Nyingma and Sakya that the exceptional quality
                          of awakened knowledge consists in not experiencing anything
                          conventional or empirical from the enlightened perspective, but
                          experiencing everything from the
                          other's—nonenlightened—perspective. (Karmapa
                          Mikyö Dorje, 2006: 141–42ff)</p>
              <p>Finally, on the relationship of the two truths, Kagyü
                          maintains a position which is consciously ambiguous—that they
                          are expressible neither as identical nor distinct. Responding to an
                          interlocutory question, “Are the two truths identical or
                          distinct?” Karmapa Mikyö Dorjé, says, “neither
                          is the case.” And he advances three arguments to support this
                          position. First, “From a perspective of the childish beings, [the
                          two truths] are neither identical, for they do not see the ultimate;
                          nor are they distinct, for they do not see them separately.”
                          (Karmapa Mikyö Dorjé, 2006: 285) Second, “From
                          standpoint of the meditative equipoise of the exalted beings, the two
                          truths are neither identical, for the appearance of the varieties of
                          conventional entities do not appear to them. Nor are they distinct, for
                          they are not perceived as distinct.” (Karmapa Mikyö
                          Dorjé, 2006: 285) The third is the relativity argument which
                          says, “They are all defined relative to one another—unreality 
                          is relative to reality and reality is relative to unreality.
                          Because one is defined relative to the other, one to which it is
                          related (ltos sa) could not be identical to that which it relates (ltos
                          chos). This is because it is contradictory for one thing to be both
                          that which relates (ltos chos) and the related (ltos sa). Nor is it the
                          case that they are distinct because,” according to
                          Kagyü's view, “when the related is not established, so
                          is the other [i.e., one that relates] not established. Hence there is
                          no relation. If one insists that relation is still possible, then such
                          a relation would not be relative to another.” (Karmapa Mikyö
                          Dorjé, 2006: 285–86)</p>
              <p>So from these three arguments, Kagyü concludes
                          that the two truths are neither expressible as identical nor distinct.
                          It argues that “just as the conceptual images of a golden vase
                          and a silver vase do not become distinct on the account of them not
                          being expressed as identical. Likewise these images do not become
                          identical on the account of them not being expressed as
                          distinct.” (Mikyö Dorjé, 2006: 286)</p>
              <h2><a name="Sak">3. Sakya</a></h2>
              <p>Sakya's theory of two truths is defended in the works

                          authoritative representation of the Sakya's position. Sakya agree
                          with Nyingma and Kagyü in maintaining that the distinction between
                          the two truths is merely subjective processes, and that the two truths
                          are reducible to the two conflicting perspectives. (Sakya
                          Paá¹…á¸�ita 1968a: 72d, Rongtön Shakya Gyaltsen n.d. 7f,
                          Taktsang Lotsawa n.d.: 27, Shakya Chogden 1975a: 3–4ff, 15f)—“Although 
                          there are not two truths in terms of the object's
                          ontological mode of being <em>(gnas tshul),</em> the truths are divided
                          into two in terms of [the contrasting perspectives of] the mind that
                          sees the mode of existence and the mind that does not see the mode of
                          existence…This makes perfect sense.” (Gorampa 1969a:
                          374ab) Since it emphasizes the subjective nature of the distinction
                          between the two truths, it proposes “mere mind” <em>(blo
                          tsam)</em> to be the basis of the division. (Gorampa 1969a: 374ab) It
                          aruges that “Here in the Madhyamaka system, the object itself
                          cannot be divided into two truths. Conventional truth and ultimate
                          truth are divided in terms of the modes of apprehension <em>(mthong
                          tshul)</em>—in terms of the subject apprehending unreality and
                          the subject apprehending reality; or in terms of mistaken and
                          unmistaken apprehensions <em>(‘khrul ma ‘khrul);</em> or
                          deluded or undeluded apprehensions <em>(rmongs ma rmongs);</em> or
                          erroneous or nonerroneous apprehensions <em>(phyin ci log ma log);</em> or reliable cognition or unreliable cognitions <em>(tshad ma yin
                          min).”</em> (Gorampa 1969a: 375b) He also adds that:
                          “The position which maintains that the truths are divided in
                          terms of the subjective consciousness is one that all
                          PrÄ�saá¹…gikas and SvÄ�tantrikas of India unanimously
                          accepted because they are posited in terms of the subjective cognitive
                          processes depending on whether it is deluded <em>(rmongs)</em> or
                          nondeluded <em>(ma rmongs),</em> a perception of unreality <em>(brdzun
                          pa thong ba)</em> or a perception of reality <em>(yang dag mthong
                          ba),</em> and mistaken <em>(khrul)</em> or incontrovertible <em>(ma
                          khrul)</em>. (1969a: 384c)</p>
              <p>Sakya's advances two reasons to support its position.
                          First, since the minds of ordinary beings are always deluded, mistaken,
                          and erroneous, they falsely experience conventional truth. Conventional
                          truth is thus posited only in relation to the perspective of the
                          ordinary
                           beings.<sup>[<a name="note-2" href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/twotruths-tibet/notes.html#2">2</a>]</sup> The wisdom of exalted meditative equipoise is however never mistaken,
                          it is always nondeluded, and nonerroneous, hence exalted beings
                          flawlessly experience ultimate truth. Ultimate truth is thus posited
                          strictly in relation to the cognitive perspective of exalted beings.
                          Second, the view held by Sakya argues for separate cognitive agents
                          corresponding to each of the two truths. Ordinary beings have direct
                          knowledge of conventional truth, but are utterly incapable of knowing
                          ultimate truth. The exalted beings in training have direct knowledge of
                          the ultimate in their meditative equipoise and direct knowledge of the
                          conventional truth in the post meditative states. Fully awakened
                          buddhas, on the other hand, only have access to ultimate truth. They
                          have no access to conventional truth whatsoever from the
                          <em>enlightened perspective</em>, although they may access conventional
                          truth from the perspective of ordinary deluded beings.</p>
              <p>Etymologically Sakya characterizes
                          ultimate (<em>parama)</em> as a qualification of transcendent exalted
                          cognitive process <em>(‘jig rten las ‘das pa'i ye
                          shes, lokottarajñÄ�na)</em> that belongs to exalted beings
                          with <em>artha</em> as its corresponding object. The sense of
                          ultimate truth (<em>paramÄ�rthasatya)</em> grants primacy to the
                          exalted transcendent cognitive process of the noble beings, which
                          supersedes the ontological status of conventional phenomena. (Gorampa
                          1969a: 377d) “There is no realization and realized object, nor is
                          there object and subject.” (Gorampa 1969b: 714f, 727–729) As
                          Taktsang Lotsawa puts it: “A wisdom without dual appearance is
                          without any object.” (Taktsang n.d.: 305f) Strictly speaking,
                          transcendent wisdom itself becomes the ultimate truth. “Ultimate
                          truth is to be experienced under a total cessation of dualistic
                          appearance through exalted personal wisdom,” and
                          further, “Anything that has dualistic appearance, even
                          omniscience,must not be treated as ultimate truth.” (Gorampa
                          1969b: 612–13ff)</p>
              <p>Therefore conventionality (saá¹ƒvá¹›ti, kun rdzob)
                          means primal ignorance. (Gorampa, 1969b: 377b, Sakya
                          Paá¹‡á¸�ita 1968a: 72b, Shakya Chogden 1975a: 30f, Rongtön
                          Shakya Gyaltsen 1995: 288) In agreement with Nyingma and Kagyü,
                          Sakya treats primal ignorance as the villain responsible for projecting
                          the entire system of conventional truths. It argues ignorance as
                          constituting the defining characteristics of the conventional
                           truth.<sup>[<a name="note-3" href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/twotruths-tibet/notes.html#3">3</a>]</sup> (Sakya
                          Paá¹‡á¸�ita 1968a: 72, Rendawa 1995: 121, Shakya Chogden 1975b:
                          378f, 1975c: 220, Taktsang Lotsawa n.d.: 27f, Rongtön Shakya
                          Gyaltsen 1995: 287, n.d: 6–7ff) It formulates the definitions of the
                          two truths in terms of the distinctions between the ignorant
                          experiences of ordinary beings and the enlightened experiences of noble
                          beings during their meditative equipoise. Sakya's definition is
                          based on three reasons. First, each conventionally real phenomenon
                          satisfies only the definition of conventional truth because each
                          phenomenon has only a conventional nature (in contrast to the two
                          nature theory of Gelug), and that ultimate truth has a transcendent
                          ontological status. Second, that each cognitive agent is potentially
                          capable of knowing only one truth exhaustively, being equipped with
                          either the requisite conventionally reliable cognitive process or
                          ultimately reliable cognitive process. For each truth must be verified
                          by a different individual, and that access to the two truths is
                          mutually exclusive—a cognitive agent who knows conventional truth
                          cannot know ultimate truth and vice versa except in the case of exalted
                          beings who are not fully enlightened. Third, that each
                          conventional entity has only one nature, namely, its conventional
                          nature, and the so-called ultimate nature must not be associated with
                          any conventionally real phenomenon. If a sprout, for example, actually
                          did possess two natures as proposed in Gelug's theory of the two
                          truths, then, according to Sakya, each nature would have to be
                          ontologically distinct. Since the ontological structure of the sprout
                          cannot be separated into a so-called conventional and ultimate nature,
                          the sprout must possess only one phenomenal nature, i.e., the
                          conventional reality. As this nature is found only under the spell of
                          ignorance, it can be comprehended only under the conventional cognitive
                          processes of ordinary beings, and of unenlightened noble beings in
                          their post meditative equipoise. It is therefore not possible, in
                          Sakya's view, to confine the definition of ultimate truth to the
                          framework of conventional phenomena.</p>
              <p>Ultimate truth, on the other hand, requires the
                          metaphysical transcendence of conventionality. Unlike conventional
                          reality, it is neither presupposed nor projected by ignorance. Ultimate
                          truth, in Gorampa's words: “is inexpressible through words
                          and is beyond the scope of cognition.” (1969a: 370a) The
                          cognition is always conceptual and thus deluded. “Yet ultimate
                          truth is experienced by noble beings in their meditative equipoise, and
                          is free from all conceptual categories<em>.</em> It cannot be expressed
                          through definition, through any defined object, or through anything
                          else.” (1969a: 370a) In fact, Sakya goes so far as to combine the
                          definition of ultimate truth with that of <em>intrinsic reality</em> <em>(rang bzhin, svabhÄ�va).</em> When an interlocutor ask this
                          question: “What is the nature of the reality of phenomena?”
                          Gorampa replies that reality is transcendent and it has three defining
                          characteristics: namely: “It is not created by causes and
                          conditions, it exists independently of conventions and of other
                          phenomena; and it does not change.” (Gorampa, 1969c: 326a) Like
                          NÄ�gÄ�rjuna's <em>hypothetical</em>, not real, intrinsic
                          reality, Sakya claims that ultimate truth is <em>ontologically
                          unconditioned</em>, and hence it is not a dependently arisen
                          phenomenon; it is <em>distinct</em> from conventional phenomena in
                          every sense of the word; it is <em>independent</em> of
                          conceptual-linguistic conventions; it is a <em>timeless</em> and
                          <em>unchanging</em> phenomenon.</p>
              <p>It is clear then, according to Sakya view, any duality
                          ascribed to truth is untenable. Since there is only one truth, it
                          cannot be distinguished any further. Like Nyingma and Kagyü, Sakya
                          holds the view that truth itself is not divisible. (Sakya
                          Paá¹‡á¸�ita n.d.: 32ab, Rendawa 1995: 122, Rongtön Shakya
                          Gyaltsen, 1995: 287, n.d.: 22f Taktsang Lotsawa (n.d.: 263, Shakya
                          Chogden 1975a: 7–8ff, 1975c: 222f) It agrees with Nyingma and
                          Kagyü that the distinction between the two truths is essentially
                          between two conflicting perspectives, rather than any division within
                          truth as such. In Shakya Chogden's words: “Precise enumeration
                          <em>(grangs nges)</em> of the twofold truth all the earlier Tibetans
                          have explained rests on the precise enumeration of the mistaken
                          cognition <em>(blo ‘khrul)</em> and unmistaken cognition <em>(blo
                          ma ‘khrul).</em> With this underpinning reason, they explained
                          the precise enumeration through the elimination of the third
                          alternative. There is not even a single figure to be found who claims
                          the view comparable with the latter [i.e., Gelug], who asserts a
                          precise enumeration of the twofold truth based on the certification of
                          reliable cognitive processes.” (1975a: 9–10ff)</p>
              <p>Sakya rejects the reality of conventional truth by treating
                          it as a projection of conventional mind—it is the ignorance of
                          ordinary beings. When asked this question: “If this were true,
                          even the mere term <em>conventional truth</em> would be unacceptable,
                          for whatever is conventional is incompatible with truth,” Gorampa
                          Replies: “Since [conventional] truth is posited only in relation
                          to a conventional mind, there is no problem. Even so-called real
                          conventionalities <em>(yang dag kun rdzob ces pa yang)</em> are posited
                          as real with respect to a conventional mind.” (1969b: 606b) By
                          “conventional mind,” Gorampa means the ignorant mind of an
                          ordinary being experiencing the phenomenal world. In other words,
                          conventional truth is described as “truth” only from the
                          perspective of ignorance. It is a truth projected <em>(sgro brtag
                          pa)</em> by it and taken for granted.</p>
              <p>Sakya equates conventional truth with “the
                          appearances of nonexistent entities like illusions.” (Gorampa
                          1969c: 287c) It follows Sakya Paá¹‡á¸�ita on this point who
                          puts it: “Conventional truths are like reflections of the moon in
                          the water—despite their nonexistence, they appear due to
                          thoughts.” (Sakya Paá¹‡á¸�ita 1968a: 72a) According to
                          Sakya Paá¹‡á¸�ita “The defining characteristic of
                          conventional truth constitutes the appearances of the nonexistent
                          objects.” (1968a: 72a) In this sense, conventional truths
                          “are things apprehended by the cognition perceiving conventional
                          entities. Those very things are found as nonexistent by the cognition
                          analyzing their mode of existence that is itself posited as the
                          ultimate.” (Gorampa 1969a: 377a)</p>
              <p>Since mere mind is the basis of the division of the two
                          truths wherein ultimate truth—wisdom—alone is seen as
                          satisfying the criterion of truth, so conventional 
                          truth—ignorance—cannot properly be taken as truth. Wisdom and
                          ignorance are invariably contradictory, and thus the two truths cannot
                          coexist. Sakya argues, in fact, that conventional truth must be negated
                          in the ascent to ultimate truth. Given wisdom's primacy over
                          ignorance, in the final analysis it is ultimate truth alone
                          that must prevail without its merely conventional counterpart.
                          Conventional truth is an expedient means to achieve ultimate truth, and
                          the Buddha described conventional truth as truth to suit the mentality
                          of ordinary beings. (Gorampa 1969a: 370b) The two truths are thus
                          categorized as a <em>means (thabs)</em> and a <em>result</em> <em>(thabs byung)</em>. Conventional truth is the means to attain the
                          one and only ultimate truth.</p>
              <p>According to this view, then, the relationship between the
                          two truths is equivalent to the relationship between the two
                          conflicting perspectives—namely, ignorance and wisdom. The
                          question now arises: How is ignorance related to wisdom? Or conversely,
                          how does wisdom relate to ignorance? It says that the two truths are
                          distinct in the sense that they are incompatible with unity<em>,</em> like entity and without entity<em>.</em> In the ultimate
                          sense, it argues, the two truths transcend identity and difference.
                          (Gorampa, 1969a: 376d) The transcendence of identity and difference
                          from the ultimate standpoint is synonymous with the transcendence of
                          identity and difference from the purview of the meditative equipoise of
                          noble beings. However, from the conventional standpoint, it claims that
                          the two truths are distinct in the sense that they are incompatible
                          with their unity. It likens this relationship to the one between
                          <em>entity</em> and <em>without entity.</em> (Gorampa, 1969a:
                          377a)</p>
              <p>Sakya's claim that the two truths are distinct and
                          incompatible encompasses both ontological and epistemological
                          distinctions. Since what is divided into the two truths is mere
                          mind<em>,</em> it is obvious that there is no single phenomenon that
                          could serve as the objective referent for both. This also means that
                          the two truths must be construed as corresponding to distinct spheres
                          belonging to distinct modes of consciousness: conventional truth
                          corresponds to ignorance and ultimate truth to wisdom. It is thus
                          inappropriate to describe the relationship between the two truths, and
                          their corresponding modes of consciousness, in terms of two ways of
                          perceiving the <em>same</em> entity. Although the two truths can be
                          thought of as two ways of <em>perceiving</em>, one based on ignorance
                          and the other on wisdom, there is no <em>same</em> entity perceived by
                          both. There is nothing common between the two truths, and if they are
                          both ways of perceiving, then they do not perceive the same
                          thing.</p>
              <p>According to this view, the relationship between
                          conventional truth and ultimate truth is analogous to the relationship
                          between the appearance of falling hairs when vision is impaired by
                          cataracts and the absence of such hairs when vision is unimpaired.
                          Although this is a metaphor, it has a direct application to determining
                          the relationship between the two truths. Conventional truth is like
                          seeing falling hairs as a result of cataracts: both conventional truth
                          and such false seeing are illusory, in the ontological sense that there
                          is nothing to which each corresponds, and in the epistemological sense
                          that there is no true knowledge in either case. Ultimate truth is
                          therefore analogous, ontologically and epistemologically, to the true
                          seeing unimpaired by cataracts and free of the appearance of falling
                          hairs. Just as cataracts give rise to illusory appearances, so
                          ignorance, according to Sakya, gives rise to all conventional truths;
                          wisdom, on the other hand, gives rise to ultimate truth. As each is the
                          result of a different state, there is no common link between them in
                          terms of either an ontological identity or an epistemological or
                          conceptual identity.</p>
              <h2><a name="Gel">4. Gelug</a></h2>
              <p>Gelug's (Dge lugs) theory of the two truths is
                          campioned by Tsongkhapa Lobsang Dragpa (Tsong khapa Blo bzang grags pa,
                          1357–1419). Tsongkhapa's theory is adopted, expanded and defended
                          in the works of his immediate disciples—Gyaltsab Jé
                          (Rgyal tshab Rje, 1364–1432), Khedrub Jé (Mkhas grub Rje,
                          1385–1438), Gendün Drub (Dge ‘dun
                          grub,1391–1474)—and other great Gelug thinkers such as
                          Sera Jetsün Chökyi Gyaltsen (Se ra Rje tsun Chos kyi rgyal
                          tshan, 1469–1544), Panchen Sönam Dragpa (Paá¹‡ chen Bsod
                          nams grags pa,1478–1554), Panchen Lobsang Chökyi Gyaltsen
                          (Paá¹‡ chen Blo bzang chos kyi rgyal tshan,1567–1662),
                          Jamyang Shepai Dorje (‘Jam dbyangs Bzhad ba'i Rdo rje,
                          1648–1722), Changkya Rölpai Dorje (Lcang skya Rol pa'i
                          rdo rje, 1717–86), Könchog Jigmé Wangpo (Kon mchog
                          ‘jigs med dbang po, 1728–91), and many others
                          scholars.</p>
              <p>Gelug maintains that “objects of knowledge”
                          <em>(shes bya)</em> are the basis for dividing the two truths.
                          (Tsongkhapa
                           1984b:176)<sup>[<a name="note-4" href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/twotruths-tibet/notes.html#4">4</a>]</sup> This means that the two truths relate to
                          “two objects of knowledge,” the idea it takes from the
                          statement of the Buddha from <em>Discourse on Meeting of the Father and
                          the Son (PitÄ�putrasamÄ�gama
                           SÅ«tra)<sup>[<a name="note-5" href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/twotruths-tibet/notes.html#5">5</a>]</sup></em> By <em>object of
                          knowledge</em> Gelug means an object that is cognizable
                          <em>(blo'i yul du bya rung ba).</em> It must be an object of
                          cognitive processes in general ranging from those of ordinary sentient
                          beings through to those of enlightened beings. This definition attempts
                          to capture any thing knowable in the broadest possible sense. Since the
                          Buddha maintains knowledge of the two truths to be necessary for
                          awakening, the understanding of the two truths must constitute an
                          exhaustive understanding of all objects of knowledge.</p>
              <p>Gelug's key argument to support this claim comes from
                          its two-nature theory in which it has been argued that every nominally
                          <em>(tha snyad)</em> or conventionally <em>(kun rdzob)</em> given
                          phenomenon possesses dual natures: namely, the <em>nominal</em> (or
                          conventional nature) and the <em>ultimate nature</em>. The conventional
                          nature is unreal and deceptive while the ultimate nature is real and
                          nondeceptive. Since two natures pertain to every phenomenon, the
                          division of the two truths means the division of each entity into two
                          natures. Thus the division of the two truths, “reveals that it
                          makes sense to divide even the nature of a single entity, like a
                          sprout, into dual natures—its conventional and its ultimate
                          natures. It does not however show,” as non-Gelug schools have it,
                          “that the one nature of the sprout is itself divided into two
                          truths in relation to ordinary beings <em>(so skye)</em> and to noble
                          beings (<em>Ä�ryas)</em>.” (Tsongkhapa 1984b: 173, 1992:
                          406)</p>
              <p>The relation of the two truths comes down to the way in
                          which the single entity appears to cognitive processes—deceptively 
                          and nondeceptively. The two natures correspond to these
                          deceptive or nondeceptive modes of appearance. While they both belong
                          to the same ontological entity, they are epistemically or conceptually
                          mutually exclusive. Take a sprout for instance. If it exists, it
                          necessarily exhibits a dual nature, and yet those two natures cannot be
                          ontologically distinct. The ultimate nature of the sprout cannot be
                          separate from its conventional nature—its color, texture,
                          shape, extension, and so on. As an object of knowledge, the sprout
                          retains its single ontological basis, but it is known through its two
                          natures. These two natures exclude one another so far as knowledge is
                          concerned. The cognitive process that knows the deceptive conventional
                          nature of the sprout does not have direct access to its nondeceptive
                          ultimate nature. Similarly, the cognitive process that apprehends the
                          nondeceptive ultimate nature of the sprout does not have direct access
                          to its deceptive conventional nature. In Newland's words:
                          “A table and its emptiness are a single entity. When an ordinary
                          conventional mind takes a table as its object of observation, it sees a
                          table. When a mind of ultimate analysis searches for the table, it
                          finds the emptiness of the table. Hence, the two truths are posited in
                          relation to a single entity by way of the perspectives of the observing
                          consciousness. This is as close as Ge-luk-bas will come to defining the
                          two truths as perspectives.” (1992: 49)</p>
              <p>Gelug's two-nature theory not only serves as the
                          basic reference point for its exposition of the basis of the division
                          of the two truths, their meanings and definitions, but also serves as
                          the basic ontological reference for its account of the relationship
                          between the two truths. Therefore Gelug proposes the view that the two
                          truths are of single entity with distinct conceptual identities. This
                          view is also founded on the theory of the two natures. But how are the
                          two natures related? Are they identical or distinct? For Gelug argues
                          that there are only two possibilities: either the two natures are
                          identical <em>(ngo bo gcig)</em> or distinct <em>(ngo bo tha dad);</em> there cannot be a third. (Tsongkhapa 1984b:176) They are related in
                          terms of being a single entity with distinct conceptual 
                          identities—thus they are both the same and different. Since the two
                          natures are the basis of the relationship between the two truths, the
                          relationship between the two truths will reflect the relationship
                          between the two natures. Just as the two natures are of a same entity,
                          ultimate truth and conventional truth are of same ontological
                          status.</p>
              <p>Gelug argues that the relationship between the two truths,
                          therefore, the two natures, is akin to the relationship between being
                          conditioned and being impermanent. (Tsongkhapa 1984b:176) It
                          appropriates this point from NÄ�gÄ�rjuna's
                          <em>Bodhicittavivaraá¹‡a,</em> which states:
                          “Reality is not perceived as separate from conventionality. The
                          conventionality is explained to be empty. Empty alone is the
                          conventionality, if one of them does not exist, neither will the other,
                          like being conditioned and being impermanent.” (v.67–68)
                          (NÄ�gÄ�rjuna 1991:45–45, cited Tsongkhapa, 1984b: 176; Khedrub
                          Jé 1992: 364) Commenting on this passage from the
                          <em>Bodhicittavivaraá¹‡a</em>, Tsongkhapa argues
                          that the first four lines (in original Tibetan verses) show that things
                          as they really are, are not ontologically distinct from that of the
                          conventionality. The latter two lines (in the original Tibetan verse)
                          show their relationship such that if one did not exist, neither could
                          the other <em>(med na mi ‘bung ba'i ‘brel ba).</em> This, in fact, he says, is equivalent to their being constituted by
                          <em>a single-property relationship</em> <em>(bdag cig pa'i
                          ‘brel ba).</em> Therefore, like the case of being conditioned and
                          being impermanent, the relation between t</p>

              <p><strong>Interestingly Mipham Rinpoche also says that “the two truths constitute a single entity but different conceptual identities (ngo bo gcig la ldog pa tha dad). “This is because,” he says, “appearance and emptiness are indistinguishable. This is ascertained through reliable cognitions (tshad ma) by means of which the two truths are investigated. What appears is empty. If emptiness were to exist separately from what appears, the reality of that [apparent] phenomenon would not be empty. Thus the two [truths] are not distinct.” (Mipham 1977: 81f) The identity of ultimate truth at issue here, according to Mipham, is that of absolute ultimate (rnam grangs min pa'i don dam ste), rather than provisional ultimate. This is because the kind of ultimate truth under discussion when we are discussing its relation with conventional truth is the ultimate truth “which is beyond the bound of any expression, although it is an object of direct perception.” (Mipham 1977: 81f)</strong></p>

              <p>FOUR ESSENTIAL POINTS</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Taught by Lopon Tenzin Namdak, </p>
              <p>New York city, October 1991, </p>
              <p>Transcribed and edited by Vajranatha </p>
              <p>The short text we have here is from the "Nam mkha phrul mdzod" collection. Here there are four essential points for understanding the nature of Dzogchen. First Dzogchen does not contradict the Two Truths. Second, in Dzogchen there is no grasping at the view that a self exists. Third the Dzogchenpa's conduct is not just going around doing whatever he wants at the moment. And fourth there is no special apprehension of anything.</p>
              <p>As for the first point according to the Sutras it is well known that the Buddha taught the Two Truths: the Relative Truth and the Absolute Truth. They are without question the Buddha s teachings and so when we understand Dzogchen it is important not to speak against these Two Truths. However Dzogchen which is the highest teaching of the Buddha teaches that causality that is to say karmic causes and their consequences is not the highest truth. In the Bonpo tradition we find two methods for proceeding along the path First according to the highest way (Dzogchen) among the Nine Ways the Nature of Mind is empty. Therefore its essence has nothing to do with causality; it is in no way changed or modified by karmic causes and their consequences. It totally transcends them; it is beyond cause and effect and so we say that it is primordial pure (ka dag). A practitioner who has actually attained Buddhahood remaining continuously in the Natural State has nothing to realize as a cause for anything else. He does not expect any virtuous qualities to arise as the consequence of virtuous actions nor does he fear any bad consequences of wrong actions. This is because the Natural State is beyond all karmic causality and its effects. That is why Dzogchen does not speak about karmic causes when referring to the Natural State. But otherwise if the practitioner is not actually in the Natural State (and this is ones usual ordinary Samsaric existence] everything proceeds according to karmic causes. The actions we do will have their consequences.</p>
              <p>Second, there is the way of proceeding according to the eight other ways among the Nine Ways of Bon (theg pa rim dgu) that are not Dzogchen in terms of their view and practice. Here matters are mostly understood in terms of Relative Truth and therefore we speak about karmic causes rather extensively. All results whether good or bad arise from causes. In the same way the visions that arise in such practices as Thodgal and dark retreat belong to sphere of Relative Truth (snang lugs kun rdzob bden pa). But the contradiction is only apparent here. From the standpoint of the Natural State we speak in terms of the Absolute Truth. Everything is empty and lacks any inherent existence Dzogchen asserts that the Natural State is beyond causality that it does not rely on any karmic causes. But it does assert that the totality of appearances (snang lugs) depends on causes. This is especially the case with our impure karmic vision and one instance of such impure vision is our human karmic vision our existence as a human being as we know it Karmic vision is brought about by causes and all of us perceive this world as human karmic vision because we all possess the cause for that karmic vision. It is impure because it is caused by ignorance and the passions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Here we speak of two kinds of practitioners ordinary persons and realized beings or adepts. We should remember that the content of the teachings when they are expressed in words depends on who is the audience listening to the teachings. The fundamental Dzogchen precepts were mainly revealed directly by the Primordial Buddha the Dharmakaya Samantabhadra or Kuntu Zangpo (Kun tu bzang po) and the Dharmakaya always spoke the Truth and never otherwise. The Dharmakaya spoke from the standpoint of the Natural State For this reason Dzogchen does not accept as its view the Two Truths. It accepts only a single Truth or Source called the Unique Essence (thig le nyag gcig). This is the Natural State in which appearances and emptiness are inseparable. However our ordinary visions (impure karmic vision) arise from causes and Dzogchen agrees with that. So if we understand Dzogchen then we do not find any inherent contradiction here. These Truths the Two Truths and the Unique Essence have different meanings. This is the first point.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for the second point Dzogchen does not grasp at or apprehend a view that a permanent self exists (bdag gi lta ba). In normal life we are always thinking of ourselves. All of our thinking is tied up with this notion of a self [as something real and abiding] and all of our emotional reactions are predicated on this self. The name for this process of constantly creating a self wheres in reality there is none there is grasping at a self (bdag dzin) or self centeredness. Up until now this unconscious process has led us to accumulate negative karmic causes throughout countless lifetimes This Dagdzin or grasping at a self represents ignorance here meaning a lack of real knowledge and awareness (ma rig pa). This ignorance has no absolute beginning in time; it has always been with us in each lifetime as an integral part of the habit of our existence. When we see some thing immediately we accept or reject it. We judge the perceived object to be good or bad and we have a corresponding emotional reaction of attachment or aversion But if we do not have any grasping (dzin pa) at the object (that is the mental process of apprehending and judging a perception) then we will not develop attachment for it.</p>
              <p>For this reason we must look back into ourselves and seek to find this so-called self (bdag). How do we think? We think that our perception exists externally to us and it is objective and real It is really there and so we grasp at it. But if we search into this what is it that we grasp? Where is the grasper? It is like opening a series of Chinese boxes. Eventually, we find that there is nothing there to grasp. Look at how we do this grasping or Dzinpa For example we have a headache and so we think Oh I have a headache! Certainly there is the experience of a headache yet this headache is not us Nor is the head us And yet we grasp and think I am sick! But look more closely at this. There is no I existing here only the experience of pain It is the same with the other parts of the body We can examine all of these parts but where do we find any I? This identification process where we predicate an "I to all of our experiences is what we meant by Dagdzin or grasping at a self Yes there exist all these parts belonging to our body but when we pull them an apart even down to the last cell where do we find any I?" </p>
              <p>Then we conclude that even though the self (bdag) is not the physical body it must be our mind or consciousness. But we can proceed here with the mind in the same way as we did with the physical body searching for a self or I. We will not find any self. For example, there is eye consciousness If that were not present we would not see anything at all even though the eye organ is present there and functional. A corpse n-tay have its eye organs in tact but it does not see anything because there is no consciousness present But is this eye consciousness the I or not? We can proceed to investigate in the same way all of the other sense consciousnesses in the current of our daily experience We have searched outside through our perceptions and through the parts of our body and have found that there exists no self there. Now we search inside through our sense consciousnesses and find that there exists no self here either. But what of our mind? Is this the self or I ? If we examine the mind we discover that it is not a single unified entity or substance; rather it is a process occurring in time a succession of states of consciousness having varied mental contents It is like a stream or a river that changes from moment to moment It is never the same. Where in these states of consciousness and contents of consciousness do we find a self or I ? We have searched outside and inside exhaustively and what do we find? Where is this self of which we speak so freely? All the things we see and experience are not this so-called self. They are not us and yet we grasp at them as if they were ourselves.</p>
              <p>Without there being any certain solid objective reality out there in space still we grasp at perceptions of the world as if they are real Perceived objects do not exist inherently but we do perceive them as if they existed objectively This is Relative Truth External appearances do exist in terms of Relative Truth but this is not the real truth It is ignorance This ignorance has existed from the very beginning until now and it is the source of our circulating in Samsara We may think that My conscious self grasps at an object but there is no object there But this is an illusion also We habitually believe that external objects have an inherent existence but this is not so Nothing exists inherently Otherwise there would be no possibility of change in the world Everything would be locked into its essence or inherent nature But change is our experience So there is no inherent existence yet grasping persists So this consciousness which grasps is not reliable and leads us into error There are perceptions— we see many beautiful and ugly things We judge them as such and feel attachment or aversion for them There is no real object out there that is beautiful or ugly because these judgments are created by our minds but we grasp at these objects In the dark, we mistakenly perceive a pillar as our enemy and we hit it with our fist This enemy did not exist independently; it was created by our minds If we go for a time into a totally dark room our imagination may create many strange effects which we see They may look very real but if we chase them we hit our head against the wall because they are illusions So there is no point in having desires for these phantoms and illusions which are as unreal as dreams If we understand this point our desires and our aversions will decrease.</p>
              <p>Even though we cannot find out there any inherent existence still we cannot say that we do not exist because we are doing this grasping We exist because we are engaged in this activity the process of Dzinpa or grasping at perceptions But if we search on the inside for some inherent existence we do not find anything either But this does not mean that we do not exist For example take the individual sitting here named George We can say that he is my son or my friend or my father or my enemy or whatever Everyone in the room here has a different idea of who George really is depending on our relationship to him But who is the real George? If George is my son he cannot be my father Even if he is my son son is not his real essence to the exclusion of anything else To his own son he is my father So George is created by our perception and our consciousness and by our definition of him in relation to us That determines what he is; it defines him So on the object side George has no inherent existence but this does not mean that he is not sitting here right in front of us all On the subject side everything exists because we are conscious and are having perceptions But on the object side nothing exists as a solid unchanging reality Therefore there is no point in feeling attachments or aversions for these appearances To understand this is the real Dharma.</p>
              <p>It is not easy to stop the accumulating of negative actions without a strong antidote But through practice this antidote can become quite strong and in this way we can mitigate the influence of the passions These negative emotions will become weaker and grow less because of our practice of meditation Then we will do less harm to others and we will accumulate virtues Just reciting mantras or circumambulating a stupa is not enough It is bringing about a change in our consciousness that is most important.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The third point here means that we as Dzogchen practitioners do not go about acting on our momentary impulses doing whatever we might feel like at that moment At this present time we have this human existence and this human body and that is something not easy to get because it requires the accumulation of a great deal of meritorious karma over countless lifetimes Even if we get a human existence we still may find many difficult conditions such as being born deaf and dumb or being bom in a country where there is no Dharma So we need not only a human rebirth but the opportunity to come into contact with the teachings and the capacity to understand the teachings and practice them We have to examine how we live our lives Because life is impermanent we should not postpone the Dharma to next month or next year and not waste our capacities of body speech and mind We waste our opportunity in this life by not doing any virtuous actions. Thinking bad of others and speaking Ul of them is wasting our minds and our speech It is just stupid to waste our opportunities when we can use our body speech and mind to practice to grow and to develop And so in terms of Dzogchen we must use every opportunity to do meditation practice in order to familiarize ourselves with the Natural State No excuses no saying that we have no time or that we are too busy But what and how long we practice depends on our capacity and our circumstances. </p>
              <p>Very well and good We are practicing Dzogchen But the third point means that we cannot simply go about in a libertine fashion doing whatever we like and saying that there is no sin or consequences to our actions. Even though Dzogchen asserts that the Natural State is beyond cause and effect and that karmic causality does not modify to it in any way this applies only to us as practitioners of Dzogchen when we are actually in the Natural State Otherwise our consciousness and our lives are totally under the rule of karrna Most of the time during the day we are not in the Natural State and so karma applies very much to our normal daily thoughts and actions. We are living in the relative condition save only when we actually find ourselves in the Natural State. So to say we can do whatever we like is not the correct view of Dzogchen These momentary desires and impulses we experience are conditioned things created by our unconscious karmic traces to follow after them is not freedom no matter how much we speak about Dzogchen. Only for the Natural State are there no rules or limitations and only in the Natural State is found there total freedom.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As four the fourth point in Dzogchen there is nothing special to be grasped or apprehended. In terms of our ordinary common vision and our daily life we can say that everything is an illusion and created by our consciousness. If we really understand this then there is no point in grasping strongly at anything, for example as their being our enemies or our friends. We are not attached too much to anything; we do not grasp at wealth or possessions. Nothing is special. We come to understand that in terms of their reality everything is equal. All things are equally empty and an things are equally illusion. If we understand that all things are in fact illusions then there is no point in having negative emotions with regard to them. All of life is like a dream We see it yes but in the end it dissolves and leaves no trace. But we, the Natural State remain. So these are four essential points to remember.</p>

              <p>Thanks for all your clarifications. I think i just needed to get this out of my system.  This discussion has made me more interested in the Madyamika. In the past, i used to disdain the philosophical systems as so much conceptual proliferations and prefered to just concentrate on actual practice.  However, i see now that it is also important to get a good understanding of the theory...</p>

              <p>The Differences between Mahamudra and Dzogchen</p>
              <p>Whether on the gross, subtle, or subtlest clear light level, the nature of mental activity remains the same. Mahamudra (phyag-chen, great seal) practice, found in the Kagyu, Sakya, and Gelug/Kagyu traditions, focuses on this nature. The Kagyu and Gelug/Kagyu traditions have both sutra and anuttarayoga tantra levels of the practice, while Sakya only an anuttarayoga one. In other words, Sakya mahamudra focuses only on the nature of clear light mental activity, while the other two traditions include focus on the nature of the other levels of mental activity as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Rigpa shares the same nature as the three levels of mental activity analyzed by the non-dzogchen schools. Dzogchen practice, however, is exclusively done on the highest level of tantra and deals only with the subtlest level of mental activity. Moreover, dzogchen does not focus merely on the conventional and deepest natures of rigpa, but also on its various aspects and facets.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Differences between Rigpa and Clear Light</p>
              <p>Further, rigpa is not an exact equivalent of clear light. Rather, it is a subdivision of it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Different Degrees of Being Unstained</p>
              <p>The clear light level of mind is naturally devoid of grosser levels of mental activity, which are the levels at which conceptual cognition and the fleeting stains of disturbing emotions and attitudes occur. Before enlightenment, however, clear light mental activity is not devoid of the habits of grasping for true existence, which may be imputed or labeled on it. Nevertheless, when clear light is manifest, these habits do not cause clear light activity to make discordant (dual) appearances of true existence (gnyis-snang), nor do they prevent it from cognizing the two truths simultaneously (appearances and voidness), which they do when grosser levels of mind are active.</p>
              <p>Rigpa, on the other hand, is devoid of even the habits of grasping for true existence. It is the totally unstained natural state of the mind.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p><strong>This could explain for the difference in views and and also to me it explains for the criticism of Mahamudra system by other schools too.</strong></p>

              </p><p>Dzogchen Explains from the Point of View of the Result</p>
              <p>According to the early twentieth-century Rimey (nonsectarian) master Jamyang-kyentzey-wangpo (‘ Jam-dbyangs mkhyen-brtse dbang-po), the four traditions of Tibetan Buddhism may be differentiated according to the point of view from which they explain: basis, path, or result.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Gelug tradition explains from the point of view of the basis – in other words, from the viewpoint of ordinary practitioners. For example, such persons are capable of perceiving appearances or voidness only separately, although the two are inseparable. Therefore, Gelug explains appearances and voidness as the two truths and thus deepest truth is self-voidness alone. Consequently, Gelug presents the svabhavakaya (ngo-bo-nyid sku, body of self-nature) of a Buddha as the voidness of a Buddha’s omniscient awareness.</p>
              <p>The Sakya tradition explains from the viewpoint of the path. Although clear light mental activity on the basis level, for example at the moment of death, cannot be said to be blissful; nevertheless, it is made blissful on the anuttarayoga tantra path. Speaking from that point of view, Sakya asserts clear light awareness as naturally blissful.</p>
              <p>Nyingma and Kagyu traditions explain from the resultant point of view of a Buddha. For example, Buddhas nonconceptually cognize appearances and voidness simultaneously. Therefore, Nyingma and Kagyu – and thus dzogchen – explain deepest truth as inseparable voidness and appearance and, consequently, they present svabhavakaya as the inseparability of the other three Buddha-bodies.</p>
