              <blockquote>
              <p><strong>Itches</strong></p>
              <p>When sitting [in] meditation it's very common to get itches somewhere on your 
              body or face.  Don't move to scratch it.  Instead sit with the itch and 
              use it as a focus for your meditation.  It essence <strong>"scratch the itch with your mind"</strong>.  Focus in on it, feel it, accept it and be easy with it.  Notice how it feels, notice your reactions to it and the urge to want to scratch 
              it.  Watch the changing in sensation and then watch it pass over time. 
               Itches are a wonderful way to be present with the changing conditions 
              of the body and how they manifest bodily sensations, feelings and 
              emotions in us, and how we have desire to do something about them or 
              desire to move away from them.  This is where our practice is.  Next 
              time you get an itch, even when you are not doing sitting meditation, 
              try this technique.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.themindfulmoment.com/2010/09/meditation-technique-1-itches.html">http://www.themindfulmoment.com/2010/09/meditation-technique-1-itches.html</a></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>He also had this to say:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>There are two ways to deal with the itch.  Continue to focus on 
              your normal breath meditation with the breath as the meditation object 
              and just leave the itch as something in the background.  The other way 
              to deal with it is to put the attention on the itch itself and make the 
              itch the object of the meditation.  In this way the itch becomes the 
              thing you are focusing on.  Dive into the sensation and feel it fully.  See all its detail and how the sensation changes.</p>
              <p>So both of these are good ways to work with itches. 
               Just don't scratch it.  ;-)  In time the itch will just pass.  If it is
               an itch due to rash then the itch may continue because there is a 
              physical condition.  You can however eventually learn through meditation
               to experience the sensation as just raw sensation and not as the 
              irritation of emotion and mind that we place on top of the itch (or 
              pain).</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Glad to have these tips from Jagaro  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/bigsmile.png" alt="bigsmile.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And my own 2 cents :  if it's discernibly a rash, then get it treated too.</p>

              <p>Realization  - Thank you for posting my comments and sharing with others.  And yes, haha, please get the itch seen by a doctor if you has a rash.  ;-)</p>
              <p>Dawnfirstlight - To answer your question, yes you can use a similar technique for pain however pain and our reaction to it is slightly different than the reaction we have to itches.  An itch creates a desire to resolve the itch, so there is an arising of intention to do something to bring about a solution to our problem - we want to scratch it.  With pain we can't simply scratch it but but we do try to resolve it through aversion, we try to push the pain away. So in both see there is this inherent drive for resolution.  How we go about seeking that resolution is different.  Instead of just being with each experience fully for how it is we try to make it something different.  One is desire, the other is aversion.  So we come to see how we bring the "me" into the experience to change it, "I don't like this" and so we seek to alter it.  So you can try the same technique with pain, either continue the meditation and notice the experience and reactions to the pain or place the awareness on the pain and examine its nature directly.  Both are beneficial practices.</p>
              <p>Of course if the pain is severe then use commonsense and be kind to yourself and end  the meditation session and try again next time. Just watch however, sometimes the story of how bad we <em>think </em>the pain is, is actually worse than what the pain <em>actually </em>is.  so stay with it as long as you can. Pain is often and most commonly a psychological and emotional response to a sensation in the body. The sensation is one thing, but the layers and layers of emotion and thoughts on top is often <em>our</em> experience of "pain". Knowing the difference takes time and practice.</p>
              <p>I hope that is helpful.</p>
