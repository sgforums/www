                  give up his political role as head of the world's exiled Tibetan community. The
                  Buddhist leader will be dying sooner or later, the article says, and maybe
                  sooner.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; vertical-align: top;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">So what will happen then to
                  Tibetan Buddhism and the cause of free Tibet?</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; vertical-align: top;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">So you get paragraphs like
                  this:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal; background: #F3F8FC; vertical-align: top;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";'>The economic
                  potency of China has made the Dalai Lama a political liability for an
                  increasing number of world leaders, who now shy away from him for fear of
                  inviting China’s wrath. Even Pope Francis, the boldest pontiff in decades,
                  report­edly declined a meeting in Rome last December. When the Dalai Lama dies,
                  it is not at all clear what will happen to the six million Tibetans in China.
                  The Chinese Communist Party, though officially atheistic, will take charge of
                  finding an incarnation of the present Dalai Lama. Indoctrinated and controlled
                  by the Communist Party, the next leader of the Tibetan community could help
                  Beijing cement its hegemony over Tibet. And then there is the 150,000-strong
                  community of Tibetan exiles, which, increasingly politically fractious, is held
                  together mainly by the Dalai Lama. The Tibetan poet and activist Tenzin
                  Tsundue, who has disagreed with the Dalai Lama’s tactics, told me that his
                  absence will create a vacuum for Tibetans. The Dalai Lama’s younger brother,
                  Tenzin Choegyal, was more emphatic: “We are finished once His Holiness is gone.”</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; vertical-align: top;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I had forgotten the dust-up<span> </span></span><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/the-pope/11357141/Pope-Francis-leaves-door-open-to-Dalai-Lama-meeting.html"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #2777ae;">about the pope not
                  meeting with the Buddhist leader</span></a><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">, but
                  a year has passed since then and they have yet to meet.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; vertical-align: top;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The article continues on,
                  recounting how 140 Buddhist monks and nuns have publicly set themselves on fire
                  to protest the suppression of Tibet by China. And what does the Dalai Lama do
                  in response?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal; background: #F3F8FC; vertical-align: top;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";'>As if in
                  response to these multiple crises in his homeland, the Dalai Lama has embarked
                  on some improbable intellectual journeys. In 2011, he renounced his role as the
                  temporal leader of the Tibetan people and declared that he would focus on his
                  spiritual and cultural commitments. Today, the man who in old photos of Tibet
                  can be seen enacting religious rites wearing a conical yellow hat — in front of
                  thangkas, or scrolls, swarming with scowling monsters and copulating deities —
                  speaks of going ‘‘beyond religion’’ and embracing ‘‘secular ethics’’:
                  principles of selflessness and compassion rooted in the fundamental Buddhist
                  notion of interconnectedness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal; background: #F3F8FC; vertical-align: top;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";'>Increasingly,
                  the Dalai Lama addresses himself to a nondenominational audience and seems
                  perversely determined to undermine the authority of his own tradition. He has
                  intimated that the next Dalai Lama could be female. He has asserted that
                  certain Buddhist scriptures disproved by science should be abandoned. He has
                  suggested — frequently, during the months that I saw him — that the institution
                  of the Dalai Lama has outlived its purpose. Having embarked in the age of the
                  selfie on a project of self-abnegation, he is now flirting with
                  ever-more-radical ideas. One morning at his Dharamsala residence in May this
                  year, he told me that he may one day travel to China, but not as the Dalai
                  Lama.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; vertical-align: top;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">As much as this leader would like to shuck off his
                  political obligations, the world won’t let him, the article notes. There is
                  simply no one to take his place.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; vertical-align: top;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Still, as a political
                  negotiator, the article states, he has failed. But who wouldn’t? Was the Dalai
                  Lama supposed to be a modern-day Gandhi, bringing China to its knees somehow?
                  Rather, it’s China that is setting the conditions. The Dalai Lama very much
                  wants to return to Tibet before he dies. By the time you’ve finished this piece,
                  you’ll be convinced that will never happen.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; vertical-align: top;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">One thing the writer – who
                  is an Indian intellectual and author who’s had access to the Buddhist spiritual
                  leader for years – brings out is the ordinariness of the man. He lists a number
                  of things the Dalai Lama will do to confound people and keep them from putting
                  him on a pedestal.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; vertical-align: top;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I have covered two of the
                  DL’s appearances in the Washington, DC area. The one included an esoteric
                  discourse on Buddhism that defied translation. But the other had quite a bit of
                  barnyard humor, which was tough to square with a world-famous monk. I never
                  knew if the latter was part of an earthiness that comes with being from that
                  part of the world, or something else. The author of this piece likewise
                  captures the oddity of the Dalai Lama, who will sometimes make weird jokes or
                  pronouncements in public settings that make little or no sense or seem odd at
                  best.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; vertical-align: top;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Couple that with examples
                  throughout the piece about how the Dalai Lama and his cause are losing traction
                  throughout the West, and one concludes that by waiting out the Dalai Lama, the
                  Chinese may win this battle.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; vertical-align: top;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The piece has way more to
                  say about politics than religion, although it does have flashes of insight like
                  the following:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal; background: #F3F8FC; vertical-align: top;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";'>The ‘‘world
                  picture,’’ as he saw it, was bleak. People all over the world were killing in
                  the name of their religions. Even Buddhists in Burma were tormenting Rohingya
                  Muslims. This was why he had turned away from organized religion, engaged with
                  quantum physics and started to emphasize the secular values of compassion. It
                  was no longer feasible, he said, to construct an ethical existence on the basis
                  of traditional religion in multicultural societies.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; vertical-align: top;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">When asked if he means to reincarnate once he dies,
                  the Dalai Lama answers that he does not. Our GetReligion<span> </span>colleague Ira Rifkin<span> </span></span><a href="http://www.getreligion.org/getreligion/2015/3/19/when-iron-birds-fly-and-chinese-politicos-ponder-the-politics-of-reincarnation-?rq=dalai%20lama"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #2777ae;">covered this
                  pronouncement</span><span><span style="font-size: 13pt; color: #2777ae;"> </span></span></a><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">earlier this year. The institution of the Dalai Lama,
                  the author of the magazine article points out, has reached the end of its
                  usefulness.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; vertical-align: top;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">So what will happen with
                  Tibet? In one sense, the article leaves you hanging. In another sense, it’s
                  clear that the Dalai Lama has already checked out.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; vertical-align: top;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">There are a few journalistic
                  burps in this piece, one being that the Buddha was born in Nepal, not India as
                  the article says. And as one commentator pointed out, Tibetan Buddhism believes
                  its lamas must reincarnate until everyone is ready for full enlightenment. So
                  how can this Dalai Lama say he will not reincarnate?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; vertical-align: top;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Otherwise, it raises the
                  right questions about a man who, along with Pope Francis, is one of the world’s
                  top spiritual leaders.</span></p>
