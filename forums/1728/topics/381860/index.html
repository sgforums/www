              <h1>Beyond No-Self</h1>
              <p class="lead">According to many Buddhist schools, grasping at the 
              notion of a real and substantial self is the root of ignorance. But 
              while insight into the truth of personal selflessness, or no-self, is an
               important step, says the <strong>Dalai Lama</strong> in his new book, <em>The 
              Middle Way</em>, it doesn’t go far enough.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <hr>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The teaching on the twelve links of dependent origination is common 
              to all Buddhist traditions; however, the interpretation of the twelve 
              links, their processes, and particularly the explanation of the first 
              link, ignorance, is different for the Madhyamaka school than it is for 
              the other philosophical schools.</p>
              <p>The other schools define fundamental ignorance as grasping at the 
              self-existence of the person. Grasping at the self-existence of a person
               means believing there is a self that is somehow distinct from our body 
              and mind—our aggregates. Such a self is thought to act like a master 
              over the physical and mental components of a person.</p>
              <p>The seventh-century Indian Buddhist philosopher Dharmakirti gives an 
              example of this belief in his <em>Exposition of Valid Cognition</em> (<em>Pramanavarttika</em>):
               Say an old person whose body is deteriorating and is full of aches is 
              given the opportunity to exchange his body for a much healthier body. 
              From the depths of his mind would emerge a ready willingness to take 
              part in such an exchange. This suggests that deep down, we believe in a 
              self that is distinct from our body, yet somehow master over it.</p>
              <p>Similarly, if a person with a poor memory or some other mental 
              deficiency were given an opportunity to exchange his or her mind for a 
              fresh one with superior cognitive powers, again from the depth of the 
              heart would arise a real willingness to enter into the transaction. This
               suggests that not only in relation to our body but also in relation to 
              our mental faculties, we believe in a self who would benefit from such 
              an exchange, a self that it is somehow the ruler or master of the body 
              and mind.</p>
              <p>The other schools define grasping at self-existence as the belief in 
              this kind of discrete self—a self-sufficient and substantially real 
              master that is in charge of the servant body-and-mind. For them, the 
              negation of that kind of self is the full meaning of selflessness, or 
              no-self. When we search for such a self by investigating whether it is 
              separate from the psychophysical aggregates or identical to them, we 
              discover that no such self exists. The other schools’ interpretation of 
              the twelve links of dependent origination therefore defines fundamental 
              ignorance as grasping at such a self-sufficient and substantially real 
              self.</p>
              <p>Madhyamikas would agree that gaining insight into such a selflessness
               does open the way to reversing the cycle. However, as Nagarjuna argues,
               while this is a form of grasping at selfhood, it does not get at the 
              subtlest meaning of selflessness.</p>
              <p>With insight into this grosser type of selflessness, you can reverse 
              some habits related to the grosser afflictions. But wherever there is 
              grasping at an intrinsic existence of the aggregates—the body and mind— 
              there will always be a danger of grasping at a self or “I” based on 
              those aggregates. As Nagarjuna writes in his <em>Precious Garland</em> (<em>Ratnavali</em>):</p>
              <blockquote>As long as there is grasping at the aggregates,<br> there is grasping at self;<br> when there is grasping at self there is karma,<br> and from it comes birth.</blockquote>
              <p>Nagarjuna argues that just as grasping at the intrinsic existence of 
              the person or self is fundamental ignorance, grasping at the intrinsic 
              existence of the aggregates is also grasping at self-existence. 
              Madhyamikas therefore distinguish two kinds of emptiness—the lack of any
               self that is separate from the aggregates, which they call the <em>emptiness
               of self</em>, and the lack of intrinsic existence of the aggregates 
              themselves—and by extension all phenomena—which they call the <em>emptiness
               of phenomena</em>. Realizing the first kind of emptiness, Nagarjuna and 
              his followers argue, may temporarily suppress manifest afflictions, but 
              it can never eradicate the subtle grasping at the true existence of 
              things. To understand the meaning of the first link, fundamental 
              ignorance, in its subtlest sense, we must identify and understand it as 
              grasping at the intrinsic existence of all phenomena—including the 
              aggregates, sense spheres, and all external objects—and not merely our 
              sense of “I.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>The Relative <em>I</em></h2>
              <p>The search for the nature of the self, the “I” that naturally does 
              not desire suffering and naturally wishes to attain happiness, may have 
              begun, in India, around three thousand years ago, if not earlier. 
              Throughout human history people have empirically observed that certain 
              types of strong, powerful emotions—such as hatred and extreme 
              attachment—create problems. Hatred, in fact, arises out of 
              attachment—attachment, for example, to family members, community, or 
              self. Extreme attachment creates anger or hatred when these things are 
              threatened. Anger then leads to all kinds of conflict and battles. Some 
              human beings have stepped back, observed, and inquired into the role of 
              these emotions, their function, their value, and their effects.</p>
              <p>We can discuss powerful emotions such as attachment or anger in and 
              of themselves, but these cannot actually be comprehended in isolation 
              from their being experienced by an individual. There is no conceiving an
               emotion except as an experience of some being. In fact, we cannot even 
              separate the objects of attachment, anger, or hatred from the individual
               who conceives of them as such because the characterization does not 
              reside in the object. One person’s friend is another person’s enemy. So 
              when we speak of these emotions, and particularly their objects, we 
              cannot make objective determinations independent of relationships.</p>
              <p>Just as we can speak of someone being a mother, a daughter, or a 
              spouse only in relation to another person, likewise the objects of 
              attachment or anger are only desirable or hateful in relation to the 
              perceiver who is experiencing attachment or anger. All of these—mother 
              and daughter, enemy and friend—are relative terms. The point is that 
              emotions need a frame of reference, an “I” or self that experiences 
              them, before we can understand the dynamics of these emotions.</p>
              <p>A reflective person will then ask, What exactly is the nature of the 
              individual, the self? And once raised, this question leads to another: 
              Where is this self? Where could it exist?</p>
              <p>We take for granted terms like east, west, north, and south, but if 
              we examine carefully, we see these again are relative terms that have 
              meaning only in relation to something else. Often, that point of 
              reference turns out to be wherever you are. One could argue, in fact, 
              that in the Buddhist worldview, the center of cyclic existence is 
              basically where you are. Thus, in a certain sense, you are the center of
               the universe!</p>
              <p>Not only that, but for each person, we ourselves are the most 
              precious thing, and we are constantly engaged in ensuring the well-being
               of this most precious thing. In one sense, our business on earth is to 
              take care of that precious inner core. In any case, this is how we tend 
              to relate to the world and others. We create a universe with ourselves 
              in the center, and from this point of reference, we relate to the rest 
              of the world. With this understanding, it becomes more crucial to ask 
              what that self is. What exactly is it?</p>
              <p>Buddhists speak of samsara and nirvana—cyclic existence and its 
              transcendence. The former, as we have seen, can be defined as ignorance 
              of the ultimate nature of reality and the latter as insight into the 
              ultimate nature of reality, or knowledge of it. So long as we remain 
              ignorant of the ultimate nature of reality, we are in samsara. Once we 
              gain insight into the ultimate nature of reality, we move toward 
              nirvana, or the transcendence of unenlightened existence. They are 
              differentiated on the basis of knowledge. But here again, we cannot 
              speak of knowledge without speaking of an individual who has or does not
               have knowledge. We come back again to the question of the self. What 
              exactly is its nature?</p>
              <p>This type of inquiry predates the Buddha. Such questioning was 
              already prevalent in India before the Buddha arrived. Until he taught, 
              the dominant belief was that since everyone has an innate sense of 
              selfhood, a natural instinctive notion of “I am,” there must be some 
              enduring thing that is the real self. Since the physical and mental 
              faculties that constitute our existence are transient—they change, age, 
              and then one day cease—they cannot be the true self. Were they the real 
              self, then our intuition of an enduring self that is somehow independent
               but also a master of our body and mind would have to be false. Thus, 
              before the Buddha, the concept of the self as independent and separate 
              from the physical and the mental faculties, was commonly accepted.</p>
              <p>Innate grasping of selfhood is reinforced by this kind of 
              philosophical reflection. These Indian philosophers maintained that the 
              self did not undergo a process of change. We say, “when I was young, I 
              was like this,” and “when I am older, I will do this,” and these 
              philosophers asserted that these statements presume the presence of an 
              unchanging entity that constitutes our identity throughout the different
               stages of our life.</p>
              <p>These thinkers also maintained that since highly advanced meditators 
              could recall their past lives, this supported their position that the 
              self takes rebirth, moving from one life to the next. They maintained 
              that this true self was unchanging and eternal and, somehow, independent
               of the physical and the mental aggregates. That was largely the 
              consensus before the Buddha.</p>
              <p>The Buddha argued against this position. Not only is our intuition of
               an inborn self a delusion, he said, the philosophical tenets that 
              strengthen and reinforce such a belief are a source of all kinds of 
              false views. The Buddhist sutras therefore refer to the belief in 
              selfhood itself as the mind of the deceiver Mara—the embodiment of 
              delusion—and as the source of all problems. The Buddha rejected the idea
               of a self that is somehow independent of the body and mind.</p>
              <p>Does that mean that the person does not, in any sense whatsoever, 
              exist at all? Buddha responded that the person does indeed exist, but 
              only in relation to the physical and mental aggregates and in dependence
               on them. Thus the existence of the individual is accepted only as a 
              dependent entity and not as an independent, absolute reality.</p>
              <p>Buddhist philosophical schools therefore all agree that an 
              independent self, separate from the body and mind, cannot be found. 
              However, when we say “I do this” or “I do that,” what exactly is the 
              true referent of the person? What exactly is the person then? Diverse 
              opinions arose among the Buddhist schools regarding the exact 
              identification of the nature of this dependent person. Given their 
              shared acceptance of existence across lifetimes, all Buddhist 
              philosophical schools rule out the continuum of the body as constituting
               the continuity of the person. Therefore, the differences of opinion 
              surround the way that the continuum of consciousness could be the basis 
              for locating the person or the individual.</p>
              <p>In a passage in his <em>Precious Garland</em>, Nagarjuna dissects the 
              concept of a person and its identity by explaining that a person is not 
              the earth element, water element, fire element, wind element, space, or 
              consciousness. And apart from these, he asks, what else could a person 
              be? To this he responds that a person exists as the convergence of these
               six constituents. The term “convergence” is the crucial word, as it 
              suggests the interaction of the constituents in mutual interdependence.</p>
              <p>How do we understand the concept of dependence? It is helpful to 
              reflect on a statement by Chandrakirti in his commentary on Nagarjuna’s <em>Fundamental
               Stanzas on the Middle Way</em>, where the following explicit explanation
               of how to understand a buddha in terms of dependent origination is 
              found. He writes, “What is it then? We posit the tathagata in dependence
               upon the aggregates, for it cannot be asserted to be either identical 
              with or separate from the aggregates.” His point is that if we search 
              for the essence of something believing we can pinpoint some real 
              thing—something objectively real from its own side that exists as a 
              valid referent of the term or concept—then we will fail to find anything
               at all.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>Time and the Self</h2>
              <p>In our day-to-day interactions, we often speak of time. We all take 
              for granted the reality of time. Were we to search for what exactly time
               is, we could do so in two ways. One is to search with the belief that 
              we should be able to find something objectively real that we can define 
              as <em>time</em>. But we immediately run into a problem. We find that time
               can only be understood on the basis of something else, in relation to a
               particular phenomenon or event. The other way to search is in a 
              relative framework, not presuming an objectively real entity.</p>
              <p>Take, for example, the present moment. If we search for the present 
              moment believing that we should be able to find a unique entity in the 
              temporal process, an objective “present,” we won’t find anything. As we 
              dissect the temporal process, we instead discover that events are either
               past or yet to occur; we find only the past and future. Nothing is 
              truly present because the very process of searching for it is itself a 
              temporal process, which means that it is necessarily always at a remove 
              from <em>now</em>.</p>
              <p>If, on the other hand, we search for the present within the relative 
              framework of everyday convention, we can maintain the concept of the 
              present. We can say “this present year,” for example, within the broader
               context of many years. Within the framework of twelve months, we can 
              speak of “the present month.” Similarly, within that month, we can speak
               of “the present week,” and so on, and in this relative context we can 
              maintain coherently the notion of a present moment. But if we search for
               a real present that is present intrinsically, we cannot find it.</p>
              <p>In just the same way, we can ascertain the existence of a person 
              within the conventional, relative framework without needing to search 
              for some kind of objective, intrinsically real person that is the self. 
              We can maintain our commonsense notion of the person or individual in 
              relation to the physical and the mental faculties that comprise our 
              particular existence.</p>
              <p>Because of this, in Nagarjuna’s text we find references to things and
               events or phenomena existing only as labels, or within the framework of
               language and designation. Of the two possible modes of 
              existence—objectively real existence and nominal existence—objectively 
              real existence is untenable, as we have seen. Hence we can only speak of
               a self conventionally or nominally—in the framework of language and 
              consensual reality. In brief, all phenomena exist merely in dependence 
              upon their name, through the power of worldly convention. Since they do 
              not exist objectively, phenomena are referred to in the texts as “mere 
              terms,” “mere conceptual constructs,” and “mere conventions.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>Searching For the Self</h2>
              <p>At the beginning of his eighteenth chapter, Nagarjuna writes:</p>
              <blockquote>If self were the aggregates,<br> it would have arising and disintegration;<br> if it were different from the aggregates,<br> it would not have the characteristics of the aggregates.</blockquote>
              <p>If we are searching for an essential self that is objectively and 
              intrinsically real, we must determine whether such a self is identical 
              to the aggregates or is something separate from them. If the self were 
              identical to the aggregates, then, like the aggregates, the self would 
              be subject to arising and disintegrating. If the body undergoes surgery 
              or injury, for example, the self would also be cut or harmed. If, on the
               other hand, the self were totally independent of the aggregates, we 
              could not explain any changes in the self based on changes in the 
              aggregates, such as when an individual is first young and then old, 
              first sick and then healthy.</p>
              <p>Nagarjuna also is saying that if the self and the aggregates were 
              entirely distinct, then we could not account for the arising of grasping
               at the notion of self on the basis of the aggregates. For instance, if 
              our body were threatened, we would not experience strong grasping at 
              self as a result. The body by nature is an impermanent phenomenon, 
              always changing, while our notion of the self is that it is somehow 
              changeless, and we would never confuse the two if they were indeed 
              separate.</p>
              <p>Thus, neither outside the aggregates nor within the aggregates can we
               find any tangible or real thing at all that we can call the self. 
              Nagarjuna then writes:</p>
              <blockquote>If the self itself does not exist, how can there be “mine”?</blockquote>
              <p>“Mine” is a characteristic of the self, for the thought “I am” 
              immediately gives rise to the thought “mine.” The grasping at “mine” is a
               form of grasping at selfhood because “mine” grasps at objects related 
              to the self. It is a variation on the egoistic view, which sees 
              everything in relation to an intrinsically existent “I.” In fact, if we 
              examine the way we perceive the world around us, we cannot speak of good
               and bad, or samsara and nirvana, without thinking from the perspective 
              of an “I.” We cannot speak of anything at all. Once the self becomes 
              untenable, then our whole understanding of a world based on 
              distinguishing self from others, “mine” from not mine, falls apart. 
              Therefore, Nagarjuna writes:</p>
              <blockquote>Since self and mine are pacified,<br> one does not grasp at “I” and “mine.”</blockquote>
              <p>Because the self and the mine cease, the grasping at them also does 
              not arise. This resonates with a passage in Aryadeva’s <em>Four Hundred 
              Stanzas on the Middle Way</em> in which he says that when you no longer 
              see a self in relation to an object, then the root of cyclic existence 
              will come to an end.</p>
              <blockquote>One who does not grasp at “I” and “mine,”<br> that one too 
              does not exist,<br> for the one who does not grasp<br> at “I” and “mine” does not perceive him.</blockquote>
              <p>In other words, the yogi who has brought an end to grasping at “I” 
              and “mine” is not intrinsically real. If you believe in the intrinsic 
              reality of such a yogi, then you also grasp at selfhood. What appears to
               the mind of the person who has ascertained the absence of self and its 
              properties is only the absence of all conceptual elaborations. Just as 
              grasping at me and mine must cease, so must grasping at a yogi who has 
              ended such grasping. Both are devoid of intrinsic existence.</p>
              <p>The point is that our understanding of emptiness should not remain 
              partial, such that we negate the intrinsic existence of some things but 
              not of others. We need to develop a profound understanding of emptiness 
              so that our perception of the lack of intrinsic existence encompasses 
              the entire spectrum of reality and becomes totally free of any 
              conceptual elaboration whatsoever. The understanding is one of mere 
              absence, a simple negation of intrinsic existence.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>Dismantling the Causes of Cyclic Existence</h2>
              <p>Nagarjuna continues,</p>
              <blockquote>When thoughts of “I” and “mine” are extinguished <br> with respect to the inner and the outer, <br> the process of appropriation ceases; <br> this having ceased, birth ceases. </blockquote>
              <p>This refers to the twelve links of dependent origination. “Inner” and
               “outer” here can be understood as the conception of self as either 
              among the aggregates or apart from them. When grasping at self and 
              “mine” ceases, then, because no more karmic potentials related to 
              external or internal phenomena are activated, the ninth link in the 
              twelve links of dependent origination—grasping, or appropriation—will 
              not occur. We will no longer grasp at objects of enjoyment and turn away
               from things we deem unattractive. Thus, although we may continue to 
              possess karmic potentials, they are no longer activated by craving and 
              grasping, and when this happens, birth in cyclic existence, the eleventh
               link, can no longer occur. This is the sense in which birth will come 
              to an end.</p>
              <p>Therefore, as we deepen our understanding of emptiness, the potency 
              of our karma to propel rebirth in cyclic existence is undermined. When 
              we realize emptiness directly, as it is stated in <em>Exposition of Valid
               Cognition</em>, “For he who sees the truth, no projecting exists.” In 
              other words, once we gain a direct realization of emptiness, we no 
              longer accumulate karma to propel rebirth in cyclic existence. As we 
              gradually deepen our direct realization, so that it permeates our entire
               experience and destroys the afflictions, we eventually eliminate the 
              root of grasping at intrinsic existence altogether and the continuity of
               rebirth in cyclic existence is cut. This is true freedom, or 
              liberation, where we no longer create new karma through ignorance, where
               no conditions exist to activate past karma, and where the afflictions 
              have been destroyed at their root.</p>
