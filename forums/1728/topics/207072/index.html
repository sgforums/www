            <div class='col-md body'>Just wondering, 1) can a layman buddhist like me go into heaven ? Please<br>listen to my story.. Even since the age of sixteen before O level, my<br>grandma pass away.. I began to realise what people cannot ecsape the wheel of life, birth, old, sick and death. Death is the beginning of birth... At<br>the time, I grew depression, began to wonder why are born as a human being, our mission to reborn as a human being... I read many books related to<br>Buddhism, Dai lama, zen practice since then, I realised that we are born to<br>practice Dharma, to fulfil our role or misson here, to do more charitable<br>deeds, to grow more wisdom through praticing the 10 good deeds and five<br>precept so that everyone can escape the six realms of rebirth before getting<br>enlightened  one day. Since then I try to practice the simple life of a<br>monk, saving money through buying excessive clothes, or other expensive watch or accessories Worn till it tear before to buy new one. No smoking and clubbing. Neither do I have a girlfriend as I think a layman should<br>find one true love so that we do not hurt other people feelings..<br><br>Moreover, I do charitable deeds by helping other people if possible, occasionally practice to chant some surta like Bo lie bo luo mi xing jing.. 2) The first time I chant, I got a strange feeling that I got chant before, plus after<br>chanting sometimes, I can memorise it easily like poetry till now? Why? I began to wondering am a pure Buddhist in my past times plus when I listen to people chaing Da Bei zhou or other chants, my mind is at ease, feeling<br>peacefulness and my heart is really pure happy...<br><br>However, I do admit I eat meat because I believe a true buddhist also eat<br>meat if there are no other food in the wild except meat.. Some people take<br>vegetable only 1st and 15th but they scold vulgarity and do not observe the<br>five percepts.. I believe throughly that we need to cultivate everyday<br>through our actions, thoughts and beliefs.. This is the true practice of<br>Buddhism.. Somestime, I am quite jealous of other people success, however I<br>try to cut down as jealousy is like the three evil roots part of anger, it<br>will never end once you havethe feeling...<br><br>Lastly, I am on my own wihtout a Dharma teacher to grow more wisdom through by reading more books,  to enjoy my life fullest by staying happy, to fulil my role as a son, to be patient when negative thoughts arise as a layman and occasionally chanting to cutivatate.. 3) Will I enlighten one day I wonder? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

Right, as long as you accumulate good karma through the practise of '10 virtuous deeds' and keeping the 5 precepts so as not to commit bad karma. Going to heaven is not difficult. And you mentioned you read many books related to Buddhism, Dalai Lama and Zen practise, I am very interested to know which books have you read..? Do share with us. Thanks.<br><br>Secondly, whether you lead a simple life of a monk is entirely up to you, it is not necessary that you have to lead a life like a monk in order to practise. Many great lay practitioners have a thriving business and enjoys good life, although they would not be too attached to luxury etc and are usually generious in giving what they have. Also as you should have known, the teaching of Middle Way is core in Buddhism. Middle way can apply to alot of situation. It first started when the Buddha realised that neither indulging in sensual pleasures, nor his practise of ascetism, could lead to Enlightenment. He stopped all these and sat under the Bodhi tree and attained enlightenment. So the Buddha taught that we should practise the middle way, that is, not become extreme. So in your case, it translate to, not indulging too much in luxuries and sensual enjoyment, but also we have to make a living and have what is necessary. You don't have to live like a hermit.<br><br>The habit of smoking and clubbing is also detrimental to our Buddhist cultivation, and all such self-serving habits/'habit energy' must be eliminated through our practise. It is also part of purifying our minds. In fact my shi fu says, the very least a Buddhist practitioner must accomplish is to eliminate our self-serving habits.<br><br>5 Precepts and 10 Virtuous deeds, as I mentioned earlier, is only a means of accumulating good karma and also to prevent accumulating any bad karma but it does not lead to enlightenment. It is very important, it is a good practise, but it will not lead you to liberation.<br><br>Buddhism is different from any other religion because it emphasizes that we must purify our minds. Our mind is the source of all good, all bad, all thoughts, all afflictions, all sufferings and so on. We must treat the problem at the root. We must eliminate the root of suffering before we can find the unconditional and eternal Bliss of Nirvana in our lives. Buddhism is a culture of bliss, as it is the way of living in perfect bliss in the midst of Life through the cultivation of dharma. The Buddhist practise of mindful awareness allows us to watch our every arising thought, and not become misled by these thoughts into further samsaric cycles. Since you have read many 'Buddhism, Dalai Lama and Zen' books, I think you should have a rough idea of what I am talking about.<br><br>And I find it very strange that you do not have any girlfriend... because you want to find true love? Care to explain that a little? Because as far as I know, although I do not claim to have lots of experience, you can only find true love if you date someone and your relationship becomes deepened as a result.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">(continued from the previous post, post segmented to prevent expiry)</span><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Moreover, I do charitable deeds by helping other people if possible, occasionally practice to chant some surta like Bo lie bo luo mi xing jing.. 2) The first time I chant, I got a strange feeling that I got chant before, plus after<br>chanting sometimes, I can memorise it easily like poetry till now?

For me, I do believe I have karmic affinity with Heart Sutra because I had a sudden understanding of that passage when I was quite young which was quite shocking for me. My mother for instance could memorise Da Bei Zhou only listening a few times and also has an affinity with Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, so we believe that she may have recited it in a previous lifetime. And yes.. when we listen to chanting, it will have a calming effect on us.<br><br><blockquote>However, I do admit I eat meat because I believe a true buddhist also eat<br>meat if there are no other food in the wild except meat..</blockquote>There are fruits, etc. Anyway I also eat meat because lay disciples are not banned from eating meat, although it is recommended that one takes up vegetarianism in Mahayana Buddhism. In Theravada Buddhism, there is no tradition of vegetarianism. Monks accept whatever the lay has to offer unless it's not suitable for eating (i.e rotten, or some other kinds of animals that are not usually eaten)<br><br>In general, when a Buddhist eats meat, he should make sure that he eats meat according to the '5 pure meat' principle:<br><br>See entire article here: <a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol5no4a.htm" rel="nofollow"><br>Five Clean Sources of Meat</a><br><br>(1) That he did not slaughter the animal personally<br>(2) That he did not instruct others to slaughter<br>(3) That the slaughter was not committed for his sake<br>(4) That he did not witness the slaughter<br>(5) That he did not hear the cries associated with the slaughter<br><br><blockquote>Some people take<br>vegetable only 1st and 15th but they scold vulgarity and do not observe the<br>five percepts..</blockquote>That is indeed not living up the purpose of taking up vegetarianism, which is to practise great compassion.<br><br><blockquote>I believe throughly that we need to cultivate everyday<br>through our actions, thoughts and beliefs.. This is the true practice of<br>Buddhism.. Somestime, I am quite jealous of other people success, however I<br>try to cut down as jealousy is like the three evil roots part of anger, it<br>will never end once you havethe feeling...</blockquote>Very true. <blockquote>Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</blockquote></div><div class="quote_body">Desire is a chain, shackled to the world, and it is a difficult one to<br>break. But once that is done, there is no more grief and no more longing;<br>the stream has been cut off and there are no more chains.<br><br>- Sutta Nipata 948<br></div></blockquote>[quote]Lastly, I am on my own wihtout a Dharma teacher to grow more wisdom through by reading more books,  to enjoy my life fullest by staying happy, to fulil my role as a son, to be patient when negative thoughts arise as a layman and occasionally chanting to cutivatate.. 3) Will I enlighten one day I wonder? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> [/b]I do agree with Bohiruci that a Buddhist teacher is very important on our spiritual path to guide us and direct us to greater achievements in our cultivation. And also to join a sangha that will encourage and motivate each other to learn and cultivate the dharma. We may be unknowingly misled if we just depend on ourselves, and no one to ask if we have any wrong concepts. In fact following a <span style="font-style: italic;">realised</span> Buddhist teacher is important.<br><br>Also regarding chanting, my shi fu says - "Chanting sutra is not as good as understanding sutra, understanding sutra is not as walking/cultivating according to the sutra, and cultivating according to sutra is not as good as truly realising the essence (zheng4) of that sutra" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Will you become enlightened one day? Of course. Every single sentient being in the world will become enlightened. This is because in everyone of us, our Buddha Nature is already perfect. It always is perfect, however, due to our ignorance we covered it up, just like dust covered a bright mirror and we couldnt see it. If we practise the purification of our mind, if we practise mindfulness in our everyday lives, then gradually the bright mirror will be revealed and the dust will be removed.<br><br>There is no lack of enlightened people in the world in history, and in the present. In fact there are some highly realised people even in our forum (I am not included, I am only a learner) whose achievements and cultivation is great. They too, are lay Buddhists like you and me, and are married.</div>

Anyway, I am still young and thanks for the prompt advice,  and some more questions again, how to get a teacher to truly teach you as I think not anyhow anywhere can find a master who want to teach  you and is there some library to borrow more Buddhism related books beside our national library and some classes to attend to learn the meaning of sutra?
