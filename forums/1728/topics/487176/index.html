              <p>"Again, there is the case where an individual keeps pervading the 
              first direction — as well as the second direction, the third, &amp; the 
              fourth — with an awareness imbued with compassion... appreciation... 
              equanimity. Thus he keeps pervading above, below, &amp; all around, 
              everywhere &amp; in every respect the all-encompassing cosmos with an 
              awareness imbued with equanimity: abundant, expansive, immeasurable, 
              free from hostility, free from ill will. He regards whatever phenomena 
              there that are connected with form, feeling, perception, fabrications, 
              &amp; consciousness, as inconstant, stressful, a disease, a cancer, an 
              arrow, painful, an affliction, alien, a disintegration, an emptiness, 
              not-self. At the break-up of the body, after death, he reappears in 
              conjunction with the devas of the Pure Abodes. This rebirth is not in 
              common with run-of-the-mill people.</p>
              <p>"These are four types of individuals to be found existing in the world."</p>

              Purification gives a very detail description on how one can go about cultivating
              the Divine Abidings starting our meditation on ‘Lovingkindness’. We should first
              start with developing lovingkindness towards oneself doing repeatedly thus: ‘May
              I be happy and free from suffering’ or May I keep myself free from enmity,
              affliction and anxiety and live happily’. Later on, radiating lovingkindness
              outwards to those near and dear to us, than our enemy and finally to all living
              beings in all directions as stated in above AN 4.126 . </span></p>
