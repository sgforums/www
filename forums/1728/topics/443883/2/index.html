              <p>Hi StriveOn,</p>
              <p>In the mahamudra texts it states that one has to continuously practice purification (of any sort, there are many purification practices out there) until the signs arise.  In your dreams, in your real life etc.</p>
              <p>Unless these signs arise, the number is just a guiding figure, ie, usually for most people, we have to do much more.  One of the thing about purification is that it removes obstacles on your path, outer circumstantial obstacles, inner mental / emotional obstacles etc.  It is important to be thorough about this as it is like gathering the fuels and necessities for a long journey (of reaching realisation) ahead...  except for some exceptional people with very conducive past karmas, the road to realisation will often be filled with all kinds of sidetracks/ distractions/obstacles/ripenings... etc. And the practice of purification is a way to lessen that so that either the obstacle is diminished, removed or you are able in some way or other to deal with it in future.  Hence, for practitioners of Mahamudra/Dzogchen, it is considered very helpful to do much purification first.</p>
              <p>In fact, even in the Mahayana tradition, this has been stated in a Sutra on telling the good and bad karmas by Ksitigarbha that we should try to purify to a certain degree before going into shamatha / vipassana.  The sutra even prescribes a way to check one's level of purification.</p>

When a Buddha is about to be born, the inhabitants of the SuddhÄ�vÄ�sÄ� insert a knowledge of the signs of a Great Being in the Vedas and teach this among men in the guise of brahmins, calling such knowledge buddhamanta. Men learn it and are thus able to recognize a Great Being (MA.ii.761; SNA.ii.448). The inhabitants of the SuddhÄ�vÄ�sÄ� know how many Buddhas will be born in any particular kappa by observing the number of lotuses which spring up on the site of the Bodhi-pallanka when the earth gradually emerges after the destruction of the world (DA.ii.411). It is the SuddhÄ�vÄ�sÄ� BrahmÄ�s who provide the four omens which lead to a Bodhisatta's renunciation in his last lay life. See, e.g., DA.ii.455f.</span></span></p>

              <p>a bit different from PL school, yet some similarity in that it's for "non-returner", meaning this is their last samsaric rebirth if they are reborn there. from there they achieve awakening just like in pure abode, they achieve arahanthood.</p>

              <p>Fully agree with you. My late wife used to chant or bow, if not 100,000 times, at least more than a 1,000 times during her sittings.</p>
              <p>So the conclusion is Our Great Teacher did not say it, but we try to improvise so that we can still achieve the goals that Our Great Teacher set for us. We must keep that in mind otherwise we loose track.</p>
              <p>To me, The Four Noble Truths and Eightfold Path is like the company's Vision, Mission Statement, Quality Policy and Shared Values, all put together. Whenever I come across something, I measure it againts these yardsticks. I find that of late, there are a lot of new 'teachings' that do not measure up against those basic teachings and I become agitated (I know, this is not very midnful). But do they tell you? No. I feel sorry for the newly initiated who is trying to absorb what is given to them. They are not getting the right stuff.</p>
              <p>I came the same way. I have to read many books from different authors, on the same topic, just to find out the essence of a teaching. You know Our Great Teacher, when he give a discourse, it usually is so profound that in its raw form most of us do not understand. So we have this commentaries and annotations that can fill up a few volumes. It is not their fault but our ignorance to percieve some of these commentaries as words spoken by Buddha. And as these material goes from one to another, the meanings of the original teachings could have been modified.</p>

              <p>Hi StriveOn,</p>
              <p>I fully agree with you too. It was confusing for me too in the beginning.</p>
              <p>Nvertheless, on hindsight, I do feel that the core teachings of (Four Noble Truths and Eightfold Path) are still found in each of the main schools, namely Theravada, Mahayana and Vajrayana. The presentation of them may be different though.</p>
              <p>To me, Theravada is still the most clear and systematic. The stages of stream entry, once returner, non returner and arhant and what each stage is like is most systematic.</p>
              <p>To me, Dzogchen and Mahamudra are very clear too. However, their presentation is different and they also entails certain insights that are not so much emphasized in Theravada. Nevertheless, most of these insights are presented in Theravada too.</p>
              <p>To me, Theravada lays the foundation. Every serious practitioner should go through the Theravada teaching. They are the core teachings that no serious practitioner should skip through. For certain detailed explanation and description of workings after initial insights (into non-dual, no-self and emptiness), I find the Mahamudra and Dzogchen teachings very helpful.</p>
              <p>These are just my experiences only though.</p>
              <p>Regards</p>

              <p>Yes simpo, agree very much with you. After i come to this forum, my understandings have changed alot. I think many people jump too fast. If we go according to the path you suggested, i think our understanding of the Mahamudra/Dzogchen teachings would be much deeper and stronger, ie, the Theravada teachings are a very helpful and necessary understanding beforehand.</p>

              Agree with simpo's and dharmadhatu's statements.
                                
              Just a note with regards to repentance, which is an alternative and highly effective method for purifying karma. Even in the pali canon, many examples are given how a karma that would have resulted in a rebirth of lower realm have been averted simply by the act of repentance, apology and seeking forgiveness.
                                
              In Mahayana, we ask a person to recite the repentance verse sincerely and prostrate to the Buddha for 108 times or more. Many do this regularly such as everyday. I used to do it when younger as a regular practice. Now I only meditate.
                                
              Anyway the repentance verse is this:
                                
              http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol6no2c.htm
                                
              All the evil karma that I have committed in the past,
              Arising from my aeons of greed, anger and ignorance,
              Committed by my body, speech and mind,
              Now I repent before the Buddha.
                                
              å¾€æ˜”æ‰€é€ è¯¸æ�¶ä¸šï¼Œçš†ç”±æ— å§‹è´ªçž‹ç—´ï¼Œä»Žèº«è¯­æ„�ä¹‹æ‰€ç”Ÿï¼Œä»Šåœ¨ä½›å‰�æ±‚å¿�æ‚”. 
              ....
                                
              It occurred to me that not only should we repent for evil karma, we should repent to having given rise to desire, anger, and ignorance. We should repent to the Buddha for not carrying out his teaching. Otherwise why mention three poisons? Just "I repent for my bad karma" is enough. 
                                
              Having repented this way, we should make a resolve that in this very life, may I be completely liberated from the afflictions of craving, anger, and aversion.
                                
              Then we should act and practice according to this resolve and never let up. We should constantly renew and act upon this resolve.
                                
              May we all be liberated in this life!
