              <p>My friends have increased their intelligence, cured diseases, removed destructive patterns that were unconducive to practice, increased clarity &amp; strength of mind etc etc etc. through this practice.  It is a main way to clear obstacles on the path.  As Vajrasattva is the quintessence of all deities.  Simply to practice his mantra covers all the other Buddhas / Deities and Vajrasattva practice is also intimately connected to the bardo experiences.</p>

              <p>Yes, I find Vajrasattva Purification to be very powerful. Incidentally, i have only discovered this method not too long ago..in the beginning of the year.</p>
              <p>It is through 'interesting' means... It started, when i was concerned that someone i know might be going towards negativity and thus falling into woeful state in future life. As people dun always believe what i say... i thought maybe i should get a 'qian' from Guan Yin at the Bugis temple... and use the 'qian' paper as a physical message. So i told the person that i will be going to Guan Yin temple to ask Guan Yin about 'what her future life condition will be'. As expected... the qian is a 'bad' one. But more importantly is the message of the qian. It says that there will be no reward/good result due to lack of merits or something like that. and that the conditions in life is determined by ones' merits. </p>
              <p>With that, i gave the 'qian' paper to the person. I went to search on the topic of 'merit' and chance upon Vajrasattva Purification... Next i recommend the Vajrasattva Purification to others and practice it myself. :)</p>
              <p>What I have found is that with whatever practice, deep respect for the Teacher is very important whether you can see the Teacher or not. Without deep respect, there will be pride and no faith and thus understandings cannot be effectively transmitted.</p>

              <p>It is in the article. The article also gave a very detailed description of karmic dynamics.</p>
              <p>Anyway a simpler article:</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.fpmt-osel.org/meditate/vjrstva.htm">http://www.fpmt-osel.org/meditate/vjrstva.htm</a></p>
              <p>Also... read the meaning of the texts first .. and see if this is what you aspire towards. Again as i have stressed... to be effective.. there must be deep respect.</p>
              <p>Plus... you cannot replace this with the other essential practices entailing insight practices, concentration and morality.</p>

              <p>Actually.. i should not have bring up this practice as it raises too much confusion with certain people.</p>
              <p>In a nutshell, the mantra and visualisation alone of course will have no power... one must understand the meaning. It is like a statement of intention and commitment.</p>
              <p>Additionally, the world is not what you see as it is. For those who realises emptiness, one will also understand that space, time, distance and locations are just impressions. They don't exist in a solid and permanent sense. That means, the Enlightenment and Wisdom of Great Beings are still accessible as they are not restricted by space, time, distance and locations. The world/consciousness is really holographic.</p>
              <p>No, these Being will not reduce your karma. IMO, it is more like by being attuned with Enlightened Being... and in the process one gets supported along the way. It is like as if an uncharged metal can be progressively magnetised when come in contact with a real magnet.</p>

              <p>Actually.. i should not have bring up this practice as it raises too much confusion with certain people.</p>
              <p>In a nutshell, the mantra and visualisation alone of course will have no power... one must understand the meaning. It is like a statement of intention and commitment.</p>
              <p>Additionally, the world is not what you see as it is. For those who realises emptiness, one will also understand that space, time, distance and locations are just impressions. They don't exist in a solid and permanent sense. That means, the Enlightenment and Wisdom of Great Beings are still accessible as they are not restricted by space, time, distance and locations. The world/consciousness is really holographic.</p>
              <p>No, these Being will not reduce your karma. IMO, it is more like by being attuned with Enlightened Being... and in the process one gets supported along the way. It is like as if an uncharged metal can be progressively magnetised when come in contact with a real magnet.</p>

              <p><br>Thanks simpo_ for the clarifications.</p>
              <p>When the mind is clear, there is no confusion.</p>
              <p>I choose to differ because I stick to the original teachings of Our Great Teacher. I am critical of teachings that deviate, because My Great Teacher 'did not say that'.</p>
              <p>But sometimes when I think about it, many Scholastic Buddhists have noble intentions by explaining it in a different perspective. The danger therefore lies in the audience accepting it as THE Teachings.</p>
              <p>I am very glad that The Four Noble Truths and The Eightfold Path is still very intact in most literature.</p>
              <p>But even then, looking at the article you posted, The Truth of Suffering became True Sufferings ??? They are not the same.</p>
              <p>But then again, I cannot be too critical because some of the respected Sangha do not communicate in English, and they are experiencing Dukha just to bring it to us in English.</p>
              <p>I hope I did not cause any Dukha. If so, my apologies.</p>

              <p>Simpo_, please do not say that you should not have brought up this practice.</p>
              <p>I think, correct me if I am wrong, I think, a forum should discuss controversial issues, besides providing info on the subject matter and start-up assistance.</p>
              <p>If all of us are in agreement, and so afraid to step on each other toes. Not only we learn nothing, there is also nothing much to discuss.</p>
              <p>During Buddha's time, there are pavilons where learned men thrashed it out. In our world today, everybody busy earning a living, where got time to go to pavilon. But we have cyberspace. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              pay close attention. I will speak.</p>
              <p>"Now what, monks, is old kamma? The eye is to be seen as old kamma, 
              fabricated &amp; willed, capable of being felt. The ear... The nose... 
              The tongue... The body... The intellect is to be seen as old kamma, 
              fabricated &amp; willed, capable of being felt. This is called old 
              kamma.</p>
              <p>"And what is new kamma? Whatever kamma one does now with the body, with speech, or with the intellect: This is called new kamma.</p>
              <p>"And what is the cessation of kamma? Whoever touches the release that
               comes from the cessation of bodily kamma, verbal kamma, &amp; mental 
              kamma: This is called the cessation of kamma.</p>
              <p>"<a id="eightfold" name="eightfold">And what</a> is the path of 
              practice leading to the cessation of kamma? Just this noble eightfold 
              path: right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right 
              livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration. This 
              is called the path of practice leading to the cessation of kamma.</p>
              <p>"So, monks, I have taught you new &amp; old kamma, the cessation of 
              kamma, and the path of practice leading to the cessation of kamma. 
              Whatever a teacher should do — seeking the welfare of his disciples, out
               of sympathy for them — that have I done for you. Over there are the 
              roots of trees; over there, empty dwellings. Practice jhana, monks. 
              Don't be heedless. Don't later fall into regret. This is our message to 
              you."</p>

              <p><br> Thanks simpo_ for the clarifications.</p>
              <p>When the mind is clear, there is no confusion.</p>
              <p>I choose to differ because I stick to the original teachings of
              Our Great Teacher. I am critical of teachings that deviate, because
              My Great Teacher 'did not say that'.</p>
              <p>But sometimes when I think about it, many Scholastic Buddhists
              have noble intentions by explaining it in a different perspective.
              The danger therefore lies in the audience accepting it as THE
              Teachings.</p>
              <p>I am very glad that The Four Noble Truths and The Eightfold Path
              is still very intact in most literature.</p>
              <p>But even then, looking at the article you posted, The Truth of
              Suffering became True Sufferings ??? They are not the same.</p>
              <p>But then again, I cannot be too critical because some of the
              respected Sangha do not communicate in English, and they are
              experiencing Dukha just to bring it to us in English.</p>
              <p>I hope I did not cause any Dukha. If so, my apologies.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I dont know what difference you think 'Truth of Suffering' and 'True Suffering' is, since the truth of suffering means birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress &amp; despair, association 
              with the unbeloved, separation from the loved which are actual experiences.</p>
              <p>The Buddha describes this:</p>
              <p>"<a id="nt4" name="nt4">Now this</a>, monks, is the noble truth of stress:<a id="fnt-1" class="noteTag" name="fnt-1" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn56/sn56.011.than.html#fn-1">[1]</a> Birth is stressful, aging is stressful, death is stressful; sorrow, 
              lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair are stressful; association

               not getting what is wanted is stressful. In short, the five 
              clinging-aggregates are stressful.</p>

              <h4><strong>THE FOUR POWERS OF PURIFICATION </strong></h4>
              <p>The purification practices found within Buddhism 
                            are not unlike the practices applied in many other religions. The 
                            most essential mental factor that one requires is sincerity or honesty 
                            with oneself. When one wants to purify past negative karma, one 
                            has to do some action with the correct motivation. <br> This is summarised in the following Four Powers of Purification:</p>
              <ol>
              <li><strong>Power of the Object</strong>: One should practice thinking of 
                              all sentient beings one may have hurt. Traditionally, one remembers 
                              all sentient beings and the <em>Three Jewels of Refuge</em> (Buddha, 
                              Dharma and Sangha), by generating compassion for all sentient 
                              beings and <em>taking refuge</em>. </li>
              <li><strong>Power of Regret</strong>: This should not be senseless <a href="http://viewonbuddhism.org/guilt.html">guilt</a> or self-recrimination, which are said to be useless emotional 
                              torture. What is intended here is to examine oneself and one's 
                              actions and to recognise that negative actions done in the past 
                              were very unwise. </li>
              <li><strong>Power of Promise</strong>: As a logical consequence of the above, 
                              one should promise not to repeat these negative actions. It is 
                              good if one can promise to avoid a negative behaviour for a specific 
                              time, or at least promise that one will put effort in avoiding 
                              repetition. Not being honest at this stage makes the practice 
                              useless or even harmful to oneself.</li>
              <li><strong>Power of Practice</strong>: Basically <strong>any</strong> positive 
                              action with a good motivation can be used as practice. Traditionally 
                              in Buddhism, one can practice e.g. making prostrations (throwing 
                              oneself to the floor - as a means to destroy pride), making offerings 
                              (to counteract greed), reading Buddhist texts (to counteract ignorance 
                              and negative thoughts), reciting mantras etc. </li>
              </ol>
              <p>It is often explained that one needs to clear a field by purifying 
                            it from rocks and weeds, then planting seeds by study and meditation, 
                            giving water and fertiliser by doing positive actions, and automatically 
                            new harvest will grow.</p>

              Buddha: "Now, a trifling evil deed done by what sort of individual is experienced in the here &amp; now, and for the most part barely appears for a moment? There is the case where a certain individual is developed in [contemplating] the body, developed in virtue, developed in mind, developed in discernment: unrestricted, large-hearted, dwelling with the immeasurable.[1] A trifling evil deed done by this sort of individual is experienced in the here &amp; now, and for the most part barely appears for a moment.

              <p>I always believe that the best way to find out about anything is to test it out through ourselves.  For me, the Vajrasattva Purification works. No need for any debate. To know the answer you just got to find out for yourself.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"><span style="color: #888888;">The Buddha is mentioned as having visited the SuddhÄ�vÄ�sÄ� (E.g., D.ii.50). When a Buddha is about to be born, the inhabitants of the SuddhÄ�vÄ�sÄ� insert a knowledge of the signs of a Great Being in the Vedas and teach this among men in the guise of brahmins, calling such knowledge buddhamanta. Men learn it and are thus able to recognize a Great Being (MA.ii.761; SNA.ii.448). The inhabitants of the SuddhÄ�vÄ�sÄ� know how many Buddhas will be born in any particular kappa by observing the number of lotuses which spring up on the site of the Bodhi-pallanka when the earth gradually emerges after the destruction of the world (DA.ii.411). It is the SuddhÄ�vÄ�sÄ� BrahmÄ�s who provide the four omens which lead to a Bodhisatta's renunciation in his last lay life. See, e.g., DA.ii.455f.</span></span></p>

              <p>a bit different from PL school, yet some similarity in that it's for "non-returner", meaning this is their last samsaric rebirth if they are reborn there. from there they achieve awakening just like in pure abode, they achieve arahanthood.</p>
