Buddhism, unlike any other religion, does not actually use the element of Fear.<br><br><blockquote>For eg if I am curious and ask if Guan Yin is female or male, they would say "dun anyhow say"... i find that very sad as all i wanted was to know more about my religion, but the elders would ask us to be quiet and "beat our mouth" for insolence.</blockquote>That is because they are ignorant, and yet afraid they may be disrespectful.<br><br>I can tell you the answer. Guan Yin is neither female or male, he/she is beyond all forms, yet can manifest any kinds of forms in order to save sentient beings and teach the dharma. Guan Yin is a Maha Bodhisattva (Da4 Pu2 Sa4), and a Bodhisattva is someone embarking on the path towards Buddhahood, and has great compassion for all beings in the world, wishing all beings to be liberated from their sufferings and attain the bliss of nirvana. Guan Yin Bodhisattva is also setting a great example for all Bodhisattva practitioners of Mahayana Buddhism. There are many different Bodhisattvas (Pu2 Sa4) in Buddhism, each of them representing a quality that we need to cultivate to attain Buddhahood. Guan Yin represents Great Compassion.<br><br>In China she is most often depicted in the Female form, but in Tibet, he is most often depicted in the Male form. For more information, you can refer to Lotus Sutra Chapter 25,<br>THE UNIVERSAL DOOR OF GUANSHI YIN BODHISATTVA: <a href="http://www.buddhistdoor.com/resources/sutras/lotus/sources/lotus25.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.buddhistdoor.com/resources/sutras/lotus/sources/lotus25.htm</a><br><br><blockquote>Are we really offending our Buddhas and gods by saying such things?</blockquote>Not at all. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><blockquote>To me I find that I want to love and not fear my religion, to be proud that our Buddha/gods are approachable as well, not just a "fearful" supreme being. For eg, i like to watch show like Jouney to the West as it brings us more info on our Buddhas, and that they will help us whenever we need them.</blockquote>Journey to the West is a fascinating and great movie, however, many of the elements in that movie is fake. After all, Journey to the West is a fictionous movie. Although Tang Shan Zhang went to India to receive the sutras, the 3 other character: Sun Wu Kong, Zhu Ba Jie, and Sa Sheng are all fictionous characters invented by the writers in the 14th century.<br><br>More info: <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=201082" rel="nofollow">Journey to the West -Just a popular Chinese folk novel</a><br><br><blockquote>I think that is also the reason why some of my friends are converting to other religions..

In reality, Buddhism does not worship anyone, the Buddha, let alone gods and deities. We respect, pay reverence to Buddha, but we do not worship him like some kind of god or deity, although Buddha is higher than any gods and deities (gods and deities learn from Buddha - which is why Buddha is known as the Teacher of Men and Gods).<br><br>Buddha is seen as the supremely compassionate Teacher to us, the fully enlightened being that taught us the way to supreme enlightenment, gaining wisdom into the nature of all things, and the ultimate liberation from all sufferings and attainment of the greatest bliss in life. If they knew the dharma, I am sure they would not have converted to the other religions. On the other hand, there were many converts from those religions INTO True Buddhism. If you have read the news, (true) Buddhism is on the rise in Singapore and the teachings is gaining alot of interest. Not only locally but also especially in the Western nations.<br><br>I strongly suggest you read up more on Buddhism here: <a href="http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/basic-guide.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/basic-guide.htm</a><br><br>If you have anymore queries, you can always ask here. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><blockquote>I feel it's the way the elders are preaching to us. Do you think so?</blockquote>The elders may have been following traditions and cultures without actually knowing the true teachings and purpose of Buddhism, which is a gem. And that is really very unfortunate.<br><br><blockquote>p/s: kindly dun post the long long reasonings for me, too chim for me liao.. if can, put in layman terms k? thx <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></blockquote>Sure.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;">Merry Meet true|y03,<br><br>Scholars believe that the Buddhist monk and translator Kumarajiva was the first to refer to the female form of Kuan Yin in his Chinese translation of the Lotus Sutra in 406 A.D. Of the thirty-three appearances of the bodhisattva referred to in his translation, seven are female. (Devoted Chinese and Japanese Buddhists have since come to associate the number thirty-three with Kuan Yin.)<br><br>Although Kuan Yin was still being portrayed as a male as late as the tenth century, with the introduction of Tantric Buddhism into China in the eighth century during the T'ang dynasty, the image of the celestial bodhisattva as a beautiful white-robed goddess was predominant and the devotional cult surrounding her became increasingly popular. By the ninth century there was a statue of Kuan Yin in every Buddhist monastery in China.<br><br>Despite the controversy over the origins of Kuan Yin as a feminine being, the depiction of a bodhisattva as both 'god' and 'goddess' is not inconsistent with Buddhist doctrine. The scriptures explain that a bodhisattva has the power to embody in any form--male, female, child, even animal depending on the type of being he is seeking to save. As the Lotus Sutra relates, the bodhisattva Kuan Shih Yin, "by resort to a variety of shapes, travels in the world, conveying the beings to salvation."<br><br>The twelfth-century legend of the Buddhist saint Miao Shan, the Chinese princess who lived in about 700 B.C. and is widely believed to have been Kuan Yin, reinforced the image of the bodhisattva as a female. During the twelfth century Buddhist monks settled on P'u-t'o Shan--the sacred island-mountain in the Chusan Archipelago off the coast of Chekiang where Miao Shan is said to have lived for nine years, healing and saving sailors from shipwreck--and devotion to Kuan Yin spread throughout northern China.<br><br>This picturesque island became the chief center of worship of the compassionate Saviouress; crowds of pilgrims would journey from the remotest places in China and even from Manchuria, Mongolia and Tibet to attend stately services there. At one time there were more than a hundred temples on the island and over one thousand monks. The lore surrounding P'u-t'o island recounts numerous appearances and miracles performed by Kuan Yin, who, it is believed, reveals herself to the faithful in a certain cave on the island.<br><br>In the Pure Land faction of Buddhism, Kuan Yin forms part of a ruling triad that is often depicted in temples and is a popular theme in Buddhist art. In the center is the Buddha of Boundless Light, Amitabha (Chinese, A-mi-t'o Fo; Japanese, Amida). To his right is the bodhisattva of strength or power, Mahasthamaprapta, and to his left is Kuan Yin, personifying his endless mercy.<br><br>Buddhist theology Kuan Yin is sometimes depicted as the Holder of the "Bark of Salvation," guiding souls to Amitabha's Western Paradise, or Pure Land--the land of bliss where souls may be reborn to receive continued instruction toward the goal of enlightenment and perfection. The journey to Pure Land is frequently represented in woodcuts showing boats full of Amitabha's followers under Kuan Yin.<br><br>Ignorance &amp; Superstitions create Fear in many.  Buddha is in your heart not only through words or actions. Religion is individual, everyone has a choice in following what they feel most comfortable with. All religions teaches the Good of Mankind. Respecting the elders while holding on to your own beliefs &amp; faith perhaps is what you should do. Perceive with your heart not just through you naked eye.

            <div class='col-md body'>History also has its role to play. Our ancestors are china nationals who migrated to south east asia during and before world war 2 and a lot of them are illiterate, so it is difficult for them to impart the correct concept of buddhism to the next generation in that kind of tough environment.

In Vajrayana Buddhism Avalokitesvara is also known as Padmapani, the Holder of the Lotus.<br><br><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">Origin of the concept</span></strong><br>The exact origin of the religious practices relating to Avalokitesvara is unclear. Some Western scholars have suggested that the concept of Avalokitesvra, along with many other supernatural beings in Buddhism, was based on a Hindu deity absorbed by Mahayana teaching as an aspect of the historical Buddha Shakyamuni. The word avalokita means "seeing or gazing down" and isvara means "lord" in Sanskrit. Isvara is also an alternate name for the Hindu god Shiva, who seems to also have acted as an inspiration for some of Avalokitesvara's depictions in art.<br><br>According to Mahayana doctrine, Avalokitesvara was a person who has made a great vow to listen to the prayers of all sentient beings in times of difficulty, and to postpone his own Buddhahood until he has helped every being on Earth achieve enlightenment. Sutras associated with Avalokitesvara include the Lotus Sutra, particularly the 25th chapter, which is sometimes referred to as the Avalokitesvara Sutra, and the Heart Sutra.<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;"><strong>Tibetan Buddhism</strong></span><br>Avalokitesvara (known as Chenrezig in Tibetan) is an important deity in Tibetan Buddhism. In particular, the Dalai Lama is held to be a manifestation of Avalokitesvara.<br><br>Other manifestations popular in Tibet include Sahasra-bhuja (a form with a thousand arms) and Ekadasmukha (a form with eleven faces).<br><br>In Tibetan Buddhism, White Tara acts as the consort and energizer of Avalokitesvara. According to popular belief, Tara came into existence from a tear of Avalokitesvara. When the tear fell to the ground, it created a lake, and a lotus opening in the lake revealed Tara.<br><br>Tibetan Buddhism relates Avalokitesvara to the six-syllable mantra Om Mani Padme Hum.<br><br><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">Manifestations</span></strong><br>Avalokitesvara has an extraordinarily large number of manifestations in different forms. Some of the more commonly mentioned forms include:<br><br><img src="http://img138.imageshack.us/img138/1341/avalokiteshvaratableip6.jpg"><br><br></div>
