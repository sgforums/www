              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">The vegetarian diet has become very popular around the world over
              the last decades. However, the history of this lifestyle and its foundation on
              the respect for animal life and the planet has its roots in the Indus River
              valley and ancient Greece.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Vegetarianism has been known about and practiced since
              ancient times. Although ancient people are sometimes depicted with loads of
              meat on their dinner tables, this image may be based more on artistic
              creativity than reality. In fact, it seems that humanity in general has only
              eaten larger quantities of meat for the last 1,000 years. Before then, the
              consumption of meat was less popular. This could have been due in part to
              problems associated with hunting. For example, in desert countries like Egypt
              it would have been extremely difficult to produce enough meat for the whole population.
              Many ancient people also had a different worldview – one which was largely
              forgotten by later generations.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Respecting Animals in
              Asia</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">It is known that prehistoric people sacrificed animals during
              rituals. The discovery of animal bones also shows that they were not
              vegetarians. However, with time some people started to avoid a diet based on
              meat and preferred to consume plants instead. Ancient writings suggest the
              first reason for this change was due to a different perception of life and the
              world of animals.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Evidence suggests that the founders of a non-meat diet lived
              in Asia, especially in ancient Indian civilizations. One of the foremost
              advocates of Buddhist vegetarianism was the emperor Ashoka (304-232 BC), who
              tried to encourage people to care for animals.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Ashoka’s vision was to stop animal sacrifice and teach people
              to respect animals. In his edicts he wrote:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #666666; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>"Beloved-of-the-Gods,
              King Piyadasi, has caused this Dhamma edict to be written.  Here (in my
              domain) no living beings are to be slaughtered or offered in sacrifice. Nor
              should festivals be held, for Beloved-of-the-Gods, King Piyadasi, sees much to
              object to in such festivals, although there are some festivals that
              Beloved-of-the-Gods, King Piyadasi, does approve of.</span></em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: #666666;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #666666; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>(…)
              Twenty-six years after my coronation various animals were declared to be
              protected—parrots, mainas, aruna, ruddy geese, wild ducks, nandimukhas,
              gelatas, bats, queen ants, terrapins, boneless fish, vedareyaka, gangapuputaka,
              sankiya fish, tortoises, porcupines, squirrels, deer, bulls, okapinda, wild
              asses, wild pigeons, domestic pigeons and all four-footed creatures that are
              neither useful nor edible. Those nanny goats, ewes and sows which are with
              young or giving milk to their young are protected, and so are young ones less
              than six months old. Cocks are not to be caponized, husks hiding living beings
              are not to be burnt and forests are not to be burnt either without reason or to
              kill creatures. One animal is not to be fed to another."</span></em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: #666666;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">The vegetarian diet appears in many other ancient Asian
              religious and cultural writings. Vegetarianism is mostly associated with two
              religions: Hinduism and Buddhism. Although currently some followers of these
              religions disagree with the aversion to eating meat, traditionally it was a
              strong part of their religious practices.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">In ancient Japan, Emperor Temmu banned the eating of wild
              animal meat in 675 AD. Japanese people from the Nara to the Meiji restoration
              period (about 1,200 years), ate mostly rice with beans and vegetables. Fish was
              served occasionally, but their national cuisine was almost completely
              vegetarian. The ancient Japanese people also had a very long lifetime during
              this period, but that started to change after the rise of Emperor Meiji - who
              canceled the ancient ban on meat in the second half of the 19th century.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Vegetarianism in
              Ancient Europe</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">The first accounts of vegetarian people come from Herodotus,
              who wrote about people from the North African coast. Later, Diodorus Siculus
              explained that tribes in Ethiopia didn’t eat meat either. In the 6th century
              BC, the vegetarian diet arrived to Greece. The famous philosopher Pythagoras
              wrote of the religious movement of ‘The Orphics’ which promoted an aversion to
              eating meat as well. Pythagoras was one of the first of the western
              philosophers to promote a vegetarian lifestyle - his followers didn't have to
              be vegetarians, but many were. It is unknown if that was the first time a
              thought like this had appeared in Europe, but older written records discussing
              vegetarianism have not been found there.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">The philosopher known as Themistocles who lived during the
              5th century also wrote declarations which made him a radical advocate for
              animal rights and vegetarianism. Plato, Hesiod, and Ovid suggested that not
              eating meat is good for humans. Moreover, some Stoics and Cynics also supported
              this idea. Plato’s academy had a huge following of vegetarianism too.
              Xenocrates, and Polemon didn't eat meat. Also, Porphyry, Plutarch, and Plotinus
              tried to be vegetarians (but it is unknown how long they followed this diet.)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Christian Vegetarianism</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">It is believed that the famous theologians St Thomas Aquinas,
              St Augustine, and St Francis of Assisi were also vegetarians. However, due to
              the lack of resources this has not been confirmed. According to some writings,
              the first Christians preferred vegetarianism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Vegetarianism was a normal thing in early Greek-Orthodox
              Christianity. In Russia, Greece, Serbia, Cyprus and other Orthodox countries
              people who belonged to the church followed a diet which was free of meat (and
              alcohol too).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">The Rebirth of
              Vegetarianism</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Vegetarianism largely disappeared in Europe between the 4th
              and 6th centuries. However, it was still practiced by several early Christian
              orders of monks in medieval Europe, who banned the eating of meat (but not
              fish) for religious reasons. The non-meat diet returned in popularity for a
              time during the Renaissance and currently it is being reborn once again.</span></p>
