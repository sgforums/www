              <p>True happiness comes from having a sense of inner peace and
              contentment, which in turn must be achieved by cultivating altruism,
              love and compassion, and by eliminating anger, selfishness and greed.<br> <br> The compassionate mind is very important. Fear, anger, jealousy are
              based on a self-centered attitude. By developing a sense of caring for
              others' well-being your heart automatically opens and that brings
              transparency, straightforwardness and honesty, which leads to
              friendship. We are social animals, and one individual...'s survival
              relies entirely on the rest of the community.<br> <br> If you have peace of mind, when you meet with problems and
              difficulties they won’t disturb your inner peace. You’ll be able to
              employ your human intelligence more effectively. But, if your mental
              state is disturbed, full of emotion, it is very difficult to cope with
              problems, because the mind that is full of emotion is... biased, unable
              to see reality. So whatever you do will be unrealistic and naturally
              fail.<br> <br> Material progress and a higher standard of living bring us greater
              comfort and health, but do not lead to a transformation of the mind,
              which is the only thing capable of providing lasting peace. Profound
              happiness, unlike fleeting pleasures, is spiritual in nature. It
              depends on the happiness of others and it is based on love and
              affection.<br> <br> According to my own experience, the highest level of inner calm
              comes from the development of love and compassion. The more concerned
              we are with the happiness of others, the more we increase our own
              well-being. Friendliness and warmth towards others allow us to relax
              and help us to dispel any sense of fear or insecurity so we can
              overcome whatever obstacles we face.<br> <br> Many problems that confront us today are created by man, whether they
              are violent conflicts, destruction of the environment, poverty or
              hunger. These problems can be resolved thanks to human efforts by
              understanding that we are brother and sister and by developing this
              sense of closeness. We must cultivate a universal ...responsibility
              toward each other and extend it to the planet that we have to share.<br> <br> My call for a spiritual revolution is not a call for a religious
              revolution, nor for a way of life that is otherworldly It is a call for
              a radical reorientation away from our habitual preoccupation with self,
              a call to turn toward the wider community<br> <br> Too much of a self-centered attitude creates mistrust and
              suspicion in others, which can in turn lead to fear. But if you have
              more of an open mind, and you cultivate a sense of concern for others'
              well-being, then, no matter what others' attitudes are, you can keep
              your inner peace.<br> <br> Although I personally believe that our human nature is fundamentally
              gentle and compassionate, I feel it is not enough that this is our
              underlying nature; we must also develop an appreciation and awareness
              of that fact. And changing how we perceive ourselves, through learning
              and understanding, can have a very real imp...act on how we interact
              with others and how we conduct our daily lives.<br> <br> I feel that compassionate thought is the most precious thing there
              is. It is something that only we human beings can develop. And if we
              have a good heart, a warm heart, warm feelings, we will be happy and
              satisfied ourselves, and our friends will experience a friendly and
              peaceful atmosphere as well. This can be experi...enced community to
              community, country to country, continent to continent.<br> <br> Our life depends on others so much that at the root of our
              existence is a fundamental need for love. That is why it is good to
              cultivate an authentic sense of responsibility and concern for the
              welfare of others.<br> <br> Neither peace nor war exists independently of us. Political and
              military leaders have grave responsibilities with respect to peace -
              but they too are members of the society that we as individuals help to
              create. Peace in the world depends on peace in the hearts of
              individuals; this depends on each of us practising ethi...cs by
              disciplining our negative thoughts and emotions, and developing basic
              spiritual qualities.<br> <br> Today, the values of democracy, open society, respect for human rights,
              and equality are becoming recognized all over the world as universal
              values. To my mind there is an intimate connection between democratic
              values, such as transparency, the rule of law and freedom of
              information, and the fundamental values of human goodness.<br> <br> I am especially encouraged to see that thinking of consumerism as an
              end in itself seems to be giving way to an appreciation that we humans
              must conserve the earth's resources.<br> <br> When we speak of a calm state of mind or peace of mind, we shouldn't
              confuse that with an insensitive state of apathy. Having a calm or
              peaceful state of mind doesn't mean being spaced out or completely
              empty. Peace of mind or a calm state of mind is rooted in affection and
              compassion and is sensitive and responsive to others.<br> <br> People often expect the other person to respond first in a positive
              way, instead of taking the initiative to create that possibility. I
              feel that's wrong; it can act as a barrier that just promotes a feeling
              of isolation from others. To overcome feelings of isolation and
              loneliness, your underlying attitude makes a tre...mendous difference -
              approaching others with the thought of compassion in your mind is the
              best way.<br> <br> Even our physical structure seems more suited to feelings of love
              and compassion. We can see how a calm, affectionate, wholesome state of
              mind benefits our health and physical well-being. Conversely, feelings
              of frustration, fear, agitation, and anger can be destructive to our
              health. This is why we are impelled to seek happiness.<br> <br> Hatred, jealousy and excessive attachment cause suffering and
              agitation. I feel compassion can help us overcome these disturbances
              and let us return to a calm state of mind. Compassion is not just being
              kind to your friend. That involves attachment because it is based on
              expectation. Compassion is when you do something good without any
              expectations based on realizing that “the other person is also just
              like me”.<br> <br> There is no denying that consideration of others is worthwhile and
              that our happiness is inextricably bound up with the happiness of
              others. There is no denying that if society suffers, we ourselves
              suffer, and the more our hearts and minds are afflicted with ill-will,
              the more miserable we become. We can reject religi...on, ideology,
              received wisdom, but we cannot escape the need for love and compassion.</p>
