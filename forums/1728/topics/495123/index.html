              Ayojjhans on the banks of the Ganges River. There he addressed the monks:
              "Monks, suppose that a large glob of foam were floating down this Ganges
              River, and a man with good eyesight were to see it, observe it, &amp; appropriately
              examine it. To him — seeing it, observing it, &amp; appropriately examining it
              — it would appear empty, void, without substance: for what substance would
              there be in a glob of foam? In the same way, a monk sees, observes, &amp;
              appropriately examines any form that is past, future, or present; internal or
              external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near. To him — seeing
              it, observing it, &amp; appropriately examining it — it would appear empty,
              void, without substance: for what substance would there be in form?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">"Now suppose that in the autumn — when it's raining in
              fat, heavy drops — a water bubble were to appear &amp; disappear on the water,
              and a man with good eyesight were to see it, observe it, &amp; appropriately
              examine it. To him — seeing it, observing it, &amp; appropriately examining it
              — it would appear empty, void, without substance: for what substance would
              there be in a water bubble? In the same way, a monk sees, observes, &amp;
              appropriately examines any feeling that is past, future, or present; internal
              or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near. To him — seeing
              it, observing it, &amp; appropriately examining it — it would appear empty,
              void, without substance: for what substance would there be in feeling?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">"Now suppose that in the last month of the hot season a
              mirage were shimmering, and a man with good eyesight were to see it, observe

              appropriately examining it — it would appear empty, void, without substance:
              for what substance would there be in a mirage? In the same way, a monk sees,

              present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">"Now suppose that a man desiring heartwood, in quest of
              heartwood, seeking heartwood, were to go into a forest carrying a sharp ax.
              There he would see a large banana tree: straight, young, of enormous height. He
              would cut it at the root and, having cut it at the root, would chop off the
              top. Having chopped off the top, he would peel away the outer skin. Peeling
              away the outer skin, he wouldn't even find sapwood, to say nothing of
              heartwood. Then a man with good eyesight would see it, observe it, &amp;
              appropriately examine it. To him — seeing it, observing it, &amp; appropriately
              examining it — it would appear empty, void, without substance: for what
              substance would there be in a banana tree? In the same way, a monk sees,
              observes, &amp; appropriately examines any fabrications that are past, future,
              or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or
              near. To him — seeing them, observing them, &amp; appropriately examining them
              — they would appear empty, void, without substance: for what substance would
              there be in fabrications?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">"Now suppose that a magician or magician's apprentice
              were to display a magic trick at a major intersection, and a man with good
              eyesight were to see it, observe it, &amp; appropriately examine it. To him —
              seeing it, observing it, &amp; appropriately examining it — it would appear
              empty, void, without substance: for what substance would there be in a magic trick?
              In the same way, a monk sees, observes, &amp; appropriately examines any
              consciousness that is past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant
              or subtle; common or sublime; far or near. To him — seeing it, observing it,

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">"Seeing thus, the well-instructed disciple of the noble
              ones grows disenchanted with form, disenchanted with feeling, disenchanted with
              perception, disenchanted with fabrications, disenchanted with consciousness.
              Disenchanted, he grows dispassionate. Through dispassion, he's released. With
              release there's the knowledge, 'Released.' He discerns that 'Birth is ended,
              the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this
              world.'"</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One
              Well-Gone, the Teacher, said further:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Form is like a glob of foam; feeling, a bubble; perception, a
              mirage; fabrications, a banana tree; consciousness, a magic trick — this has
              been taught by the Kinsman of the Sun. However you observe them, appropriately
              examine them, they're empty, void to whoever sees them appropriately.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Beginning with the body as taught by the One with profound
              discernment: when abandoned by three things — life, warmth, &amp; consciousness
              — form is rejected, cast aside. When bereft of these it lies thrown away,
              senseless, a meal for others. That's the way it goes: it's a magic trick, an
              idiot's babbling. It's said to be a murderer. 
              No substance here is found.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Thus a monk, persistence aroused, should view the aggregates
              by day &amp; by night, mindful, alert; should discard all fetters; should make
              himself his own refuge; should live as if his head were on fire — in hopes of
              the state with no falling away.</span></p>

              sutta, makes this insightful observation:</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">This sutta is one of the most radical discourses on the empty
              nature of conditioned phenomena; its imagery (especially the similes of the
              mirage and the magical illusion) has been taken up by later Buddhist thinkers,
              most persistently by the Mï‚Œdhyamikas. Some of the images are found elsewhere in
              the Pali Canon, eg at Dh 46, 170. In the context of early Buddhist thought
              these similes have to be handled with care. They are not intended to suggest an
              illusionist view of the world but to show that our conceptions of the world,
              and of our own existence, are largely distorted by the processes of cognition. Just
              as the mirage and magical illusion are based on real existents—the sand of the
              desert, the magician’s appurtenances—so these false conceptions arise from a
              base that objectively exists, namely, the five aggregates; but when seen
              through a mind subject to conceptual distortion, the aggregates appear in a way
              that deviates from their actual nature. Instead of being seen as transient and
              selfless, they appear as substantial and as a self. (Bodhi S:B 1085 n188)</span></p>
