Strictly speaking its not related to Buddhism. If you and her is faithful partner then its ok, as there are some people who decided to stay as faithful partners and did not get married.<br><br>But of course it is completely unwise to engage in sex before marriage especially if you all are young. Then it can lead to problems like having to abort babies, which will create very very negative karma if you chose to do so.</div>

Strictly speaking, I remember reading Master Chi Zhou's ( forgot where's that book, will check it out) article that any craving for sexual gratifications is sexual misconduct. Even for married couples, if they make love in inappropriate places eg. kitchen, living room,garden, bathroom etc. instead of in the privacy of their bedroom, it is also sexual misconduct ( becos they are craving sexual excitment or gratifications).<br><br>I think many ppl in this new era would choose to dissagree with Master Chi Zhou in this, but think of what AEN mentioned above, such actions and behaviour will be planted in our 8th Consciousness.

Is masturbation a sin ? </div></blockquote>Masturbation itself does not constitute a sexual misconduct for a lay person, though masturbation in the monastic order is not allowed and constitutes and offense which requires the monk to confess to the sangha (monastic community). But anyway the difference is because monks are supposed to uphold celibacy -- that means avoiding ALL sexual activities. For lay persons we do not need to uphold celibacy, but we have to follow the third precept of 'no sexual misconduct'.<br><br>Which are,<br><br>Wrong partner-- a married person, a minor, someone in a relationship, an incompetent.<br><br>Wrong time -- day time<br><br>Wrong place -- in public, in shrine, etc.<br><br>Wrong orifice -- oral, anal.<br><br>Gender is not specified. These above can be found in the Abhidharmakosha. I do not think masturbation is mentioned.<br><br>But we must take note that it depends on your mind state. Masturbation is not only a physical act, it depends on your mental state as well, as it usually involves strong craving and sometimes lustful thoughts of sexual misconduct. This is creating a form of mental karma. Do know that karma has three forms: Mind karma, Speech karma, and Action karma. All these are volitional action (karma) and will have its karmic consequences in the future.<br><br>Negative unwholesome seeds and habit energy are planted into our 8th consciousness and may become a habit and might eventually become a monster in future or even future lifetimes as well.</div>

But anyway the difference is because monks are supposed to uphold celibacy -- that means avoiding ALL sexual activities. For lay persons we do not need to uphold celibacy, but we have to follow the third precept of 'no sexual misconduct'.<br><br>Which are,<br><br>Wrong partner-- a married person, a minor, someone in a relationship, an incompetent.<br><br>Wrong time -- day time<br><br>Wrong place -- in public, in shrine, etc.<br><br>Wrong orifice -- oral, anal.<br><br>Gender is not specified. These above can be found in the Abhidharmakosha. I do not think masturbation is mentioned.<br><br>But we must take note that it depends on your mind state. Masturbation is not only a physical act, it depends on your mental state as well, as it usually involves strong craving and sometimes lustful thoughts of sexual misconduct. This is creating a form of mental karma. Do know that karma has three forms: Mind karma, Speech karma, and Action karma. All these are volitional action (karma) and will have its karmic consequences in the future.<br><br>Negative unwholesome seeds and habit energy are planted into our 8th consciousness and may become a habit and might eventually become a monster in future or even future lifetimes as well.</div></blockquote>Wrong partner -- I can understand<br><br>Wrong time -- Why? What's wrong with having sex in day time as long as it's done in private and between consenting adults (the usual) ?<br><br>Wrong place -- I think I can understand.<br><br>Wrong orifice -- Same thing...why is this wrong?
