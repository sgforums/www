              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 22.25pt; text-align: justify;">Dr. Ambedkar in his speech
              delivered on Oct 13, 1935, in Yewala, in Nashik district had thundered that
              although he was born as a Hindu, he would not die as one. He advised the
              Depressed Classes to abandon all agitation for temple-entry privileges;
              instead, he advised that they should leave Hinduism entirely and embrace
              another religion.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 13.1pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Vexed by the rampant Caste
              discrimination rooted in the Hinduism that did not spare even a foreign
              returned doctorate scholar like him, he fought against the bigotry all his
              life. Twenty-One years later, On October 14, after studying various other
              religions he chose Buddhism – an indigenous religion of India that promotes
              peace and equality and which is based on human compassion than divine
              power.  So influenced was he about the religion that he demolished the
              caste-based Hindu ideology and gave birth to Indian Constitution based on
              Liberty Equality Fraternity and justice. The fundamental principles of the
              Constitution are indeed equality, promoting scientific temper and freedom for
              all.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 13.1pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">This year 14th October marked the
              60th Anniversary of the conversion of millions of Dalits lead by Dr. Ambedkar
              at the historic Nagpur place. The celebrations took place on October 9th as per
              Lunar Calendar. This was by far the largest religious mass conversion in the
              history of the modern world without any bloodshed.   Unfortunately,
              Dr. Amebekdar did not live longer and consequently his mass conversion at
              Mumbai and other places did not materialise.  The </span><a href="http://censusindia.gov.in/"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #446b9b;'>Censusindia.gov.in</span></a><span><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> </span></span><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">website lists Buddhist population at 8
              million as per 2011 census.  The largest concentration of Buddhism is in
              Maharashtra (58.3%), where (73.4%) of the total Buddhists in India reside.
              Karnataka (3.9 lakh), Uttar Pradesh (3.0 lakh), west Bengal (2.4 lakh) and
              Madhya Pradesh (2.0 lakh) are other states having large Buddhist population.
              Sikkim (28.1%), Arunachal Pradesh (13.0%) and Mizoram (7.9 %) are top states in
              terms of having the  maximum percentage of Buddhist population. Since most
              neo-Buddhist were erstwhile Dalits from Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar
              Pradesh,  the term Dalits and Buddhist is used interchangeably here. Some
              still maintain their Hindu caste certificate although they practice Buddhism.
              The confusion and question mark created related to reservations for converted
              Buddhist meant that people had apprehension reporting themselves as Buddhism.
              Thus, in reality, the population could be much more in reality.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 13.1pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">But Every year millions of
              Buddhist and Dalits converge to Nagpur from All over India to celebrate the
              anniversary of Conversion called as Dhamma Chakra -named after Buddhist meaning
              of revolving the Chakra. According to one estimates, turnover on the sell
              of books on Ambedkar, Buddha, Phule and other social reformers ranges in Lakhs.
              Also, there are hundreds of stalls giving educational information, assistance
              or guidance to Dalit youths. Many organisations participate in order to
               take part in this philanthropic activity.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 13.1pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Dr. Ambedkar had asked his
              followers to donate 5% of their income to social cause and uplifting their
              brothers and sisters from abject poverty and neglect. Today there are more
              people who follow Dr. Ambedkar’s idea of community services. Pankaj Meshram and
              his wife Sheetal traveled from USA to participate in the event. While Pankaj
              works for a private company, Sheetal is a doctor in US. They have been
              collaborating with local grassroot organizations in India to train,
              educate and empower Women and also Students from the lower echelon of the
              society. This includes bicycle donation, computer donation, educational
              assistance and other activities including self-defense training for Dalit
              girls. “Nowhere in the world would you see such a crowd that is driven by
              passion for social work and upliftment of downtrodden. I also liked college
              students doing street play to raise awareness and it’s a great sign to see
              youngsters carrying forward the caravan of Babasaheb Ambedkar”, Says Pankaj who
              along with Sheetal had a stall on Women’s empowerment.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 13.1pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">There are many others who have
              traveld to Nagpur. Mr. Raju Kamble has been pioneer in social work.Among other
              things, free distribution of Dr. Ambedkar literature to the young students in
              Engineering and Medical colleges for last fifteen years has been one of his
              successful ideas.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 13.1pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Vidya Bhushan Rawat, noted
               journalist also took part in the Deeksha Bhoomi event this year. He wrote
              “We hope with this positive minds working together will see changes in India
              for an enlightened India of Babasaheb Ambedkar’s dream. They came in lakhs to
              pay their tribute to celebrate the Historic Day of Ashoka Vijaya Dashami in
              Nagpur when the Dhamma Chakra pravartan day celebrations overshadow the Dussera
              celebrations in the RSS headquarters just miles away. Everywhere you see
              Dhammachakra, the Buddha and Dr. Ambedkar their literature, music,
              culture, theater, dance and reverence — everything here to understand what
              makes Dr. Ambedkar the tallest intellect of India. The people come on their own
              and their emotions and passion can only be understood if you have sensitivity”</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 13.1pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">You’d imagine all this positive
              news would make excellent sound bites for the mainstream media. Isnt it? But
              not to be. Just like every year, the mainstream Media continued to boycott
               such historical and mammoth gatherings. You will never see in mainstream
              media, Print or Electronic Hindi or English, giving any coverage to this grand
              event attended by millions. Even local Marathi TV channels in Maharashtra
              covers the Deekshabhoomi event scantily.  This year they covered
              half-a-minute sound bite of the chief minister Devendra Fadanavis, who attended
              the event at DeekshaBhoomi Nagpur, without elaborating anything about the
              event. To mark this anniversary, every year, thousands of low caste people
              willingly convert to Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 13.1pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Just few kilometers from Deeksha
              Bhoomi the RSS does its annual  Dussera festival and it’s aired live on
              many channels or covered extensively but censors Dikshabhoomi.   Rediff
              recently reported that in Gujarat, following the Una Dalit atrocity, hundreds
              of Dalits have taken a pledge  to Buddhism on occasion of the 60th
              Anniversary of Conversion. Again, the Mainstream media turns a blind eye. (</span><a href="http://www.rediff.com/news/report/three-hundred-dalits-convert-to-buddhism-in-gujarat/20161012.htm"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #446b9b;'>http://www.rediff.com/news/report/three-hundred-dalits-convert-to-buddhism-in-gujarat/20161012.htm</span></a><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">)</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 13.1pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">While Nagpur has DeekshaBhoomi,
              Mumbai has Chaitya Bhoomi, the place where Dr. Ambedkar was cremated on 6 Dec
              1956. Millions of Dalits gather here to pay their homage and yet there is never
              a media coverage. If anything, this event is reported in the news form of
              traffic congestion and pollution or inconvenience to the residents living in
              the vicinity. Again, here too its the books that get sold more than ritualistic
              material like garlands or incense sticks. Last year on 6th Dec, some youths led
              by young Poet and Journalist Vaibhav Chhaya started a noble initiative along
              with groups of his friends – ‘One book, One Pen’. Millions of pens and
              notebooks were thus donated by each person visiting. They were later
              distributed to the needy students and schools. The group has replicated his
              success to Deekshabhomi this year.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 13.1pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Granted, Mainstream media does
              highlight, to some extent, the atrocities committed on Dalits.  Although
              they do not make to prime time debates, it is at least reported. But positive
              news or show of strength almost finds no mention in Mainstream media.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 13.1pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">In the age of social media, the
              mainstream media gets completely exposed with its  overt bias towards
              gatherings of Dalits and Buddhists.</span></p>

              <p>It may not be unkind to maintain low profile for buddhism there, and especially when and if buddhism would become too famous to be true<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> . It may be exploited to conflict with other or vice versa, that thwart the harmony in all.</p>
              <p>If worldly system has a solution to their problem, Buddha would not be reincarnated in India, why the need to trouble troubles. The reason for Buddha Shakyamuni to reincarnate in India then was exactly Hinduism or worldly races can't solve caste system issue. Hinduism ascetic were highest caste in India, commanding highest respect and honour. however, their solution to daily issues of people in India then was staying ascetism in forest places, which was not the way for all. Buddha Shakyamuni was throne to be and the highest caste in India. He renounced his status and materialism to seek and discovered the answer for true equality, happiness and beyond death &amp; rebirth of all beings, which stated that all beings are equally the same as the enlightened one, but owing to their delusion and attachment that prevented them from actualisation. </p>
