                  School in Boudhanath in the Nepalese capital Kathmandu where the Tibetan
                  community was scheduled to celebrate the 81st birthday of the Dalai Lama
                  was swarmed by Nepalese police early this morning, disrupting the
                  celebrations and even detaining close to 30 Tibetans including the Tibetan
                  Settlement Officer. The celebratory event has now been forced to cancel.<br> <br> The developments come as a surprise move by the police considering the fact
                  that proper permission had earlier been granted by concerned Nepalese
                  authorities for the celebratory function, according to a source who wish to
                  remain anonymous. The source further adds that, “the Police have threatened
                  the Tibetan people to leave the venue immediately or else face detention.”
                  Currently, the detained Tibetans are being held at the Brikuti Mandap
                  police station in Boudha area. <br> <br> The Nepalese police, as seen in photos and videos circulating on social
                  media sites, were blocking the main gate to the school and were seen
                  nudging and shoving Tibetans instructing them to abandon the event. Pema, a
                  Tibetan youth living in Boudha who was at the venue spoke with Phayul about
                  the situation and described the incident as “hellish”. “Anyone who is
                  wearing Tibetan dress or wearing monastic robes is detained in the
                  vicinity. We were merely celebrating the birthday of our beloved leader, it
                  is not political. Besides, the same police were smiling and accepting our
                  help and donations during the earth quake last year when Tibetans and
                  Nepalese people were working together for relief efforts in the aftermath.
                  What was supposed to be a joyous occasion has turned into a sad one,” Pema
                  lamented.<br> <br> The birthday celebration is an important date in the calendar for the
                  Tibetans and more so for the Tibetan refugees who are increasingly targeted
                  by the police under pressure from China. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>The itinerary for this year’s celebration
                  were organized and prepared since months ago; the stage, the program
                  itself, an opera performance, cultural performances and food and
                  assortments have all gone waste, said a Tibetan. The same source added,
                  “The cost of the event estimated to at least 10 lakh rupees have all gone
                  to waste but more importantly the psyche of the Tibetan people will never
                  be the same again. We now feel suffocated with the kind of restrictions
                  meted against us.”<br> <br> Nepal which is home to more than 20,000 Tibetans who either came across the
                  border or were born to settlers, are finding it hard to sustain a free and
                  normal existence. The Nepalese government’s treatment of the Tibetan
                  refugees has taken a turn for the worse in the last few years with China
                  pumping in cheap interest loans and relaxed FDR (Foreign Direct Investment)
                  schemes in exchange for its will to be imposed. China’s FDR in Nepal has
                  shot to $128 million in 2015 up from $24 million in 2014 besides perks such
                  as a fleet of Mercedes SUVs.<br> <br> The Nepalese government has publicly spoken on the issue when Nepal's
                  foreign minister, Mahendra Bahadur Pandey, earlier during a visit to
                  Beijing in March, said that they, “will never allow any forces to use
                  Nepali territory to engage in anti-China activity."<br> <br> With China gaining the upper hand in controlling the moors in the tiny
                  Himalayan nation replacing India with the promise of riches, the Tibetans
                  who set foot on Nepalese soil decades ago are once again subjected to
                  thinly veiled wrath of China.</span></p>

              <p>Would'nt it be easier if the Dalai Lama in his own words "is just a simple monk".</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the Dalai Lama is much more than a " simple monk". He carry many hats,spiritual leader to many, also to Tibetans in exile, amongst others. Many times a wall flower to invite and grace any capitalist administration's office in less vocal snub to communist China.</p>
              <p>However, he is also seen a an icon of peace. The violent vocalization from some of his adherents are rather unsettling. They sounded like anything than "peaceful, loving kindness or compassion"</p>
              <p>But then, he is also a politician, that's why we must be vigilant of his words and actions.</p>
              <p>His unfortunate meddling in Karma Kagyud's internal affairs has cause much grief and problems that should have been resolve within the sect. But as I state, the Dalai Lama is more than a "simple monk".</p>
