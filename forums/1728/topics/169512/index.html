            <div class='col-md body'>Speaking about the white hair in another topic  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> reminded me about this:<br><br><blockquote>(Translated by sinwei)<br><br>i roughly translate a few potions i find interesting from an audio q&amp;a by Xin Fu Yin Pusa 幸福音菩萨(aka Ven Shen Kai).<br><br>One asked Ven Shen Kai, Kuan Yin Bodhisattva promo Compassion gate. Da Shi Zhi promo Renunciation gate. Manjushiri promo Wisdom gate. Then what gate do you promo? 'I' promo Blissful/Fortune gate. Hence people called Him - Xin Fu Yin Pusa幸福音菩萨.<br><br>Buddhism wants you to doubt. Big doubt = big realisation. Small doubt = small realisation. No doubt = no realisation.<br><br>Disciple: Master, how do we witness Sukhavathi?<br>Master Shen Kai: That's easy. But Sukhavathi is very far away. How far? It's passing through hundreds of thousands of millions of Buddhalands. In between this hundreds of thousands of millions of Buddhalands are not Buddhalands but Hui Tu(wisdom land?). Buddhalands are pure where Buddhas dwell. Sukhavathi is hence very very far away. Far does not mean we don't believe.<br><br>In the sutras, Buddha used to explain that it's very very near. So near that nobody believe it's true. There's no choice as sentient beings are too greedy, hence say it's very very far away and not easy to go or reach. So He expound the Amitabha Sutra, where Buddha spoke without people asking. If a person is not greedy, then Dharmakaya is very near as it encompass everything.<br>Since it's entire existence, it's so near to reach like space everywhere exist Dharmakaya. Without Dharmakaya, Earth cannot be in the space. Cars cannot works. Every thing is benefited by Dharmakaya.<br><br>When people do business, they need an initial funding, now Buddha say you don't need that initial funding, you believe in Amitabha and recite His name.<br>When one see people wearing a gold necklace, but it's just a piece of metal chain like the one you see in jail to chain prisioners. Then Buddha told sentient beings not to be obsess with gold, you just need to recite Amitabha and don't need any initial funding and you can reborn in a place where gold is use for building constructions.<br>So does Sukhavathi really exist? Yes. Don't think Buddha is lying. You can GO NOW and witness yourself and come back to tell people. Master tell you I been there before, you all might disbelieve. So I will describe it to you.<br>Sentient beings on Earth are very small, Bodhisattvas of Sukhavathi are really Big and tall. A person standing next to Amitabha only reach the height of Amitabha's toe! When I reached Sukhavathi, only wish to pay homage to Amitabha, and adore Amitabha.<br>Amitabha Buddha reply: What do you seek here in Sukhavathi?<br>Shen Kai: Honored One, i came to seek Dharma.<br>Amitabha Buddha ask: What kind of Dharma?<br>Shen Kai: i'm not sure. Seeing Amitabha's forehead is adorned with a curled hair白毫. i wisk to seek that Dharma, Honorable One.<br>(Back to reality.) That's how I cultivate and got my curled hair 白毫, but this Dharma method cannot anyhow expound to people. It's is because you people have doubt in Sukhavathi. Thinking it doesn't exist. Hence I tell you my experience. Due to the busy schedule, the white hair is curled. When it grew longer to 3 inch, it will extend when i'm washing the face. That's the proof. ohmy.gif<br><br>How did Ocean of suffering (ku hai wu bian) come about? Because beings of samsara cannot sever emotion, love and greed. Sentinet beings cry a lot. Separation from friend, family, love ones, people cry. Son is leaving, mother crys, so does the son. Mother is dying, sons also crys. When people want's to eat, the mouth starts to water. This is greed. People need to work, they swear. In a life them, people generate so many water. One person, say one bucket of water, 100 pax, 100 bucket form a pool of water. If millions of millions of people cannot sever emotion, love and greed, form an Ocean of water.<br><br>In our world there's male and female. Those who goes to jail, 99% are involve with female. But in Sukhavathi, there's not male nor female form.<br><br>---<br><br>/\</blockquote></div>
