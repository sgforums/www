              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 4.7pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt; "><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: BentonSansCondMedium;">Before kindergarten, kids are curious about spiritual expression
              and hungry to learn. Here's how to teach them </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 14.05pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 14.05pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">If a spiritual compass, commitment to
              family, and spiritual community as a sustaining source of love are must haves
              for children’s life journey, then spiritual multilingualism is their passport.
              Having our own spirituality and sense of community, whatever that may be, is
              important to a child. But you want your child to be able to see the sacred in
              others. Spiritual multilingualism enables us to cross familiar borders and
              embrace the essence of spirituality in its many cultural narratives.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 14.05pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 14.05pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Children come to understand
              that diverse spiritual traditions share common themes and often have parallel
              ideas and observances: the rhythm of the seasons, the birth of a baby,
              ceremonies of commitment, or rituals around death and mourning. Having your own
              spiritual or religious orientation but being able to hear and understand others
              doesn’t only make it easier to engage with other people; it also enhances your
              own access to sacred experience by making these universal inner connections
              available to you wherever we go. A child who is conversant in the “many names,
              many faces” of spiritual practice can find the sacred in others— engage more
              meaningfully with other people in our diverse global culture.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 14.05pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 14.05pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">“The biggest mistake people
              make when first beginning to look at unfamiliar perspectives is immediately to
              make comparisons between the familiar and the unfamiliar,” writes Buddhist
              feminist theologian and author Rita Gross. “The power of the comparative lens
              comes not from making positive and negative comparisons; rather, it comes from
              seeing each perspective clearly, in its own right. In other words, one gets a
              deeper understanding of one’s own perspective by understanding how others
              understand their own perspective.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 14.05pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 14.05pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">In childhood, natural
              spirituality of the heart very quickly attaches to the names, stories, and
              rules to which our children gain daily exposure. Starting as early as age four
              and certainly by age seven, children absorb the language and customs of thought
              used to express spirituality in their family or spiritual community. Research
              shows that for children these names are prioritized as spiritually “more real.”
              A team of Harvard psychologists led by professor Mahzarin Banaji, investigated
              whether very young children, ages four to six, already had in- group versus
              outgroup—<em>my God is better than your God</em>— perceptions around the names
              of the higher power. The team found in controlled experiments, a child as young
              as age six will rate “God” as named by her faith as more omniscient than “God”
              as named by another geographically remote unfamiliar faith. No matter what we
              may think about religion, we want to be sure children are open to other
              possibilities. You want your kid to be as open minded as possible. As parents,
              we want to act early, deliberately, and swiftly. We do not want a child to
              build tribal superiority, which has nothing to do with a clear and open
              pipeline for natural spirituality. Theology competition is a misguided form of
              implicit socialization that ultimately distorts access to transcendent love in
              all three forms of self, other, and higher power.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 14.05pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 14.05pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">The early mental packaging
              of a child’s natural spirituality makes imperative— read <em>urgent</em>— that
              our children become, in essence, spiritually multilingual and multicultural
              from an early age if we genuinely want them to have respect and appreciation
              for natural spirituality in other people and cultures. This “many faces, many
              names” perspective is the opposite of religious chauvinism and all other
              “isms.” Offer your child a window into the religions of other families and
              peoples. As ambassadors, offer the opportunity to feel transcendence in many
              places and ways.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 14.05pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 14.05pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Well before kindergarten,
              but certainly by elementary school, kids are primed to want to learn about
              spiritual expression and they are hungry to learn. Walk by any house of
              worship— a mosque, a temple, church, or a cathedral, a Spirit Hut— and a child
              will be curious and want to explore inside. They see a house of worship built
              for prayer or contemplation, or spiritual community life, and they want to
              experience it too. They are already little universal beings. Explain to them
              that God and spirituality has many faces as seen by humans. Teach them, too,
              that all people of genuine, loving spiritual nature share a fundamental sense
              of goodness in how they view others and the world we share. Your child is ready
              to understand other faiths, traditions, and cultures. Speak with her about
              other religions with interest, share what you know, learn more together, and
              see where your own spirituality can find expression in other faith traditions.
              Talking together will give her language to speak about other forms of
              spirituality and also give her words to discuss her own choices and spiritual
              views.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 14.05pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 14.05pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Jane (who earlier shared her
              epiphany of walking with God through the grass as a six- year- old) had grown
              up in a tiny farm town of one hundred people and attended a small community
              church and Sunday school most Sundays. There, she said, “I had imbibed a sense
              of a boundless and loving God—no fundamentalism, no dogma, just a belief in an
              all-powerful divine being whose presence made the universe fundamentally good.”
              That open and loving religious backdrop “permanently changed my view of
              spirituality, and gave me confidence to know that our connection with the
              universe, or with God, or what ever we define as the uniting energy, is a deeply
              personal one, and that it doesn’t have to be bounded by any dogma or sectarian
              rules,” Jane said. “I have been grateful for that many times, because I believe
              it helped me remain open to learning about all faiths— including the Buddhism
              embraced some thirty years later by my husband at the time, a lapsed Catholic.
              It has also given me hope in times when I felt alienated from religions of all
              kinds.”</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 14.05pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 14.05pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Spiritual multilingualism
              isn’t only about accepting others. We also grow as spiritual beings more able
              to fully engage our human experience. Rolland, a young man of nearly thirty,
              told me how his grandmother died of a sudden illness when he was eight. She
              lived in India, her homeland, and— unlike Rolland’s family in the United States
              who were Baptist— she was Hindu, something he heard for the first time when he
              heard his parents talking about her funeral arrangements. His grandmother was
              much beloved, and as he felt the loss reverberate through his family he also
              found himself thinking for the first time about aspects of his religious
              upbringing that he had never really thought about before: how death was
              explained in his Baptist community, and other religions’ different views of the
              life, death, and an afterlife. Learning of his grandmother’s Hinduism inspired
              Rolland to feel and know transcendence through the path of his grandmother’s
              spiritual practice.</span><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";  '></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 14.05pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 14.05pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">As children grow and take in
              more and more of the world— events, debates, conflicts at home and globally— a
              foundation of respect and an awareness of universal spiritual themes will help
              prevent them from seeing fellow human beings as distant others or inherently
              wrong because of different religious or spiritual expression. Fluency in many
              spiritual languages can deepen and permanently strengthen their capacity for
              heart knowing, including seeing the transcendent in people who look and pray
              differently.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 14.05pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 14.05pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">More schools are venturing
              into spiritual multilingualism as part of their curriculum in global,
              multicultural education. Foote School, a progressive and culturally diverse day
              school in New Haven, Connecticut, sends its sixth- grade class— eleven- and
              twelve- year- olds—on a series of field trips to augment their study of world
              religions. The program is part of the humanities curriculum, designed to give
              students experiences to help them be global citizens in our diverse world. I
              was invited to accompany the class on a field trip, focusing on the Abrahamic
              traditions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 14.05pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 14.05pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">To get to know these faiths
              at least a step beyond classroom study, the students were taken to three
              landmark houses of worship in New York City: St. John the Divine, the largest
              cathedral in the United States; Temple Emanu-El, generally considered the most
              architecturally spectacular Reform synagogue; and the Islamic Cultural Center
              Mosque, spiritual home to the city’s Muslim community, all of these houses of
              worship accommodating countless international visitors each year. Each
              structure is breathtaking, exceptional, and vast.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 14.05pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 14.05pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">From the grand cathedral to
              the grand synagogue to the grand mosque, the children craned their heads up and
              around and a breathy universal choir of “Wow!” echoed through each sanctuary.
              At each stop our school guide and the welcoming clergy took the students
              through these great halls of worship, and pointed out architectural highlights
              that reflect aspects of the faith’s spiritual foundations. At St. John’s, the
              crucifix and the stained glass windows depict the biblical roots of
              Christianity. In Temple Emanu-El’s historic hand- scribed Torah scrolls the
              students could see the durable expression of an ancient spiritual story and
              people. And at the Islamic temple, the sea of men kneeling in midday prayer was
              a vivid reminder of spiritual devotion embodied in each and the many gathered
              together.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 14.05pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 14.05pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">At various points along the
              way these children on the cusp of adolescence asked the clergy respectfully
              about different prayers, rituals, and symbolism. They listened intently,
              absorbing the distinguishing features, and the commonalities, of the different
              faiths. Their questions and comments reflected their growing capacity for
              reflection and a probing desire to connect this practice in this place of
              worship, with their own inner knowing of the heart. In one activity, the
              teacher asked the children to draw in a journal something from anywhere within
              the great structure that touched them with personal meaning or significance. A
              Jewish girl drew the votive candles at St. John the Divine. A non- Jewish boy
              drew the Torah scrolls from the sanctuary at Temple Emanu- El, and a group of
              nearly half- dozen children stood attentive and respectful for quite a while
              before they drew the kneeling men at the mosque.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 14.05pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 14.05pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">As we stood outside waiting
              for the bus, a chaperoning teacher explained to me that the school hoped the
              children would “respect the differences,<br> but more fundamentally find the common ground between faiths,” she said. “We
              want them to truly feel at home in all three spaces, rather than just passing
              by on the street, wondering what goes on inside.” Judging from the students’
              enthusiasm, the trip accomplished that. Equally important, as evidenced by
              their responses to the drawing assignment, all of the children found something
              of personal meaning or significance, and many did so in houses of worship and
              religious contexts that were not familiar to them previously.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 14.05pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 14.05pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">You don’t have to wait for a
              school field trip to broaden your child’s spiritual horizons. You can go on
              those walks together, visit houses of worship and respectfully explore, or
              search online sources for information and commentary, or virtual tours of
              historic religious sites and spiritual communities around the globe. You can
              encourage your child to hear at the level of their heart the wisdom contained
              in a world of faiths as well as from those on their own spiritual journeys.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 14.05pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 14.05pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">You can’t order up moments
              of transcendent illumination, but you can open the space for them by supporting
              your child’s sense that spiritual connection exists everywhere and at all
              times— and that they can find it in people everywhere. <em>You have your own
              inner spiritual wisdom through which to experience the wisdom in
              traditions around us. Even if in our family</em> <em>we have a strong one of
              our own, we can learn different things from other spiritual</em> <em>traditions.
              All are valuable to our own understanding of spiriutality.</em></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 14.05pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 14.05pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">If you welcome questions,
              they will come. The child is making sense of messages from without, trying to
              link up these messages with experiences of the heart. The child also is a keen
              empirical scientist of spirit, making observations that are consistent or
              inconsistent between family and cultural messages and knowing of the heart.
              Sometimes these are moral questions, sometimes they are big structural cosmic
              questions, sometimes they are picking up something within their own heart.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 14.05pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 14.05pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">So they will ask you
              foundational questions: They will hear about something— let’s just say
              reincarnation— and the questions bubble forth:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 14.05pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 14.05pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><em><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">If you were born a
              rabbit, can you come back as a human? Could I come back</span></em><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"> <em>as rabbit? </em>You don’t have to be an expert in
              world religions to honor your child’s questions, welcome the conversation, and
              explore the world of ideas together, whether that’s through online resources or
              from your own—and your child’s— perspective. You can ask: <em>What do you think?
              Have you ever sensed you may have been a rabbit? How so? </em>Let your
              child’s curiosity drive the exploration. If you hop on board to visit these
              questions together, you give importance to the discoveries for both of you.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 14.05pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 14.05pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Silence is the worst thing
              you can do to your child’s spiritual development. Silence sends the
              implicit message that a child’s transcendent experiences and feelings are
              “off the map,” not “really real,” or are not important enough for your
              family to discuss. This can be the accidental side effect of a parent’s
              own avoidance of spiritual questions, or a side stepping of cultural or
              religious blending within a family. But losing the place of natural
              spirituality in the home is a loss to the child. A young teen girl explain
              it this way.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 14.05pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 14.05pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">My mother was raised Hindu.
              Well sort of— that is what she really is. But she went to Catholic school,
              and she believes in Jesus, so officially she is Christian. My father was
              raised Jewish, but did not really observe as a child. So because they did
              not have the same religion we got rid of it as a family— and we are
              atheists. Well, not really atheists. We just don’t talk about it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 14.05pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 14.05pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">This highly articulate girl
              went on to share that she felt joy and felt uplifted when visiting a
              beautiful cathedral on a class trip, but she had no frame of reference for
              understanding these feelings as coming from a source of spirituality
              within her. Her parents’ rejection of religion had prevented the
              recognition of spirituality as a natural, personal faculty of direct
              knowing, and connection to a larger universe through head and heart.
              Spiritual multilingualism can hold on to direct knowing, far better than
              silence, if a single religious “language” does not make sense for a
              family.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 14.05pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 14.05pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">No matter how complicated or
              ill prepared you feel approaching this spiritual conversation, there is
              always a way to do it. In a religiously “mixed marriage,” it’s less
              important in <em>which </em>religion or spiritual language you land. The
              essential point is that you provide your child with a way to
              explore natural spirituality. You don’t even have to have a clear stance
              on your own spirituality. You simply need to show that you respect the
              quest and support the exploration. Divorced from the field of love,
              language and symbolism can be misused to teach prejudice, bigotry, and
              beliefs in religious superiority—in effect, being used to kill off
              experience and close minds. Within the field, spiritual multilingualism
              opens up things, broadens the conduit to heart knowing and a child’s inner
              compass. Now is the time—in this first decade—to sustain the spiritual
              conversation in the way you welcome questions and conversation. As
              learners and as spiritual beings, our children need to be free, not held
              in place by systems of reasoning and limitations of language and socializations.</span></p>
