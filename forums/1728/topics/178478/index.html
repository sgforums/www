I do not think its takes one lifetime to overcome anger. Even if one overcome anger in this lifetime, it is not the result of this lifetime, but previous innumerable past lives as well.<br><br>keep on practising on tolerance, patience and compassion to those that are unkind or rude to us.<br><br></div>

Where does it come from?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The human beingÂ’s seventh mind-consciousness is the Â“IÂ”. Because of Â“IÂ”, it gives rise to Â“myÂ”. Because of Â“meÂ”, it gives rise to self-attachment, followed by attachment of perception such as Â“I like it this way Â…Â” or Â“I like it that way Â…Â” In the end, people become attached to everything, be it right or wrong. This is the root cause of distress and suffering. Â“IgnoranceÂ” means darkness and without brightness. <strong>People lose their temper because of ignorance. If we investigate the reason for being angry, at the beginning most people will blame it on others. On further investigation, we will discover that the anger stems from self-ignorance. When we have understood this principle, we will realize that these are due to this Â“IÂ” (seventh mind-consciousness, transient-invisible body).</strong> Therefore if we allow it (the ignorance) to further develop and lead according to the wishes of this Â“IÂ”, we will certainly descend to a lower realm of life, because the root of this Â“IÂ” is ignorance.</span><br><br>Practise mindfulness, simply note the arising and ceasing of the thoughts. A true practitioner is not affected by thoughts. He simply remains aware. So whats the difference when the thoughts arise in him compared to the thoughts that arise in an ordinary being? It is that the thoughts do not 'belong to him'. He is detached from them, and simply watches the arising and ceasing of the thoughts.<br><br>This website is also good: <a href="http://courses.dl.kent.edu/21020/emotionsppt2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://courses.dl.kent.edu/21020/emotionsppt2.htm</a> - A Buddhist Technique for Dealing with Anger<br>Thich Nhat HanhÂ’s steps of mindfulness<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else; you are the one who gets burned."<br><br>- Buddha</span><br><br>My Master was once scolded badly by someone. All the while he was smiling... looking as if he was listening very attentively at him. At the end of it the person under the spell of ignorance left... my taiwanese teacher asked my master "what did the guy just scolded you for??" and my master said, <strong>"I don't know!"</strong>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> It is not that my master was not paying attention, it is that practitioners immediately 'delete' things that is not worthy to him.

I get irritated and frustrated all the time, but I hardly every get really angry. In fact, the last time I got angry was when i was still serving NS, and I got into a fist fight with my platoon mate then <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>However, I think anger and irritation are the same because these two are negative emotions. I managed my irritation by focusing on the positive/ beautiful things in my life, i.e. mostly my wife and kids. I will also pour out my grievances to my wife. That is always a great source of relief for me.</div>
