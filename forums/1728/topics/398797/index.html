              <p>Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche:</p>
              <p>There are two types of mindfulness: deliberate and effortless. By 
              starting out with the mindfulness of deliberate attention, the 
              practitioner can make a clear distinction between being distracted or 
              not. Effortless mindfulness is of course possible if you happen to be 
              one of the people of the highest calibre - the instantaneous type of 
              person - who does not really need to go through the path. However, for 
              most other people, especially in the Mahamudra system, the mindfulness 
              of deliberate attention is essential in the beginning. Otherwise, by 
              relying only on effortless mindfulness, you may not even notice whether 
              you are distracted or not. Even worse, you may convince yourself that 
              you are never distracted. Rather than this, it is much better to 
              practice deliberate mindfulness even though it is subtly conceptual, and
               gradually progress to effortless mindfulness. <br> <br> In the Mahamudra teachings, you often find the phrase 'original innate 
              nature'. This is none other than buddha nature. The training is simply 
              to become used to that, whether you call it Mahamudra, Madhyamika or 
              Dzogchen. These are all different words for the same natural state. But 
              to train, you must first of all be introduced to, and have then 
              recognized the view. In Mahamudra, once the practitioner has recognized 
              the view, he or she takes mindfulness as the path; it is a way of 
              training in that view. If mindfulness is lost, then he/she is led 
              completely astray into the 'black dissipation' of ordinary habitual 
              patterns. Black dissipation means one forgets all thought of practice 
              and simply deviates into ordinary activities. All practice is left 
              behind. So, either we remember the view and sustain it (remain 
              undistracted), or the practice is destroyed. We need to know when we are
               distracted. Discursive thought is distraction, but once we recognize 
              the essence of the thought, we arrive at non-thought. A quote from The 
              Rain of Wisdom by Jamgon Lodro Thaye says: "Within complexity I 
              discovered dharmakaya; within thought I discovered non-thought."<br> <br> A person of the highest capacity can immediately arrive at effortless 
              mindfulness. This is someone who possesses the continuity of former 
              training from the life before this, who has been reborn with a very 
              strong aptitude for this type of practice. Needless to say, most people 
              do not belong to this category. Most of us are not of the highest 
              capacity, so there is no way around having to remind ourselves of the 
              view by deliberately being mindful. <br> <br> That which goes astray is simply our attention. Our mind becomes 
              distracted, and that which brings us back to the view is called 
              'deliberate mindfulness'. In the same way, if you want the light to come
               on in a room, a conscious act is necessary. You must put your finger on
               the switch and press it; the light does not turn itself on. In the same
               way again, unless a beginner reminds him/herself determinedly to 
              remember the view, the recognition of mind-essence never occurs. The 
              moment we notice we have been carried away, we think, "I have wandered 
              off". By recognizing the identity of who has been distracted, you 
              automatically arrive back in the view. The reminder is nothing more than
               that. This moment (of recognition) is like pressing the light-switch. 
              Once the light is on, you do not have to keep pressing the switch. After
               a while, we may again forget and are carried away. At that point, we 
              must reapply deliberate mindfulness.</p>
