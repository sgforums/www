              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 16.0pt;">Senses Perception – The Interpretation of the Logical
              School </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 1.231;">In early Buddhism, the origin of a perception was
              explained as an interdependent between three elements; an external object, a
              sense organ and pure consciousness. This produces a sensation resulting in the
              formation of an image, concept or a judgment by the element of conception. The
              element of pure consciousness is present in all cognition. It is the sixth
              sense organ. The mind/intellect is a part of this organ.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 1.231;">Here the soul of the eternalist that lights up the
              external organs and make the whole process of cognition conscious is dropped. The
              whole process of coordinating the external organs and the internal operation of
              the mind is replaced by the sixth organ. This organ, the pure consciousness is
              employed in watching the operation of the mind perceived by ourselves which is
              the special objects of the sixth sense. It only assists the work of the other senses
              in the perception of external objects. It is thus a stream of pure consciousness
              cognizing all mental phenomena directly and external object indirectly.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 1.231;">Dignaga was led to abolish the sixth sense and to
              replace the physical sense organ by pure sensation. The perception of an object
              was explained as a moment of pure sensation followed by the construction of the
              image of the object by the Understanding, a mental or intelligible sensation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 1.231;">The logicians believe that what a thing is in itself,
              what its essence is can never be express. It does not exist. We can only know things
              by their relations. What the colour blue is, we will never know. We can only
              divide all colours in blue and non-blue. The non-blue can be further divided
              into other varieties of colours. The definition of blue is that it is non-blue
              and vice versa.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 1.231;">Sense perceptions or cognition by the senses is only
              the first moment of perception. Subsequence operation when attention is aroused
              is just a process of recognition. When attention is aroused it is not pure
              sense perception anymore. The main function of sense perception is to signalize
              the presence of an object in the ken, its mere presence and nothing more. The
              construction of the image of the object is another function by another agency,
              the Understanding. The salient feature of sense perception is that, it is non
              constructive. Sense perception shorn of all its memory is pure sense perception.
              It is also a valid source of knowledge.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 1.231;">Perception is more than just sense perception alone,
              it also mean direct knowledge or intuition as contrasted with indirect knowledge
              by concepts through our Understanding. Our Understanding is also a source of
              illusion since it constructs image of reality instead of a direct intuition.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 1.231;">Sense perception is one variety of intuition. There is
              also another form of intuition, an intelligible one. But it is a faculty of a
              saint rather than that of an ordinary humanity. This intelligible intuition is
              present in every perception. It is the 2</span><sup>nd</sup><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 1.231;"> moment that follows on
              each pure sensation before our understanding takes over and constructs an image
              of each pure sensation.</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 1.231;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 1.231;">Dharmakirti says – That sensation is something quite
              different from productive imagination and can be proven just by introspection.
              Now, if we are to stare at a patch of colour and withdraw all our thoughts from
              it and become as though unconscious of it, this will be the condition of pure
              sensation. If we than to awakened from that condition and begin to think, we
              will notice a feeling of remembering that we have an image before us, but we
              did not notice it whilst we are in the foregoing condition because it was pure
              sensation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 1.231;">We do have an unmistakable feeling of our personal
              identity, a sense of our own self. This feeling accompanies every state of our
              consciousness. When we see some object and at the same time are conscious of a
              pleasant feeling arising, it is a feeling of the condition of our ego. It is a
              direct self-perception in being self-conscious. It is something additional
              accompanying every mental state, different from the perceived external object.
              This something is our own ego. It is a direct, non constructive and not an
              illusion. It therefore falls under the definition of sense-perception as one of
              its varieties.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 1.231;">It is a fundamental tenet of the Logical school that
              every consciousness is self-consciousness. Consciousness can only be known by
              itself. It is self-luminous whereas matter and external objects can only be
              known through consciousness. A cognition of an external object is a cognition
              of that cognition, it is an awareness of our awareness. Dharmakirti point out
              that such mental state as pain and pleasure are of the nature of consciousness
              and they cannot be cognized by other cognitions. It does than follows that all
              cognitions and mental states are self cognized. That all volition is, on the
              one hand connected with some object and on the other side self-conscious. It is
              maintained that if we did not know that we have perceive a blue patch, we never
              would have perceived it. Thus, all consciousness, mental phenomena, images,
              ideas, feeling and volitions are self-conscious in themselves. Self-consciousness
              in this sense is synonymous with life.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 1.231;">In Buddhist logic, the two diverse elements of a
              non-constructive pure sensation and a constructive or conceptual synthesis, together
              with the theory of introspection and Buddhist Nominalism is the basic fundamental
              feature on the subject of Buddhist epistemology.</span></p>
