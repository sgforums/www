              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.231;">Should we take the Buddha at his word? Larry
              Rosenberg encourages us to put the teachings to the test.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>The practice of the
              dharma is learning how to live, and this is both hard and joyful work. Practice
              makes extraordinary demands of us. It requires that we take nothing for
              granted, that we accept nothing on faith alone. If we practice with diligence
              and honesty, then we must question everything about ourselves; we must
              challenge our most basic beliefs and convictions, even those we may have about
              the dharma itself. Of all the teachings of the Buddha, the <em>Kalama Sutta</em> is one of my favorites precisely because it encourages such rigorous inquiry
              into our beliefs. Indeed, if Buddhism were not infused with the spirit of this
              sutta—a spirit of questioning, of critical examination—I’m quite sure I would
              not have a meditative practice today.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>I was raised in what
              you might call a tradition of skepticism. My father was the first to teach me
              the importance of asking questions. He came from a line of fourteen rabbis but,
              like his own ex-rabbi father, he rejected that heritage—although “rejected,”
              actually, is too weak a term. He frequently expressed contempt not only for
              Orthodox Judaism, but for all religions. I remember that before Hebrew school,
              my father would pull me aside and say things like, “Ask the rabbi just how
              Moses got that river to split.” Well, I would go along with it, but as you can
              imagine, that never went over very well. Rabbi Minkowitz was not particularly
              pleased to be questioned in this way. I think my father was the first in
              recorded history actually to pay a rabbi not to give a talk at his son’s bar
              mitzvah. My father said, “Please. Here’s the money. Don’t give a talk.” But the
              rabbi gave the talk anyway. And my father was fuming.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>So my father believed
              in the necessity of thinking critically, and he instilled this in me. His way
              of parenting was very similar to the scientific approach. If I got into
              trouble—I was usually very good at home, but I got into a lot of mischief at
              school and in the neighborhood—I’d be put on trial when my father came home
              from work. He had always wanted to be a lawyer or a judge, but he drove a cab,
              so he had to settle for a court made up of my mother and me. His court was very
              sensitive and reasonable: He would hear the accused out, and sometimes, after
              listening to all sides, he would drop the charges. Of course, my mother would
              smile, and they were both happy that I got off. But my father always explained
              to me why I should have acted differently: “When you did that, your Aunt Clara
              got aggravated, then she called up your mother, and now I have to listen to it.
              Next time, just pick up the rye bread and bagels and come home. It’s simple.”
              He’d always explain to me that my actions had consequences. And, most
              important, he taught me that we have the right to ask questions about anything
              and everything. But with that right comes a responsibility: If we’re going to
              question the actions of others, we also have to be willing to question our own.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>The Kalamas of the <em>Kalama
              Sutta</em> were, like my father, a skeptical but responsible bunch. They were
              quite alive to spiritual matters, but they were overrun with teachers and
              teachings, each teacher competing for an audience, each propounding a different
              philosophy or path. Their situation was not very different from ours now. We’re
              inundated with possibilities: “You’re interested in religion? Well, what kind?
              Buddhism? What flavor would you like? Tibetan? Okay, we have about ten flavors
              there. Theravada? Oh, you’ve tried that? A little too dry for you? Too much
              talk about suffering and impermanence? Perhaps you’d prefer Dzogchen, the
              innate perfection of the mind. That sounds much better, doesn’t it? And they
              have more colorful outfits. Most Vipassana teachers aren’t Asian and aren’t
              even monks; they just wear sweatpants. At least the Tibetan teachers look like
              teachers, you know? And then you get to Zen: beautiful—those great stories that
              teach you and make you laugh. Theravada teachings go on and on, but Zen is just
              hilarious one-liners.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>So we have this great
              swirling spiritual marketplace, with lots of claims being made. It’s no wonder
              that many of us find it confusing. Well, like us, the Kalamas were confused.
              They went to the Buddha to hear his perspective:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>So the Kalamas of
              Kesaputta approached the Buddha. On arrival, some of them bowed down to him and
              sat to one side. Some of them exchanged courteous greetings with him and sat to
              one side. Some, raising their joined palms, sat down to one side. Some,
              announcing their name and clan, sat to one side. Some of them sat to one side
              in silence. As they were sitting there, they said to the Buddha: “Lord, some
              teachers come to Kesaputta, expounding and glorifying their own doctrines. But
              as for the doctrines of others, they abuse them, disparage them, deprecate
              them, and pull them to pieces. Other teachers, on coming to Kesaputta, do the
              same thing. When we listen to them, we feel doubt and uncertainty as to which
              of these teachers are speaking truth and which are lying.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>The Kalamas were
              overwhelmed by all these claims to exclusive truth. And when the Buddha
              arrived, despite his reputation as a great sage, they were concerned that he
              might be just one more teacher with a competing point of view. Actually, I
              think their skepticism is very admirable, and rather unusual. The history of
              the world reveals that people are drawn to those who provide a strong,
              uncompromising teaching. We’re drawn to those who say, “This is it, and
              everyone else is wrong.” Certainly we see this pattern in contemporary
              politics, but we also see abuse of this sort within spiritual circles. It makes
              you wonder: Do we really want freedom? Can we handle the responsibility? Or
              would we just prefer to have an impressive teacher, someone who can give us the
              answers and do the hard work for us?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Of course,
              foolishness exists within Buddhist circles as well. After all the problems that
              have come up in dharma centers in the past twenty years, I still see Westerners
              who check their intelligence at the door, who grovel at the feet of a teacher,
              saying, “Just tell me how to live.” Well, I’ve been taken a few times myself. I
              don’t know if you have. But I deserved it. I just wanted to have my special
              teacher, someone with special access to the truth. It felt fantastic to be their
              student. My spiritual life was taken care of. I didn’t have to worry anymore. I
              was absolved of the responsibility that comes with exercising the right to ask
              questions. But, of course, I wasn’t free.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>After hearing the
              concerns of the Kalamas, the Buddha replied:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Come, Kalamas. Don’t
              go by reports, by legends, by traditions, by scripture, by logical conjecture,
              by inference, by analogies, by consistency with your own views, by probability,
              or by the thought, 'This contemplative is our teacher.' When you know for
              yourselves that 'these mental qualities are unskillful; these mental qualities
              are blameworthy; these mental qualities are criticized by the wise; these
              mental qualities when acted on lead to harm and suffering’ then abandon them.
              When you know for yourselves that 'these mental qualities are skillful; these
              mental qualities are blameless; these mental qualities are praised by the wise;
              these mental qualities when acted on lead to well-being and happiness’ then
              keep following them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>There’s a teaching
              story from China: People came from far and wide to hear the dharma talks of a
              young teacher. Apparently he had some depth. And one day, an old master came to
              hear him. He sat in the back of the meditation hall while the young teacher was
              giving a dharma talk. But the young teacher saw him, and out of respect,
              knowing that he was a renowned teacher and also much older, said, “Please, come
              up here, sit next to me while I give my talk.” So the old master rose and sat
              next to him. The young teacher resumed his talk, and every other word was a
              quotation from a different sutra or Zen master. The old master started to nod
              off in front of everyone. And the young teacher could see this out of the
              corner of his eye, but he just continued. The more authorities he cited, the
              sleepier the old master became. Finally, the young teacher couldn’t stand it
              anymore, so he asked, “What’s wrong? Is my teaching so boring, so awful, so
              totally off?” At that point, the old master leaned over and gave him a very
              hard pinch and the young teacher screamed, “Ouch!” The old master said, “Ah!
              That’s what I’ve come all this way for. This pure teaching. This 'ouch'
              teaching.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Like the old master
              in this story, the Buddha, in his response to the Kalamas, is trying to
              emphasize the importance of direct experience. He acknowledges that people rely
              upon many different modes of authority, sometimes internal, sometimes external.
              Some of them are reliable and others are way off the mark. The question is, how
              do we tell which is which? How do we balance internal authority with external
              authority? As the Buddha says, just because something is ancient doesn’t mean
              it’s true. Just because it’s new doesn’t mean it’s true. Just because it’s in
              the scriptures doesn’t mean it’s true. Just because it seems reasonable, or you
              like the person teaching it, doesn’t mean it’s right.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>What’s left, then?
              Where do we turn for authority in terms of knowing how to act? In the <em>Kalama
              Sutta</em>, the Buddha is not saying that ancient teachings are irrelevant, or
              that you have to reinvent the dharma wheel every time you think. He’s not
              saying not to accept the guidance of teachers or not to read the scriptures.
              After all, how else are you going to find out what’s criticized and praised by
              the wise? No, what he’s saying is: Don’t give final authority to these things.
              Don’t give final authority to your own ideas. You have to test the teachings,
              and your ideas, in the laboratory of your actions.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>When you put
              something to the test, really to the test, don’t you find that it challenges,
              that it stretches you, too? This has certainly been my experience. Some of
              these wonderful teachings are inspiring. It can be intellectually satisfying
              and emotionally nourishing just to hear them. But you can’t stop there. If you
              want to gain any real benefit from them, you have to let them stretch your own
              lived experience. For the dharma to become firsthand knowledge—to feel the
              “ouch” of it—you have to live intimately with it, hold it up to scrutiny, and
              let it hold you up to scrutiny. In the end, the ball is always thrown back to
              you: “Be a lamp unto yourself,” says the Buddha. In other words, you must
              ultimately find the way on your own, by putting your ideas of the truth to the
              test. Your questions light the way.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>So what is the test
              of truth? The Buddha offers a simple formula: Test things in terms of cause and
              effect. Whatever is unskillful, leading to harm and ill, should be abandoned;
              whatever is skillful, leading to happiness and peace, should be pursued. Apply
              the test of skillfulness to all teachings in all your actions. Where is this
              teaching taking you? Is it moving you in a direction that is wise and kind? One
              quick test isn’t enough, you know.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 12.0pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>You have to keep at
              it, so that your sensitivity to the results of your actions grows more and more
              refined with practice. When you’ve done the hard work of asking these
              questions, then you can decide for yourself whether a teaching, or a teacher,
              is worth following. And at the same time, you’ve also taught yourself how to
              live—a learning that can bring with it joy and the energy to go even deeper.</span></p>
