              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Buddhist
              statues and Orthodox icons aren't always symmetrical. Neither are we. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I’m
              sitting in front of my computer drinking from a knobbly, lopsided Japanese tea
              bowl, with two new books on either side of my keyboard. At my left hand is
              William Empson’s The Face of the Buddha, edited by Buddhist scholar-monk Rupert
              Arrowsmith from a long-lost manuscript. At my right hand is The Art of Seeing:
              Paradox and Perception in Orthodox Iconography, by the Orthodox monk-scholar
              Fr. Maximos Constas. The books are mirror opposites; I wish the authors could
              meet.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Many
              consider William Empson the best critic of his generation. His first book,
              Seven Types of Ambiguity, which he began at the tender age of 22, plumbed the
              English poetic canon for tantalizing examples of verbal ambiguity—cases in
              which a word or expression yields alternative meanings, to the puzzlement of
              the attentive critic and the delight of the deep reader. Empson was a figure of
              ambiguity himself, a profound exegete of Christian literature and a passionate
              anti-Christian. He loved to unearth evidence that his favorite English authors
              were conflicted about their faith, that the ambiguities in Paradise Lost were
              symptomatic of Milton’s struggle to make a tyrannical God seem worthy of
              worship, that the double meaning of a word as innocuous as buckle revealed
              Gerard Manley Hopkins’s mixed feelings about his Jesuit calling, that George
              Herbert’s poem “The Sacrifice” exposed a two-faced God: vindictive judge and
              loving redeemer.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">What
              had promised to be a spectacular academic career ran aground early on when a
              servant found contraceptives in Empson’s college rooms and the young prodigy
              was expelled in disgrace. But the exile proved fruitful; after a stint among
              the Bloomsbury literati, Empson found teaching jobs in Japan and China. Here,
              amid the gracious statues of Buddhas and bodhisattvas, he discovered a type of
              ambiguity that was free from neuralgic Christian associations. Studying the
              Kudara Kannon in Nara’s HÅ�ryÅ«-ji Temple, he marveled at the “puzzlement and
              good humour” on the left side of the face and the “birdlike innocence and
              wakefulness” on the right. He became fascinated to the point of obsession,
              crisscrossing the Asian continent in search of statues that shared the same
              secret: “the faces all seem to be asymmetrical in the same way, as if the
              artists were working on a theory.” To test the theory, Empson would photograph
              a Buddha’s face, split the photograph down the middle, reverse one side, and
              create two mirrored composites. The asymmetries were unmistakable. One face
              appeared sardonic on the right side, mystical on the left; another cunning on
              the right side, placid on the left; yet another “masculine and foxy” on the
              right side, plaintive on the left. Overall, the asymmetries created an
              impression of ironic wisdom coupled with compassion, and marked by a certain
              “coolness” toward the supernatural. “I think Buddhism much better than
              Chris­tianity,” Empson wrote, “because it managed to get away from the
              Neolithic craving to gloat over human sacrifice.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Fr.
              Maximos Constas has an eye for ambiguity as well. For Constas, the art of the
              icon requires a certain strangeness, a disruption of the symmetries that
              naturally please the eye, in order to transport the viewer from the image to
              its divine original. Nowhere is this strangeness more apparent than in the
              majestic sixth-century Christ Pantocrator of Sinai, an icon whose asymmetry has
              been the subject of endless commentary. Using the same split photograph
              technique, Constas discovered “a timid, slightly sad-looking young man . . .
              yearning for contact and love” on one side and “a ponderous Titan, aloof to all
              relations” on the other. Some interpreters think that this duality is a lesson
              in Chalcedonian Christology, but Constas suggests that the real subject is “the
              paradoxical co-existence of mercy and judgment.” The effect is intentionally
              disturbing: “Beholding the face of Christ, the viewer . . . judges his own
              likeness poor and disfigured.” Yet the ultimate message is a hopeful one, for
              the tender side of Christ’s face, commanding the viewer’s left visual field
              (which is favored, Constas notes, by our asymmetrical brain), is what unites
              the composition. It seems that the iconographer instinctively understood how to
              portray the polarity of divine mercy and judgment in such a way that mercy
              would be undimmed.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Empson
              never wholly converted to Buddhism; he returned to England at intervals, taught
              at various universities in the United States and the U.K., and wrapped up a
              brilliant, unruly, bohemian life with a knighthood and an honorary fellowship
              from the college that expelled him. Constas (now the Very Rev. Archi­mandrite
              Maximos Constas) is at once an American academic and an Athonite monk. The two
              authors, one a promiscuous literary adventurer, the other a scholarly ascetic,
              have made a wonderful discovery. But where Constas sees a saving paradox,
              Empson sees a damnable contradiction. Where Empson sees a vindictive God,
              Constas sees a loving God in whom “Mercy and Truth have met together . . .
              Righteousness and Bliss have kissed.” It’s a mystery—here are two intelligent
              bipeds, symmetrical on the outside and asymmetrical, as we all are, on the
              inside, who have so much to teach us about the aesthetics of ambiguity; and yet
              they fall on opposite sides of the great divide.</span></p>
