              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style='font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; color: #111111; font-size: 12pt;'> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: #111111; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">In this sutta, the Buddha refutes the theories of the Jains — here called the Niganthas — an order of contemplatives flourishing in India during his time. Although on the surface this sutta may seem to be of strictly historical interest, it makes two important points that are very relevant to some common misunderstandings about Buddhism alive today.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: #111111; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: #111111; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The first point concerns the Buddhist teaching on action, or kamma (karma). The general understanding of this teaching is that actions from the past determine present pleasure and pain, while present actions determine future pleasure and pain. Or, to quote a recent book devoted to the topic, "Karma is the moral principle that governs human conduct. It declares that our present experience is conditioned by our past conduct and that our present conduct will condition our future experience." This, however, does not accurately describe the Buddha's teaching on karma, and is instead a fairly accurate account of the Nigantha teaching, which the Buddha explicitly refutes here. As he interrogates the Niganthas, he makes the point that if all pleasure and pain experienced in the present were determined by past action, why is it that they now feel the pain of harsh treatment when they practice asceticism, and no pain of harsh treatment when they don't? If past action were the sole determining factor, then present action should have no effect on their present experience of pleasure or pain.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: #111111; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="color: #111111; font-size: 12pt;">In this way, the Buddha points to one of the most distinctive features of his own teaching on kamma: that the present experience of pleasure and pain is a combined result of both past and present actions. This seemingly small addition to the notion of kamma plays an enormous role in allowing for the exercise of free will and the possibility of putting an end to suffering before the effects of all past actions have ripened. In other words, this addition is what makes Buddhist practice possible, and makes it possible for a person who has completed the practice to survive and teach it with full authority to others.

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: #111111; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: #111111; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The second important point touched on in this sutta — how to put an end to pain and suffering — relates to the first. If the cause of present suffering were located exclusively in the past, no one could do anything in the present moment to stop that suffering; the most that could be done would be to endure the suffering while not creating any new kamma leading to future suffering. Although this was the Jain approach to practice, many people at present believe that it is the Buddhist approach as well. Meditation, according to this understanding, is the process of purifying the mind of old kamma by training it to look on with non-reactive equanimity as pain arises. The pain is the result of old kamma, the equanimity adds no new kamma, and thus over time all old kamma can be burned away.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: #111111; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: #111111; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">In this sutta, however, the Buddha heaps ridicule on this idea. First he notes that none of the Niganthas have ever come to the end of pain by trying to burn it away in this way; then he notes that they have based their belief in this practice entirely on their faith in their teacher and their approval of his ideas, but neither faith nor approval can act as guarantees of the truth. As he illustrates with his simile of the man shot with an arrow, only a person who has succeeded in going beyond pain would be in a position to speak with authority of the method that actually puts an end to pain. (What is not mentioned in this sutta is the Nigantha idea that the practice of austerities, to succeed completely in burning away old kamma, must culminate in a suicide by starvation. Thus there could be no living person who would be able to vouch for the efficacy of their method.)</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: #111111; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: #111111; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The Buddha then provides his own account of how meditation actually works in putting an end to pain and suffering. His discussion shows that the problem underlying pain is not past action, but passion — in the present — for the causes of pain. In other words, pain is not inevitable. Present suffering can be prevented by changing one's understanding of, and attitude toward, the cause of suffering in the present. The Buddha illustrates this principle with the simile of a man in love with a woman: As long as he feels passion for her, he will suffer when he sees her enjoying the company of another man; when, seeing the connection between his suffering and his passion, he abandons that passion, he will no longer suffer from that cause.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: #111111; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="color: #111111; font-size: 12pt;">Thus the practice must focus on ways to understand and bring about dispassion for the causes of stress and pain here and now. As the Buddha points out in </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.106.than.html"><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MN 106</span></span></a><span style="color: #111111;">, equanimity plays an important role in this practice, but it can also become an object for passion and delight, which would then stand in the way of true release. Thus he notes here that, in some cases, dispassion can arise simply from on-looking equanimity directed at the causes of stress. In other cases, it can come only through exertion: the mental effort — through the fabrications of directed thought, evaluation, and perception — to develop the discernment needed to see through and abandon any and all passion.</span></span></span></p>

              kamma: that the present experience of pleasure and pain is a
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;">combined</span> result of both past and present actions. This seemingly
              small addition to the notion of kamma plays an enormous role in
              allowing for the exercise of free will and the possibility of
              putting an end to suffering before the effects of all past actions
              have ripened. </span></span></p>

At the same time, they are conducting compassion and benevolence for treating the patients with care and love in the way of Mahayana Buddhism. And they can provide valuable advice on health care based on their wisdom so that patients would live blissly and healthily. May all be safe and happy.</p></div>

              <p><strong>Public Statement of YBAMï¼šMisleading Teachings Deviate From The Right Path of Buddhism</strong></p>
              <p>The Young Buddhist Association of Malaysia (YBAM) recently received a
               correspondence from the Buddhist Society of a branch campus of a 
              university in Kelantan, stating that members and other undergraduates 
              are influenced by a Theravada monk, leading to transferrence of course 
              of study, and strained relationship with the family members.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The monk started to approach the undergraduates of the said 
              university since March this year.  Activities were carried out without 
              the acknowledgement of the Buddhist Society of the university.  The monk
               even brought dozens of students to pay a visit to the temples in 
              Thailand for few weeks.  When the semester started in September, these 
              students, of about 30 of them, contacted the faculty and their family 
              about their intention of transferrence from Medical Discipline to other 
              disciplines such as Nutrition or Sport Science.  Some students could not
               concentrate in their study, and absent from the lectures to participate
               in the activities organised by the mentioned monk.  Some students even 
              have the intention to withdraw from the university. The university 
              started to show concern on this incident following the request of 
              transferrence of course from these students.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Most of the affected students are the future doctors, with some of 
              them are graduating in next one or two years, and some of them are even 
              the JPA scholarship holders.  However, these students disregard the 
              worries of the family members, as well as the implications of the RM 
              250,000 compensation that the family is going to make following their 
              irresponsible act, had a falling out with the family, and even 
              threatened to run away from home or to terminate the family 
              relationship.</p>
              <p>This monk taught the students that the patients should not receive 
              medication for their condition, as these sicknesses are the results of 
              their Karma.  If one receives treatment for the sickness, this will not 
              eliminate the Karma, and he/she will continue to suffer in the future.  
              This monk keep stressing about the supernatural power, and telling 
              students that he has the power to know the past, and to predict the 
              future.  He also used the so-called subconciousness method to let 
              students to see their pasts.  These teachings led to the Medical 
              students not willing to, and also dare not to face the patients and 
              corspes.  Some of them even felt the uneasiness and the horror after 
              contacting or facing the patients and corspes.  In addition, this monk 
              also misled the students in the views of the relationship that led to 
              the end of the relationship of a few couples.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>YBAM also received some complaints that this monk used the same 
              tactic to approach the Buddhist and youths in the Alor Setar, Kedah.  He
               also has a centre for students’ gathering in the Klang Valley</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the Buddha’s teaching, we see how the Buddha, as the leader, also 
              concerned his disciples who are sick, and provided necessary 
              medications. The Buddha taught how to integrate ourselves into the 
              society and to benefit the society with our contributions.  The Buddha 
              did not teach us on the unconventional and bizzre ideas, which leads to 
              the worries of our family and friends, or even broken relationships with
               them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>YBAM hence urge the Buddhist society in the varsities and the local 
              Buddhist societies to pay extra care when dealing with the interactions 
              between the venerables and the disciples, as to avoid the negative 
              implications that might be caused to the students and disciples 
              following such relationship.  Together with other Buddhist 
              organisations, YBAM is also trying with various approaches including the
               Immigrations, university and family members, not to worsen the 
              development of the incident, and to prevent this monk to bring the 
              students to Thailand in this October again.</p>
