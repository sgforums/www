              <p>You may ask your girlfriend to get monk to help her close her 3rd eye if she wishes to. There is this popular book " The Boy Who Talk To Ghost" (True Story). This is about a local teenager boy who comes from a christian family but able to see spirits. He is also able to see and talk to his younger sister who passed away at young age. Though they are christians, his mother brought him to monk to close his 3rd eye.</p>

              <p>Lost souls (or ghosts) are everywhere, and they are attracted by living people's energy, especially those very positive or very negative ones. Because they are lost in our realm, and not back in the realm where they should go to, they will 'feed' on our energy if we do not know how to handle them. (They seriously don't eat oranges, steamed white chicken or 'huat kueh', or any of those food people offer them. hehe).</p>
              <p>Those who have very positive energy are usually more spiritually advanced, so can either help them, or prevent them from feeding on their energy. As for people with very negative energy, it's advisable to stay away from such ghosts (lost souls), as they won't be able to fend them off, and often end up having a 'parasite spirit' hanging around them, causing 'damage'.</p>
              <p>They like to gather near religious places of worship, as they are attracted by the large gathering of people. As for campfires, I can only think it's because there are hardly any other people around, so the campsite is the only place with living people around for them to get near to.</p>
              <p>Even for people with the ability to see ghosts, it's easier to see them under certain conditions (eg. angle of sight, lighting, etc). Though they are around at all times of the day or night, it's easier at evening or night time, as there's less light interference. They often appear as almost transparent silhouettes. Though their faces can't be seen clearly, you'll know roughly how old their human forms are, eg. old man or young lady in '20s. And they are usually visible to the human eye for a few seconds only. And yes, their movement really seems like floating.</p>

              <p>When we are free of our physical bodies, there are many things that we can do, that is not possible in our bodies, as there's no more physical limitations.

              <p>We don't need to fear ghosts, though some people need to take precautions. It's not advisable to allow ghosts to stay in anyone's house or office etc. It's also noble to help them move on to the spiritual realm, where they can find peace again.</p>

              <p>Actually even if you are alive, you need not be bounded by the physical body. You can see non locally (aka remote vision), hear non locally, you can read others thoughts, and so on. If: you attain mastery of samatha absorptions, or you are enlightened to a high degree that you have 'insight absorption'. I know of such persons.</p>
              <p>None of these implies a 'soul'. Even after death, there will be a period up to 49 days where we take on a transient invisible body called the antarabhava during the bardo stage, but even that is not a fixed unchanging entity called 'soul'. It is just that consciousness manifests in that way under certain conditions. It is the transition period between one birth to the next.</p>

              <p>Actually even if you are alive, you need not be bounded by the physical body. You can see non locally (aka remote vision), hear non locally, you can read others thoughts, and so on. If: you attain mastery of samatha absorptions, or you are enlightened to a high degree that you have 'insight absorption'. I know of such persons.</p>
              <p>None of these simplies a 'soul'. Even after death, there will be a period up to 49 days where we take on a transient invisible body called the anatarabhava during the bardo stage, but even that is not a fixed unchanging entity called 'soul'. It is just that consciousness manifests in that way under certain conditions. It is the transition period between one birth to the next.</p>

              <p>The things that you mention are what I term as psychic abilities to me. :) And yes, we can all do such things, even right now, if we know how, and believing that we can all do it. It's believing in the power of our mind and heart. Of course, there are some pre-requisites before someone can have such abilities and to what extent, regardless of religion or faith.</p>

              <p>I will tell you guys openly since it is stated in the above. The ghost she saw was the no. 4 ghost (blood feeding ghost) you mentioned above. The ghost was feeding on the disposed pads in the toilet.</p>
              <p>In Di Zhang Jing, it mentions that during woman's child birth, there are many ghosts ready to feed on the blood. At first, I found this part very disgusting and doubted it but now I believe that it is true.</p>
              <p>Thanks for sharing. I did not know there are so many types of ghosts. They are really pitiful. Let's dedicate our merits to them ä¸‹æµŽä¸‰é€”è‹¦ã€‚</p>
              <p>Buddhism is the only religion which emphasie on no attachment. Luckily I know about it. Many were born in ghost realm without know why.</p>

              <p>hey Eternal Now ...great sharing on the various categories of ghost, I totally agree with you that the categories do not limit to 36 but more. It is the Sentient Being's Karma that led them to be who they are and where they are. </p>
              <p>In fact, Earth Store Bodhisattva Sutra mentioned that HELL was create by sentient being own karma. It was not created by God or Buddha.</p>
              <p>I believe in the forums, there are those who believe in spirit world and those who do not and view it as something of superstitious.</p>
              <p>I remember once during one of my malacca trip, my family and I stay in a last minute walk in hotel. As it was holiday and long weekend, a lot of hotel was fully booked for the nite. We were left with no choice, but to accept the any available room. </p>
              <p>In the middle of the nite when I was sleeping. I felt something pressing against me which prevent me from moving. It happened a couple of time which will go off. When I forced myself to chant, "Namu Myo Ho Renge Kyo" loud after which my wife will wake me up. During the third time, I could hear some one crushing a plastic bag walking pass my bed. Mind you all this while my wife was sleeping beside me on the same bed however, she felt and hear nothing. Subsequently, I wake up and do a proper chanting with dedication of merits and after which I slept like a baby.</p>
              <p>Through the incident, I realise that the spirit world which Buddhist view as part of 6 path of existence is real. We may not see it but it exists before us. It is because of different dimensions of existence that make us different.</p>
              <p>Well, I think Dr KKTan, a well known Meditation teacher,  did some good writing on this spirit matter. (see <a href="http://www.kktanhp.com/">http://www.kktanhp.com/</a>) No worries neither am I his followers nor him<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png">, just find some his article is very well written for reference.</p>

              <p>Thanks for the informtion she is not scared to most form as she is use to it. But sme ghst as she describe like headless etc. She will try not the enter that area again. She said that ghost has a range where they will always appear. Why cant the ghost move around like from east to west?</p>
              <p>Secondly, she said she can see fresh blood even after the blood is wipe away. Sort of transperency thingy. Does fresh blood wipe away have some unique power?</p>

              <p>Im curious if a ghost or a being in hell remembers and recites Buddha's(Amituofo) name will he be able to see the buddha's light instantly and be freed. I am asking as per in the spiritual realm because in the human world when recite buddha's name obviously normal pple cant see anything so im not asking about that.</p>
              <p>apparently humans, animals cannot be freed and go to pureland immediately when reciting as we need to wait for our this life(and this body comprising 4 elements) to end. however, in the spiritual realm, like for ghosts, hell-beings, theres no need to wait, right?</p>
              <p>Any stories, anecdotes of this sort?</p>
              <p>(btw, im not asking about those who have the meditative spiritual attainment being able to leave their human body at will and go to pureland at a time they wish. i am talking about normal beings in general)</p>
              <p>i am also not asking about the buddha's light in a figurative sense, as i've come across enough attempted explanations of those. im asking about literal sense in the spiritual realm.</p>
              <p>im just thinking if the ghosts actually know they can be liberated by reciting the buddha's name why would they allow themselve to be stuck at a place without freedom to move about.  </p>

              <p>I know this one!!! When i was younger in primary school, theres a very old secondary school opposite my school. Its up in the hill and there are churches and grave sites there ( near bukit timah). It happen twice!!!</p>
              <p>1st is a old lady cleaner, she was washing the toilet during after school time at around 5pm something... then when she was washing one of the girls toilet, she saw a women in a cubicle, she was squating on the toilet bowl and was sucking on a pad. The old lady run off as fast as she can and went into a church nearby to hide. she quit her job next day.</p>
              <p>2nd, is a sercurity guard. He was checking the school compound, then as he pass by the girls toilet, he heard someone was fumbling with equipment inside, so he went in to check it out as it was quite late for a student to stay in the school. He then saw a creature female alike squatting on the toilet bowl eating a pad. It smiled at him, he was so freaked out and he ran off as fast as he could, but he was very suey coz this time the creature chase after him, it hovers!!! then he manage to scramble into the security hut at the front gate. He lock the door and windows and start to recite Quran verses. The creature was hovering outside the hut and was banging against the roof. He then got out when a teacher drove car into the school much later. He quits his job next day.</p>
              <p>This is true, because the principal of the school back then hired a holy man each from sg's  4 main religion to bless the school. Then all the religious man told the principal their school need to be blessed regularly. Because alot of strange things keep happening in the school.</p>
              <p>Right now the school had been renovated. But don't know whether all this strange things still happen.</p>
