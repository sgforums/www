              <p>1st is a old lady cleaner, she was washing the toilet during after school time at around 5pm something... then when she was washing one of the girls toilet, she saw a women in a cubicle, she was squating on the toilet bowl and was sucking on a pad.

              <p>2nd, is a sercurity guard. He was checking the school compound, then as he pass by the girls toilet, he heard someone was fumbling with equipment inside, so he went in to check it out as it was quite late for a student to stay in the school.

It smiled at him, he was so freaked out and he ran off as fast as he could, but he was very suey coz this time the creature chase after him, it hovers!!! then he manage to scramble into the security hut at the front gate.

              <p>I must have missed your post. Just get to read now. It is so horrible and is beyond my imagination but it is true.</p>
              <p>My friend's boss is a Christian but he hired a holy man to bless and chase the spirits away from his company as many of his employees see ghosts and wanting to quit. Though Christians don't believe in ghosts but at times they have no choice because it is true that ghosts exist.</p>

              <p><br>Fear is the one emotion that strengthens most negative entities, and weakens us. Should anyone come across a negative entity which he/she cannot avoid, most effective thing is to do is to stay as calm as possible, no matter how difficult it is. If you've a religion, you can chant/pray whatever you feel most appropriate, to stay composed. If you don't have a religion, just stay calm, and ask the negative entity to leave you alone in a firm manner.</p>
              <p>You can just say that in your mind to the negative entity, as voices are not needed to communicate with non-physical beings, like humans. But if you prefer, you can always shout out loud to it, if it gives you greater courage at the point of time. :)</p>
