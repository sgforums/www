              <p>Consciousness is that entire process of re-becoming, it is not a fixed entity or experiencer or soul. So you should not be asking 'what is the entity?' -- There is no entity. You should be asking: 'what is the conditions for the re-becoming of consciousness?'</p>

              <div>Q. So there is no self (Atman). so what exactly is it that is
                                              reborn, and how does what is reborn pass from one body to
                                              another?<br>   Thanks in advance for any answers received.  <img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="http://www.lioncity.net/buddhism/style_emoticons/Default2/bow.gif" alt="bow.gif"><br></div>
              <p>-----------------------------</p>
              <p>The question is wrongly put and the Buddha's reponse when asked
                                              such a question was to reject it as an improper question. Having
                                              rejected the question he would then inform the questioner of what
                                              he ought to have asked: "With what as condition is there
                                              birth?"<br> <br> The reason that it is an improper question is that rebirth is
                                              taught as the continuation of a process, and not as the passing on
                                              of any sort of entity. For a more complete exposition of the
                                              subject see Mahasi Sayadaw's <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.buddhistinformation.com/a_discourse_on_paticcasamuppada_.htm">Discourse on Paticcasamuppada</a>.<br> <br> Best wishes,<br> Dhammanando Bhikkhu</p>

              <p>We have to understand, what is 'self'. In Buddhism it is taught there is no self other than the 5 skhandas (form, feelings, perceptions, volition, consciousness).</p>
              <p>To put it more simply: there is no self other than thoughts arising and ceasing, sounds arising and ceasing, sight arising and ceasing.</p>
              <p>There is no permanent entity behind who is doing the experiencing, who is watching, controlling, thinking.</p>
              <p>Instead, there is just thoughts arising and ceasing, deeds being done, sights and sounds arising, all according to conditions. There is no separate hearer, doer, thinker, etc.</p>

              <p>Alaya is not universal, alaya is an individual stream of consciousness containing all our karmic seeds. Your alaya and my alaya is not the same, my karma and your karma are not the same. Relatively speaking each stream of consciousness is individual and different from every other stream of consciousness. Buddhism does not postulate a universal soul or consciousness -- that would be Hinduism and other religions.</p>
              <p>However, there is at the same time No-Self.</p>
              <p>For example, what I am seeing and what you are seeing is different. What I am hearing and what you are hearing is different. What I am thinking and what you are thinking is different. That is relatively speaking, 'I' and 'you' are different.</p>
              <p>At the same time, there is no separate thinker apart from thought. There is no seer apart from scenery. There is no hearer apart from sound. Everything manifests differently at every single moment, and in every single mindstream, due to differing conditions. But they are just conditioned manifestation -- they are not happening to 'someone'. They are simply spontaneously manifesting, IMPERSONALLY, due to conditions.</p>
              <p>There is no 'you' thinking, there is just thoughts arising. There is no 'you' hearing, there is just sound. Sound and hearing are one. There is nothing that can be attributed to 'I', and nothing can be attributed to 'mine'. The word 'self' is just a conventional term or imputation -- it has no substance, no reality, no findable essence.</p>
              <p>No self can be found within nor apart from the 5 skhandas. 5 Skhandas or 18 Dhatus are all there is.</p>
              <p>Buddha-Nature (not Alaya) is sometimes described as sun-like, it is all pervading, but again don't think of it as having an inherent essence -- it is also empty, xing kong. So it is not a universal essence. But it manifests in all <em>appearances</em> -- that is miao you.</p>

              <p>No. Though it is true that in an Arhant without vows to continue the Bodhisattva path he will experience cessation of the mind continuum for a prolonged period of time (in Mahayana we consider that Arhats will eventually return to continue his path to Buddhahood), Enlightenment and Nirvana should not be understood as simply about the relative cessation of the mind continuum.</p>
              <p>You should not understand 'void' or 'emptiness' as being 'absence' or 'nihilism' -- rather what it means is there is no findable, graspable, inherent, permanent entity called 'self'. Just in the same way the word 'weather' is simply a conventional designation for the patterns of clouds, lightning, thunderstorm, wind, etc etc, a fully interdependently originated phenomena in which these factors and combinations are constantly changing every moment, and thus there is no locatable or fixed entity nor thing called 'weather' -- similarly 'self' has no findable essence anywhere within nor apart from the everchanging and interdependently originated five aggregations of form, feelings, perceptions, volition, and consciousness.</p>
              <p>Another analogy is that the word 'car' is simply a conventional designation of the combination of windows, wipers, engines, and many other car 'parts'... there is in fact no inherent 'car-ness' to be found anywhere. You can remove the parts one by one, and you cannot find a 'car essence' in any of the parts. Nor can you find any existence of 'car' beyond or outside those parts. The parts are simply parts, the window is simply window, the engine is simply engine. There is no car-ness to be found. And if we investigate further, even the 'parts' are empty. What we call 'car' is simply a convention/designation for a group of parts connected in an arrangement to produce a particular function -- there is no independent or inherent existence to be located anywhere, it is one whole dependently originated phenomena, it has no independent, inherent substance or existence.</p>
              <p>This can be applied to 'self' and the 'five skandhas' as well.</p>

              <p>Finally with regards to Nirvana, actually Nirvana is not apart from this world. Arhats experience Nirvana even within the world, that is called 'Nirvana with residue'. The world is experienced as it is, but no longer with the delusion or ignorance of being a separate self. He realises the non-dual ultimate reality.<span id="intelliTXT"><br> <br> As Academic and Zen teacher Dr. David Loy says:<br> <br> "Nothing of saá¹�sÄ�ra is different from nirvÄ�á¹‡a, nothing of nirvÄ�á¹‡a is
                              different from saá¹�sÄ�ra. That which is the limit of nirvÄ�á¹‡a is also the
                              limit of saá¹�sÄ�ra; there is not the slightest difference between the
                              two." [1] And yet there must be some difference between them, for
                              otherwise no distinction would have been made and there would be no
                              need for two words to describe the same state. So NÄ�gÄ�rjuna also
                              distinguishes them: "That which, taken as causal or dependent, is the
                              process of being born and passing on, is, taken noncausally and beyond
                              all dependence, declared to be nirvÄ�á¹‡a." [2] There is only one reality
                              -- this world, right here -- but this world may be experienced in two
                              different ways. Saá¹�sÄ�ra is the "relative" world as usually experienced,
                              in which "I" dualistically perceive "it" as a collection of objects
                              which interact causally in space and time. NirvÄ�á¹‡a is the world as it
                              is in itself, nondualistic in that it incorporates both subject and
                              object into a whole which, MÄ�dhyamika insists, cannot be characterized
                              (ChandrakÄ«rti: "NirvÄ�á¹‡a or Reality is that which is absolved of all
                              thought-construction"), but which YogÄ�cÄ�ra nevertheless sometimes calls
                              "Mind" or "Buddhanature," and so forth"</span></p>

              <p>:-) Thanks ... it does sound confusing ... but if I get what you are trying to say here is</p>
              <p>1) There is no self, soul or any form of entity (car-less) to start with. Only the 5 skhandas (in this case the windows, wipers, engines, and
              many other car 'parts'...).</p>
              <p>2) Thus The self, soul or any form of entity exists because the 5 skhandas come together to enable the illusion self, soul, or entity to become what we are today...</p>

              <p>Yes and not only is it in a state of impermanence, there is no separate distinct entity apart from the phenomena. For example when seeing a bird, there is no seer behind seeing, the seeing IS the scene/sight. When hearing music, there is no hearer, there is simply music. Everything is self-aware where it is without a separate experiencer or self.

              <p>About enlightenment, it's not exactly a state -- it's a realisation of what has always been the case, thus ending all ignorance and suffering that arises out of delusion.

              <p>Thanks. Back to your post on the following "Though it is true that in an Arhant without vows to continue
                                      the Bodhisattva path he will experience cessation of the mind
                                      continuum for a prolonged period of time (in Mahayana we consider
                                      that Arhats will eventually return to continue his path to
                                      Buddhahood)..."</p>
              <p>So are we saying that the practice of the Arhat way is incorrect given that it differs from that of the Bodhisattva's path? Will it not eventually lead to the state of realization and entering into Nirvana? if so, and if time is just a matter of relative long or short, it does not matter which path is being follow?</p>
              <p>Thanks for making the effort to reply and helping understand the Buddhist thinking process.</p>

              <p>What I meant is this: Arhats, when they are alive, already experience Nirvana. Nirvana means Cessation. It is the end of clinging to the
                          aggregates, the ceasing of viewing the aggregates as self or pertaining
                          to a self. That ceasing is what is called the not-born and
                          not-conditioned, because once attachment vanished it cannot arise
                          again.</p>
              <p>However, while alive, the Arhats will still experience sensory awareness and be able to think and function as a normal human being like us (albeit without ignorance and mental suffering) and are also capable of ageing, sickness and physical pain, etc. That has to do with the normal bodily function of a human being.</p>
              <p>However, what happens after physical death for an Arhat is, the relative cessation of the mind continuum in Nirvana. This is because the causes for uncontrolled rebirth has been ended, and that liberated sage is no longer trapped in the cycle of samsaric rebirth. Being liberated he no longer needs to get reborn due to karma, and so there is no more conditions for his birth. For most Theravadins this is the end goal. For Mahayanist, we believe that the Arhats will eventually return to continue their journey to Buddhahood.</p>
              <p>For a Mahayanist, the Bodhisattva, even though he might be liberated from uncontrolled rebirth, due to their vows will still return again to save other sentient beings and continue his practice to Buddhahood.</p>

              <p><br>i realise this thread is related to what i've posted in the other "no-self" thread.</p>
              <p>the question which i've wanted to ask is about the "true mind" or "buddha nature". according to what i've read in surangama or whatever, the alaya consciousness is very close to the "true mind". and also, this "true mind" is treated as something permanent. maybe it is due to limited understanding and delusion, but isnt there something got to be permanent when we pass from life to life? like what i've said in the other thread, its like a same "you" experiencing it and no one can take that place.</p>
