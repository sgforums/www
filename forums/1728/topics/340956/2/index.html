              <p><br> i realise this thread is related to what i've posted in the other
                  "no-self" thread.</p>
              <p>the question which i've wanted to ask is about the "true mind"
                  or "buddha nature". according to what i've read in surangama or
                  whatever, the alaya consciousness is very close to the "true mind".
                  and also, this "true mind" is treated as something permanent. maybe
                  it is due to limited understanding and delusion, but isnt there
                  something got to be permanent when we pass from life to life? like
                  what i've said in the other thread, its like a same "you"
                  experiencing it and no one can take that place.</p>

              <p>No, true mind is not an entity and should not be mistaken as an entity that passes on to the next lifetime. True mind is simply the luminous and empty nature of mind, and all appearances are mind. It is permanent in the same way as 'emptiness' is the permanent nature of all phenomena, 'impermanence' is the 'permanent' nature of all phenomena. 'Impermanence' is not a thing: it's simply the nature of all phenomena. Similarly 'luminosity', 'emptiness' is not a thing, it is rather the nature of all phenomena. Luminosity means vivid awareness, emptiness is the ungraspability, unlocatability of anything.</p>
              <p>Hence we must not be mistaken that there is an entity called 'mind' which is permanent, taking rebirth.</p>
              <p>Rather there is only a continuation of a process, the process continues due to cause and effect, i.e. a previous karmic cause results in a NEW birth, which is nevertheless the continuation of the process since that birth is due to the ripening of a previously planted karmic seed.</p>
              <p>So there is no fixed entity called Self, as Thusness said before:</p>

              <p>thanks, but this is too difficult for me, even concept wise. and neither do i see the point for me to get confused trying to understand this. but i want to ask u is: entity aside, isnt 'true mind' permanent? it has always been in our possession? ok, i understand the limit of the language but u get the idea?</p>
              <p>that being able to have the realisation in bold under deep meditation is certainly noteworthy, whether theres anything wrong with it i dont dare to say, but that doesnt mean the person has totally comprehended his buddha nature, right?</p>

              <p>True mind is the permanent nature of everything.</p>
              <p>But before we talk about true mind, lets use a simpler concept like impermanence.</p>
              <p>Is all phenomena impermanent? Yes.</p>
              <p>Has any phenomena ever stopped being impermanent? No.</p>
              <p>Therefore: impermanence is the permanent nature of all phenomena, not in the sense there is a thing called 'impermanence' that is eternal, but rather, it is permanent in the sense that impermanence is simply the nature of reality and is 'always so'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Similarly, it is said luminosity and emptiness is the unchanging nature of mind.</p>
              <p>Have you ever stopped being aware? No. (only corpses are unaware)</p>
              <p>Isn't hearing, seeing, etc, always occuring? Yes.</p>
              <p>Hence: luminosity is an unchanging nature of mind.</p>
              <p>Has whatever you seen, felt, experienced, have any independent existence apart from causes and conditions, i.e., can the sound of the drum occur without the person hitting, the drumstick, the drum, the ears, etc etc? No.</p>
              <p>Has the nature of dependent origination/emptiness ever stopped being so? No. It's simply the nature of all that is.</p>
              <p>Hence: emptiness is the unchanging essence of mind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Emptiness (interdependent arising), Luminosity (awareness) is the unchanging nature of mind.</p>
              <p>Does that mean there is some entity called 'Mind'? No. Emptiness and luminosity is simply the nature of reality at all times in the same way 'impermanence' is the nature of all appearances.</p>
              <p>Seeing is not separate from scenery, hearing is not separate from sound. When hearing, there is just sound. When seeing, just forms, sceneries, etc.</p>
              <p>There is no separate seer involved.</p>
              <p>There is no 'impermanence' apart from apperances, and there is no 'emptiness and luminosity' apart form appearances.</p>

              <p>True Mind should not be understood as an unchanging self experiencing changes or experiencing rebirth. True Mind is simply whatever we experience -- scenery, sound, taste, everything is True Mind. There is no 'True Mind' moving from lifetime to lifetime and taking rebirth -- since that would be separating the experiencer from the experience, and no such separation can be found.</p>
              <p>True Mind must not be misunderstood as the Atman of Hinduism.</p>
              <blockquote style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">Buddhism Plain and Simple page 115, by Zen Teacher Steve Hagen:<br><br>With
                              the two types of views there are two kinds of minds. As human beings,
                              we all have what we could call ordinary minds - the mind that you've
                              always assumed you've had. It's a calculating mind, a discriminating
                              mind, a fragmented mind. It's the mind of ordinary consciousness, the
                              mind of self and other. We generally think of it as "my mind."<br><br>But
                              there's another mind that is unborn, ungrown, and unconditioned. Unlike
                              "your mind," it is unbound, for there is nothing beyond it. To this
                              Mind, there is no "other mind."<br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br>This Mind is nothing other
                              than the Whole. It's simply thus, the fabric of the world itself - the
                              ongoing arising and falling away that are matter, energy and events.</span></strong><br><br>Speaking of this Mind, the great Chinese Zen master Huang Po said,<br><br>All
                              buddhas and ordinary people are just One Mind... This Mind is beyond
                              all measurements, names, oppositions: this very being is It; as soon as
                              you stir your mind you turn away from It.<br><br>This Mind is
                              self-evident - it's always switched on, so to speak. We can - and, in
                              fact, we do - see It in every moment. If we would refrain from stirring
                              our minds (rest our frontal lobes, as my Zen teacher used to say) and
                              let our conceptualising die down, like the ripples on a pond after the
                              stirring wind has ceased, we would realise - we would know Mind
                              directly.</span></blockquote>

              <p>i dont know, as u can see im quite blur and confused.</p>
              <p>so i just wanna to give example. for instance, those who remember their past lives. those people will say they remember who "i" was and what "i" did. so obviously theres something still the same and unchanging, and no one can take their place. one carries out their actions and bears their own result of their own karma(theres collective karma but thats a different story), and no one can take the place of their own suffering on their behalf. even if the true mind should not be mistaken as a separate entity and a 'self', something's still there which is still very individual and got very much to do with ourselves. even if a huge part of this is not real, theres still got to be something unchanging with it that, like the surangama sutra say, "cannot be returned to any causes" and conditions. so is this the true mind?</p>

              <p>What you are talking about is Alaya consciousnesss, not True Mind. Yes, alaya consciousness is an individual stream of consciousness.

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-size: normal;">Alaya-vijnana</span></span>, or
                      "store consciousness" -- one of the central technical terms of <a href="http://www.kheper.net/topics/Buddhism/Yogacara.html">Yogacara</a> (Vijnanavada, Vijnaptimatra) philosophy of Mahayana Buddhism. Early Buddhists
                      taught about existence of six-fold consciousness, that is the conciousness
                      of five types of perception (visual, audial, etc.) and of "mind" (<em>manovijnana</em>).
                      The <a href="http://www.kheper.net/topics/Buddhism/Vijnanavada.htm">Yogacarins</a> analysing the source of consciousness
                      added two more kinds of consciousness. They are: <em>klistamanovijnana</em>,
                      or <em>manas</em>, that is the ego-centre of
                      an empirical personality, and <em>alaya-vijnana</em> which is the source of other kinds of consciousness. Alaya-vijnana is above
                      subject-object opposition <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>but it is not a kind of absolute mind: alaya-vijnana
                      is momentary and non-substantial. </strong></span> Every sentient being with the corresponding
                      to this being "objective" world can be reduced to its "own" alaya-vijnana.
                      Therefore, classical Yogacara states the existence of many alayas.</p>
              <p>The Alaya-vijnana is a receptacle and container of the so-called "seeds"
                      (<em>bija</em>), or elementary units of past experiences. These <em>bijas</em> project themselves as an illusionary world of empirical subjects and corresponding
                      objects. All other seven types of consciousness are but transformations
                      (<em>parinama</em>) of alaya-vijnana. In the course of its yogic practice
                      a Yogacarin must empty
                      <br>alaya-vijnana of its contents. Thus the Yogacarin puts an end to the
                      tendency of external projections of alaya-vijnana changing it into <a href="http://www.kheper.net/topics/nonduality/index.html">non-dual</a> (<em>advaya</em>) wisdom (<em>jnana</em>) of Enlightened mind.</p>
