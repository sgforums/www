Just enough for basic needs.<br><br>Monks may need to take cabs because someone calls them up for emergency things - like he needs this monk to come here and speak the dharma to someone who is dying. PDA and Handphones may be gifts from lay disciples. We may never know.<br><br>But it is also true that some monks are materialistic because they have not renounced in their mind.<br><br>But my point is we may never know so we should nevertheless pay our respects to them and not think otherwise.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi<br><br>Some centers allocate a sum of money called "Allowance" to the monks each month. This money is for them to cover their transport, food, lodging, petty purchases during their stay at the center.<br><br>Cash, credit card, car, PDA phone. By themself they are neither sinful nor pure. Rather they are tools required to survive in modern societies. Outside of society, like say in forests or Buddhist places, some do survive on just their robes and bowl.</div>

It is not true at all.<br><br>Many many venerables are truly highly enlightened. Even if you dont know them much, I believe you should not anyhow make judgements.<br><br>Buddhism is lack of religious wars. We seldom hear of molestation cases within the sangha either.

Buddhists do not generally alter Buddhist teachings, that I am not aware of, unless you are speaking of the unorthodox Buddhist traditions, yes I am aware of that.. that is why I have stated that the forum does not recognise certain traditions.<br><br>It is important as a Buddhist to learn under an authorized Buddhist teacher.
