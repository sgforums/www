            <div class='col-md body'>Hello,<br><br>My opinions in <span style="color: darkblue;">dark blue</span>.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by justdoit77:<br><strong>Something really puzzle me is why will buddhism still one day disappear from our world. Since every now and then there are some great masters appear in the world to ensure the dharma will continue to spread to sentient beings.</strong><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Firstly, how do one actually define great masters? Great masters may ensure spread of Dhamma but that alone will not be sufficient without the help of <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> buddhists, ordained and lay alike. The various masters may evolve into an issue of individualistic sectarianism. That buddhists will be busy trying to recruit people into <span style="font-style: italic;">their</span> organisations respectively. As different organisations tend to have a different objective in mind. Some would prone more to charity, some prone more to meditation, some prone more to academic writing, etc. This seems to suggest that though on the surface we looky united but under that crust, we are not really so.</span><br><br><strong>In fact after buddhism diminish from India, it flourish in country like china, tibet, and now even to the whole world. It is in upward trend.</strong><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">The diminish in India, if you are refering to history, is largely due to that Buddhism had integrated too much of non-buddhistic elements which in terms, doctrinal wise we were no longer in upper hand. Compliment with the violence from a particular religion that surppressed upon buddhism as monastries had a lot of gold and monetary items donated by laity and kings alike.</span><br><br><strong>By right the number of people who become enlightened should be increasing over time, likewise for the englightened being who vow to come back to the world.</strong><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">That is why we cannot rely people who made vow (not say we shouldn't make vow) because vow doesn't guarantee to an instant fullfillment. So to a very large extend we have ourselves to rely in the spreading of Dhamma.</span><br><br><strong>The great masters like padmasambhava, karmapa, xuan zhuang and so on should be able to come back to our world to guide us on the buddhism path or better still achieve another heir day or miracle.</strong><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">This we will not know and we shouldn't speculate what happened to them after their demise.</span><br><br><strong>We have a lot of unseen dharma protectors around to help the continuation of the buddha teaching too.</strong><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Maybe, maybe not. To my understanding, Dhamma Protectors only help those who "turn the Dhamma wheel".</span><br><br><strong>Is it because our society become more and more complicated due to technology improvement and competition arise?</strong><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">I think that contributes a large part too. Every moment we receive so many information and our mind becomes very distracted. The competitions in the material world for survival probably has become some tough that spiritual advancement would be the last thing in most people's minds. The good part of Buddhism is that actually Buddhism is a very practical religion. The Noble Eightfold Paths, having one of it to be Right Livelihood, is applicable to one's life. One shouldn't restrict the definition on cultivation to chanting in temple, group meditation, etc. One can do simply morning or evening puja to remind one's faith in the Triplegem and meditate at home. However, I believe most of us urban dwellers' lives would be schooling, working, etc. This is the best time to put Buddhism to use as well. The various moralities, values, how we perceive and react to different situations that keep presenting before us.<br><br>Every single moment is the time to practice. Irregards to where you are, as long as one's heart is forthcoming and honest, that is the <span style="font-style: italic;">dao chang</span> itself. Every buddhist is the ambassadors of the Good Dhamma.<br><br>The Dhamma will only cease when no one bothers to take faith, understand, practice and <strong>expound </strong>the Good Dhamma.</span><br><br></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Back to the title thread:<br>As long as Buddhism is practical, relevant and common-sensical, it will remain. As a philosophy, Buddhism is great. But if it degenerates into a religion of blind faith, legends and customary rites and rituals - it will go the way of the dinosaurs.<br>Do recognise that as more people become educated, has access to information and vigorous exchanges in Internet forums, religious dogmas and gods are no longer sacred grounds that cannot be questions, reviled and even ridiculed.</div>
