            <div class='col-md body'>The first 2 truths deal with the way   things are; the last 2 point the way to freedom from suffering.<br><br><strong> 1. The Noble Truth of Suffering</strong><br><br>Besides "suffering," other translations of the Pali word dukkha include unsatisfactoriness, dis-ease, and instability. All these words   point to the fact that no conditioned phenomenon can provide true   (lasting) happiness in our lives. The first step in a spiritual life is to<br>look very closely and honestly at our experience of life and see that   there is suffering. We tend to overlook or ignore or just blindly react to   the unpleasant, so it continually haunts us. Yet although physical   suffering is a natural aspect of our lives, we can learn to transcend   mental suffering.<br><br><strong>  2. The Noble Truth of the Cause of Suffering</strong><br><br>Through a lack of understanding of how things truely exist, we  create and recreate an independent self entity called "me."<br>The whole of our experience in life can be viewed through this sense   of self. In consequence, various cravings govern our actions. Cravings   arise for sense experiences, for "being" or "becoming" (e.g. rich,   famous, loved, respected, immortal), and to avoid the unpleasant.  These cravings are the root cause of suffering.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'><strong>3. The Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering</strong><br><br>The mind can be purified of all the mental defilements that cause   suffering. Nibbana, the ultimate peace, has been compared to the   extinction of a three-fold fire of lust, ill-will, and delusion. One who has   realised cessation has great purity of heart, ocean-like compassion,   and penetrating wisdom.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'><strong> 4. The Noble Truth of the Way to the Cessation of Suffering</strong><br><br>The Way leading to cessation contains a thorough and profound  training of body, speech, and mind. Traditionally it's outlined as the Noble Eightfold Path:<br><br>(1) Right Understanding;<br>(2) Right Intention;<br>(3) Right Speech;<br>(4) Right Action;<br>(5) Right Livelihood;<br>(6) Right Effort;<br>(7) Right Mindfulness; and<br>(<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Right Concentration.<br><br>On the level of morality (sila), the Path entails restraint and care in speech, action, and livelihood. The concentration (samadhi) level requires constant    effort to abandon the unwholesome and develop the wholesome, to increase mindfulness and clear comprehension of the mind-body    process, and to develop mental calm and stability. The wisdom  (panna) level entails the abandonment of thoughts of sensuality,    ill will, and cruelty; ultimately it penetrates the true nature of    phenomena to see impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and    impersonality. When all 8 factors of the Path come together in harmony to the point of maturity, suffering is transcended. In summary,   the Four Noble Truths can be thought of as that which is to be<br><br>(1) comprehended, (2) abandoned, (3) realized, and (4) developed.<br><br>With acknowledgements of dhammathai.org</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If look carefully in Amitabha Sutra, Shakyamuni Buddha had urged us 1 time on practice Nienfo and 3 times on vows. This show that vows are more important.<br><br>Nobody had stated this but Master Oyi, that the Bodhisattva Universal 4 vows are related to the 4 Noble Truth!<br><br>1) however innumberable beings are i vow to deliver them. = The Truth of Suffering;<br><br>2) however inexhaustible afflictions/defilements are i vow to sever them. = The Truth of the Cause of Suffering;<br><br>3) however immeasurable the dharmas are, I vow to master them. = The Truth of the Path leading to the End of Suffering.<br><br>4) however unattainable the Way is, I vow to attain it. = The Truth of the End of Suffering;<br><br>So when one vow to attain rebirth in Pureland, all 4 vows and the noble truth is completed! Some people when asked whats Bodhisattva Universal 4 vows or 4 Noble Truth? They don't know yet when vow to rebirth in pureland, they unknowingly attain them. Bodhisattva Universal 4 vows is Great Bodhicitta, and the vow to rebirth in pureland is Utmost Great Bodhicitta. When Master Oyi, said this, we were stunned for words.<br><br>/\<br>Amtf!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Another saying which is very profound:<br><br>As widly known there's the 4 Noble Truths--suffering, affliction, Cessation, and Path. Yet Mahanirvana sutra describe the 4 stages of 4NT and each stage has their unique characteristic OF each 4NT. Which mean Truth within truth.<br><br>1st stage of 4NT , stress the truth of <strong>'birth and cessation' </strong>IS the 1st noble truth of Suffering.<br>2nd stage of 4NT, is the truth of <strong>'no birth and no cessation' </strong>IS the 2nd noble truth of Affliction.<br>3rd stage of 4NT, is the truth of '<strong>infinity' </strong>or All-in-One &amp; One-in-All IS the 3rd noble truth of Cessation.<br>4th stage of 4NT, is the truth of <strong>'non-abiding' </strong>IS the 4th noble truth of Path.<br><br>1st is Collection teachings is meant for Shravakas and Pratyeka-buddhas..<br>2nd is Common teachings is meant for Shravakas, Pratyeka-buddhas and lower-level Bodhisattvas.<br>3rd is Special teachings is dedicated for the Bodhisattvas.<br>4th is Complete teachings comprise of all the above teachings, dwell in the Middle Way. Any teaching given by the Buddha should be considered as the ultimate teaching regardless of the methods.<br><br>/\<br>amtf</div>
