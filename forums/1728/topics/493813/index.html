              Provokes China, and Hints at His Heir</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">ELLEN BARRY APRIL 6, 2017
              The New York Times</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">NEW
              DELHI — It has been a hard journey for the 81-year-old Dalai Lama, perhaps his
              last over the mountain passes at the edge of China, to a town that has played a
              fateful role in his life, and in the history of Tibetan Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Violent
              rains buffeted the small plane he flew into the valley. His party was forced to
              continue overland, traveling seven or eight hours a day over steep serpentine
              roads, lined with villagers hoping to glimpse him.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Each
              day, as he came closer to the holy site of Tawang, China pressed India more
              forcefully to stop his progress, its warnings growing increasingly ominous.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">By
              Thursday, a day before the Dalai Lama was expected to reach Tawang, the
              official China Daily wrote that Beijing “would not hesitate to answer blows
              with blows” if the Indian authorities allowed the Dalai Lama to continue.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">At
              stake on this journey, scholars said, is the monumental question of who will
              emerge as the Dalai Lama’s successor — and whether that successor, typically a
              baby identified as the next reincarnation of the Dalai Lama, will live inside
              or outside China’s zone of influence.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">By
              visiting Tawang, a Tibetan Buddhist stronghold that was the birthplace of a
              previous Dalai Lama, he is expertly needling Beijing, which maintains that this
              area should be part of China. He is also consolidating his sect’s deep roots
              among the population, potentially laying the groundwork for a reincarnation
              there.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;" lang="EN-US">“</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">He is a wise
              Lama, and he is thinking far ahead, as he always has,” said Brahma Chellaney,
              an analyst at New Delhi’s Center for Policy Research. “He is not given to
              sentimental reasoning. There is nothing about his trip to Arunachal Pradesh
              that is sentimental in its nature.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Tawang
              is home to the Monpa people, who practice Tibetan Buddhism and once paid
              tribute to rulers in Lhasa, 316 miles to the north. Though the town’s
              population is about 11,000, officials said they were expecting as many as
              60,000 to gather for the Dalai Lama’s appearances at Tawang’s monastery this
              weekend.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;" lang="EN-US">“</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">We have been
              preparing for the last two months,” said Lobsang Khum, secretary of the
              monastery. “Everybody wants to see him, get his blessings, touch his feet. For
              us, the Dalai Lama is more important than our lives.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              most treasured lore among the Monpa surrounds Tsangyang Gyatso, who in 1682
              became the sixth Dalai Lama. People here make pilgrimages to his childhood
              home, where a stone is displayed with a faint footprint said to be his, and
              speak longingly of the possibility that it could happen again.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;" lang="EN-US">“</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">That is the
              dream of many people here, that the next Dalai Lama should be born in Tawang,”
              said Sang Phuntsok, Tawang’s deputy commissioner. Tsering Tashi, a local
              legislator, said that, as a layman, he had no business commenting, but in the
              end he could not restrain himself. “I wish that the reincarnation of the next
              Dalai Lama happens in Tawang,” he said. “That’s all I can say.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              Dalai Lama has been enigmatic about how his successor will be chosen.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              the past, monks have turned to visions and oracles to lead them to a child
              conceived just as the previous Dalai Lama died. Having identified a child, they
              administer tests seeking to confirm that he is the reincarnated lama, such as
              asking him to pick out objects belonging to his predecessor.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">But
              that method would leave Tibetan Buddhism without a leader for at least a year,
              allowing China to identify and promote its own candidate. The Dalai Lama has
              hinted that he may instead opt for a nontraditional selection process,
              selecting a child or an adult to succeed him while he is still alive.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Aging
              Tibetan Buddhist lamas have, in some cases, visited places where they would
              later be reincarnated as babies, and the Dalai Lama’s visits to Tawang and
              Mongolia seemed to fall into that pattern, said Robert J. Barnett, a historian
              of modern Tibet at Columbia University.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"> <span lang="EN-US">“</span>This is a way of
              getting under the skin of the Chinese, of probing them, and reminding them that
              they have no control over where the next reincarnation occurs,” he said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">As
              the Dalai Lama’s arrival in Tawang grew closer this week, Chinese statements
              grew increasingly bellicose, a tactic that has succeeded in pressuring
              officials of many countries to snub the Tibetan leader.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">On
              Wednesday, a foreign ministry spokeswoman said India had “obstinately arranged”
              the Dalai Lama’s visit, causing “serious damage” to bilateral ties. On
              Thursday, The Global Times, a state-run tabloid, suggested that China could
              retaliate by supporting the anti-Indian militancy in Kashmir.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;" lang="EN-US">“</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Can India
              afford the consequence?” it asked sarcastically. “With a G.D.P. several times
              higher than that of India, military capabilities that can reach the Indian
              Ocean and having good relations with India’s peripheral nations, coupled with
              the fact that India’s turbulent northern state borders China, will Beijing lose
              to New Delhi?”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Though
              India is typically wary of provoking China, several officials have been
              unusually pugnacious in their responses. Pema Khandu, the chief minister of
              Arunachal Pradesh, took the unusual step this week of stating that an independent
              Tibet, not China, is India’s true northern neighbor.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;" lang="EN-US">“</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Let me get this
              straight,” Mr. Khandu told journalists. “China has no business telling us what
              to do and what not to do because it is not our next-door neighbor.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              Dalai Lama, for his part, has been characteristically jovial to the crowd of
              journalists trailing after him, expounding cheerily on subjects from quantum
              physics to global warming. He hardly needs to do more, Mr. Barnett said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;" lang="EN-US">“</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">He doesn’t have
              to do anything except exist and be his usual beaming self to embarrass the
              Chinese,” he said. “He will be right on the border, he will be a complete free
              person, he will be only meters away from Chinese territory, but they cannot do
              anything about it.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              Dalai Lama also revisited his escape from Tibet in 1959, when he fled a Chinese
              military crackdown in Lhasa. Disguised, and with a small group of aides, he
              crossed the mountain passes to safety in Tawang.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">He
              was reunited this week with Naren Chandra Das, 76, an Indian soldier who
              escorted him on the last three days. The two embraced before the cameras: the
              former soldier painfully thin, his eyes clouded by cataracts; the monk
              apple-cheeked and jovial.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;" lang="EN-US">“</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I became old,
              but he stays the same,” Mr. Das said. “He is a big man, the king of Tibet.”</span></p>
