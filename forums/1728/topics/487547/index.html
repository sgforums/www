              Buddhists, the universe has no beginning. Various world systems come into
              existence and eventually cease to be, but other worlds precede and follow them.
              The Buddha is said to have discouraged speculation about the origin of the
              universe; the question of whether the world has a beginning is one of fourteen
              questions that the Buddha refused to answer. He also remained silent when asked
              whether the universe will ever come to an end. Individual worlds are destroyed,
              incinerated by the fire of seven suns; but, no apocalypse, no final end time,
              is foretold. Individual beings put an end to their individual existence, one
              that also has no beginning, by traversing the path to nirvana. </span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>This
              does not mean that Buddhists do not have creation myths. One is offered in the <em>Agganna
              Sutta</em>, which describes how beings first came to populate a newly formed
              world system and how gender, sexuality, private property, labor, and government
              came into existence. The place that they inhabit—and which we inhabit,
              according to the Buddhists—is an island continent called Jambudvipa, "Rose
              Apple Island," in a great sea. It is the southern continent, one of four
              continents in a flat world, situated in the four cardinal directions around a
              central mountain called Mount Meru. The mountain is in the shape of a great
              cube, each of its four faces composed of a different kind of precious stone.
              The southern face of the mountain is made of lapis lazuli and so when the light
              of the sun reflects off Meru's south face, it turns the color of our sky blue.
              Gods live on the slopes of the mountain and on the summit. It was in the heaven
              on the summit on Mount Meru that the Buddha taught the Abhidharma to his
              mother.</span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>The
              Buddha, like other teachers of his day, believed in rebirth—a process of birth
              and death called samsara, literally "wandering." According to the
              Buddha, this process has no beginning and will not end unless one brings it to
              an end. Until then, each being is born in lifetime after lifetime into one of
              six, and only six, realms: as a god, demigod, human, animal, ghost, or denizen
              of hell. This is not a process of evolution but rather very much an aimless
              wandering from realm to realm, up and down, for aeons, a process that on the
              surface appears entirely random. The gods live above our world, some on the
              surface of the central mountain, some in the heavens above it. Their lives
              there are long but not eternal. For the gods who live on the summit of Mount
              Meru, the life span is a thousand years, and every day of those years is equal
              in length to one hundred human years. In the heavens arrayed above the summit
              of Mount Meru, the life spans are longer. These heavens as well as the realms
              of demigods, humans, animals, ghosts, and the denizens of hell, together
              constitute what is called the realm of desire, because the beings there desire
              the pleasures that derive from the five senses, constantly seeking beautiful
              things to see, hear, smell, taste, and touch. Above the desire realm are the
              heavens of the realm of form, where the gods have bodies made of a subtle
              matter invisible to humans; having no need for food or drink, these gods only
              have the senses of sight, hearing, and touch. The highest Buddhist heavens are
              located in what is called the formless realm. There the gods have no bodies but
              exist only as consciousness, and the names of its four heavens are derived from
              the object in which the minds of the gods of that heaven are absorbed: infinite
              space, infinite consciousness, nothingness, neither perception nor
              nonperception. But these heavens remain within the cycle of birth and death,
              and when the karmic effect has run its course, each inhabitant is reborn
              elsewhere. </span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>In
              general, it is said that one is reborn as a god as a result of acts of
              generosity and charity in a former life; charity directed toward the community
              of Buddhist monks and nuns is considered particularly efficacious. However, one
              is reborn in these heavens of the formless realm by achieving their deep levels
              of concentration in meditation while a human. Yet even these profound states of
              bliss, states that last for millennia, are not eternal. Indeed, Buddhist texts
              sometimes consign the saints of other religions to these heavens, explaining
              that they have mistaken such states, which lie within samsara, as liberation
              from it. </span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>Below
              the gods in the hierarchy of beings are the demigods (excluded in some lists),
              a kind of catchall category of all manner of spirits and sprites, some
              malevolent and some benign; one of the words for "plant" or
              "tree," which Buddhists monks are prohibited from uprooting or
              cutting down, literally means "abode of being." The demigods are less
              potent than the gods but have powers that exceed those humans and can cause all
              manner of mischief if not properly propitiated. In the category of demigod, one
              finds the <em>gandharvas</em>, a class of celestial musicians who, according to
              their name, subsist on fragrances; a crude translation of that name would be
              "odor eaters." One also finds a kind of half-human half-horse
              creature called the <em>kimnara</em>, literally, "is that a man?" </span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>The
              third realm is the world of humans, regarded as the ideal state for the
              practice of the Buddhist path. The realms of the gods above are too
              pleasurable; those of the animals, ghosts, and denizens of hell below are too
              painful. The world of humans is said to have sufficient suffering to cause one
              to wish to escape from it, but not so much as to cause paralysis and thereby
              block such an attempt. Among the sufferings of humans, the Buddha enumerated
              eight: birth, aging, sickness, death, losing friends, gaining enemies, not
              getting what you wish for, and getting what you do not wish for. As we
              consider, as we always must, the extent to which the doctrines of a religion
              reflect, on the one hand, the concerns of a distant time and place and, on the
              other hand, more general elements of the human condition, this list, set forth
              in ancient India more than two millennia ago, seems to fall on the universal
              side of the spectrum.</span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>It is
              said that one is reborn as a human as a result of being an ethical person,
              generally understood as keeping vows. As mentioned above, for the Buddhist
              laity, there are five traditional vows: to abstain from killing humans, from
              stealing, from sexual misconduct, from lying, and from intoxicants. Laypeople
              could take any one, two, three, four, or all five of these vows, whether for
              life or for a more limited period. The vows kept by monks and nuns number in
              the hundreds. They govern all elements of monastic life, including possessions
              (especially robes), hygiene, and general comportment. The vows are categorized
              by the weight of the infraction they seek to prevent. Four transgressions
              result in permanent expulsion from the order: murder, sexual intercourse, theft
              (of anything above a specified value), and lying about spiritual attainments.
              Lesser infractions may require probation, confession, or simply a verbal
              acknowledgment.</span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>Vows
              play a central role in Buddhist practice. They are not commandments from God,
              nor do they represent a covenant, but instead are a mechanism for making merit,
              the good karma that leads to happiness in this life and the next. It is
              sometimes said that one of the Buddhist innovations in Indian karma theory was
              to introduce the element of intention. A misdeed was no longer a ritual
              mistake, a sacrifice poorly performed, as it was in Vedic times, but an
              intentional action—whether physical, verbal, or mental—motivated by desire,
              hatred, or ignorance. A vow represented not a situational decision for good
              over evil but a lifetime commitment to refrain from a particular negative act.
              It was said that one accrued a greater good karma by taking a vow not to kill
              humans than by simply happening not to commit murder over the course of one's
              life. Conversely, one accrued greater negative karma if one took and then broke
              a vow to avoid a particular misdeed than if one simply happened to commit that
              misdeed. The scholastic tradition would later explain why this was the case. In
              the act of taking a vow, a kind of "subtle matter" was created in
              one's body. As long as the vow was kept, this subtle matter caused good karma
              to accrue in every moment throughout one's life. For this reason, taking a vow
              was a much more efficient means to generate the seeds of future happiness than
              simply being occasionally ethical. </span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>The
              realms of gods and humans are considered the "good" or
              "fortunate" realms within the cycle of rebirth, because rebirth there
              is the result of virtuous actions and because the sufferings undergone by the
              beings in these realms are far less horrific than those of the beings reborn in
              the three lower realms. </span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>The
              realm of animals (which includes all birds, mammals, amphibians, fish, and
              insects, but not plants) is familiar enough, as are the various sufferings.
              Buddhist texts say that the particular suffering of animals is that they always
              must go in search of food while avoiding themselves becoming food; unlike
              humans, animals are killed not because of something that they did or said, but
              because of the taste of their flesh or the texture of their skin. One is said
              to be reborn as an animal as a result of past actions that were motivated by
              ignorance. </span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>The
              next realm is that of the ghosts—often called "hungry ghosts," the
              translation of the Chinese term for the denizens of this realm. Their primary
              form of suffering is indeed hunger and thirst, and they are constantly seeking
              to fill their bellies. As they do so, they encounter all manner of obstacles.
              In Buddhist iconography, ghosts are depicted as baleful beings with huge
              distended bellies and emaciated limbs, not unlike the victims of famine. But
              beyond this affliction so familiar in human history, the other sufferings of
              ghosts are more fantastic. Some have knots in their throats, making it
              impossible for food or drink to pass. For others, who are able to swallow, the
              food they eat is transformed into sharp weapons and molten lead when it reaches
              their stomach. Still others find that when they finally come upon a stream of
              flowing water, it turns into blood and pus as they kneel down to drink. Ghosts
              live in a world located five hundred leagues beneath the surface of the earth,
              but they sometimes venture into the human world, where they can be seen by
              monks with supernormal powers. Indeed, the feeding of ghosts is a special
              responsibility of Buddhist monks. The Sanskrit term translated as
              "ghost" is <em>preta</em>, which means "departed" or
              "deceased," suggesting that they are the spirits of the dead who have
              not received the proper ritual offerings from their families and thus are
              doomed to starvation. Buddhist monks and nuns, who also have left family life
              behind, have a special responsibility to feed the hungry ghosts, who appear
              often in Buddhist stories. It is said that one is reborn as a ghost as a result
              of actions motivated by greed in a former life. </span></p>

              Buddhist cosmology, the most elaborate of the realms are the most desired—the
              heavens—and the most feared—the hells. There are eight hot hells and eight cold
              hells, four neighboring hells, and a number of trifling hells. They are stacked
              beneath the surface of the earth—the deeper below, the greater the intensity
              and duration of the suffering. The cold hells are desolate lands of ice where
              snow is always falling, without a sun or moon, or any source of light and heat.
              The beings there are naked, and the names of some of the hells describe the
              shape of the blisters that form on their bodies: for example, "Split Like
              a Blue Lotus." The hot hells are lands of burning iron where beings
              undergo various forms of torture during lifetimes that last for millions of
              years, but not forever. Beings are reborn in hell as a result of actions
              motivated by hatred. There are said to be five deeds that result in immediate
              rebirth in the most torturous of the hot hells. The first of the four of these
              seems particularly heinous, the last less obviously so: killing one's father,
              killing one's mother, killing an arhat (someone who has achieved liberation and
              will enter nirvana at death), wounding the Buddha, and causing dissension in
              the community of monks and nuns.</span></p>
