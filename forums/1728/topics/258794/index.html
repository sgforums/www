            <div class='col-md body'>Ajivaka Sutta<br>To the Fatalists' Student<br>Translated from the Pali by<br>Thanissaro Bhikkhu<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">I have heard that on one occasion Ven. Ananda was staying in Kosambi at Ghosita's monastery. Then a certain householder, a disciple of the Fatalists (Ajivakas), went to him and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to Ven. Ananda, "Among us, sir, whose Dhamma is well-taught? Who has practiced well in this world? Who in the world is well-gone?"<br><br>"In that case, householder, I will question you in return. Answer as you see fit. Now, what do you think: those who teach a Dhamma for the abandoning of passion, for the abandoning of aversion, for the abandoning of delusion Â— is their Dhamma well-taught or not? Or how does this strike you?"<br><br>"Sir, <strong>those who teach a Dhamma for the abandoning of passion, for the abandoning of aversion, for the abandoning of delusion Â— their Dhamma is well-taught.</strong> That's how it strikes me."<br><br>"And what do you think, householder: those who have practiced for the abandoning of passion, for the abandoning of aversion, for the abandoning of delusion Â— have they practiced well in this world or not? Or how does this strike you?"<br><br>"Sir, those who have practiced for the abandoning of passion, for the abandoning of aversion, for the abandoning of delusion Â— they have practiced well in this world. That's how it strikes me."<br><br>"And what do you think, householder: those whose passion is abandoned, its root destroyed, like an uprooted palm tree, deprived of the conditions of existence, not destined for future arising; those whose aversion is abandoned... whose delusion is abandoned, its root destroyed, like an uprooted palm tree, deprived of the conditions of existence, not destined for future arising: are they, in this world, well-gone or not? Or how does this strike you?"<br><br>"Sir, those whose passion... aversion... delusion is abandoned, its root destroyed, like an uprooted palm tree, deprived of the conditions of existence, not destined for future arising: they, in this world, are well-gone. That's how it strikes me."<br><br>"In this way, householder, you have answered yourself: 'Those who teach a Dhamma for the abandoning of passion, for the abandoning of aversion, for the abandoning of delusion Â— their Dhamma is well-taught. Those who have practiced for the abandoning of passion, for the abandoning of aversion, for the abandoning of delusion Â— they have practiced well in this world. Those whose passion... aversion... delusion is abandoned, its root destroyed, like an uprooted palm tree, deprived of the conditions of existence, not destined for future arising: they, in this world, are well-gone.'"<br><br>"How amazing, sir. How astounding, that there is neither extolling of one's own Dhamma nor deprecation of another's, but just the teaching of the Dhamma in its proper sphere, speaking to the point without mentioning oneself.<br><br>"You, venerable sir, teach the Dhamma for the abandoning of passion... aversion... delusion. Your Dhamma is well-taught. You have practiced for the abandoning of passion... aversion... delusion. You have practiced well in this world. Your passion... aversion... delusion is abandoned, its root destroyed, like an uprooted palm tree, deprived of the conditions of existence, not destined for future arising. You, in this world, are well-gone.<br><br>"Magnificent, Master Ananda! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to point out the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has Master Ananda Â— through many lines of reasoning Â— made the Dhamma clear. I go to the Buddha for refuge, to the Dhamma, &amp; to the community of monks. May Master Ananda remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward, for life."</span><br><br><a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an03/an03.072.than.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an03/an03.072.than.html</a><br><br>/\<br></div>

This is because, firstly, sensory data are interpretations (manifested form) of reality. Why are they interpretations and are not the direct experiencing of it (reality)? To illustrate this point let's consider the perception of 2 persons: a color-blind person and one with normal vision. The color-blind person may see images differently from one who is not. So... who is seeing the truth? None. Both are seeing interpretations (manifested form) of the truth. Likewise animals may see and sense things differently from humans.<br><br>Sensory data that are being perceived are in turn cognated by the conventional mind. Again, the conventional mind sees interpretations collected by sensory perception. From the sensory data, the conventional mind conceives the information into things, environments and people, etc.<br><br>Here's a simplified example to illustrate this point:<br><br>By differentiating the changes in colours on the vision sight, the conventional mind cognate edges. Perceiving that the edges are connected, an enclosed area becomes recognised. Next, the enclosed area become perceived as objects, things, entities...<br><br>The conventional mind can only theorizes from its interpretations. Science is based on the theory and concepts derived from the conventional mind.<br><br>Science is just that... conceptual framework for understanding the dynamics of Ultimate Reality... But it can only theorizes using concepts.<br><br>To truly experience Ultimate Reality...one must go beyond thinking (which is theorising) about Reality. We must experience it directly.<br><br>From the way that I have written, some people might have the misconceptions that the Source(Reality) is separated from us. This is clearly not so. It is only the conventional discriminating mind that think in terms of separation and duality. However, the conventional discriminating mind itself is not an entity, but is just the dualistic function of cognition.<br><br>For your necessary discernment.

That ignorance is our mistaken notion of our own permanent, independent existence. In ignorance, we see ourselves as separate beings, unconnected with others. Blinded to our true state of interdependence and interconnectedness, it is this basic ignorance that keeps us divided. Only practice that leads to overcoming such ignorance will help to free us from the prisons we make for ourselves and for others<br><br>The BuddhaÂ’s advice is that we should be free from these distractions if we want to experience bliss. This release must however be obtained by our own effort and come from within ourselves.The quality of life depends not upon external development or material progress, but upon the inner development of peace and happiness.If we integrate Buddha's teachings into our daily life, we will be able to solve all our inner problems and attain a truly peaceful mind. Without inner peace, outer peace is impossible. We all wish for world peace, but world peace will never be achieved unless we first establish peace within our own minds<br></div>

This is because, firstly, sensory data are interpretations (manifested form) of reality. Why are they interpretations and are not the direct experiencing of it (reality)? To illustrate this point let's consider the perception of 2 persons: a color-blind person and one with normal vision. The color-blind person may see images differently from one who is not. So... who is seeing the truth? None. Both are seeing interpretations (manifested form) of the truth. Likewise animals may see and sense things differently from humans.<br><br>Sensory data that are being perceived are in turn cognated by the conventional mind. Again, the conventional mind sees interpretations collected by sensory perception. From the sensory data, the conventional mind conceives the information into things, environments and people, etc.<br><br>Here's a simplified example to illustrate this point:<br><br>By differentiating the changes in colours on the vision sight, the conventional mind cognate edges. Perceiving that the edges are connected, an enclosed area becomes recognised. Next, the enclosed area become perceived as objects, things, entities...<br><br>The conventional mind can only theorizes from its interpretations. Science is based on the theory and concepts derived from the conventional mind.<br><br>Science is just that... conceptual framework for understanding the dynamics of Ultimate Reality... But it can only theorizes using concepts.<br><br>To truly experience Ultimate Reality...one must go beyond thinking (which is theorising) about Reality. We must experience it directly.<br><br>From the way that I have written, some people might have the misconceptions that the Source(Reality) is separated from us. This is clearly not so. It is only the conventional discriminating mind that think in terms of separation and duality. However, the conventional discriminating mind itself is not an entity, but is just the dualistic function of cognition.<br><br>For your necessary discernment. Thank you for reading.<br><br><img src="http://www.dreamdatum.com/top_of_the_world.jpg"><br><br>For your necessary ponderance.

As a matter of fact it is already very supportive.<br><br>And when you're dealing with things like Consciousness, you can't just use physical laws to study it, because consciousness is not confined to it. <span style="font-style: italic;"><br>Chalmers advocates the necessity for a new theory, distinct from physical laws, to close the explanatory gap2 and to solve the hard problems of consciousness. Chalmers argues that a complete final theory of the universe will need to establish consciousness as a fundamental, irreducible component.</span> So 'physically proven' is irrelevant here!<br><br>Of course, you can prove someone is conscious by checking his brian waves, that's about it. And yes, there are brainwaves correlates with deep meditative states even that of Causal and Nondual (see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFFMtq5g8N4&amp;mode=related&amp;search=" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFFMtq5g8N4&amp;mode=related&amp;search=</a> where Ken Wilber demonstrates himself entering into Causal, Nondual and other meditative states and its correlates to brainwave activities) However, Consciousness is Consciousness, Brain waves is Brain waves and they are a different 'element'.<br><br>But before that, do your practise and meditation, find out for yourself.<br><br>See Thusness's reply to Casino_King:<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Thusness:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi Casino_King,<br>It is inadequate to use rational thought to understand spiritual matters. Logic is only that branch of philosophy that deals with reasoning.  It does not deal with all types of thinking such as remembering (Recalling past life included), dreaming (Dream Yoga), day dreaming, neurosis,  learning..etc.  These other types of thinking are the job of psychology and parapsychology.<br><br>Although evidence is needed to serve as a base for inductive and deductive reasoning, full proof evidence to arrive at a certain conclusion is not necessary in logical analysis.   In daily life, not all reasoning attempts to provide conclusive evidence for the truth of a given conclusion and more often than not, conclusive evidence cannot be produced.  For pragmatic ground,  we merely want the evidence we arrived at be 'well founded'.<br><br>As human, sleeping and dreaming took up pretty much percentage of our life.  We are not just a rational being, to understand human, we have to deal with all these matters with spiritual issues included.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div></blockquote>There are countless experiential accounts by contemplatives, mystics and Buddhists that describe the same kind of transcendental insight ever since several thousands of years ago. Similarly because of these accounts it is therefore possible that we may reach these insights ourselves by doing spiritual practise.<br><br>Like I said to you previously, "Since Buddhism is about spirituality, experiments must be conducted through spiritual techniques, otherwise there will be no real benefits." That is what is truly useful.<br><br>Also see the limits of current classical science (my 32522th time mentioning) in dealing with (ultimate) Reality: <a href="http://www.dreamdatum.com/science-limitation.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dreamdatum.com/science-limitation.html</a><br><br>Also see: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wX_W1BB_0M&amp;mode=related&amp;search=" rel="nofollow">Ken Wilber - Spirituality and the 3 Strands of Deep Science</a> -- watch the whole thing ESPECIALLY after 6:00 -- Spirituality IS a form of science but don't mix up biology with physics, even though they are interrelated.</div>
