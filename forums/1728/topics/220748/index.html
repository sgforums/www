However it should not be attached to.... just like Buddhists should not be attached to right and wrong.. the Buddhist saying goes 'Shan4 Er4 Jie1 Fan2 Nao3'.. meaning whether right or wrong, if attached to, it will lead to sufferings.<br><br>But since repentance is right.. we shouldn't suppress such thoughts either. I mean when you recognised that you made a mistake... it is good to repent. It would even be better if you can repent in front of the Buddha... my dharma teacher repents 108 times everyday in front of Buddha, prostrating each time she chants the repentance verse.<br><br>When we repent, we just recognise that we ought not to make the same mistakes. But if the 'wrong' is identified with 'self', it becomes guilt. Anyway you say you wish to lose the sense of restrain and abandon all cares in the world and just be.. yes, you can abandon the cares of the world any time. That doesn't mean you cannot be a responsible person.. don't you think? I mean responsibility doesn't necessarily equate to attachment, or am I wrong? It is only because you are identified with it, there is suffering.<br><br>And of course the Bodhisattva is the perfect example... the Diamond Sutra stated,<br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>The Buddha told Subhuti, "All Bodhisattvas, Mahasattvas, should subdue their minds thus: 'I must cause all living beings--those born from eggs, wombs, moisture, by transformation; those with form, those without form, those with thought, those without thought, those not totally endowed with thought, and those not totally without thought--to enter Nirvana without residue and be taken across to Cessation. Yet of the immeasurable, numberless, boundless numbers of living beings thus taken across to Cessation, there is actually no living being taken across to Cessation. ' Why?

And yet, to him, that is not a responsibility.. because he is not attached to "an appearance of self, others, living beings, or a life".<br><br>As for 'To be responsible, i practise suppression my own desire.', well, if what you do is considered inconsiderate to others... and you cannot help it but suppress your own desire, then do so. Because otherwise it may not be morally right.. it just depends on the situation at hand. Wisdom is required. But suppressed desires will strike back, it is better to remove the root of it - because suppressing is like putting a rock on the weed to stop it from growing but not killing it.

            <div class='col-md body'>=== JKrishnamurti.org - Daily Quote === This Choiceless Awareness<br><br>This Choiceless Awareness<br><br>Great seers have always told us to acquire experience. They have said that experience gives us understanding. But it is only the innocent mind, the mind unclouded by experience, totally free from the past - it is only such a mind that can perceive what is reality. If you see the truth of that, if you perceive it for a split second, you will know the extraordinary clarity of a mind that is innocent. This means the falling away of all the encrustations of memory, which is the discarding of the past. But to perceive it, there can be no question of 'how'. Your mind must not be distracted by the 'how', by the desire for an answer. Such a mind is not an attentive mind. As I said earlier in this talk, in the beginning is the end. In the beginning is the seed of the ending of that which we call sorrow. The ending of sorrow is realized in sorrow itself, not away from sorrow. To move away from sorrow is merely to find an answer, a conclusion, an escape; but sorrow continues. Whereas, if you give it your complete attention, which is to be attentive with your whole being, then you will see that there is an immediate perception in which no time is involved, in which there is no effort, no conflict; and it is this immediate perception, this choiceless awareness that puts an end to sorrow.<br><br>The Book of Life - October 10<br><br>I read this while browsing through " hi everyone "<br><br>nice, might be applicable to my problem  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

But if we do harmful acts, the karma will nevertheless comes back... </div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by _wanderer_:</div><div class="quote_body">Eternal Now you can read my mind huh? lol no la we probably don't read same books.<br><br>But well, I do agree most with Longchen's post, though when you say "view of the Dharmakaya", different pple would have diff understanding of what it means.<br><br>Basically I think the View refers to the Ultimate View (some call it View of Emptiness, some call it Primordial Wisdom, others call it something else...). I think Padmasambhava is reminding us not to get lost in conduct, thinking that there is "something truly virtuous" to adopt and "something truly nonvirtuous" to abandon in our conduct/actions. This means, while we are adopting virtues and abandoning nonvirtuous we should bear the View of Emptiness in mind, that NO truly existing person is performing any truly existing action towards any truly existing party.<br><br>However, having embraced this View of Emptiness, as what Longchen said, we should not think that we don't need to care about performing virtuous or nonvirtuous actions, because for us the unenlightened beings, we're still bound by karma. So though aware of the "lack of an inherent truly existing nature" of virtues and nonvirtues, we should still try to adopt virtuous behaviour and abandon nonvirtuous behaviour.<br><br>Thanks for all the sharing Longchen, Sinwei and Eternal Now. I found it kinda surprising and very interesting that diff pple have diff interpretations. I believe such sharings can help all of us sharpen our understanding of the Dharma and motivate one another to apply and actualize them. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> </div></blockquote></div>

I shouldn't be too attached to ethics values that aren't balanced. Since im not enlightened yet, i guess this way could be better for me.<br><br>To note of: let say by going against the values, i could have thought hey i could be happier, why care? But then if the actions created could affect somebody and cause suffering.In addition, the actions could also turn a situation ( unpredictable ) around against u.<br><br>The main conflict here is if it is creating immense self-suffering, isn't me creating a self-denial situation that there is a problem here? I need to deal with the underlying issue and to create constructive solution to the problems that will ideally bring to a win-win situation.<br><br>To drop desire against my ethics..  there might be a chance that i will regret about my action if i commit something against my ethics so it might be better.. ethics are rather subjective topics arr.. so it is very hard to say what is right and wrong here...<br><br>btw what does it has to do with right discourse, speech with the above quote? just curious<br><br></div>
