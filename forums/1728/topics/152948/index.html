            <div class='col-md body'>You are right, time is just a measurement. But strictly speaking .... there is no time. Why is that so?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Everything we call "the past" is, literally, nothing but present memories. Likewise, everything we call "the future" is nothing but present memories inverted, or rearranged, to form a prediction or expectation. The appearance of "time" is little more than a trick of memory, as the Avatamsaka Sutra (Flower Ornament Scripture) says. You can easily discern this for yourself: simply figure out what it is you consider "the past" and "the future." You will discover that it is nothing but thoughts--nothing but memories, nothing but expectations, nothing but mental commentary. It's "all in your head," so to speak. There's really no such thing as time. There is really only Now--an eternally present Present with no beginning and no ending. <strong>Everything is completely new, distinct, and original every instant, with no real "change" or "motion" at all.</strong> The mystic-philosopher Heraclitus, explaining this point, said, "A man cannot step in the same river twice."</span><br><br>see: <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=105352" rel="nofollow">'There is No Time'</a></div>

There is no beginning.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">To those who talked about the first cause of this world, the Buddha responded by saying that it is impossible to find a first cause since everything is changing, interdependent and conditioned by other things. Something that acts as the cause in the present may become the effect in the future. Later that same effect may again become the cause. <strong>Such phenomenon continues ad infinitum.</strong> It is called the universal law of Anicca or impermanency.</span><br><br>But if you are talking about the 'Primordial Buddha', the luminous source of all - source of samsara and nirvana, that one transcends time and space.

It has been said that one cannot find living beings at the becoming of the universe for the essential reason that causes have no beginning. If there were a beginning to the universe, there would also have to be a beginning to consciousness. If we accepted a beginning to consciousness, we would also have to accept that its cause has a beginning, a sudden cause which would have instantly produced consciousness; this would lead to a great many other questions. If consciousness had arisen without cause, or from a permanent cause, that cause would have to exist on. a permanent basis, always, or not exist at all, ever. The fact that a phenomenon exists intermittently proves that it depends on causes and conditions. When all the conditions are met, the phenomenon is produced. When those conditions are absent or incomplete, the phenomenon does not appear. As causes have no beginning and stretch back to infinity, the same thing must apply for living beings. Creation is therefore not possible.</span> (continued in the webpage)</div>

Another note: when the Buddha is still alive, he is in 'Nirvana with residue', when he passes away, his Dharmakaya (dharma body) does not pass away, and that is 'Nirvana without reside'. Buddha is liberated from the cycle of samsaric rebirth. However, even though the Buddha can feel/is aware if there is pain, he will not suffer. He is freed from sufferings in this life.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Regarding 'timelessness', I will quote two persons from the other 'There is no time' post -<br><br>_______________________________<br>longchen  05 December 2004 Â· 09:58 PM<br><br>From my understanding thus far, all past lives are actually happening in the ETERNAL NOW. This interpretation was taken from a brief moment, which felt as if I was physically, and consciously aligned with Â“Eternal Now/No TimeÂ”. I was very much awake when the amazing phenomenon occurred. I could only catch a glimpse of it.<br>Anyway, hereÂ’s what I think I perceivedÂ…<br><br><strong>Â“TIME existed only as a perception for physical consciousness in this realm. Without consciousness, TIME does not exist. Events are all happening in the NOW moment. However, not all consciousnesses are in the present time. Past events/memories are also happening in the NOW. Future appears to be some kind of potential.</strong><br><br>_______________________________<br>Thusness  07 December 2004 Â· 08:44 AM<br><br>This topic is so much to my liking that I have to say something.<br>"Time" does it exist first of all? Science has viewed time as a dimension that can be manipulated if "we are able to travel faster than the speed of light." According to Einstein, a photon travelling at the speed of light does not experience time, coz time halt at the speed of light!<br>So where is "Time" according to Science? It is another "space" far from<br>"here" and can be reached if we are able to travel faster than light.<br>_______________________________<br>Thusness  07 December 2004 Â· 08:59 AM<br><br><strong>The moment ceases as it arises, what the mind grasped is but an image<br>of the ever changing Present. It catches the "Form", the "Enity", the "I"<br>which is illusionary and misses the Essence. In reality there is no changing "thing", there is merely change.</strong><br><br>Right at this moment is the display of the three Dharma Seals: impermanence, non-self, and nirvana, the emptiness nature all existence.<br>This is the basis that every authentic teaching of buddhism must bear.<br><br>It is here that even the greatest mystic must take bow to Buddha. Such penetrating insight amid all kinds of lightning-fast changes to differentiate "I AM" from "Thusness".<br><br>The ever Presence of all cannot be something secondhand, it cannot<br>be the object of observation.
