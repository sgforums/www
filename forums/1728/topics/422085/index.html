              <p>In a particular tradition that I am familiar with, it is said <br>that there are three kinds of protectors.  They are dharmapalas, <br>lokapalas and ksetrapalas.  Respectively they translate to <br>"dharma-protectors," "world(ly)-protectors" and "field-protectors."  <br>Dharma-protectors are those who are highly advanced on the Path.  <br>From Vajrayana's point of view, these beings are actually <br>manifestations of the activities of the Buddhas.  Some of these <br>beings are considered Buddhas while some are on different levels of <br>the Bodhisattva path.  For example, Mahakala and Ekazati are both <br>considered fully enlightened beings while someone like Dorje Lekpa <br>is considered a tenth stage bodhisattva.  The worldly-protectors <br>refer to beings who have pledged to protect the teachings and <br>practitioners.  These include powerful worldly gods, local spirits, <br>energies and other beings.  It is said that sometimes these beings <br>do not even fully accept the teachings of the Buddha.  They are in <br>other words as deluded as we are  - some of them more, others less.  <br>Field protectors are usually associated with very specific places or <br>buildings. In Tibet, families live in the same place and house for <br>hundred of years. As time passes, it is believed that there are <br>certain protectors especially connected with that particular house, <br>clan or family. Spiritually both the worldly and field protectors <br>are much lower than the Dharma-protectors.  Both the worldly and <br>field protectors are not particularly related to Dharma in the same <br>way as Dhama-protectors are. <br><br>    How should we relate to the protectors?  I remember reading His <br>Holiness the Dalai Lama's response to a similiar question.  His <br>Holiness advised that it is actually sufficient to regard the Triple <br>Gem (Buddha, Dharma and Sangha) as protectors.  In his opinion, if <br>one truly takes refuge in the Triple Gem they will be the best <br>protectors one can have. He further explained that protectors are <br>related to Vajrayana practice and only those who are deeply involved <br>with Vajrayana practices should be concerned with the protectors.  I <br>suspect that His Holiness' response in this case is spoken for the <br>general audience and in no way indicates that he is not in favor of <br>protector practices.  Other teachers also agree that if one really <br>relies on the Triple Gem, protection is guaranteed.<br><br>    Very briefly, according to Vajrayana, protectors should never be<br>seen as something separate from oneself.  Protectors actually have <br>two levels which we can relate with.  On the relative level, there <br>are protectors like Mahakala, Palden Lhamo, Dorje Lekpa or Ekazati.  <br>There are numerous sadhanas (practices) associated with these <br>protectors.  But ultimately, it is our own rigpa (the natural mind <br>which is empty, spacious and open) that is the protector.  The <br>sadhanas usually have a structure where the meditator visualizes him <br>or herself as a particular protector. The meditator is reminded <br>again and again that his or her own nature is never separate from <br>the protectors'.  Some teachers further explain that in a way, these <br>protectors are simply our own awareness and mindfulness. Because we <br>are beings with both body and mind, it is easier in the beginning <br>for us to focus on some being with a form - the various protectors.  <br>By meditating on their enlightened form - the various attributes and <br>ornaments (these are related to different enlightened qualities and <br>activities), one is to actualize these same enlightened qualities in <br>oneself.  In a sense, we can say that the protectors are our own <br>awareness and mindfulness appearing in enlightened forms.  With <br>right awareness and mindfulness, we will be able to relate to things <br>as they truly are (the wisdom aspect) and carry out the bodhisattva <br>activities (the compassionate aspect).  Therefore, the effectiveness <br>of these protectors are directly related to our own level of <br>awareness and mindfulness.  I have also heard another teacher <br>explaining that the law of karma is the real protector.  Here, he <br>means that if one were to truly understand cause and effect, one <br>will then abstain from performing any negative actions but instead <br>only cultivate good.<br><br>    Perhaps on a more advance level, the Dharma-protectors are <br>related to different forms and levels of energies.  These energies <br>are said to be latent in us.  By relating to a particular protector, <br>one learns how to channel up a particular energy and to deal with it <br>in an enlightened way. Because energy is simply energy (with <br>negative and positive potentials), there is always a chance of not <br>knowing how to deal with a certain energy that has been aroused <br>through  practice.  Or perhaps the means of arousing that energy is <br>misused.  This is when it is believed that negative effects will <br>occur.  This effect might not only affect the practitioner himself <br>but might include other as well.  Therefore, some teachers are <br>extremely cautious when it comes to protector practices.  In <br>traditional language, protector's practice is something that one <br>does only if one is certain that one can fulfill all the commitments <br>(samaya or damtshig) related to that practice.  Unlike practices <br>like Chenrezig meditation or Tara, it is said that when the <br>protector practice is done wrongly or is not done consistently, the <br>protectors will get extremely "wrathful."  These protectors are <br>guardians of the different practices.  It is also said that <br>protectors are there to make sure that the purity of the lineage is<br>protected.  And to do that, they guard the practices of the <br>practitioners.  It is not uncommon to hear people saying that when <br>they became lazy in their practice or got distracted, something <br>mysterious or supernatural happened that pulled them back into the <br>Path again!  And devout Tibetans will straightaway acknowledge the <br>protectors for fulfilling their duties.  There are also stories of <br>protectors who guard termas - hidden "treasures" (teachings, ritual <br>objects etc, that have supposedly been hidden by masters like <br>Padmasambhava to be retrived in latter days to benefit people).  <br>Some of these protectors are even believed to fiecely guard these <br>termas so that if the wrong people get these termas, they might be<br>destroyed or the termas will simply vanish.  These protectors are <br>usually not Dharma-protectors but some worldly protectors.<br><br>    Therefore, on the relative level, these protectors are treated<br>like independent beings who have pledged to protect the Dharma (but <br>since the ultimate and relative can never be taken as distinct, one <br>is always reminded of the ultimate protector - one's own natural <br>mind).  Different lineages, teachers and practices  have different <br>special protectors.  For example, Palden Lhamo and Dharmaraja is <br>particularly associated with the Gelugpas.  For the Kagyupas, <br>Mahakala is especially significant.  Different aspects of Mahakala <br>(two-armed, four-armed, six-armed, female aspects) are practised by <br>the Sakyas, Gelugs, Kagyus and Nyingmas.  In the Drikung-Kagyu (one <br>of the major sects in the Kagyu school), Achi Chokyi Drolma is a <br>protector intimately related to members of this lineage.  Milarepa <br>himself is related to the five protector goddesses of Tibet - known <br>as the Tseringmas.  Among the Nyingmapas, Ekazati, Rahula and Dorje <br>Lekpa are protectors very closely related to Dzog-chen.  The famous <br>deity of the Nechung oracle is the personal protector of the Dalai <br>Lamas.  Various elaborate rituals and sadhanas are performed to <br>these protectors in the lives of practitioners.  There are certain <br>monasteries that have protector practices carried out 24 hours a day <br>for 365 days a year.  If I am not mistaken, there are a group of <br>monks specially charged with the task of performing protector <br>practices for the welfare of His Holiness the Dalai Lama in <br>particular, and the live of the Dharma in general.<br><br>full article on</p>
