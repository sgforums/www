For nun, Ladies can only renounce once.<br><br>But in my heart i know...... 'Reality is not what it seems sometime '...<br><br>it becos my heart simply know.... i cant lie to myself....<br><br>that all the pleasure in life does not give me the kind of pleasure that i can enjoy anymore... i dun pursue them as much as i will previously<br><br>the way i deal w things are simply different but sometime i find it impractical in the way society function in some sense</div>

I wasn't really satisfied, it just stopped there monotonously.<br><br>I do thought about renounce. to me its a serious cultivation yet not holding too tight. I thought about it but not thinking too much either. let nature take its own course...<br>i've wanted to be buddhist scholar besides the choice of renounce. reason simply cos of wanting to know the deep real true meaning of buddhism thru studies investigations observations &amp; finally speaking them authentically by my own understanding &amp; not blindly quoting or copying what others say....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>renunciation: giving things up and away.....<br><br><strong>leaving one's homeland is accomplishing half the Dharma.</strong><br>- Milarepa<br><br>Trungpa Rinpoche said, "usually we think of renunciation as celibacy, poverty, obedience, shaving your head, going off somewhere and leaving everything behind."<br>he then gave a wider tantric interpretation of renunciation:<br><strong>"renunciation means to let go of holding back."</strong><br><br>it does mean abandoning our intense emotional attachments and compulsive preoccupations. do we really have to turn our backs on family, friends and work in order to practice Dharma? don't think so......<br><br><strong>if there is clinging, the practitioner's view is not the vast view.<br>if there is resistence, the meditation is weak.<br>if there is partiality, the activity is not enlightened action.<br>free from these three is the way of the Natural Great Perfection.</strong><br>- Dzogchen Verse<br><br>Isis, may you be well and liberated and attain enlightenment soon one day.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>
