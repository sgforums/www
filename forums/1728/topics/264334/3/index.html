Because they don't know how to practise. And therefore they can't be liberated. All they are seeking for all their life is eventually going to disappear, and eventually has to be parted with. Such a person can never know transcendental bliss and liberation, and I can honestly say such a life is pretty meaningless... it is like a floating bubble without substance, fruitless goal to chase upon. Basically, he will suffer.<br><br>That doesn't mean we can't make an effort to get mundane things. It just means we have to be liberated at all moments. Then we are free to do or get whatever we want, but we are also free to lose whatever we want.

Many spiritual seekers have had glimpses of the absolute unity of all existence, but few are capable of or willing to live up to the many challenging implications inherent in that revelation. The revelation of perfect unity, that there is no other, is a realization of the ultimate impersonality of all that seems to be so very personal.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Applying this realization to the arena of personal relationships is something that most seekers find extremely challenging, and is the number one reason why so many seekers never come completely to rest in the freedom of the Self Absolute</span>. <strong>Inherent in the revelation of perfect unity is the realization that there is no personal me, no personal other, and therefore no personal relationships</strong>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Coming to terms with the challenging implications of this stunning realization is something that few people are willing to do.</strong></span> Because realizing the true impersonality of all that seems so personal, challenges every aspect of the illusion of a separate, personal self. It challenges the entire structure of personal relationships which are born of needs, wants, and expectations.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is in the arena of personal relationships that the illusion of a separate self clings most tenaciously and insidiously</span>. Indeed, there is nothing that derails more spiritual seekers than the grasping at and attaching to personal relationships. <strong>The revelation of perfect unity reveals the true impersonality of all relationships</strong>. The ego always interprets "impersonal" as meaning cold, distant, and aloof. However, "impersonal" simply means not personal, or void of a separate me and a separate you. The mind cannot comprehend of a relationship without separate entities. Much as a character in a dream cannot comprehend that all other dream characters are simply manifestations of the same dreamer. Yet when the dreamer awakens, he instantly comprehends that the entire dream, and all the characters in it, were none other than projections of his own self. In the dream there is the appearance of separate, personal entities in relationship, but upon awakening one comprehends the impersonal (non-separate) Self that is the source of all appearances.<br><br>To deeply inquire into the question "Who is another?" can lead to the direct experience that the other is one's own Self - that in fact there is no other. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>However, I have seen that for most seekers, even this direct experiential revelation is not enough to transform the painfully personal ways they relate</strong></span>. To come to this profound transformation requires a very deep investigation into the implications inherent within the experiential revelation that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>there is no other</strong></span></span>. It is in the daily living of these implications that most seekers fail. Why? Because, fundamentally, most people want to remain separate and in control. Simply put, most people want to keep dreaming that they are special, unique, and separate, more than they want to wake up to the perfect unity of an Unknown which leaves no room from any separation from the whole.<br><br>There is a powerful tendency in most spiritual seekers to avoid probing deeply into the implications inherent within profound spiritual experience and revelation, because these implications are always threatening to the sense of a separate self, or ego. It is the implications inherent within profound spiritual revelation that demand the transformation of the apparent individual.<br><br>Inherent within the revelation of perfect unity is the realization that there is no other. The implications of this realization reveal that in order to manifest that unity in the relative world, one must renounce the dream of being a separate self seeking to obtain anything through relationship with another. Indeed, personal relationship appears to happen in the relative world, but in reality, all appearances simply arise as temporary manifestations of a unified whole. In the relative world these appearances are in relationship, but not as separate entities. Rather, they are the play of the one Self projecting itself as apparent entities in relationship to one another.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>As long as you identify yourself with the projection of separateness, you will continue to deny that you are the Source of all projections</strong></span>. When you truly and absolutely awaken to this fact, and comprehend the overwhelming implications inherent within this awakening, you will continually experience that all apparently personal relationships are in truth nothing other than the play of your Self.<br><br>To realize that the personal me is an illusion born of false identification with the body, thoughts, and emotions, brings a profound sense of freedom. This is fundamentally the realization of emptiness, of what you are not. But contained within the realization of emptiness (formlessness) is also the realization of what you ARE. In the most absolute sense you ARE this conscious emptiness which is the source of all appearances (existence). But you are the appearance as well. Not just one part of the appearance called "me", but all of it, the entire whole.<br><br>This is the challenge, to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>let your view get this vast</strong></span>. To let your view get so vast that your identity disappears. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Then you realize that there is no other, and there is nothing personal going on.</span> Contrary to the way the ego will view such a realization, it is in reality the birth of true love. A love which is free of all boundaries and fear. To the ego such uncontaminated love is unbearable in its intimacy. When there is no clear separating boundaries and nothing to gain the ego becomes disinterested, angry, or frightened. In a love where there is no other there is nowhere to hide, no one to control, and nothing to gain. It is the coming together of appearances in the beautiful dance of the SELF called Love.<br><br>To the seeker who is sincere, an experiential glimpse of this possibility is not enough. If you are sincere you will find it within yourself to go far beyond any glimpse.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong> You will find within your Self the courage to let go of the known and dive deeply into the Unknown heart of a mystery that calls you only to itself. </strong></span></span></blockquote></div>
