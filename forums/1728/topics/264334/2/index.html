Windows programming.<br><br>Participant 1: Not lah, the chat window lah. {laughs}<br><br>Thusness: Ok. I thought you entered into Programming.<br><br>Participant 1: The question is Â“Does that mean that we try to practise the right conditions such as meditation for the mind in order to let the luminosity to arise.Â”<br><br>Thusness: Luminosity will always arise. It never fails to arise. Now, let me tell you what is luminosity in the simplest sense. Have you ever experienced suffering? Or you experience anything. Suffering... Suffering is actually luminosity. Otherwise how do you know it is suffering? Why the pain is so real? Anything that is real, that you feel, that you touch, anything that you feel so real. It is actually luminosity. How can you know what suffering is all about? Without thoughts or what, you still feel suffering, right? <strong>The presence of suffering, any kind of existence that is made available is actually the manifestation of this luminous clarity. You get it? However, they are fused with the momentum. They are fused with attachment. And the entire fusing and the entire working of the momentum, that instance, the manifestation is suffering.</strong> Everything is like that, you have to feel the pain. Can you understand what I mean or not? When you feel the sand, or you see the texture or you take the stone out, and the texture is so and so, that is actually luminosity also.</div>

Relative truths are expressions of the ultimate reality, and ultimate truth is also not separated from the relative. It is awareness/clarity that matters. If you are aware, then you see everything (relative) as an expression of awareness/ultimate, you can focus on whatever you are doing, everything is just an expression/function of buddha nature. There is no duality between relative and ultimate, if you try to get rid of relative to seek/focus on the ultimate, it cannot be done. Only Clarity is the key.<br><br>But an ignorant man attaches to relative truths, forming dualistic concepts, and therefore is not liberated and bonded. He is lost in ignorant thinking.

            <div class='col-md body'>A quote from Thusness:<br><br><blockquote>Why all the fuss? Is No-Self and Emptiness that important? What that is most problematic is how consciousness works and what happened when we identify and get attached. The immense power of identification, I cannot help but to emphasize and re-emphasized. A mere Â“identificationÂ” has such amazing power. Fusing into all aspect of our experiences, mental, spiritual and physicalÂ…The weight, the burden and the suffering, like holding on to a charcoal and unwilling to drop. How true is that? Again it is not in words, we have to experience the magical effect of identification and attachment ourselves. </blockquote></div>
