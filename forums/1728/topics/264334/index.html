            <div class='col-md body'>Someone asked the question below and I've answered it the best way I can and yet I haven't really answered the question at all because I simply don't know the answer and strongly suspect the question is itself questionable.<br><br>Anyhow, any feedback would be appreciated.<br><br><blockquote>[quote]Just a question: if you are all about accepting and experiencing the world as it is, why do you keep trying to change the rest of us and make us just like you? If YOU are all about just being in the present moment, then aren't those of US who AREN'T in the present moment, still part of YOUR present moment?<br><br>It occurrs to me that you say you're about accepting what is, but that seems to be counter to the fact that you are often exhorting the rest of us to change.<br><br>I'm just sayin'.</blockquote>I really love this question.<br><br>It brings up many paradoxes.<br><br>First of all you're assuming I'm talking to other people and not just to myself. What I mean by that is that you are me, you just don't know it yet.<br><br>As for accepting the world as it is and why am I trying to change anyone, that part of the question is really provocative. I really don't know how to answer that. I'm completely at a loss. I don't know. Of course there is the assumption that I am indeed trying to change someone, and it appears to be true. But I've learned that appearances can be deceiving. Remember, I'm advocating letting go of everything I know. So that really leaves me in the middle of nowhere, in a huge vastness or void, with no scaffolding to hang on to and I must say, I love it, it's really freeing and peaceful. But it also leaves me with no answers, nothing is known, except perhaps the fact that I am, that seems to be the only thing that is definite.<br><br>You also mentioned that some of you are not in the present moment and you're suggesting that I am and to me that doesn't make sense at all. We all are in the present moment simply because there's nowhere else to be, is there? The present moment is all that really exists. The future is just a thought in your mind and the past is just a memory.<br><br>So when I say you're not in the present moment I'm really only talking about your thoughts and something called "presence". You actually can get lost in your thoughts about the past and the future. This can happen when you identify with your thoughts and take them seriously. But we're only talking about thinking here. Physically we are all ever only in the present moment. But I have to confess here, that I really don't know what I'm talking about when I talk about "physically" because to me that is just more interpretation by the mind, I've learned not to take my mind very seriously anymore.<br><br>But we can definitely get the sense that past and future are real when we identify with thoughts about past and future, but when you see thoughts for what they are, simply thoughts, then they lose their hypnotic effect on you and you can remain in the present moment, this is called "presence". And this is what leads to the peace that surpasses all understanding. Simply because there is no way to understand this, you can only BE this. You can only be "presence" because that is your true nature. [/quote]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think that one has to discern what is relative truth and ultimate reality. When talking about relative truths (such as talking about mundane affairs, etc), it is unhelpful to bring in ultimate reality as it just confuses.<br><br>On the other hand, when one is talking about ultimate reality, then relative truths does not apply because the ultimate nature of reality is the nature of reality regardless of what is the content of that reality.<br><br>It's like asking if there is no self, why does a Bodhisattva have compassion and want to save other beings? Because ultimate reality does not contradict relative truths (where we talk about I, Me, You, etc), it is only that we no longer see relative truths as absolute, we are no longer confused.<br><br>(Diamond Sutra elaborates a lot on this, regarding no-self, no sentient being to be saved, and yet working for all sentient being's liberation)<br><br>p.s. Accepting what is does not contradict with trying to change things. It is like what Eckhart said, it is only that one no longer treats the present moment as a means to an end. Then one just do what one needs to do without attaching to outcome and preferences. Response that arises is spontaneous and out of Prajna, without being affected by our attachment and delusions.</div>

The conditions for arising differ.<br><br>There is the temptation to express this way in conventional terms but really it is the result of attempting to reconcile non-dual experience into a dualistic framework and extrapolate a little due to momentum.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>When we are engaged in the process of explaining Â“I am YouÂ”, confusion arises not only because dualistic thinking is not an appropriate tool to express non-dual experience, but we identify with the dualistic mechanism.  The habitual tendency of the mind to identify is so amazing and our entire experience is shaped during the process even for a person that has experienced non-duality.<br><br>In Buddhism, there is no-self apart from phenomenon happening and there never was a Â‘you and meÂ’ from start.  Therefore non-dual experience is not being extrapolated to Â“I am YouÂ”, instead, a skillful-mean to correctly explain without being trapped in a dualistic framework was devised.  This skillful mean must eliminate Â‘IÂ’ from start and see what is from beginning.  Emptiness and Dependent Origination are devised for this purpose.<br><br>There is phenomenon happening, there is no self and to intuitively experience the ceaseless arising and ceasing nature of awareness is more precious than anything in Buddhism; this is the arising of prajna wisdom.<br><br>My 2 cents.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>
