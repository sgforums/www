              <div class="chapter">
              <p>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at <a id="savatthi" name="savatthi">Savatthi</a>, in Jeta's Grove, <a id="anatha" name="anatha">Anathapindika</a>'s monastery. There he addressed the monks: "Monks!"</p>
              <p>"Yes, lord," the monks replied.</p>
              <p><a id="yoniso" name="yoniso">The</a> Blessed One said, "Monks, the 
              ending of the fermentations is for one who knows &amp; sees, I tell you,
               not for one who does not know &amp; does not see. For one who knows 
              what &amp; sees what? Appropriate attention &amp; inappropriate 
              attention. When a monk attends inappropriately, unarisen fermentations 
              arise, and arisen fermentations increase. When a monk attends 
              appropriately, unarisen fermentations do not arise, and arisen 
              fermentations are abandoned. There are fermentations to be abandoned by 
              seeing, those to be abandoned by restraining, those to be abandoned by 
              using, those to be abandoned by tolerating, those to be abandoned by 
              avoiding, those to be abandoned by destroying, and those to be abandoned
               by developing.</p>
              <p>"<strong>[<a id="f1" name="f1">1</a>]</strong> And what are the fermentations 
              to be abandoned by seeing? There is the case where an uninstructed, 
              run-of-the-mill person — who has no regard for noble ones, is not 
              well-versed or disciplined in their Dhamma; who has no regard for men of
               integrity, is not well-versed or disciplined in their Dhamma — does not
               discern what ideas are fit for attention or what ideas are unfit for 
              attention. This being so, he does not attend to ideas fit for attention 
              and attends [instead] to ideas unfit for attention.</p>
              <p>"And what are the ideas unfit for attention that he attends to? 
              Whatever ideas such that, when he attends to them, the unarisen 
              fermentation of sensuality arises in him, and the arisen fermentation of
               sensuality increases; the unarisen fermentation of becoming arises in 
              him, and arisen fermentation of becoming increases; the unarisen 
              fermentation of ignorance arises in him, and the arisen fermentation of 
              ignorance increases. These are the ideas unfit for attention that he 
              attends to.</p>
              <p>"And what are the ideas fit for attention that he does not attend to?
               Whatever ideas such that, when he attends to them, the unarisen 
              fermentation of sensuality does not arise in him, and the arisen 
              fermentation of sensuality is abandoned; the unarisen fermentation of 
              becoming does not arise in him, and arisen fermentation of becoming is 
              abandoned; the unarisen fermentation of ignorance does not arise in him,
               and the arisen fermentation of ignorance is abandoned. These are the 
              ideas fit for attention that he does not attend to. Through his 
              attending to ideas unfit for attention and through his not attending to 
              ideas fit for attention, both unarisen fermentations arise in him, and 
              arisen fermentations increase.</p>
              <p>"This is how <a id="ayoniso" name="ayoniso">he attends inappropriately</a>:
               'Was I in the past? Was I not in the past? What was I in the past? How 
              was I in the past? Having been what, what was I in the past? Shall I be 
              in the future? Shall I not be in the future? What shall I be in the 
              future? How shall I be in the future? Having been what, what shall I be 
              in the future?' Or else he is inwardly perplexed about the immediate 
              present: 'Am I? Am I not? What am I? How am I? Where has this being come
               from? Where is it bound?'</p>
              <p>"As he attends inappropriately in this way, one of six kinds of view arises in him: The view <em>I have a self</em> arises in him as true &amp; established, or the view <em>I have no self</em>... or the view <em>It is precisely by means of self that I perceive self</em>... or the view <em>It is precisely by means of self that I perceive not-self</em>... or the view <em>It is precisely by means of not-self that I perceive self</em> arises in him as true &amp; established, or else he has a view like this: <em>This
               very self of mine — the knower that is sensitive here &amp; there to 
              the ripening of good &amp; bad actions — is the self of mine that is 
              constant, everlasting, eternal, not subject to change, and will stay 
              just as it is for eternity.</em> This is called a thicket of views, a 
              wilderness of views, a contortion of views, a writhing of views, a 
              fetter of views. Bound by a fetter of views, the uninstructed 
              run-of-the-mill person is not freed from birth, aging, &amp; death, from
               sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair. He is not freed, I 
              tell you, from suffering &amp; stress.</p>
              <p>"The well-instructed disciple of the noble ones — who has regard for 
              noble ones, is well-versed &amp; disciplined in their Dhamma; who has 
              regard for men of integrity, is well-versed &amp; disciplined in their 
              Dhamma — discerns what ideas are fit for attention and what ideas are 
              unfit for attention. This being so, he does not attend to ideas unfit 
              for attention and attends [instead] to ideas fit for attention.</p>
              <p>"And what are the ideas unfit for attention that he does not attend 
              to? Whatever ideas such that, when he attends to them, the unarisen 
              fermentation of sensuality arises in him, and the arisen fermentation of
               sensuality increases; the unarisen fermentation of becoming arises in 
              him, and arisen fermentation of becoming increases; the unarisen 
              fermentation of ignorance arises in him, and the arisen fermentation of 
              ignorance increases. These are the ideas unfit for attention that he 
              does not attend to.</p>
              <p>"And what are the ideas fit for attention that he does attend to? 
              Whatever ideas such that, when he attends to them, the unarisen 
              fermentation of sensuality does not arise in him, and the arisen 
              fermentation of sensuality is abandoned; the unarisen fermentation of 
              becoming does not arise in him, and the arisen fermentation of becoming 
              is abandoned; the unarisen fermentation of ignorance does not arise in 
              him, and the arisen fermentation of ignorance is abandoned. These are 
              the ideas fit for attention that he does attend to. Through his not 
              attending to ideas unfit for attention and through his attending to 
              ideas fit for attention, unarisen fermentations do not arise in him, and
               arisen fermentations are abandoned.</p>
              <p>"He attends appropriately, <em>This is stress... This is the 
              origination of stress... This is the cessation of stress... This is the 
              way leading to the cessation of stress.</em> As he attends appropriately 
              in this way, three fetters are abandoned in him: identity-view, doubt, 
              and grasping at precepts &amp; practices. These are called the 
              fermentations to be abandoned by seeing.</p>
              <p>"<strong>[<a id="f2" name="f2">2</a>]</strong> And what are the fermentations 
              to be abandoned by restraining? There is the case where a monk, 
              reflecting appropriately, dwells restrained with the restraint of the 
              eye-faculty. The fermentations, vexation, or fever that would arise if 
              he were to dwell unrestrained with the restraint of the eye-faculty do 
              not arise for him when he dwells restrained with the restraint of the 
              eye-faculty.</p>
              <p>Reflecting appropriately, he dwells restrained with the restraint of the ear-faculty...</p>
              <p>Reflecting appropriately, he dwells restrained with the restraint of the nose-faculty...</p>
              <p>Reflecting appropriately, he dwells restrained with the restraint of the tongue-faculty...</p>
              <p>Reflecting appropriately, he dwells restrained with the restraint of the body-faculty...</p>
              <p>Reflecting appropriately, he dwells restrained with the restraint of 
              the intellect-faculty. The fermentations, vexation, or fever that would 
              arise if he were to dwell unrestrained with the restraint of the 
              intellect-faculty do not arise for him when he dwells restrained with 
              the restraint of the intellect-faculty. These are called the 
              fermentations to be abandoned by restraining.</p>
              <p>"<strong>[<a id="f3" name="f3">3</a>]</strong> And what are the fermentations 
              to be abandoned by using? There is the case where a monk, reflecting 
              appropriately, uses the robe simply to counteract cold, to counteract 
              heat, to counteract the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, &amp; 
              reptiles; simply for the purpose of covering the parts of the body that 
              cause shame.</p>
              <p>"Reflecting appropriately, he uses almsfood, not playfully, nor for 
              intoxication, nor for putting on bulk, nor for beautification; but 
              simply for the survival &amp; continuance of this body, for ending its 
              afflictions, for the support of the holy life, thinking, 'Thus will I 
              destroy old feelings [of hunger] and not create new feelings [from 
              overeating]. I will maintain myself, be blameless, &amp; live in 
              comfort.'</p>
              <p>"Reflecting appropriately, he uses lodging simply to counteract cold,
               to counteract heat, to counteract the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind,
               sun, &amp; reptiles; simply for protection from the inclemencies of 
              weather and for the enjoyment of seclusion.</p>
              <p>"Reflecting appropriately, he uses medicinal requisites that are used
               for curing the sick simply to counteract any pains of illness that have
               arisen and for maximum freedom from disease.</p>
              <p>"The fermentations, vexation, or fever that would arise if he were 
              not to use these things [in this way] do not arise for him when he uses 
              them [in this way]. These are called the fermentations to be abandoned 
              by using.</p>
              <p>"<strong>[<a id="f4" name="f4">4</a>]</strong> And what are the fermentations 
              to be abandoned by tolerating? There is the case where a monk, 
              reflecting appropriately, endures. He tolerates cold, heat, hunger, 
              &amp; thirst; the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, &amp; reptiles;
               ill-spoken, unwelcome words &amp; bodily feelings that, when they 
              arise, are painful, racking, sharp, piercing, disagreeable, displeasing,
               &amp; menacing to life. The fermentations, vexation, or fever that 
              would arise if he were not to tolerate these things do not arise for him
               when he tolerates them. These are called the fermentations to be 
              abandoned by tolerating.</p>
              <p>"<strong>[<a id="f5" name="f5">5</a>]</strong> And what are the fermentations 
              to be abandoned by avoiding? There is the case where a monk, reflecting 
              appropriately, avoids a wild elephant, a wild horse, a wild bull, a wild
               dog, a snake, a stump, a bramble patch, a chasm, a cliff, a cesspool, 
              an open sewer. Reflecting appropriately, he avoids sitting in the sorts 
              of unsuitable seats, wandering to the sorts of unsuitable habitats, and 
              associating with the sorts of bad friends that would make his 
              knowledgeable friends in the holy life suspect him of evil conduct. The 
              fermentations, vexation, or fever that would arise if he were not to 
              avoid these things do not arise for him when he avoids them. These are 
              called the fermentations to be abandoned by avoiding.</p>
              <p>"<strong>[<a id="f6" name="f6">6</a>]</strong> And what are the fermentations 
              to be abandoned by destroying? There is the case where a monk, 
              reflecting appropriately, does not tolerate an arisen thought of 
              sensuality. He abandons it, destroys it, dispels it, &amp; wipes it out 
              of existence.</p>
              <p>Reflecting appropriately, he does not tolerate an arisen thought of ill will...</p>
              <p>Reflecting appropriately, he does not tolerate an arisen thought of cruelty...</p>
              <p>Reflecting appropriately, he does not tolerate arisen evil, 
              unskillful mental qualities. He abandons them, destroys them, dispels 
              them, &amp; wipes them out of existence. The fermentations, vexation, or
               fever that would arise if he were not to destroy these things do not 
              arise for him when he destroys them. These are called the fermentations 
              to be abandoned by destroying.</p>
              <p>"<strong>[<a id="f7" name="f7">7</a>]</strong> And what are the fermentations 
              to be abandoned by developing? There is the case where a monk, 
              reflecting appropriately, develops <em>mindfulness</em> as a factor for Awakening dependent on seclusion... dispassion... cessation, resulting in letting go. He develops <em>analysis of qualities</em> as a factor for Awakening... <em>persistence</em> as a factor for Awakening... <em>rapture</em> as a factor for Awakening... <em>serenity</em> as a factor for Awakening... <em>concentration</em> as a factor for Awakening... <em>equanimity</em> as a factor for Awakening dependent on seclusion... dispassion... 
              cessation, resulting in letting go. The fermentations, vexation, or 
              fever that would arise if he were not to develop these qualities do not 
              arise for him when he develops them. These are called the fermentations 
              to be abandoned by developing.</p>
              <p>"When a monk's fermentations that should be abandoned by seeing have 
              been abandoned by seeing, his fermentations that should be abandoned by 
              restraining have been abandoned by restraining, his fermentations that 
              should be abandoned by using have been abandoned by using, his 
              fermentations that should be abandoned by tolerating have been abandoned
               by tolerating, his fermentations that should be abandoned by avoiding 
              have been abandoned by avoiding, his fermentations that should be 
              abandoned by destroying have been abandoned by destroying, his 
              fermentations that should be abandoned by developing have been abandoned
               by developing, then he is called a monk who dwells restrained with the 
              restraint of all the fermentations. He has severed craving, thrown off 
              the fetters, and — through the right penetration of conceit — has made 
              an end of suffering &amp; stress."</p>
              <p>That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words.</p>
