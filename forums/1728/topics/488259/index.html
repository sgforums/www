              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 15pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The
              situation in Nepal is still desperate. Aid and relief efforts have reached
              Kathmandu, though more is still needed there and many isolated villages still
              have seen no supplies or medical help. The Government is ill-prepared for such
              a disaster and is <a href="https://www.transparency.org/country/#NPL"><span style="color: #509ac9;">known for
              corruption</span></a>. And while the first reaction of many is to turn to
              international NGOs, specifically those with disaster training and expertise
              (see the recent post on <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/americanbuddhist/2015/04/5-ways-to-help-victims-of-the-nepal-earthquake.html"><span style="color: #509ac9;">5 ways to help victims of the Nepal earthquake</span></a>;
              which has now been shared nearly 15,000 times – thank you all so, so much!), a
              friend with expertise in Nepal suggested today that larger NGOs may
              actually have a harder time delivering aid, as they need to go <em>through</em> government channels, while smaller aid organizations can go around them.</span><span style="font-size: 15pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 15pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">A case can,
              no doubt, be made for this, as well as in the other direction. However, for our
              current purposes, one such smaller aid group with intimate contact on the
              ground in Nepal is <a href="http://www.phakchokrinpoche.org/"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Lama Phakchok Rinpoche’s</span></a> <a href="http://www.cglf.org/"><span style="color: #509ac9;">Chokgyur Lingpa Foundation</span></a>, which was included
              in last week’s contact information for several, first <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/americanbuddhist/2015/04/9-buddhist-organizations-working-on-the-ground-in-nepal.html"><span style="color: #509ac9;">9, then 12, Buddhist groups working in Nepal</span></a>.
              The following is an update from members of the <a href="http://www.cglf.org/"><span style="color: #509ac9;">Chokgyur Lingpa
              Foundation</span></a>:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">On the 29<sup>th</sup> April, one of our teams travelled up
              to the Nuwakot district. Urgyen</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Dorje, one of our monks, is from the Chatrohali
              village so they headed there to see how they could help. Fortunately they saw
              that although many houses have been damaged, not too many have been destroyed.
              Nevertheless, even if their houses are still standing, because they have been
              damaged they are not safe so many families are living outside. In the near
              future, they will need to either completely rebuild or repair their houses.</span><span style="font-size: 15pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 22.45pt; background: whitesmoke;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The team was
              planning to return to Kathmandu that evening, but it started raining and the
              dirt road soon turned to a stream of mud. Their truck couldn’t travel on the
              road so they had to stay there overnight. Urgyen Dorje’s family was extremely
              helpful and hospitable. They put the whole team up, which included Urgyen
              Dorje, Kebula, nurse Anita, and several others, giving them space in their
              makeshift shelter, bedding, and food even though they themselves have so little
              after the disaster.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 22.45pt; background: whitesmoke;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The
              villagers are in need of tarpaulins to make shelters. It is a very large
              village. We distributed food supplies and medicine there. We used half of the
              medicine during our stay while Anita was treating injured people. We left the
              remaining half there since there is a resident doctor who will be able to
              continue treating patients. The following day, 30<sup>th</sup> April, we
              returned to the monastery in Kathmandu. We now know that what they need most of
              all is tarpaulins so will be returning there today, 1<sup>st</sup> May.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 22.45pt; background: whitesmoke;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Fortunately
              they do have enough food for the meantime. Nevertheless, we distributed 1 pack
              of rice, 1 pack of daal, and 1 pack of salt to each family there. There are
              around 800 families in Chatrohali, and each family is very large with around 15
              members. Another organization has given them 150 sacks of rice.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 22.45pt; background: whitesmoke;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">There is a
              village called Balami above Chatrohali, which has been much worse hit but is
              only accessible by foot. Some of the villagers from Balami were able to walk
              down to Chatrohali and so we gave them sacks of potatoes which they carried up
              to their village. We are leaving for the area again today, 1<sup>st</sup> May
              with a restocked truck. We should be back this evening with more to report.</span></p>
