Other prayers are for specific people or situations, as in praying for a certain personÂ’s illness to be cured. To have either type of prayer fulfilled depends on more than just praying: the appropriate cause must also be created.</strong> It is not just a matter of saying, <span style="color: red;">"Please, Buddha, make this and that happen, but IÂ’m going to relax and have tea while you do the work!"</span><br><br>For example,<strong> if we pray to be more loving and compassionate and yet make no effort to control our anger, we are not creating the cause for that prayer to be fulfilled.</strong> <span style="color: darkblue;">The transformation of our mind comes from our own effort, and we pray for the BuddhasÂ’ inspiration to do so.</span> <strong>"Receiving the blessings of the Buddhas" does not mean that something tangible comes from the Buddhas and goes into us. It means that our mind is transformed through the combined effort of the teachings and guidance of the Buddhas and bodhisattvas and our own practice. Thus, we cannot pray to be born in a pure land and expect the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas to do all the work! We must also make effort to actualize the teachings: we gradually develop detachment from worldly pleasures, we practice compassion as much as we can, and we generate wisdom. Then, praying has an exceptionally profound effect on our mind.</strong> However, if we do nothing to correct our bad habits of body, speech and mind, and if our mind is distracted while praying, then there is minimal effect.<br><br>As for our <strong>prayers for a sickness to be cured or the family finances to improve or for a deceased relative to have a good rebirth, these, too, depend on the person involved having created the necessary causes. If he/she has, our prayers provide the condition for the seed of a virtuous action he/she did in the past to ripen and bring its result. However, if that person has not created the causal seed through his/her own positive past actions, then it is difficult for our prayers to be fulfilled.</strong> <span style="color: darkblue;">We can put fertilizers and water on the ground, but if the farmer has not planted the seed, nothing will grow.</span><br><br>While describing how cause and effect works in our mental continuum, the Buddha said that killing causes shortage of life. Both abandoning killing and saving othersÂ’ lives cause us to have a long life, free from illness. <span style="color: darkred;">If we neglect to follow this basic advice and yet pray to have a long and healthy life, we are missing the point!</span> On the other hand, if in the past the person concerned has abandoned killing and has saved lives, then prayers for him/her could be fulfilled.<br><br>In the same way, the Buddha said generosity is the cause of wealth. If we have been generous in a past life and now pray for our wealth to increase, then our finances could improve. Yet, if we are very miserly now, we are creating the cause for poverty, nor wealth, in the future. Being generous, helping those in need and sharing what we have, will bring their desirable results sometime in the future. On the other hand, when we experience some difficulties in our life, it is good to ask ourselves, "<span style="color: darkred;">What kind of action could I have done that created the cause for this result?" </span>This we can learn from the BuddhaÂ’s teachings.<span style="color: darkblue;"> Then we can change our behavior to avoid leaving more seeds to experience that undesirable result.</span><br><br></div>

The network has grown to about 65 host sites around the world running custom software that reads the output of physical random number generators and records a 200-bit trial sum once every second, continuously over months and years. The data are transmitted over the internet to a server in Princeton, NJ, USA, where they are archived for later analysis. Individual data create a tapestry of color. The dot below shows coherence.<br><br>The purpose of this project is to examine subtle correlations that appear to reflect the presence and activity of consciousness in the world.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>In 1985, Elaine Myers re-examined the original published research in "The Hundredth Monkey Revisited" in the journal In Context. In her review she found that the original research reports by the Japan Monkey Center in vol. 2, 5 and 6 of the journal Primates differ from Watson's story in significant ways. In short, it contains no evidence that the 'Hundredth Monkey' phenomenon exists; the published articles only describe how the sweet potato washing behavior gradually spread through the monkey troop and became part of the set of learned behaviors of young monkeys. There is no evidence at all of a critical number at which the idea suddenly spread to other islands, and none of the original researchers ever made such a claim.<br><br>Despite the lack of supporting evidence for the story as told by Watson and Keyes it is still popular among New Age authors and personal growth gurus and has become an urban legend and part of New Age mythology. As a result, the story has also become a favorite target of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal and was used as the title essay in The Hundredth Monkey: And Other Paradigms of the Paranormal published by them in 1991.</strong><br><br>Are you saying that for you, praying is simply talking to oneself? I am going to say "for you" instead of saying "for Buddhists" since there are folk practices that people who call themselves Buddhists do.</div>

Many non-enlightened people can also develope such powers, so no point in asking this, there are many people outside Buddhism who has exercised such powers. Supernatural powers was never a pre-requisite of enlightenment, and buddha never taught that awakening and supernatural powers are linked. Supernatural powers is also not a goal in practising meditation, it should never be. Siddhis are merely by-products of samadhi and Buddhists always do not emphasize on such aspects.<br><br>There are a few kinds of arhants. Some has powers due to his different path of practise, but the other type of arhant is dry-insight, that is he does not focus so much on samadhi and only attains the insight of direct seeing into the 4 noble truths and attaining enlightenment. Not to mention, arhant is the highest level for the self-liberating path. Prior to that there are 3 other levels of awakening.<br><br>Furthermore, I do not see that developing such powers as side-products of samadhi makes you anymore 'superhuman'. We do not identify people with such powers as God or immortal or something. A person who possesses such powers continue to remain fully human.</div>

Until science shows that it is indeed natural, science says that it is unnatural or super natural. You cannot say that you are scientific and then throw scientific principles out the window.
