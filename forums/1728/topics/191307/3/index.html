As a result certain modifications or re-interpretations of their scriptures have become necessary. <strong>In this respect Buddhism, the rational teaching of the Enlightened One, faces no such embarrassment, as its basic principles are in close harmony with the findings of science.</strong> Let us study just one example.<br><br><span style="color: red;">In the light of the latest studies of the atom, the old concept of the world is radically changing, just as the concept of the atom itself is changing. There is no more matter as it was believed in the past; it has been reduced to energy, and even concept of energy is disappearing gradually and the scientists themselves do not know what to call it. They are now coming to the conclusion that the atom is only a concept and by extension, that the world too is nothing but a conception. The more they make researches into the structure of the atom the more they seem to be convinced of this conclusion. </span></div>

Darkness was on the surface of the deep. God's Spirit was hovering over the surface of the waters.<br><br>3 God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.<br><br>4 God saw the light, and saw that it was good. God divided the light from the darkness.<br><br>5 God called the light "day," and the darkness he called "night." There was evening and there was morning, one day.<br><br>6 God said, "Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters."<br><br>7 God made the expanse, and divided the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse; and it was so.<br><br>8 God called the expanse "sky." There was evening and there was morning, a second day.<br><br>9 God said, "Let the waters under the sky be gathered together to one place, and let the dry land appear;" and it was so.<br><br>10 God called the dry land "earth," and the gathering together of the waters he called "seas." God saw that it was good.<br><br>11 God said, "Let the earth put forth grass, herbs yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind, with its seed in it, on the earth;" and it was so.<br><br>12 The earth brought forth grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, with its seed in it, after their kind; and God saw that it was good.<br><br>13 There was evening and there was morning, a third day.<br><br>14 God said, "Let there be lights in the expanse of sky to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years;<br><br>15 and let them be for lights in the expanse of sky to give light on the earth;" and it was so.<br><br>16 God made the two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night. He also made the stars.<br><br>17 God set them in the expanse of sky to give light to the earth,<br><br>18 and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. God saw that it was good.<br><br>19 There was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.</blockquote>You notice that that in verse 3 it says: <strong><span style="color: red;">"God said, "Let there be light," and there was light."</span></strong><br><br>Light is energy, how did the Bible know that the universe in not composed of matter; even more amazing, <strong><span style="color: red;">how did the Bible know that the universe is not even composed of energy?</span></strong><br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">The light of "Let There Be Light" is not light energy.

It is not a science text book. It is a recording of people's experiences with God. Even if it is in full accordence with science text books so what? What is required of you is not believe in the Bible but Faith In God.<br><br>What is required of you is not believe in Buddha's teaching but enlightenment. Buddah said that you must not be attached to Dharma. Similarly, Christians cannot be attached to the Bible, they must experience God for themselves.<br><br>Jesus said: "Verily verily I say unto you, except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God"<br><br>Do you then insist that Jesus is stupid because what he said in not in compliance with Gynecology? Who is the confused one?</div>
