            <div class='col-md body'>i first think of Buddhist percepts and some of Christian's ten commandment.<br>do not Kill, do not steal, do not lie , do not sexual misconduct/adultery.<br><br>or there are many examples in the book:<br><br><blockquote>Living Buddha, Living Christ<br>-- Thich Nhat Hanh<br><br>Quoted from "Living Buddha, Living Christ" by Thich Nhat Hanh<br><br>To me, religious life is life. I do not seee any reason to spend one's whole life tasting just one kind of fruit. We human beings can be nourished by the best values of many traditions. (p.2)<br><br>It is good that an orange is an orange and a mango is a mango. The colors, the smells, and the tastes are different, but looking deeply, we see that they are both authentic fruits. Looking more deeply, we can see the sunshine, the rain, the minerals, and the earth in both of them...If religions are authentic, they contain the same elements of stability, joy, peace, understanding, and love. The similarities as well as the differences are there. They differ only in terms of emphasis. Glucoise and acid are in all fruits, but their degrees differ. We cannot say that one is a real fruit and the other is not. (p194-195). </blockquote>ps : all real religions from saints are to make people become good.<br><br>/\<br><br></div>

Both were born in a miraculous way. Soon after their birth, their future greatness is proclaimed by a sage (Asita, Simeon). Both astonish their teachers through the knowledge they possess, though still in their early childhood. Both are tempted by the devil before they start upon their public career. Both walk over the water (//Jataka//, 190; //Matth.//, 14, 26). Both feed 500 and 5,000 persons, respectively (//Jataka//, 78; //Mark//, 14, 16ff.) by multiplying miraculously the food available. The death of both is accompanied by great natural phenomena. Also the parables ascribed to them show some similarities as, for instance, the story of the sower (//Samyutta//, 42, 7; //Matth.// 13,3), of the prodigal son (//Lotus of the Good Law//, Chap. IV; //Lk.//, 14), of the widow's mite (//Kalpanamanditika//; //Mark// 12).<br></blockquote></div>

The Buddha taught 84000 dharma doors to enlightenment - chanting is one of them, meditation is one of them and within the 'meditation' catergory there are dozens of different types of meditation... there is also koan inquiry, visualisation, etc etc really a lot.<br><br>Praying is not one of them because you cannot attain enlightenment by praying.</div>
