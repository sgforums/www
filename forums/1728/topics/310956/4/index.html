              <p>BTW while I was trying to 'let go into the infinite' I had this
              weird experience of a sense of energy rising in my body and strong
              bliss coupled with a very strong sensation of heat and warmth
              growing hotter and hotter... even though the room is very cold.
              Similar to Tummo practice perhaps. But then after the sensation of
              warmth passed, I felt strangely cold and started shivering... LOL.
              But anyway not so important.</p>

              <p>Hi AEN,</p>
              <p>You ask me what is it... i will try to reply based on my understanding only.</p>
              <p>I think the heat and warm feeling is the chi moving. Usually, our modern day lifestyle does not allow us to feel the chi. This is partly because, there are too much tension.</p>
              <p>These tensions in the body block the flow of chi. However during medition, the tension goes away and the flow resumes... making us feel the difference as warm and heat.</p>
              <p>Also, if you become sensitive enough, you can also feel the effect of electromagnetic field affecting the body if the body is near some kind of electrical devices. It may feel like some kind of aches.</p>
              <p>Normally, i find that taking a bath will clear away the electrical charge.</p>

              <p>Well first of all I am not suggesting that what I experienced is Tummo or is similar to that... but I think some elements maybe similar... as I remember being in this empty spacious state without a separate self... and then this intense bliss and energy arising, and the 'heat' is produced as some sort of byproduct. Very very hot... almost going to sweat. "Feverish" is the right word but is yet the sensation actually much hotter than the usual feeling of "feverish".</p>

              <p><br>  Associating 'death of I' with vivid luminosity of your
              experience is far too early.  This will lead you into
              erroneous views because there is also the experience of
              practitioners by way of complete surrendering or elimination
              (dropping) like Taoist practitioners.  An experience of deep
              bliss that is beyond that of what you experienced can occur. 
              But the focus is not on luminosity but effortlessness, naturalness
              and spontaneity.  In complete giving up, there is no 'I' ; it
              is also needless to know anything; in fact 'knowledge' is
              considered a stumbling block.  The practitioner drops away
              mind, body, knowledge...everything.  There is no insight,
              there is no luminosity there is only total allowing of whatever
              that happens, happen in its own accord.  All senses including
              consciousness are shut and fully absorbed.  Awareness of
              'anything' is only after emerging from that state.<br>  <br> One is the experience of vivid luminosity while the other is a
              state of oblivious.  It is therefore not appropriate to relate
              the complete dissolving of 'I' with what u experienced alone.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Hi, is this description by David Carse a description of the 'state of oblivious':</p>
              <p><em>"Still later that night in the jungle, toward morning, lying there in Presence, there was a point when all the experiencing stopped. The thinking and the feeling and the processing that had been happening all completely ceased. I was not aware of it 'at the time,' because there was no thought and no awareness of time or indeed of anything; only in hindsight is there a looking back and realizing that there was a 'period of time,' out of time, when there was no thought, no experience, no thing, nothing.</em></p>
              <p><em>It may have been hours, it may have been an instant; it was not of time, Only in retrospect can it be called a place or a time of stillness or emptiness, because when it was occurring there was no time and no place and no sense or awareness of anything happening. I was not asleep. It was a condition of complete stillness and completely alert awareness. But there was nothing there to be aware of, no sense even of self to be self-aware. It could be called a completely empty stillness and awareness. I have no idea how long this lasted.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>Eventually, at some point, in this place of no time, no thought, no place, no self, there gradually began a creep in an awareness that there was a simple watching of something. As this awareness distilled out of the emptiness, attention focused; and the realization was that what was being watched, what there was awareness of, was a guy lying in the bamboo hut in the jungle. This continued to focus until there was awareness, a kind of recognition, of what had always been thought of myself, 'david,' lying there on a matt in the middle of the rainforest. And there was an abrupt realization: "my god, there's nobody home."</em></p>
              <p><em>This was the moment at which nothing happened. Like a 'pop' of a bubble bursting, a shift in understanding. I am not 'david:' there has never been a 'david:' the idea of 'david' is part of a thought, something like a dream, that doesn't matter. The individual 'self,' the one I thought resided in that body, looking through those eyes, the one I thought a few hours ago had woken up enough to perceive Presence, is not there, does not exist, never has. There is nobody home.</em></p>
              <p><em>This was not an 'out of body' experience. I have had these, in which 'me', my'self,' experienced being out of this body rather than inside it, and experienced looking at the body from outside instead of looking out through the body's eyes. This was not like that at all. What was being watched here was not only the body, but the whole 'david' apparatus; body, mind self, soul, personality. What is watching is All that is. The watching, what I came to know as 'witnessing,' is neither other than the body or mind or the whole 'david' thing, nor not other. IT does not originate from here, from the body/mind; but also It does not stand apart from it, because It is inclusive of it. The witnessing is clearly not being done by 'me,' even a disembodied 'me.' This witnessing is not being done by anyone, any entity. That's the point: there are no entities, there is nobody home. There is only the witnessing.</em></p>
              <p><em>Abruptly, instantly. Effortlessly, out of stillness.</em></p>
              <p><em>A moment, an instant, of radical, severe disorientation, discontinuity; then a stepping through into perfect clarity, not at all unlike the experience of waking up.</em></p>
              <p><em>A dream, seemingly real, lasting all one's apparent life.</em></p>
              <p><em>A stirring, and the sleep dropping effortlessly away.</em></p>
              <p><em>A moment of disorientation as the dream is recognized as dream and there is waking to the Real.</em></p>
              <p><em>Immediately, the dream falls away and it is known that the dream was never real, that one never was what one had been dreaming. There is no 'before and after,' no moment when I was 'no longer' david. This is the 'gateless gate:' only the seeing that david never was. As near as can be said: the perception now is that there is no 'me,' no 'david;' and 'I' is that which has never not been All That Is. Always everywhere prefect Brilliant Stillness, and no-thing which has no name continually outpouring, seen now always not as from this mind/body thing.</em></p>

              <p>“Tilopa's Song to Naropa” (from <em>Mother of the Buddhas</em> by Lex Hixon):</p>
              <p><em>“To
              realize this inexpressible truth, do not manipulate mind or body, but
              simply open into transparency with relaxed, natural grace, intellect at
              ease in silence, limbs at rest in stillness like hollow bamboos.
              Neither breathing in nor breathing out with the breath of habitual
              thinking, allow the mind to be at peace in brilliant wakefulness.”<br> <br> “Phenomena on every plane of being are constantly arising and
              disappearing. Thus they are forever fresh, always new and
              inexhaustible. Like dreams without solid substance, they can never
              become rigid or binding. The universe exists in a deep, elusive way
              that can never be grasped or frozen. Why feel obsessive desire or
              hatred for it, thereby creating illusory bonds?”<br> <br> “Strenuously seeking truth by investigation and concentration, one will
              never appreciate the unthinkable simplicity and bliss that abide at the
              core. To uncover this fertile ground, cut through the roots of
              complexity with the sharp gaze of naked awareness, remaining entirely
              at peace, transparent and content. You need not expend great effort nor
              store up extensive spiritual power. Remain in the flow of sheer
              awareness. </em>Mahamudra<em> neither accepts nor rejects any current of energy, internal or external.”<br> <br> “Since the ground consciousness is never born into any realm of being,
              nothing can add to or subtract from it. Nothing can obstruct or stain
              it. When awareness rests here, the appearance of division and conflict
              disappears into original reality. The twin emotions of anxiety and
              arrogance vanish into the void from which they came.”</em></p>

                                  ordinary thought because they are not objects or subjects. They can't
                                  be imagined or touched or approached in any way by any ordinary mode of
                                  consciousness, therefore they are beyond thinking."<br><br>-- <a href="http://www.andyweberstudios.com/d_prajnaparamita.html">Prajnaparamita</a></p>

              <div class="post-content">
              <p>We
                      could say that awareness has two different aspects or expressions. In
                      one, it is the space that makes room for everything, the emptiness
                      which allows what is to simply be as it is. In this aspect, our
                      sky-Like nature is passive, unmoved and untouched by whatever clouds
                      appear within it. It is the still and formless background against which
                      the world of form appears and moves. In this aspect, the Sky is not
                      really involved or engaged with the myriad forms that appear and then
                      disappear within it. It is simply the silent witness of all comings and
                      goings. Here, the expression is a silent one for the Sky really has
                      nothing to say about any thought, sensation, feeling or experience that
                      may be present. It is simply that boundless space that contains them
                      all.</p>
              <p>We could say that in this aspect, the sky-like nature of mind or
                      awareness is a kind of disinterested observer or witness. You can maybe
                      sense this aspect right now, the simple and effortless knowing or
                      registering of whatever sounds and sights may be present, much like a
                      movie screen passively registers the multitude of images that flash
                      across it. Regardless of their content, every thought, image, feeling,
                      and sensation is effortlessly known by this empty, awake, sky-like
                      presence that we are.</p>
              <p>But there is another more dynamic aspect or expression of this
                      presence of awareness. And it is that dimension that becomes active
                      when the container in a sense becomes interested in that which it
                      contains. Yes, there is something – call it awareness - that silently
                      registers the sound of the bird or the traffic outside or the colors
                      and patterns of light that appear before its ever-watchful gaze. But
                      what happens when the silent awareness becomes interested and curious
                      about the sounds that are appearing within it? What happens when the
                      still and unmoving witness becomes curious about that which it is
                      witnessing? There is the sense here that the mystery that is awake (our
                      true nature) has this natural interest and curiosity about everything.
                      In its more active aspect or dimension, the mystery seems to live in a
                      state of child-like wonder and innocence, a kind of quiet fascination,
                      even awe, in the face of the utter miracle that is everything.</p>
              <p>As the screen of presence-awareness or Being that simply registers
                      what is, what we are is this deep and abiding peace. All is still and
                      unmoving. But as the screen becomes interested in the images that are
                      moving across its face, so begins the dance of the unborn and the born,
                      of formlessness loving form, the boundless wonder of what is…</p>

              <div class="post-content">
              <p>In
                      spiritual, non-dual circles we often hear the instruction to stay with
                      the sense of “I AM,” to simply notice the undeniable feeling that we
                      exist. But rather than focusing on the “I AM,” here is another
                      invitation. Drop the “I” altogether and just notice the “Am,” the sense
                      of existence itself. Not <em>my</em> existence. Not <em>my</em> being.
                      Just BEING. See if you can find a beginning or an end to this sense of
                      aliveness. Notice how it is without edge or boundary, how there really
                      is no “my” in it anywhere.</p>
              <p>Now, for a moment, as you look out upon the world, observing
                      whatever is in your visual field, just feel that you are gazing at it
                      from some reference point, call it “I.” Feel that you are a separate
                      self, a subject looking out upon the world of objects. Now simply feel
                      into this reference point called “I.” What is it actually made of?
                      Isn’t the reference point we call “self” really made of nothing, a
                      nothing that moves as everything, a nothing that is Life? Isn’t it <em>all</em> made of Life - the search for an identity, for some point of reference,
                      the fixation upon that point, and the falling away of all points of
                      view - all of it, the expression of the boundlessness that is Life?</p>

              <div class="post-content">
              <p>Here’s a little experiment…</p>
              <p>The experience you are having right now - thoughts arising, feelings
                  being felt, sensations dancing. No matter whether or how the experience
                  may be being judged - as pleasurable, painful, boring, exciting, hazy,
                  clear - the question I would pose to you is this: What is at the <em>center</em> of the experience?  No doubt, something is happening, something is being experienced.  But what is at the <em>center</em> of this that is being seen, this that is being felt, this that is being
                  heard? Feeling happy and content? What is at the center? Confused and
                  struggling? What is at the center? Calm and at peace? What is at the
                  center? Is anything there?</p>
              <p>Now, the mind may answer, “Well <em>I</em> am there, I am at the
                  center.” Okay, so you are the center. If that is your experience, fine.
                  No sense fighting that sense. Go ahead and feel that you are at the
                  center, feel that you are there, right in the heart of whatever is
                  being experienced. But now I would ask you to look once more: “What is
                  at the center of that feeling called “me being at the center?” What is
                  there, in the center of this sense called “me,” the center of this
                  experience you are calling “I”?</p>
              <p>Anything there?</p>

              <p>I met God<br> on the road<br> today.<br> She asked<br> me if I knew<br> where She<br> might find<br> God.</p>
              <p>I didn’t know<br> what to say…</p>

              <p>Others:</p>
              <p><br> What appears is at the same time disappearing, the arising and the
                                      passing away, a single movement, without beginning or end. This is
                                      the preciousness of life, this amazing constellation of feelings,
                                      thoughts, sensations, and the mystery of wakefulness that
                                      illuminates them all, here and then gone in a flash.<br> <br> And the extraordinary paradox is that this which is ever changing
                                      is, at the same time, changeless. A bird, a tear, a star- all the
                                      movement of a single life, one ocean dancing as a thousand
                                      different waves and yet always remaining itself.</p>

              <p><strong>Pathless Path</strong></p>
              <p>The path to God,
                      the path to ultimate reality is as Krishnamurti said, a "pathless
                      path." In the end, there is no path to the ultimate because there is
                      only the ultimate. Everything is made of That, the source and suchness
                      of all things - every tree, every person, every flower, every atom,
                      every star - all of them made of the same ineffable mystery, the
                      wetness in every wave... <br><br> We may imagine that we are on a journey back to God, but how can there
                      be a journey to something that is everywhere and everything? We walk to
                      our temples and mosques, our churches and synagogues, our yoga centers
                      and meditation cushions, to find God, to find Truth, but what is sought
                      is already present, present before the first step is ever taken, and
                      present as that very step. What is sought is here before the first
                      thought ever arises to seek It, and It is here as that very thought.
                      Truth is present, before the mind ever imagines it has been lost. But
                      Truth is also the imagining, God seeking God... <br><br> We seek God but there is no escaping God for there is only God, only
                      Spirit dancing as everything that is seen, everything that is touched,
                      everything that is felt. We search for something else that will make us
                      happy, some other experience or moment, but the happiness and freedom
                      we seek is already here as this - this experience, this state of mind,
                      this moment. Every breath, every sensation, the clarity, the confusion,
                      the seeking, and the end of seeking, all of them God, all of them the
                      Truth, all of them, enough.</p>
