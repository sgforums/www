              <p><span>Have you ever had the experience of fully
                          appreciating a piece of music to the point that instead of
                          'hearing' the music, you actually 'Became' the music? It's like
                          your sense of self or personality temporarily dissolves and instead
                          of hearing the music, you are the music as it plays?</span></p>
              <p><span>Or perhaps seeing a tree.. or anything... and
                          becoming merged with the seeing or the tree such that you could
                          feel the 'existence' of the tree itself, but there is nobody there
                          seeing it... you are not there seeing the tree, you ARE the tree,
                          you ARE the seeing/seen.</span></p>
              <p><span>Well I had such experiences years ago but
                          recently I had more intense experiences of such....</span></p>
              <p><span>Some days back I was contemplating on death. What
                          I mean is I'm pondering on 'How does it feel like to die or be
                          dead?'... Then I 'pretended' to die... and suddenly, it feels like
                          "I" completely died and disappeared.. But instead of losing
                          consciousness, awareness turns out to be everything I see and felt,
                          the whole world is there, except without a "me". It's like the pure
                          existence of the world but without a center or a "me" in it.
                          However a short moment later the karmic propensity of perceiving a
                          "separate self" comes back like an entity in the head and 'I'
                          'lost' the experience... This is described very precisely by
                          Thusness in his earlier stages of experiences, <em>"The rest of the
                          journey is the unfolding and further refining of this experience of
                          Total Presence but somehow there is always this blockage, this
                          ‘something’ preventing me from recapturing the experience. It is
                          the inability to fully ‘die’ into total Presence..."</em> and
                          <em>"Somehow something is blocking the natural flow of my innermost
                          essence and preventing me from re-living the experience. Presence
                          is still there but there is no sense of ‘totality’. It was both
                          logically and intuitively clear that ‘I’ is the problem. It is the
                          ‘I’ that is blocking; it is the ‘I’ that is the limit; it is the
                          ‘I’ that is the boundary but why can’t I do away with
                          it?"</em></span></p>
              <p><span>Anyway I learnt from this that 'death' is not as
                          scary as we might think and in fact is quite blissful.</span></p>
              <p><span>Then a few days later a similar experience came
                          but was much more intense... it feels as though I'm entering into a
                          different state of consciousness... and my body and mind is like
                          totally dissolving and fading away... and I'm 'forcefully' absorbed
                          into what I am seeing and hearing and feeling... it feels strange
                          and I don't know how to describe it. There is sort of a shift in
                          consciousness like entering an altered state but yet it is not a
                          trance. There is complete awareness or consciousness but the "self"
                          or "center" dissolves and fades out of existence. What remains is
                          everything as consciousness. Actually it's not even "consciousness"
                          that we might think of or "consciousness" in the Buddhist sense
                          because this "consciousness" is not "consciousness conscious OF
                          something"... rather it feels like pure existence itself… the "Pure
                          Beingness", yet not limited to the sense of "Beingness" or "Amness"
                          (which I had past glimpses of what it is like, the impersonal pure
                          sense of existence or consciousness) but rather it is the "pure
                          existence" of the seeing and hearing, i.e. of the
                          "world".</span></p>
              <p><span>It feels very different from our normal way of
                          perceiving things but at the same time it's pretty much the same.
                          What I mean is the things that are seen or heard are still pretty
                          much the same as before but the experience contrasts with our
                          normal (or abnormal) way of perceiving things "at a distance" and
                          "with a self" and also with a lack of clarity.</span></p>
              <p><span>This time the experience is longer but still I
                          'went back to normal' after some time. Also, it appears that I
                          'time travelled' during my meditation... I sat one hour, second
                          half hour passed by like less than a few minutes... its as if I did
                          not perceive the change in time.. sort of timeless? I only knew how
                          long has past after looking at the clock.</span></p>
              <p><span>Anyone had such experiences to share?</span></p>
              <p><span>p.s. the forum seems unusually inactive
                          theseadays.</span></p>

              <p>Great explanation by David Loy which I just read (I find some parts of his book 'Nonduality' intellectually heavy and couldn't fully understand but at the same time I could recognise increasingly what he is saying):</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>To begin, let us remind ourselves that in nondual perception there is no awareness that one is seeing <em>with</em> the eyes or hearing <em>with</em> the ears. According to the ninth Oxherding Picture, the perceiving of an enlightened person is "as though he were blind and deaf" in the sense that "he absorbs himself so unselfconsciously in what he sees and hears that his seeing is no seeing and his hearing no-hearing." To be simultaneously aware of the sense-organ would mean that attention is divided, hence the experience is dualistic and the Light-object (for example) could not be completely be self-luminous.</strong></span> This view is equally agreeable to both Mahayana and Advaita, but Advaita quite understandably wants to distinguish between such transcendental experience and our usual perception, in which sense-consciousness is dependent upon the contact between organ and object. But the only way we can avoid splitting experience into two radically different types, thus severing samsara from nirvana, is to make the extraordinary claim that we do not actually perceive with the sense-organs even now.</p>

              <p>BTW while trying to find 'where is the body' one finds that there is no body in one's direct experience, only bodily sensations etc. The construct of a body is 'inferred'. It is only a mental construct which we are heavily bonded with.</p>
                  <p>As David Loy also said (regarding the duality between sense organ and sense object), "However deeply automatized such a basic
                          inference may be, still it is nothing more than a savikalpa thought-construct.
                          This argument also implies something else important to the nondualist: that we
                          have never had any dualistic sense-experience. The sense of duality can only be
                          thought-constructed by juxtaposing one nondual experience (e.g., an eye opening)
                          with another (the experience of a self-luminous Light-object.)"</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>And hence in deep meditation we can dissolve such bonds and 'body consciousness'... Saw something from the net the other day which I think is very nicely described...</p>

              <p>I'm not sure what sort of disorientation. Even if there is disorientation (and I don't know what you mean by this), there will be tremendous bliss resulting from the loss of 'I', 'me', 'mine'. If there is no bliss, that means there is still attachment to 'self'. Also how do you know that he is feeling disoriented if he's already dead? lol</p>
              <p>Also after death, the loss of 'I', 'me', 'my body' is only for a short moment. When complete dissolution happens there is a short moment where the Clear Light is experienced, which is our true nature. But most people cannot recognise that, and the delusion of 'I', 'me', 'mine' or 'where am I?' arises again and hence the state is lost and rebirth takes place. In Mahayana or Vajrayana, the delusional 'I', 'me', 'mine' which is the 7th consciousness results in the formation of the Antarabhava in the bardo state, which is a ghost-like entity being the height of a 5 year old. During the beginning period the Antarabhava will suffer some confusion.</p>
              <p>BTW recently I watched this youtube video, I could recognise what she is saying. It's very good, do watch it if you can. I believe she had an awakening of some sort. Luckily my experience wasn't stroke... lol.</p>

              <p>I
                          grew up to study the brain because I have a brother who has been
                          diagnosed with a brain disorder, schizophrenia. And as a sister and as
                          a scientist, I wanted to understand, why is it that I can take my
                          dreams, I can connect them to my reality, and I can make my dreams come
                          true -- what is it about my brother's brain and his schizophrenia that
                          he cannot connect his dreams to a common, shared reality, so they
                          instead become delusions?
                          <br> <br>So I dedicated my career to research into the severe mental
                          illnesses. And I moved from my home state of Indiana to Boston where I
                          was working in the lab of Dr. Francine Benes, in the Harvard Department
                          of Psychiatry. And in the lab, we were asking the question, What are
                          the biological differences between the brains of individuals who would
                          be diagnosed as normal control, as compared to the brains of
                          individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia, schizoaffective, or bipolar
                          disorder?
                          <br> <br>So we were essentially mapping the microcircuitry of the brain,
                          which cells are communicating with which cells, with which chemicals,
                          and then with what quantities of those chemicals. So there was a lot of
                          meaning in my life because I was performing this kind of research
                          during the day. But then in the evenings and on the weekends I traveled
                          as an advocate for NAMI, the National Alliance on Mental Illness. <br> <br> But on the morning of December 10 1996 I woke up to discover that I had
                          a brain disorder of my own. A blood vessel exploded in the left half of
                          my brain. And in the course of four hours I watched my brain completely
                          deteriorate in its ability to process all information. On the morning
                          of the hemorrhage I could not walk, talk, read, write or recall any of
                          my life. I essentially became an infant in a woman's body. <br> <br> If you've ever seen a human brain, it's obvious that the two
                          hemispheres are completely separate from one another. And I have
                          brought for you a real human brain. [Thanks.] So, this is a real human
                          brain. This is the front of the brain, the back of the brain with a
                          spinal cord hanging down, and this is how it would be positioned inside
                          of my head. And when you look at the brain, it's obvious that the two
                          cerebral cortices are completely separate from one another. For those
                          of you who understand computers, our right hemisphere functions like a
                          parallel processor. While our left hemisphere functions like a serial
                          processor. The two hemispheres do communicate with one another through
                          the corpus collosum, which is made up of some 300 million axonal
                          fibers. But other than that, the two hemispheres are completely
                          separate. Because they process information differently, each hemisphere
                          thinks about different things, they care about different things, and
                          dare I say, they have very different personalities. [Excuse me. Thank
                          you. It's been a joy.]
                          <br> <br>Our right hemisphere is all about this present moment. It's all
                          about right here right now. Our right hemisphere, it thinks in pictures
                          and it learns kinesthetically through the movement of our bodies.
                          Information in the form of energy streams in simultaneously through all
                          of our sensory systems. And then it explodes into this enormous collage
                          of what this present moment looks like. What this present moment smells
                          like and tastes like, what it feels like and what it sounds like. I am
                          an energy being connected to the energy all around me through the
                          consciousness of my right hemisphere. We are energy beings connected to
                          one another through the consciousness of our right hemispheres as one
                          human family. And right here, right now, all we are brothers and
                          sisters on this planet, here to make the world a better place. And in
                          this moment we are perfect. We are whole. And we are beautiful. <br> <br> My left hemisphere is a very different place. Our left hemisphere
                          thinks linearly and methodically. Our left hemisphere is all about the
                          past, and it's all about the future. Our left hemisphere is designed to
                          take that enormous collage of the present moment. And start picking
                          details and more details and more details about those details. It then
                          categorizes and organizes all that information. Associates it with
                          everything in the past we've ever learned and projects into the future
                          all of our possibilities. And our left hemisphere thinks in language.
                          It's that ongoing brain chatter that connects me and my internal world
                          to my external world. It's that little voice that says to me, "Hey, you
                          gotta remember to pick up bananas on your way home, and eat 'em in the
                          morning." It's that calculating intelligence that reminds me when I
                          have to do my laundry. But perhaps most important, it's that little
                          voice that says to me, "I am. I am." And as soon as my left hemisphere
                          says to me "I am," I become separate. I become a single solid
                          individual separate from the energy flow around me and separate from
                          you. <br> <br> And this was the portion of my brain that I lost on the morning of my stroke.
                          <br> <br> On the morning of the stroke, I woke up to a pounding pain behind my
                          left eye. And it was the kind of pain, caustic pain, that you get when
                          you bite into ice cream. And it just gripped me and then it released
                          me. Then it just gripped me and then released me. And it was very
                          unusual for me to experience any kind of pain, so I thought OK, I'll
                          just start my normal routine. So I got up and I jumped onto my cardio
                          glider, which is a full-body exercise machine. And I'm jamming away on
                          this thing, and I'm realizing that my hands looked like primitive claws
                          grasping onto the bar. I thought "that's very peculiar" and I looked
                          down at my body and I thought, "whoa, I'm a weird-looking thing." And
                          it was as though my consciousness had shifted away from my normal
                          perception of reality, where I'm the person on the machine having the
                          experience, to some esoteric space where I'm witnessing myself having
                          this experience. <br> <br> And it was all every peculiar and my headache was just getting worse,
                          so I get off the machine, and I'm walking across my living room floor,
                          and I realize that everything inside of my body has slowed way down.
                          And every step is very rigid and very deliberate. There's no fluidity
                          to my pace, and there's this constriction in my area of perceptions so
                          I'm just focused on internal systems. And I'm standing in my bathroom
                          getting ready to step into the shower and I could actually hear the
                          dialog inside of my body. I heard a little voice saying, "OK, you
                          muscles, you gotta contract, you muscles you relax."
                          <br> <br>And I lost my balance and I'm propped up against the wall. And I
                          look down at my arm and I realize that I can no longer define the
                          boundaries of my body. I can't define where I begin and where I end.
                          Because the atoms and the molecules of my arm blended with the atoms
                          and molecules of the wall. And all I could detect was this energy.
                          Energy. And I'm asking myself, "What is wrong with me, what is going
                          on?" And in that moment, my brain chatter, my left hemisphere brain
                          chatter went totally silent. Just like someone took a remote control
                          and pushed the mute button and -- total silence. <br> <br> And at first I was shocked to find myself inside of a silent mind. But
                          then I was immediately captivated by the magnificence of energy around
                          me. And because I could no longer identify the boundaries of my body, I
                          felt enormous and expansive. I felt at one with all the energy that
                          was, and it was beautiful there. <br> <br> Then all of a sudden my left hemisphere comes back online and it says
                          to me, "Hey! we got a problem, we got a problem, we gotta get some
                          help." So it's like, OK, OK, I got a problem, but then I immediately
                          drifted right back out into the consciousness, and I affectionately
                          referred to this space as La La Land. But it was beautiful there.
                          Imagine what it would be like to be totally disconnected from your
                          brain chatter that connects you to the external world. So here I am in
                          this space and any stress related to my, to my job, it was gone. And I
                          felt lighter in my body. And imagine all of the relationships in the
                          external world and the many stressors related to any of those, they
                          were gone. I felt a sense of peacefulness. And imagine what it would
                          feel like to lose 37 years of emotional baggage! I felt euphoria.
                          Euphoria was beautiful -- and then my left hemisphere comes online and
                          it says "Hey! you've got to pay attention, we've got to get help," and
                          I'm thinking, "I got to get help, I gotta focus." So I get out of the
                          shower and I mechanically dress and I'm walking around my apartment,
                          and I'm thinking, "I gotta get to work, I gotta get to work, can I
                          drive? can I drive?"
                          <br> <br>And in that moment my right arm went totally paralyzed by my side.
                          And I realized, "Oh my gosh! I'm having a stroke! I'm having a stroke!"
                          And the next thing my brain says to me is, "Wow! This is so cool. This
                          is so cool. How many brain scientists have the opportunity to study
                          their own brain from the inside out?"
                          <br> <br>And then it crosses my mind: "But I'm a very busy woman. I don't
                          have time for a stroke!" So I'm like, "OK, I can't stop the stroke from
                          happening so I'll do this for a week or two, and then I'll get back to
                          my routine, OK."
                          <br> <br>So I gotta call help, I gotta call work. I couldn't remember the
                          number at work, so I remembered, in my office I had a business card
                          with my number on it. So I go in my business room, I pull out a 3-inch
                          stack of business cards. And I'm looking at the card on top, and even
                          though I could see clearly in my mind's eye what my business card
                          looked like, I couldn't tell if this was my card or not, because all I
                          could see were pixels. And the pixels of the words blended with the
                          pixels of the background and the pixels of the symbols, and I just
                          couldn't tell. And I would wait for what I call a wave of clarity. And
                          in that moment, I would be able to reattach to normal reality and I
                          could tell, that's not the card, that's not the card, that's not the
                          card. It took me 45 minutes to get one inch down inside of that stack
                          of cards. <br> <br> In the meantime, for 45 minutes the hemorrhage is getting bigger in my
                          left hemisphere. I do not understand numbers, I do not understand the
                          telephone, but it's the only plan I have. So I take the phone pad and I
                          put it right here, I'd take the business card, I'd put it right here,
                          and I'm matching the shape of the squiggles on the card to the shape of
                          the squiggles on the phone pad. But then I would drift back out into La
                          La Land, and not remember when I come back if I'd already dialed those
                          numbers.
                          <br> <br>So I had to wield my paralyzed arm like a stump, and cover the
                          numbers as I went along and pushed them, so that as I would come back
                          to normal reality I'd be able to tell, yes, I've already dialed that
                          number. Eventually the whole number gets dialed, and I'm listening to
                          the phone, and my colleague picks up the phone and he says to me, "Whoo
                          woo wooo woo woo." [laughter] And I think to myself, "Oh my gosh, he
                          sounds like a golden retriever!" And so I say to him, clear in my mind
                          I say to him. "This is Jill! I need help!" And what comes out of my
                          voice is, "Whoo woo wooo woo woo." I'm thinking, "Oh my gosh, I sound
                          like a golden retriever." So I couldn't know, I didn't know that I
                          couldn't speak or understand language until I tried.
                          <br> <br>So he recognizes that I need help, and he gets me help. And a
                          little while later, I am riding in an ambulance from one hospital
                          across Boston to Mass General Hospital. And I curl up into a little
                          fetal ball. And just like a balloon with the last bit of air just, just
                          right out of the balloon I felt my energy lift and I felt my spirit
                          surrender. And in that moment I knew that I was no longer the
                          choreographer of my life. And either the doctors rescue my body and
                          give me a second chance at life or this was perhaps my moment of
                          transition. <br> <br> When I awoke later that afternoon I was shocked to discover that I was
                          still alive. When I felt my spirit surrender, I said goodbye to my
                          life, and my mind is now suspended between two very opposite planes of
                          reality. Stimulation coming in through my sensory systems felt like
                          pure pain. Light burned my brain like wildfire and sounds were so loud
                          and chaotic that I could not pick a voice out from the background noise
                          and I just wanted to escape. Because I could not identify the position
                          of my body in space, I felt enormous and expensive, like a genie just
                          liberated from her bottle. And my spirit soared free like a great whale
                          gliding through the sea of silent euphoria. Harmonic. I remember
                          thinking there's no way I would ever be able to squeeze the
                          enormousness of myself back inside this tiny little body. <br> <br> But I realized "But I'm still alive! I'm still alive and I have found
                          Nirvana. And if I have found Nirvana and I'm still alive, then everyone
                          who is alive can find Nirvana." I picture a world filled with
                          beautiful, peaceful, compassionate, loving people who knew that they
                          could come to this space at any time. And that they could purposely
                          choose to step to the right of their left hemispheres and find this
                          peace. And then I realized what a tremendous gift this experience could
                          be, what a stroke of insight this could be to how we live our lives.
                          And it motivated my to recover. <br> <br> Two and a half weeks after the hemorrhage, the surgeons went in and
                          they removed a blood clot the size of a golf ball that was pushing on
                          my language centers. Here I am with my mama, who's a true angel in my
                          life. It took me eight years to completely recover. <br> <br> So who are we? We are the life force power of the universe, with manual
                          dexterity and two cognitive minds. And we have the power to choose,
                          moment by moment, who and how we want to be in the world. Right here
                          right now, I can step into the consciousness of my right hemisphere
                          where we are -- I am -- the life force power of the universe, and the
                          life force power of the 50 trillion beautiful molecular geniuses that
                          make up my form. At one with all that is. Or I can choose to step into
                          the consciousness of my left hemisphere. where I become a single
                          individual, a solid, separate from the flow, separate from you. I am
                          Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor, intellectual, neuroanatomist. These are the "we"
                          inside of me.
                          <br> <br>Which would you choose? Which do you choose? And when? I believe
                          that the more time we spend choosing to run the deep inner peace
                          circuitry of our right hemispheres, the more peace we will project into
                          the world and the more peaceful our planet will be. And I thought that
                          was an idea worth spreading.</p>

              <p>There is no inner self, nor outer self, nor in between. Buddha did not teach an inner Atman, he teach Anatta -- No Atman. No-Self. Consciousness is not a Self, not an entity, but a process that is conditioned arising. I can go into that further if you wish.</p>
              <p>The idea of an Atman (Self) as taught by Hinduism that is the Soul, which is not the body or mind but the notion of a permanent inner "core" that is the true "essence" of a being, who is the experiencer and controller of his life, which transmigrates from lifetime to lifetime and inhabits different bodies upon reincarnation, is <strong>refuted</strong> by Buddha, who taught in the essential teachings of Anatta that there is no inner core -- no soul or a Self at all. Enlightenment is realising the emptiness of both self and phenomena.</p>
              <p>'Ji shen cheng fo' is a Tibetan saying, not Zen. But all traditions agree to the extent that it is possible to attain realisation (of ultimate reality) or enlightenment in this lifetime, this is the meaning of "attaining enlightenment in this body". This statement has nothing with finding an "inner self". No "inner self" can be found -- when you reach realisation/enlightenment, you'll see that there is no separate, permanent, identifiable 'self'.</p>
              <p>Then what is the "True Self" that some people talk about? "True Self" is neither inner nor outer -- it is the empty-cognizant quality that pervades all our experience. When we experience a thought, or a sight, or a sound, or a smell, or a touch, or a taste, whatever it is that we experience, is a manifestation of Buddha-nature (i.e. True Self) which has the quality of cognizance/awareness while at the same time Empty of any fixed inherent existence. Whatever we experience is empty while at the same time the appearance of our perceiving nature.</p>
              <p>"True Self" is actually NO self -- the true nature of self when realised is found to be Empty, and at the same time Cognizant, Aware, manifesting as all appearances. So our true nature, true self, is actually luminous-emptiness. We realise that this True Self, Buddha-nature, has no inner-outer separation, is empty and has no center nor circumference, and is infinite/boundless and all-pervading. It is not a thing (empty!), much less an eternal Self -- and is inseparable from the transience of all our experience. All our experiences, the sound of bird chirping, sceneries, all are One Taste, all are the manifestation of our true nature, empty-cognizance/awareness.</p>

              <h4>What Is The "Me"?</h4>
              <p><em>The following article was adapted from a talk by Toni Packer on Day 4 of the August 1997 retreat.</em></p>
              <p>A somber day, isn't it? Dark, cloudy, cool, moist and
              windy. Amazing, this whole affair of "the weather!"
              We call it "weather," but what is it really? Wind. Rain.
              Clouds slowly parting. Not the words spoken about it, but just
              this darkening, blowing, pounding, wetting, and then lightening
              up, blue sky appearing amidst darkness, and sunshine sparkling
              on wet grasses and leaves. In a little while there'll be frost,
              snow and ice-covers. And then warming again, melting, oozing water
              everywhere. On an early 
              spring day the dirt road sparkles with streams of wet silver.
              So — what is "weather"  other than this incessant change
              of earthly conditions and all the human thoughts, feelings, and
              undertakings influenced by it? Like and dislike. Depression and
              elation. Creation and destruction. An ongoing, ever changing stream
              of happenings abiding nowhere. No entity "weather" to
              be found except in thinking and talking 
              about it.</p>
              <p>Now — is there such an entity as "me,"
              "I," "myself?" 
              Or is it just like the "weather" — an ongoing, ever
              changing stream of ideas, images, memories, projections, likes
              and dislikes, creations and destructions, which thought keeps
              calling "I," "me," "Toni," and thereby
              solidifying what is evanescent? What am I really, truly, and what
              do I think and believe I am? Are we interested in exploring this
              amazing affair of "myself" from moment to moment? Is
              this, maybe, the essence of retreat work? Exploring ourselves
              minutely beyond the peace and quiet that we are seeking and maybe
              finding. Coming upon clarity about this deep sense of separation
              which we call "me," and "other people," without
              any need to condemn or overcome.</p>
              <p>Most human beings take it totally for granted that
              I am "me," and that "me" is this body, this
              mind, this knowledge and sense about myself which so obviously
              feels separate from other people. The language in which we talk
              to ourselves and to each other inevitably implies separate "me's,"
              and "you's" all the time. All of us talk "I" and "you"
              talk, we think it, write it, read it, and dream it with rarely
              any pause. There is incessant reinforcement of the sense 
              of "I," "me," separate from others. Isolated.
              Insulated. Not understood. How is one to come upon the truth if
              separation is taken so much for granted, feels so common sense?</p>
              <p>The difficulty is not insurmountable. Wholeness,
              true 
              being, is here all the time, like the sun behind the clouds. Daylight
              is here in spite of cloud cover.</p>
              <p>What makes up the clouds?</p>
              <p>Can we begin to realize that we live in conceptual,
              abstract ideas about ourselves? That we are rarely directly in
              touch with what actually is going on? Can we realize that thoughts
              about myself — I am good or bad, I'm liked or disliked — are nothing
              but thoughts — and that thoughts do not tell us the truth about
              what we really are? A thought is a thought, and it triggers instant
              physical reactions, pleasures and pains throughout the bodymind.
              Physical reactions generate further thoughts and feelings about
              myself — "I'm suffering," "I'm happy," "I'm
              no good." Feedback that implies that all this is me, that
              I have gotten hurt, or somehow feel good about myself, or that
              I need to defend myself, or get more approval and love from others.
              When we're protecting ourselves in our daily interrelationships
              we're not protecting ourselves from flying stones or bomb attacks.
              It's from words we're taking cover, from gestures, from colorations
              of voice and innuendo.</p>
              <p>Just now words were spoken, ". . . we're protecting
              ourselves,  . . . we're taking cover." In using our common
              language the implication is constantly created that there is someone
              real who is protecting and someone real that needs protection.</p>
              <p>Is there someone real to be protected from words
              and gestures, or are we merely living in ideas and stories about
              me and you, all of it happening on the stage of the on-going audio/video
              drama of ourselves?</p>
              <p>The utmost care and attention is needed to follow
              the internal drama fairly accurately, dispassionately, in order
              to express it as it is seen. What we mean by "being made
              to feel good" or "being hurt" is the internal enhancing
              of our ongoing me-story, or the puncturing and deflating of it.
              Enhancement or disturbance of the me-story is accompanied 
              by pleasurable energies or painful feelings and emotions throughout
              the organism. Either warmth or chill can be felt at the drop of
              a word evoking memories, feelings, passions. Conscious or unconscious
              emotional recollection of what happened yesterday or a long ago
              surge through the body-mind, causing feelings of happiness or
              sadness, affection or humiliation.</p>
              <p>Right now words are being spoken, and they can be
              followed literally, intellectually. If they are fairly clearly
              and logically put together they can make sense intellectually.
              Perhaps at first it's necessary to understand what is going 
              on in us intellectually. But that's not the whole thing. The words
              that are spoken point to something that may be directly seen and
              felt, inwardly, as the talk proceeds. And as we go along from
              moment to moment, now and after the talk is over, (and after retreat)
              can we experience freshly, wakefully, directly, when hurt or flattery
              are taking place? What 
              is happening? What is being hurt? And what keeps the hurt going?
              Can there be some awareness of defenses arising, fear and anger
              forming, or withdrawal taking place, all accompanied by some kind
              of storyline? Can the whole drama become increasingly transparent?
              And, in becoming increasingly transparent, can it be thoroughly
              questioned? What is it that is being protected? What is it that
              one thinks got hurt? Me? What is me?</p>
              <p>It is amazing. A spark of awareness witnessing one
              spoken word arousing pleasure or pain all over. Can the connection
              become clear? The immediacy of it, and no 
              I-entity there directing it, even though we say and believe we
              are doing all that. But we also say that we don't want to do that.
              Words and reaction proceed along well-oiled pathways and interconnections.
              A thought of loss comes up and the solar plexus tightens in pain.
              Fantasy of love-making occurs and an ocean of pleasure ensues.
              Who does it? Thought says, "I do!" To whom is it happening?
              Thought says, "To me of course!" But, where and what
              is this I, this me, aside from all the thoughts and feelings,
              the palpitating heart, painful and pleasurable energies circulating
              throughout the organism? Who could possibly be doing it all with
              such amazing speed and precision? Thinking about ourselves and
              triggering physiological reactions take time, but present awareness
              brings the whole drama to light instantly. Everything is happening
              on its own. No one is directing the show!</p>
              <p>Right this moment wind is storming, branches are
              creaking and leaves quivering. It's all here in the listening — but whose 
              listening is it? Mine? Yours? We say, "I'm listening"
              or, "I cannot listen as well as you do" and these words
              befuddle the mind with feelings and emotions learned long ago.
              You may be protesting that "my hearing isn't yours. Your
              body isn't mine." We have thought like that for eons and
              behave accordingly, but presently, can there be just the sound
              of swaying trees and rustling leaves and fresh air blowing through
              the window cooling the skin? It's not happening to anyone. It's
              simply present for all of us, isn't it?</p>
              <p>Do I sound as though I'm trying to convince you
              of something? The passion arising in trying to communicate simply,
              clearly, may be misunderstood for a desire to influence people.
              That's not the case. There is just the description of what is
              happening here for all of us. Nothing to be sold or bought. Can
              we simply listen and test out on our own what is being offered
              for exploration from moment to moment?</p>
              <p>What is the "me" that gets hurt or attracted,
              flattered, time and time again, the world over? In psychological
              terms we say that we are identified with ourselves. In spiritual
              language we say, that we are attached to ourselves. What is this
              "ourselves?" Is it feeling myself existing, knowing
              what I am, having lots of recollections about myself — all the
              ideas and pictures and feelings about myself strung together in
              a coherent story? And knowing this story very well — multitudes
              of memories, some added, some dropped, all inter-connected — what
              I am, how I look, what my abilities and disabilities are, my education,
              my family, my name, my likes and dislikes, opinions, beliefs,
              etc., etc. The identification with all of that, meaning, "This
              is what I am." And the attachment to it, meaning, "I can't let go of it."</p>
              <p>Let's go beyond concepts and look directly into
              what we mean by them. If one says, "I'm identified with my
              family name," what does that mean? Let me give an example.
              As a growing child I was very much identified with my last name because
              it was my father's and he was famous — so I was told. I liked
              to tell others about my father's scientific achievements to garner
              respect and pleasurable feelings for myself by impressing friends.
              I felt admiration through other people's eyes which may not even
              have been there. It may have been projected. Perhaps some people
              even felt, "What a bore she is!" On the entrance door to our apartment there
              was a little polished brass sign with my father's name on it and
              his titles: Professor, Doctor Phil. The Phil impressed me particularly,
              because I thought it meant that my father was a philosopher, which
              he was not. I must have had the idea that a philosopher was a
              particularly imposing individual. So I told some of my friends
              about it and brought them to look at the little brass sign at
              the door. This is one meaning of identification — enhancing one's
              sense of self by incorporating the ideas about other individuals
              or groups, or one's possessions, achievements, transgressions 
              —  anything — and feeling that all of this is "me." Feeling
              important about oneself generates amazing, addictive energies.</p>
              <p>To give another example from the past: I became very
              identified with my half-Jewish descent. Not openly in Germany,
              where I mostly tried to hide it rather than display it, but later
              on after the war ended, telling people of our family's fate, and
              finding welcome attention, instant sympathy, and nourishing interest
              in the story. One can become quite addicted to making the story of one's life impressive
              to others and to oneself, and feed on the energies aroused by
              that. So that's a bit of what identification and attachment are
              about. And when that is disturbed by someone not buying into it,
              contesting it or questioning it altogether, there is sudden insecurity,
              physical discomfort, anger, fear, hurt, whatever.</p>
              <p>Becoming a member of the Zen Center and engaging
              in spiritual practice, I realized one day that I had not been
              talking about my background in a long while. And now, when somebody
              brings it up — sometimes an interviewer will ask me to talk about
              it — it feels like so much bother and effort. Why delve into old
              stuff? I want to talk about listening, the wind, and the birds.
              [Laughter] Are you listening too, interviewer? Or are you more
              interested in identities and stories?</p>
              <p>At times people bring up the question about why
              I don't call myself a teacher when I'm so obviously engaged in
              teaching. Somebody actually brought it up this morning — the projections
              and mental as well as psychological associations aroused in waiting
              outside the meeting room and then entering nervously with a pounding
              heart. The images of teacher and student offering themselves automatically
              like clothes to put on and roles to play in these clothes. In
              giving talks and meeting with people the student-teacher imagery
              is not there — it belongs to a different level of existence. If
              images do come up they're in the way like clouds hiding the sun.
              Relating without images is the freshest, freest thing in the universe.</p>
              <p>So, what am I and what are you — what are we with-
              out images clothing and hiding our true being? It's un-image-inable,
              isn't it? And yet there's the sound of wind blowing, trees shaking,
              crows cawing, woodwork creaking, breath flowing without need for
              any thoughts. Thoughts are grafted on top of what's actually going
              on right now, and in that grafted world we happen to spend most
              of our lives.</p>
              <p>And yet, every once in a while, whether one does spiritual
              work or not, meditating or not, the real world shines wondrously
              through everything. What is it when words fall silent? When there
              is no knowing? When there is no listener and yet there is listening,
              awaring, without any separation?</p>
              <p>A moment during a visit with my parents in Switzerland
              comes to mind. I had always had a difficult relationship with
              my mother. I was very afraid of her. She was a very passionate
              woman with lots of anger. But also love. Once during that visit
              I saw her standing in the dining room facing me. She was just
              standing there, and for no known reason or cause I suddenly saw
              her without the past. There was no image of her, and also no idea
              of what she saw in me. All that was gone. There was nothing left
              except pure love for this woman. Such beauty shone out of her.
              And our relationship changed, there was a new closeness. It just
              happened.</p>
              <p>Someone said that seeing a shattered image caused
              grief. But the shattering of self-image need not cause suffering.
              Truly seeing that the "me" is nothing but a habitual
              mental construct is freeing beyond imagination.</p>

              <p>There is no inner self, nor outer self, nor in between. Buddha did not teach an inner Atman, he teach Anatta -- No Atman. No-Self. Consciousness is not a Self, not an entity, but a process that is conditioned arising. I can go into that further if you wish.</p>
              <p>The idea of an Atman (Self) as taught by Hinduism that is the Soul, which is not the body or mind but the notion of a permanent inner "core" that is the true "essence" of a being, who is the experiencer and controller of his life, which transmigrates from lifetime to lifetime and inhabits different bodies upon reincarnation, is <strong>refuted</strong> by Buddha, who taught in the essential teachings of Anatta that there is no inner core -- no soul or a Self at all. Enlightenment is realising the emptiness of both self and phenomena.</p>
              <p>'Ji shen cheng fo' is a Tibetan saying, not Zen. But all traditions agree to the extent that it is possible to attain realisation (of ultimate reality) or enlightenment in this lifetime, this is the meaning of "attaining enlightenment in this body".

No "inner self" can be found -- when you reach realisation/enlightenment, you'll see that there is no separate, permanent, identifiable 'self'.</p>
              <p>Then what is the "True Self" that some people talk about? "True Self" is neither inner nor outer -- it is the empty-cognizant quality that pervades all our experience. When we experience a thought, or a sight, or a sound, or a smell, or a touch, or a taste, whatever it is that we experience, is a manifestation of Buddha-nature (i.e. True Self) which has the quality of cognizance/awareness while at the same time Empty of any fixed inherent existence. Whatever we experience is empty while at the same time the appearance of our perceiving nature.</p>
              <p>"True Self" is actually NO self -- the true nature of self when realised is found to be Empty, and at the same time Cognizant, Aware, manifesting as all appearances. So our true nature, true self, is actually luminous-emptiness. We realise that this True Self, Buddha-nature, has no inner-outer separation, is empty and has no center nor circumference, and is infinite/boundless and all-pervading. It is not a thing (empty!), much less an eternal Self -- and is inseparable from the transience of all our experience. All our experiences, the sound of bird chirping, sceneries, all are One Taste, all are the manifestation of our true nature, empty-cognizance/awareness.</p>

              <p>'Ji shen cheng fo' means attaining Buddhahood in one lifetime. This concept is only to be found in Vajrayana/Tibetan Buddhism, Zen Master Hui Neng never said "ji sheng cheng fo". Tibetan Buddhism stresses it is the highest vehicle because it can allow the practitioner to attain full Buddhahood in this lifetime. This is not at all a concept absorbed from Zen, because Zen never taught attaining full Buddhahood in this lifetime -- it taught that our Mind's essence can be realised instantaneously, which is not the same as attaining full Buddhahood. The concept of Ji Shen Cheng Fo is found in all the ancient Tibetan tantras/scriptures.</p>
              <p>I have no comments about the validity of 'Ji Sheng Cheng Fo' and how it can be achieved, since I am not a Vajrayana practitioner. I practice more of Chinese Mahayana. BTW just wondering you're Singaporean?</p>
              <p>"Dun4 Wu4" means instantaneous awakening, but it is different from the notion of attaining full Buddhahood like Shakyamuni -- it is more like waking up to our original Buddha-nature, but this does not yet mean that we have attained full Buddhahood. Even a glimpse or awakening to our Buddha-Nature, one still has to practice a long time of purification, transformation, practicing the Bodhisattva path, and developing further insights and clarity before full Buddhahood can be achieved. If you realise Buddha-nature, you attain to the 1st Bhumi of the Bodhisattva path. There are 10 bhumis.</p>
              <p>Also, I think you misunderstood what Hinduism is. Hinduism is not Buddhism -- Hinduism is å�°åº¦æ•™ -- the religion practiced in India now. It is the 3rd largest most populous religion in the world, after Christianity and Islam. Buddhism is the 4th.</p>
              <p>It is Hinduism that teaches the notion of a inner Soul or eternal Self. This is Eternalism (å¸¸è§�), and this is refuted as a false view by Buddha. Buddha teach No-Self, and the middle way beyond eternalism (å¸¸è§�) and nihlism (æ–­è§�).</p>

              <p>I see. Yes, it is taught that Mind is Buddha -- Mind as in our mind essence. But not to mistake "mind" as a self -- in fact when you read Shurangama sutra, Buddha asked Ananda where is mind? Ananda gave a whole list of speculation, but at each time the Buddha denied him. In another case, 1st Ch'an master Bodhidharma asked Shen Hsiu to give him his mind. He could not find it either, and was awakened.</p>
              <p>The eventual conclusion of the chapter in Shurangama Sutra is that Mind has no location -- the Mind is EMPTY! But at the same time it has quality of Awareness -- and all our experiences are only manifestation of Mind-essence! This empty-awareness is the nature of Mind. Since it is empty, it is not a self and it is not eternal. There is also no separation between Mind and all perceived phenomena -- all appearances are Mind-only. All of them are expression of Buddha Nature, there is no perceiver apart from the perceived -- observer is the observed. Hence, there is no inner and outer.</p>
              <p>Regarding Hinduism and Upanishads, Hinduism has similarities with Buddhism, but there is a very fundamental difference -- the Hindus who experienced Mind's cognisance/luminous awareness mistakes his experience and treats it as a real ultimate Self/Soul/Atman. The experience objectified is thought to be Self, Eternal, and the ultimate Subject.. the ultimate Witness/Seer/Observer. Hence they cannot penetrate the Mind's essence.</p>
              <p>They did not realise it's emptiness, and they cannot comprehend No-Self. They did not realise that Observer is the Observed, awareness is simply a knowingness not separated from the flow of manifestation... it is not an eternal subject separated. Because of their karmic propensities of perceiving their experience in a dualistic framework (perceiving in terms of Subject and Object), awareness is treated to be the eternal Self, watching the transient flow of phenomena, which is duality -- (there are two components here -- "watcher" and "phenomena").</p>
              <p>They have only experienced the relative nature of mind, but not the ultimate nature of mind. And the experience is then misunderstood. My friend Thusness would tell me æ˜Žå¿ƒ does not really mean è§�æ€§ and I agree.</p>

              <p>They have only experienced the relative nature of mind, but not the ultimate nature of mind. And the experience is then misunderstood. My friend Thusness would tell me æ˜Žå¿ƒ does not really mean è§�æ€§ and I agree.</p>

              <p><br>What an honor it has been to be chosen as one of TIME Magazine's 100 Most Influential in the World for 2008!<br><br>This all came about because I was invited to give an 18-minute presentation at the <a href="http://www.ted.com/">TED</a> conference in Monterey, CA on February 27, 2008. TED stands for Technology, Entertainment,
              Design - three wide-ranging subject areas that are, collectively,
              shaping our future. Every year, 1300 of the world's leading thinkers
              and doers gather together for four days of networking, education and
              exposure to new ideas. Past speakers and performers have included Bill
              Clinton, Bill Gates, Paul Simon, Richard Branson, Frank Gehry, Philippe
              Starck, James Watson, Billy Graham, Jane Goodall, Al Gore, and Bono.
              However, TED is about much more than famous names. It is about passion,
              laughter, beauty, and ingenuity. It is about ideas capable of changing
              the world, and I was given 18 minutes to share my personal story and an
              idea that I believed was worth spreading. My experience at TED was both
              phenomenal and life transforming. See for yourself by visiting <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/229">www.TED.com</a>.<br></p>

              <p>Well, so far I have never had the experience of encountering painfulness for long hours during meditation. But I think what is important is to let go of all mental resistance and relax in a state of mindfulness. Be aware of the sensations but not to be attached to the sensations. Of course, also see a doctor, take your medicine or apply whatever things that eases the pain.</p>
              <p>I think the following excerpts by Ven Gunaratana (btw did you read his book Mindfulness in Plain English? I think its a good read) might be helpful, and it beautifully described the possibility to be "nondual" with sensations of pain and thus freedom from pain:</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe10.html">http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe10.html</a></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;"><strong>Problem 
                                        1<br> Physical Pain </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> Nobody likes pain, yet everybody has some sometime. It is one 
                                        of life's most common experiences and is bound to arise in your 
                                        meditation in one form or another. Handling pain is a two-stage 
                                        process. First, get rid of the pain if possible or at least 
                                        get rid of it as much as possible. Then, if some pain lingers, 
                                        use it as an abject of meditation. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> The first step is physical handling. Maybe the pain is an illness 
                                        of one sort or another, a headache, fever, bruises or whatever. 
                                        In this case, employ standard medical treatments before you 
                                        sit down to meditate: take your medicine, apply your liniment, 
                                        do whatever you ordinarily do. Then there are certain pains 
                                        that are specific to the seated posture. If you never spend 
                                        much time sitting cross-legged on the floor, there will be an 
                                        adjustment period. Some discomfort is nearly inevitable. According 
                                        to where the pain is, there are specific remedies. If the pain 
                                        is in the leg or knees, check you pants. If they are tight or 
                                        made of thick material, that could be the problem. Try to change 
                                        it. Check your cushion, too. It should be about three inches 
                                        in height when compressed. If the pain is around your waist, 
                                        try loosening your belt. Loosen the waistband of your pants 
                                        is that is necessary. If you experience pain in your lower back, 
                                        your posture is probably at fault. Slouching will never be comfortable, 
                                        so straighten up. Don't be tight or rigid, but do keep your 
                                        spine erect. Pain in the neck or upper back has several sources. 
                                        The first is improper hand position. Your hands should be resting 
                                        comfortably in your lap. Don't pull them up to your waist. Relax 
                                        your arms and your neck muscles. Don't let your head droop forward. 
                                        Keep it up and aligned with the rest of the spine. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> After you have made all these various adjustments, you may find 
                                        you still have some lingering pain. If that is the case, try 
                                        step two. Make the pain your object of meditation. Don't jump 
                                        up and down and get excited. Just observe the pain mindfully. 
                                        When the pain becomes demanding, you will find it pulling your 
                                        attention off the breath. Don't fight back. Just let your attention 
                                        slide easily over onto the simple sensation. Go into the pain 
                                        fully. Don't block the experience. Explore the feeling. Get 
                                        beyond your avoiding reaction and go into the pure sensations 
                                        that lie below that. You will discover that there are two things 
                                        present. The first is the simple sensation--pain itself. Second 
                                        is your resistance to that sensation. Resistance reaction is 
                                        partly mental and partly physical. The physical part consists 
                                        of tensing the muscles in and around the painful area. Relax 
                                        those muscles. Take them one by one and relax each one very 
                                        thoroughly. This step alone probably diminishes the pain significantly. 
                                        Then go after the mental side of the resistance. Just as you 
                                        are tensing physically, you are also tensing psychologically. 
                                        You are clamping down mentally on the sensation of pain, trying 
                                        to screen it off and reject it from consciousness. The rejection 
                                        is a wordless, "I don't like this feeling" or "go away" attitude. 
                                        It is very subtle. But it is there, and you can find it if you 
                                        really look. Locate it and relax that, too. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> That last part is more subtle. There are really no human words 
                                        to describe this action precisely. The best way to get a handle 
                                        on it is by analogy. Examine what you did to those tight muscles 
                                        and transfer that same action over to the mental sphere; relax 
                                        the mind in the same way that you relax the body. Buddhism recognizes 
                                        that the body and mind are tightly linked. This is so true that 
                                        many people will not see this as a two-step procedure. For them 
                                        to relax the body is to relax the mind and vice versa. These 
                                        people will experience the entire relaxation, mental and physical, 
                                        as a single process.<strong> In any case, just let go completely till 
                                        you awareness slows down past that barrier which you yourself 
                                        erected. It was a gap, a sense of distance between self and 
                                        others. It was a borderline between 'me' and 'the pain'. Dissolve 
                                        that barrier, and separation vanishes. You slow down into that 
                                        sea of surging sensation and you merge with the pain. You become 
                                        the pain. You watch its ebb and flow and something surprising 
                                        happens. It no longer hurts. Suffering is gone. Only the pain 
                                        remains, an experience, nothing more. The 'me' who was being 
                                        hurt has gone. The result is freedom from pain.</strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> This is an incremental process. In the beginning, you can expect 
                                        to succeed with small pains and be defeated by big ones. Like 
                                        most of our skills, it grows with practice. The more you practice, 
                                        the bigger the pain you can handle. Please understand fully. 
                                        There is no masochism being advocated here. Self- mortification 
                                        is not the point. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> This is an exercise in awareness, not in sadism. If the pain 
                                        becomes excruciating, go ahead and move, but move slowly and 
                                        mindfully. Observe your movements. See how it feels to move. 
                                        Watch what it does to the pain. Watch the pain diminish. Try 
                                        not to move too much though. The less you move, the easier it 
                                        is to remain fully mindful. New meditators sometimes say they 
                                        have trouble remaining mindful when pain is present. This difficulty 
                                        stems from a misunderstanding. These students are conceiving 
                                        mindfulness as something distinct from the experience of pain. 
                                        It is not. Mindfulness never exists by itself. It always has 
                                        some object and one object is as good as another. Pain is a 
                                        mental state. You can be mindful of pain just as you are mindful 
                                        of breathing. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> The rules we covered in Chapter 4 apply to pain just as they 
                                        apply to any other mental state. You must be careful not to 
                                        reach beyond the sensation and not to fall short of it. Don't 
                                        add anything to it, and don't miss any part of it. Don't muddy 
                                        the pure experience with concepts or pictures or discursive 
                                        thinking. And keep your awareness right in the present time, 
                                        right with the pain, so that you won't miss its beginning or 
                                        its end. Pain not viewed in the clear light of mindfulness gives 
                                        rise to emotional reactions like fear, anxiety, or anger. If 
                                        it is properly viewed, we have no such reaction. It will be 
                                        just sensation, just simple energy. Once you have learned this 
                                        technique with physical pain, you can then generalize it in 
                                        the rest of your life. You can use it on any unpleasant sensation. 
                                        What works on pain will work on anxiety or chronic depression. 
                                        This technique is one of life's most useful and generalizable 
                                        skills. It is patience. </span></p>
