              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";' lang="EN-SG">Have you ever had
                      the experience of fully appreciating a piece of music to the point that instead
                      of 'hearing' the music, you actually 'Became' the music? It's like your sense
                      of self or personality temporarily dissolves and instead of hearing the music,
                      you are the music as it plays?</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";' lang="EN-SG">Or perhaps seeing
                      a tree.. or anything... and becoming merged with the seeing or the tree such
                      that you could feel the 'existence' of the tree itself, but there is nobody
                      there seeing it... you are not there seeing the tree, you ARE the tree, you ARE
                      the seeing/seen.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";' lang="EN-SG">Well I had such
                      experiences years ago but recently I had more intense experiences of such....</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";' lang="EN-SG">Some days back I
                      was contemplating on death. What I mean is I'm pondering on 'How does it feel
                      like to die or be dead?'... Then I 'pretended' to die... and suddenly, it feels
                      like "I" completely died and disappeared.. But instead of losing
                      consciousness, awareness turns out to be everything I see and felt, the whole
                      world is there, except without a "me". It's like the pure existence
                      of the world but without a center or a "me" in it. However a short
                      moment later the karmic propensity of perceiving a "separate self"
                      comes back like an entity in the head and 'I' 'lost' the experience... This is
                      described very precisely by Thusness in his earlier stages of experiences, <em>"The rest of the journey is the
                      unfolding and further refining of this experience of Total Presence but somehow
                      there is always this blockage, this ‘something’ preventing me from recapturing
                      the experience. It is the inability to fully ‘die’ into total Presence..."</em> and <em>"Somehow something is blocking
                      the natural flow of my innermost essence and preventing me from re-living the
                      experience. Presence is still there but there is no sense of ‘totality’. It was
                      both logically and intuitively clear that ‘I’ is the problem. It is the ‘I’
                      that is blocking; it is the ‘I’ that is the limit; it is the ‘I’ that is the
                      boundary but why can’t I do away with it?"</em></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";' lang="EN-SG">Anyway I learnt from
                      this that 'death' is not as scary as we might think and in fact is quite
                      blissful.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";' lang="EN-SG">Then a few days
                      later a similar experience came but was much more intense... it feels as though
                      I'm entering into a different state of consciousness... and my body and mind is
                      like totally dissolving and fading away... and I'm 'forcefully' absorbed into
                      what I am seeing and hearing and feeling... it feels strange and I don't know
                      how to describe it. There is sort of a shift in consciousness like entering an
                      altered state but yet it is not a trance. There is complete awareness or
                      consciousness but the "self" or "center" dissolves and
                      fades out of existence. What remains is everything as consciousness. Actually
                      it's not even "consciousness" that we might think of or
                      "consciousness" in the Buddhist sense because this "consciousness"
                      is not "consciousness conscious OF something"... rather it feels like
                      pure existence itself… the "Pure Beingness", yet not limited to the
                      sense of "Beingness" or "Amness" (which I had past glimpses
                      of what it is like, the impersonal pure sense of existence or consciousness)
                      but rather it is the "pure existence" of the seeing and hearing, i.e.
                      of the "world".</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";' lang="EN-SG">It feels very
                      different from our normal way of perceiving things but at the same time it's
                      pretty much the same. What I mean is the things that are seen or heard are still pretty
                      much the same as before but the experience contrasts with our normal (or
                      abnormal) way of perceiving things "at a distance" and "with a
                      self" and also with a lack of clarity. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";' lang="EN-SG">This time the
                      experience is longer but still I 'went back to normal' after some time. Also,
                      it appears that I 'time travelled' during my meditation... I sat one hour,
                      second half hour passed by like less than a few minutes... its as if I did not
                      perceive the change in time.. sort of timeless? I only knew how long has past
                      after looking at the clock.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";' lang="EN-SG">Anyone had such
                      experiences to share?</span></p>

                  was reading a very relevant passage from the book "Nonduality" by
                  David Loy, a qualified Zen teacher and academic:</span></p>
              <p><em><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";' lang="EN-SG">...music heard
                  so deeply, That it is not heard at all, but you are the music, While the music
                  lasts.</span></em></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";' lang="EN-SG">-- T.S. Eliot,
                  "The Dry Salvages"</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";' lang="EN-SG">Chapter I, in a
                  discussion of nonduality in Zen, included some quotations from a contemporary
                  Japanese Zen master, Yasutani Hakaun. These were from his dokusan (private
                  interviews) with Western students. One of these statements dealt specifically
                  with the nature of hearing:</span></p>
              <p><em><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";' lang="EN-SG">There is a line
                  a famous Zen master wrote at the time he became enlightened which reads:
                  "When I heard the temple bell ring, suddenly there was no bell and no I,
                  just sound." In other words, he no longer was aware of a distinction
                  between himself, the bell, the sound, and the universe. This is the state you
                  have to reach."</span></em></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";' lang="EN-SG">Yasutani
                  elaborates on this in another dokusan with a different student.</span></p>
              <p><em><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";' lang="EN-SG">Usually when
                  you hear a bell ringing you think, consciously or unconsciously, "I am
                  hearing a bell." Three things are involved: I, a bell, and hearing. But
                  when the mind is ripe, that is, as free of discursive thoughts as a sheet of
                  pure white paper is unmarred by a blemish, there is just the sound of the bell
                  ringing. This is </span></em><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";' lang="EN-SG">Kensho<strong><em> </em></strong><em>[enlightenment or self-realization.]"</em></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";' lang="EN-SG">While such nondual
                  hearing can hardly be said to be common, neither is it confined to the
                  adherents of the nondualist Asian traditions. The lines from T.S.Eliot quoted
                  above clearly allude to a very similar experience, and other examples could be
                  cited. Eliot's is especially interesting because it refers to the medium by
                  which most nondual experiences probably occur. The experience described is
                  unmistakably nondual. Not only is there no hearer, but there is no objective
                  music that is heard. It doubtlessly records an experience that Eliot had,
                  perhaps many times, and that I suspect many people have had occasionally. One
                  literally becomes "absorbed" into the music; the sense of self that
                  is doing the hearing fades, and at the same time the music ceases to be
                  something "out there." Especially if the musical work is a familiar
                  one, we normally (and dualistically) hear each note or chord in the context of
                  the whole phrase, by remembering the previous notes and anticipating the ones
                  to come, as if the whole phrase were simultaneously present before us and we
                  "read" it from beginning to end. But this is an example of mnemic
                  savikalpa determination of the nirvikalpa sound. This changes in the nondual
                  hearing: No matter how well I may know the work, I cease to anticipate what is
                  coming and become that single note or chord which seems to dance "up and
                  down." Music is the ideal medium for nondual experience, since we listen
                  to it for enjoyment -- that is to say, we listen for no other reason or
                  intention outside itself; we do not need to assign the sounds a meaning, which
                  is to have them refer to something else. The sound need not be a sound <em>of</em> something, and without any such thought-construction we have "a pure
                  sound, a bark without its dog" (Neruda). For those of religious inclination,
                  like Eliot, such moments of nondual hearing have a spiritual or mystical
                  quality, but I suspect that for all those who have had them they are cherished
                  as a "heightening of consciousness." This is despite the fact that at
                  the time one cannot be said to be aware of oneself "enjoying" the
                  music, for then I do become aware of myself as enjoying, the nonduality of the
                  experience has already faded away into dualistic hearing and it cannot be
                  brought back by any effort of will or attention. Nondual experience cannot be
                  repeated or produced by the self because it is something that happens to the
                  self -- the sense of self evaporates temporarily. One can only create
                  conditions where this is more likely to occur (e.g., meditation), but even then
                  the expectations of such an experience will interfere with its occurrence, as
                  experienced meditators know.</span></p>

              <p>Yes AEN, you are beginning to experience what that is known in the Advaita Vedanta as ‘Atman’ except that the experiences you had did not lead to you to the wrong conclusion.  This is because the doctrine of anatta has sunk sufficiently deep in your inmost consciousness.  Although the 'teaching of anatta' helps to prevent you from landing into wrong views, the downside is it also denies you from experiencing that deep and utimate conviction, that certainty beyond doubt of your very own existence -- "I AM'.  This is a very important factor for Advaita practitioners.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The next important factor is the duration of this non-dual experience must be prolonged; long enough for you to enter into a sort of absorption that the experience becomes 'oceanic'. </p>

              <p>Yes AEN, you are beginning to experience what that is known in
              the Advaita Vedanta as ‘Atman’ except that the experiences you had
              did not lead to you to the wrong conclusion.  This is because
              the doctrine of anatta has sunk sufficiently deep in your inmost
              consciousness.  Although the 'teaching of anatta' helps to
              prevent you from landing into wrong views, the downside is it also
              denies you from experiencing that deep and utimate conviction,
              that certainty beyond doubt of your very own existence -- "I
              AM'.  This is a very important factor for Advaita
              practitioners.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The next important factor is the duration of this non-dual
              experience must be prolonged; long enough for you to enter
              into a sort of absorption that the experience becomes
              'oceanic'. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Next is to deepen ur right understanding of these experiences.
              Are you the tree or not the tree experientially?</p>

              <p>Hi, thanks for the reply! I have a few questions.</p>
              <p>You said "Although the 'teaching of anatta' helps to
              prevent you from landing into wrong views, the downside is it also
              denies you from experiencing that deep and utimate conviction,
              that certainty beyond doubt of your very own existence -- "I
              AM'."</p>
              <p>Then how about for a Buddhist, does he need to experience " that deep and utimate conviction,
              that certainty beyond doubt of your very own existence -- "I
              AM'."?</p>
              <p>And you asked "Are you the tree or not the tree experientially?" -- experientially it feels that I am the tree during nondual experience, but right now I do not feel such 'recognition' experientially.</p>
              <p>You said "Not yet.  The dissolving of 'I' and 'death' must
              include both the experience of luminosity and 'losing of
              consciousness'.  However it is not the right time now, have
              the right understanding of these experiences first. :)"</p>
              <p>Actually at first when the experience first happened I had a feeling that I am losing consciousness... but later on it appears I did not lose consciousness. But what do you actually mean by losing consciousness? Does that mean 5 senses shut off?</p>

              <p>Yes it is still important (in my opinion).  It is the experience of our luminosity.  There must be certainty of our luminosity but this luminosity is empty of an essence.  This is most difficult to understand and the purpose of insight into our emptiness and anatta nature (to me) is really just about 'effortless <span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">sustainability'.  </span></p>

                                  appreciating a piece of music to the point that instead of
                                  'hearing' the music, you actually 'Became' the music? It's like
                                  your sense of self or personality temporarily dissolves and instead
                                  of hearing the music, you are the music as it plays?</span></p>
              <p><span>Or perhaps seeing a tree.. or anything... and
                                  becoming merged with the seeing or the tree such that you could
                                  feel the 'existence' of the tree itself, but there is nobody there
                                  seeing it... you are not there seeing the tree, you ARE the tree,
                                  you ARE the seeing/seen.</span></p>
              <p><span>Well I had such experiences years ago but
                                  recently I had more intense experiences of such....</span></p>
              <p><span>Some days back I was contemplating on death. What
                                  I mean is I'm pondering on 'How does it feel like to die or be
                                  dead?'... Then I 'pretended' to die... and suddenly, it feels like
                                  "I" completely died and disappeared.. But instead of losing
                                  consciousness, awareness turns out to be everything I see and felt,
                                  the whole world is there, except without a "me". It's like the pure
                                  existence of the world but without a center or a "me" in it.
                                  However a short moment later the karmic propensity of perceiving a
                                  "separate self" comes back like an entity in the head and 'I'
                                  'lost' the experience... This is described very precisely by
                                  Thusness in his earlier stages of experiences, <em>"The rest of the
                                  journey is the unfolding and further refining of this experience of
                                  Total Presence but somehow there is always this blockage, this
                                  ‘something’ preventing me from recapturing the experience. It is
                                  the inability to fully ‘die’ into total Presence..."</em> and
                                  <em>"Somehow something is blocking the natural flow of my innermost
                                  essence and preventing me from re-living the experience. Presence
                                  is still there but there is no sense of ‘totality’. It was both
                                  logically and intuitively clear that ‘I’ is the problem. It is the
                                  ‘I’ that is blocking; it is the ‘I’ that is the limit; it is the
                                  ‘I’ that is the boundary but why can’t I do away with
                                  it?"</em></span></p>
              <p><span>Anyway I learnt from this that 'death' is not as
                                  scary as we might think and in fact is quite blissful.</span></p>
              <p><span>Then a few days later a similar experience came
                                  but was much more intense... it feels as though I'm entering into a
                                  different state of consciousness... and my body and mind is like
                                  totally dissolving and fading away... and I'm 'forcefully' absorbed
                                  into what I am seeing and hearing and feeling... it feels strange
                                  and I don't know how to describe it. There is sort of a shift in
                                  consciousness like entering an altered state but yet it is not a
                                  trance. There is complete awareness or consciousness but the "self"
                                  or "center" dissolves and fades out of existence. What remains is
                                  everything as consciousness. Actually it's not even "consciousness"
                                  that we might think of or "consciousness" in the Buddhist sense
                                  because this "consciousness" is not "consciousness conscious OF
                                  something"... rather it feels like pure existence itself… the "Pure
                                  Beingness", yet not limited to the sense of "Beingness" or "Amness"
                                  (which I had past glimpses of what it is like, the impersonal pure
                                  sense of existence or consciousness) but rather it is the "pure
                                  existence" of the seeing and hearing, i.e. of the
                                  "world".</span></p>
              <p><span>It feels very different from our normal way of
                                  perceiving things but at the same time it's pretty much the same.
                                  What I mean is the things that are seen or heard are still pretty
                                  much the same as before but the experience contrasts with our
                                  normal (or abnormal) way of perceiving things "at a distance" and
                                  "with a self" and also with a lack of clarity.</span></p>
              <p><span>This time the experience is longer but still I
                                  'went back to normal' after some time. Also, it appears that I
                                  'time travelled' during my meditation... I sat one hour, second
                                  half hour passed by like less than a few minutes... its as if I did
                                  not perceive the change in time.. sort of timeless? I only knew how
                                  long has past after looking at the clock.</span></p>
              <p><span>Anyone had such experiences to share?</span></p>
              <p><span>p.s. the forum seems unusually inactive
                                  theseadays.</span></p>

              <p>Thusness told me my experience is similar to Ramana Maharshi's (his inquiry on death, pretended to die and realised transcendental awareness)... I went to check his account and found that it is indeed somewhat similar.</p>

              <p>In 1892, Venkataraman's father Sundaram Iyer suddenly fell seriously
                          ill and unexpectedly died several days later at the age of 42. <sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramana_Maharshi#_note-9">[10]</a></sup> For some hours after his father's death, Venkataraman later said, he
                          contemplated the matter of death, and how his father's body was still
                          there, but the 'I' was gone from it.</p>
              <p>After leaving Scott's Middle School, Venkataraman went to the
                          American Mission High School. One November morning in 1895, he was on
                          his way to school when he saw an elderly relative and enquired where
                          the relative had come from. The answer was "From Arunachala."<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramana_Maharshi#_note-10">[11]</a></sup></p>
              <p>Krishna Bikshu, in Ramana Leela, describes the response in
                          Venkataraman: "The word "Arunachala" was familiar to Venkataraman from
                          his younger days, but he did not know where it was, what it looked like
                          or what it meant. Yet that day that word meant to him something great,
                          an inaccessible, authoritative, absolutely blissful entity. Could one
                          visit such a place? His heart was full of joy. Arunachala meant some
                          sacred land, every particle of which gave moksha. It was omnipotent and
                          peaceful. Could one behold it? "What? Arunachala? Where is it?" asked
                          the lad. The relative was astonished, "Don't you know even this?" and
                          continued, "Haven't you heard of Tiruvannamalai? That is Arunachala."
                          It was as if a balloon was pricked, the boy's heart sank."</p>
              <p>About a month or two later, Sri Ramana later reported, he came
                          across a copy of Sekkilar's Periyapuranam, a book that describes the
                          lives of sixty three Saivite saints, and was deeply moved and inspired
                          by it.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramana_Maharshi#_note-11">[12]</a></sup> Filled with awe, and a desire for emulation, he began devotional visits
                          to the nearby Meenakshi Temple in Madurai, and associated with this
                          bhakti, later reported fever like sensations. <sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramana_Maharshi#_note-12">[13]</a></sup></p>
              <p>Soon after, on July 17, 1896<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramana_Maharshi#_note-13">[14]</a></sup>,
                          at age sixteen, Venkataraman had a life changing experience. He
                          spontaneously initiated a process of self-enquiry that culminated,
                          within a few minutes, in his own permanent awakening. In one of his
                          rare written comments on this process he wrote: 'Enquiring within <em>Who is the seer?</em> I saw the seer disappear leaving That alone which stands forever. No thought arose to say <em>I saw</em>. How then could the thought arise to say <em>I did not see</em>.' <sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramana_Maharshi#_note-14">[15]</a></sup> As Sri Ramana reportedly described it later: "It was in 1896, about 6 weeks before I left Madurai for good (to go to <a class="mw-redirect" title="Tiruvannamalai" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiruvannamalai">Tiruvannamalai</a> - Arunachala) that this great change in my life took place. I was
                          sitting alone in a room on the first floor of my uncle's house. I
                          seldom had any sickness and on that day there was nothing wrong with my
                          health, but a sudden violent fear of death overtook me. There was
                          nothing in my state of health to account for it nor was there any urge
                          in me to find out whether there was any account for the fear. I just
                          felt I was going to die and began thinking what to do about it. It did
                          not occur to me to consult a doctor or any elders or friends. I felt I
                          had to solve the problem myself then and there. The shock of the fear
                          of death drove my mind inwards and I said to myself mentally, without
                          actually framing the words: 'Now death has come; what does it mean?
                          What is it that is dying? This body dies.' And at once I dramatised the
                          occurrence of death. I lay with my limbs stretched out still as though <em>rigor mortis</em> has set in, and imitated a corpse so as to give greater reality to the
                          enquiry. I held my breath and kept my lips tightly closed so that no
                          sound could escape, and that neither the word 'I' nor any word could be
                          uttered. 'Well then,' I said to myself, 'this body is dead. It will be
                          carried stiff to the burning ground and there burn and reduced to
                          ashes. But with the death of the body, am I dead? Is the body I? It is
                          silent and inert, but I feel the full force of my personality and even
                          the voice of I within me, apart from it. So I am the Spirit
                          transcending the body. The body dies but the spirit transcending it
                          cannot be touched by death. That means I am the deathless Spirit.' All
                          this was not dull thought; it flashed through me vividly as living
                          truths which I perceived directly almost without thought process. I was
                          something real, the only real thing about my present state, and all the
                          conscious activity connected with the body was centered on that I. From
                          that moment onwards, the I or Self focused attention on itself by a
                          powerful fascination. Fear of death vanished once and for all. The ego
                          was lost in the flood of Self-awareness. Absorption in the Self
                          continued unbroken from that time. Other thought might come and go like
                          the various notes of music, but the I continued like the fundamental
                          sruti [that which is heard] note which underlies and blends with all
                          other notes." <sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramana_Maharshi#_note-15">[16]</a></sup>.</p>
              <p>After this event, he lost interest in school-studies, friends, and
                          relations. Avoiding company, he preferred to sit alone, absorbed in
                          concentration on the Self, and went daily to the Meenakshi Temple,
                          ecstatically devoted to the images of the Gods, tears flowing profusely
                          from his eyes.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramana_Maharshi#_note-16">[17]</a></sup></p>
              <p>Venkataraman’s elder brother, Nagaswamy, was aware of a great change
                          in him and on several occasions rebuked him for his detachment from all
                          that was going on around him. About six weeks after Venkataraman’s
                          absorption into the Self, on the 29th of August, 1896, he was
                          attempting to complete a homework assignment which had been given to
                          him by his English teacher for indifference in his studies. Suddenly
                          Venkataraman tossed aside the book and turned inward in meditation. His
                          elder brother rebuked him again, asking, “What use is all this to one
                          who is like this?” Venkataraman did not answer, but recognized the
                          truth in his brother’s words.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramana_Maharshi#_note-17">[18]</a></sup></p>

              <p>Yes this is important. What is also important is to know the correct technique and way of practice.</p>
              <p>Many people in meditation see visions of gods or Buddhas or attain special abilities, not knowing they have entered demonic states.</p>
              <p>Our practice should consist only in dropping (attachment to thoughts, body and mind, 'self'), developing calm/equanimity and clarity/awareness.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: x-large;">I</span> want to talk in depth today about
                          the nature of Buddhism. Very often I read in newspapers and books some strange things that
                          are presented as Buddhism. So here, I will point out the heart of the real Buddhist
                          teaching, not as a theory but as an experience. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: #800080;"><strong></strong>
              </span></span></p><h2><strong>What is Not The Heart of
                          Buddhism.</strong></h2>
              <p></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Psychotherapy. </strong>I know that some people still think
                          Buddhism is some form of psychotherapy, some way of applying wise attitudes or skilful
                          means in order to live more at peace in this world. Indeed, in the rich storehouse of
                          Buddhist teachings there are many things which do help people to live life with less
                          problems. Using wise attitudes and compassionate intentions, Buddhism teaches an effective
                          way of dealing with the problems of the world. When these Buddhist methods actually work,
                          they give people faith and confidence that there really is something in this Buddhist path
                          which is valuable to them. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I often reflect on why people come here to the Buddhist
                          Society on a Friday evening. It's because they get something out of this. What they get
                          out of these teachings is a more peaceful life style, a happier feeling toward themselves
                          and more acceptance of other beings. It is in that sense a therapy for the problems of
                          life, and it does actually work. <em>However that's not what Buddhism really is, that's
                          only one of its side affects</em>. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Philosophy. </strong>Some people come across Buddhism and
                          they find it's a marvellous philosophy. They can sit around the coffee table after I've
                          given a talk and they can talk for hours and still not be close to enlightenment. Very
                          often people can discuss very high-minded things; their brains can talk about and think
                          about such sublime subjects. Then they go out and swear at the first car that pulls out in
                          front of them on the way home. They lose it all straight away. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Ritual. </strong>Or instead of looking at Buddhism as a
                          philosophy, many people look at it as a religion. The rituals of Buddhism are meaningful,
                          and they shouldn't be discarded just because one thinks one is above ritual. I know people
                          are sometimes very proud, arrogant even, and think they don't need any rituals. But the
                          truth of the matter is that rituals do have a psychological potency. For example, it is
                          useful in society when two people are going to live together that they go through some
                          sort of marriage ceremony. Because in that ceremony there is something that happens to the
                          mind, something that happens to the heart. There is a commitment made deep inside which
                          echoes with the knowledge that something important has happened. In the ceremonies and
                          rituals of death, all of those rites of chanting, reflection and kind words actually have
                          a meaning for the people involved. It does help them to come to accept with grace the
                          passing of a loved one. It helps them acknowledge the truth of what's happened, that a
                          final separation from that person has occurred. And in that acceptance they come to peace. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In the same way, at our monastery, in order to forgive
                          another person and to let go of past hurt, a ceremony of forgiveness is often used. In the
                          Catholic Church they have the ceremony of confession. The precise details of a forgiveness
                          ceremony don't really matter, but what is important is that forgiveness is given, by some
                          physical means through some ritual or ceremony. If you just say, "Oh I'm sorry",
                          isn't that a lot different from also giving a present, or a bunch of flowers? Or isn't it
                          different from going up to them and saying "look, what I did the other day was really
                          unforgivable, but come out to dinner with me this evening", or "here have a
                          couple of tickets to the theatre"? It is much deeper and more effective when you
                          weave a beautiful ceremony around forgiveness rather than just muttering a few words. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Even the ritual of bowing to a Buddha has a great meaning.
                          It's an act of humility. It's saying I'm not enlightened and yet there is something that
                          is beyond me which I am aspiring towards. It's the same humility that a person has when
                          they go to school, or university and they acknowledge that the lecturers and the
                          professors know more than they do. If you argue with professors when you go to university,
                          are you going to learn anything? Humility is not subservience, which denies the worth of
                          yourself, But humility is that which respects the different qualities in people. Sometimes
                          the act of bowing, if it's done mindfully, is a ceremony, a ritual that can generate a
                          great sense of joy. As a monk many people bow to me, and I bow to many others. There is
                          always someone that you have to bow to no matter how senior you are. At the very least
                          there is always the Buddha to bow down to. I enjoy bowing. When there is a monk who is
                          senior to me, bowing is a beautiful way of overcoming ego and judging, especially when I
                          must bow to a really rotten monk (the good monks are easy to bow to). This is a ritual
                          which if done in the right way can produce so many benefits. At the very least, as I tell
                          people at the monastery, if you do a lot of bowing it strengthens your stomach muscles and
                          you don't look fat! But it's more than that. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">So these Buddhist rituals are useful, but <strong>Buddhism is
                          much more than that.</strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong><span style="color: #800080;">Meditation and
                          Enlightenment.</span> </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">When you ask what Buddhism <em>really</em> is, it's a hard
                          question to answer in a few words. You have to come back to <em>this process of meditation
                          because there is the crux, the fulcrum of Buddhism, the heart of Buddhism.</em> As
                          everybody who has ever come across the Buddhist teachings would know, the Buddha was a man
                          who became enlightened while meditating under a tree. A few minutes ago you were doing the
                          same meditation for half an hour! Why where you not enlightened? That enlightenment of the
                          Buddha was actually what created this religion of Buddhism. It is its meaning, it is its
                          centre. <em>Buddhism is all about enlightenment</em>; not just about living a healthy life,
                          or a happy life, or learning to be wise and saying smart things to your friends around the
                          coffee table. Again <em>Buddhism is all about this enlightenment.</em> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">First of all you have to get some feeling or indication of
                          what enlightenment actually is. Sometimes people come up to me and say "I'm
                          enlightened", and I sometimes get letters from people saying "thank you for your
                          teachings, please know that I am enlightened now". And sometimes I hear other people
                          say of teachers or gurus "Oh Yeah, they are certainly enlightened" without
                          really knowing what that means. The word enlightenment stands for some opening of wisdom, <em>some
                          understanding which stops all suffering.</em> The person who hasn't abandoned all suffering
                          is never enlightened. The fact that a person still suffers means that they are yet to
                          abandon all their attachments. The person who is still worried about their possessions,
                          who still cries at the death of a loved one, who is still angry, and who is still enjoying
                          the pleasures of the senses like sex, they are not enlightened. Enlightenment is something
                          beyond and free from all that. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Sometimes when a monk talks like this he can very easily
                          put people off. Monks seem like "wowsers" [1], as they say in Australia. They
                          don't go to the movies, don't have any sex, don't have any relationships, don't go on
                          holidays, don't have any pleasures. What a bunch of wowsers! But the interesting thing
                          which many people notice, is that some of the most peaceful and happy people you meet are
                          the monks and nuns who come and sit here on a Friday evening and give the talks. Monks are
                          quite different from wowsers, and the reason is that there is another happiness which the
                          monks know and which the Buddha has pointed out to them. Each one of you can sense that
                          same happiness when your meditation starts to take off. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: #800080;"><strong>Letting Go.</strong></span> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The Buddha taught that it is attachment that causes
                          suffering and <em>letting go is the cause for happiness and the way to enlightenment.</em> Letting go! So often people have asked how do you let go? What they really mean is, why do
                          you let go? It's a difficult question to answer and it will never be answered in words.
                          Instead I answer that question by saying "Now is the time to meditate, cross your
                          legs, be in the present moment," because this is teaching people what letting go is
                          all about. <em>Moreover, the final moments of the meditation are the most important.</em> Please always remember this. In the last few minutes ask yourself, "How do I
                          feel?" "What is this like and why?" "How did this come about?" </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">People meditate because it's fun, it's enjoyable. They
                          don't meditate to "get something out of it," even though when you meditate there
                          are a lot of good benefits to be had such as health benefits or reducing stress in your
                          life. Through meditation you become less intolerant, less angry. <em>But there is something
                          more to it than that - it's just the sheer fun of it!</em> When I was a young monk that's
                          what made me become a Buddhist. It was inspiring to read the books but that was not good
                          enough. It was when I meditated and became peaceful, very peaceful, incredibly peaceful,
                          that something told me that this was the most profound experience of my life. I wanted to
                          experience this again. I wanted to investigate it more. Why? <em>Because one deep
                          experience of meditation is worth a thousand talks, or arguments, or books, or theories.</em> The things you read in books are other people's experiences, they are not your own.
                          They're words and they might inspire, but the actual experience itself is truly moving.
                          It's truly earth shattering because it shatters that which you've rested on for such a
                          long time. By inclining along this path of meditation you're actually learning what
                          letting go really is. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: #800080;"><strong>Acknowledge, Forgive and Let Go
                          (AFL).</strong></span> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">For those of you who have difficulty meditating, it's
                          because you haven't learned to let go yet in the meditation. Why can't we let go of simple
                          things like past and future? Why are we so concerned with what someone else did to us or
                          said to us today? The more you think about it, the more stupid it is. You know the old
                          saying, "When someone calls you an idiot, the more times you remember it, the more
                          times they've called you an idiot!" If you let it go immediately, you will never
                          think about it again. They only called you an idiot at most once. It's gone! It's
                          finished. You're free. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Why is it that we imprison ourselves with our past? Why
                          can't we even let that go? Do you really want to be free? Then acknowledge, forgive and
                          let go, what I call in Australia the "AFL Code" [2] - Acknowledge, forgive, and
                          let go of whatever has hurt you, whether it's something that somebody has done or said, or
                          whether it's what life has done. For instance, someone has died in your family and you
                          argue with yourself that they shouldn't have died. Or you've lost your job and you think
                          without stop that that shouldn't have happened. Or simply something has gone wrong and you
                          are obsessed that it's not fair. You can crucify yourself on a cross of your own making
                          for the rest of your life if you want to; but no one is forcing you to. Instead you can
                          acknowledge forgive and learn in the forgiving. The letting go is in the learning. The
                          letting go gives the future a freedom to flow easily, unchained to the past. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I was talking to some people recently about the Cambodian
                          community here in Perth and, being a Buddhist community, I have had much to do with them.
                          Like any traditional Buddhists, when they have a problem they come and speak to the monks.
                          This is what they have done for centuries. The monastery and the monks are the social
                          centre, the religious centre, and the counselling centre of the community. When men have
                          arguments with their wives they come to the monastery. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Once when I was a young monk in Thailand, a man came into
                          the monastery and asked me "Can I stay in the monastery for a few days?". I
                          thought he wanted to meditate, so I said "Oh you want to meditate?" "Oh
                          no", he said "the reason I want to come to the monastery is because I've had an
                          argument with my wife." So he stayed in the monastery. Three or four days later he
                          came up to me and said, "I feel better now, can I go home". What a wise thing
                          that was. Instead of going to the bar and getting drunk, instead of going to his mates and
                          telling them all the rotten things that he thought his wife had done thereby reinforcing
                          his ill will and resentment, he went to stay with a group of monks who didn't say anything
                          about his wife, who were just kind and peaceful. He thought about what he had been doing
                          in that peaceful, supportive environment, and after a while he felt much better. This is
                          what a monastery sometimes is: it's the counselling centre, the refuge, the place where
                          people come to let go of their problems. Isn't that better than lingering on the past,
                          especially when we are angry at something that has happened? When we reinforce the
                          resentment, are we really seeing what's going on? Or are we seeing through the perverted
                          glasses of our anger, looking at the faults in the other person, focussing only on the
                          terrible things they have done to us, never really seeing the full picture? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">One of the things I noticed about the Cambodian community
                          was that these were all people who had suffered through the Pol Pot years. I know of a
                          Cambodian man whose wife had been shot by the Khmer Rouge in front of him, for stealing a
                          mango. She was hungry so she took a mango from a tree. One of the Khmer Rouge cadres saw
                          her and, without any trial, he pulled out his gun in front of her husband and shot her
                          dead. When this man was telling me this, I was looking at his face, looking at his bodily
                          movements, and it was amazing to see that there was no anger, there was no resentment,
                          there was not even grief there. There was a peaceful acceptance about what had happened.
                          It shouldn't have happened but it did. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Letting go of the past is so we can enjoy the present, so
                          the future can be free. Why is it that we always carry around the past? Attachment to the
                          past is not a theory, it is an attitude. We can say, "Oh I'm not attached". Or
                          we can say, "I'm so detached I'm not even attached to detachment," which is very
                          clever, and sounds very good, but is a lot of old rubbish. <em>You know if you're attached
                          if you can't let go of those important things that cause you to suffer, that stop you
                          being free.</em> Attachment is a ball and chain, which you tie around your own legs. No one
                          else ties it around you. You've got the key to free yourselves, but you don't use it. Why
                          do we limit ourselves so and why can't we let go of the future, all the concerns and the
                          worries? Do you worry about what's going to happen next, tomorrow, next week, next year?
                          Why do you do that? How many times have you worried about some exam or some test, or a
                          visit to the Doctors, or a visit to the Dentist? You can worry yourself sick and when you
                          get ready to go to the dentist you find they have cancelled your appointment, and you
                          didn't have to go anyway! </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Things never work out as you expect them to. Haven't we
                          learnt yet that the future is so uncertain that it doesn't bear worrying about? We never
                          know what's going to happen next. When we let go of the past and the future, isn't that
                          being on the path to deep meditation? Aren't we actually learning about how to be at
                          peace, how to be free, how to be content. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">These are indications of what enlightenment means. It
                          means seeing that many of our attachments are based on sheer stupidity. We just don't need
                          this. As we develop this meditation deeper, we let go more and more. The more we let go
                          the more happiness and peace it gives us. This is why the Buddha called this whole path of
                          Buddhism a gradual training. It's the path that leads one on, one step at a time, and at
                          every step you get a prize. That's why it's a very delightful path and the prizes get more
                          delightful and more valuable the further you go. But even on the first step you get a
                          prize. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I still remember the first time I meditated. I remember
                          the room. It was at Cambridge University, in the Wordsworth Room at Kings College. I'd
                          never done any meditation before, so I just sat down there for five or ten minutes with a
                          few of my mates. It was only ten minutes but I thought "Oh that was nice", I
                          still remember that feeling. There was something that was resonating inside of me, telling
                          me that this was a path which was leading somewhere wonderful. I'd discussed over coffee
                          and over beer with my friends all types of philosophy, but the "discussions" had
                          always ended in arguments <em>and they never made me happier.</em> Even the great professors
                          at the university, who you get to know very well, didn't seem happy. That was one of the
                          reasons why I didn't continue an academic career. They were brilliant in their field but
                          in other ways they were as stupid as ordinary people. They would have arguments, worry and
                          stress just like everyone else. And that really struck me. Why in such a famous
                          university, where people are so intelligent, are they not happy? <em>What's the point of
                          being clever if it doesn't give you happiness?</em> I mean real happiness, real
                          contentment, and real peace. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: #800080;"><strong>Real contentment and peace.</strong></span> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The first person I saw who had real contentment and peace
                          was Ajahn Chah, my teacher in Thailand. There was something about that man! I saw what he
                          had and I said to myself, "I want that, I want that understanding, that peace".
                          People from all over the world would come to see him. Just because he was a monk didn't
                          mean that everyone was subservient, obsequious and always praising him. Some people would
                          go and argue with him and try to catch him out or even shout at him. I remember a story
                          about the first time he went to England with Ajahn Sumedho. He went on alms round in
                          Hampstead and as he was walking on alms round, this was over twenty years ago, this young
                          hooligan came up to this funnily dressed Asian and threw a punch at him just missing his
                          nose. Ajahn Chah did not know this person was trying to miss. Then he tried to kick him
                          and just missed. He was just trying to wind up this little Asian monk in funny clothes.
                          Ajahn Chah didn't know when he was going to be hit. He never did get hit, because he kept
                          peaceful, kept cool and never got angry. Afterwards, he said England was a very good place
                          and that he wanted to send all his senior monks over there to really test them out. As for
                          Ajahn Chah, he had equanimity in practice. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">It's easy saying "I'm enlightened", but then
                          something happens like that and you run a mile. Another monk in Hampstead at the time was
                          just going for a walk in the afternoon when he passed a pub. He didn't realise at the time
                          that there was a big soccer match between England and Scotland on that day. It had already
                          finished and the Scots supporters where in the pub getting drunk. Around this period,
                          there was a popular TV series about a Kung Fu monk who, when he was small, was called
                          "grasshopper." These sozzled Scots soccer fans looked through the window of the
                          pub and said "Och it's wee grasshopper," and this monk took fright. These where
                          big Scotsmen and they were very drunk. So he started running away, and they chased him all
                          the way back to the Temple. "Wee grasshopper" was running for his life. He lost
                          it. But the sort of practical letting go that Ajahn Chah did in Hampstead is something
                          which gives you a sense that you are on the road to enlightenment. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: #800080;"><strong>A Gradual Path.</strong></span> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The Heart of Buddhism is a gradual path, one step after
                          another step, and you do get results. Some people say you shouldn't meditate to get
                          results. That's a lot of hogwash! Meditate to get results! Meditate to be happy. Meditate
                          to get peace. Meditate to get enlightened, little by <em>little. But if you're going for
                          results, be patient.</em> One of the problems with Westerners is that when they make goals,
                          they are not patient enough. That's why they get disillusioned, depressed and frustrated.
                          They don't give their practice enough time to mature naturally into enlightenment. It
                          takes time, maybe a few life times even, so don't be in a rush. As you walk each step,
                          there is always something you get out of it. Let go a little and you get freedom and
                          peace. <em>Let go a lot and you feel bliss.</em> This is how I teach meditation both at my
                          monastery and here. I encourage meditators to aim for these stages of letting go, these
                          bliss states called <em>Jhana</em>. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: #800080;"><strong>Jhanas</strong></span> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><em>Everyone wants to be happy, and the Jhanas are how you
                          can achieve happiness,</em> I mean real happiness, deep happiness. The only trouble is
                          these states don't last very long, only a few hours, but still they are <em>very</em> attractive. They arise through letting go,<em> real letting go.</em> In particular they
                          arise through letting go of will, choice, control. It's a fascinating thing to experience
                          a deep meditation and understand how it comes about. Through such an experience you
                          realise that the more you control, the more you crave because of attachments, the less
                          peaceful you get. <em>But the more you let go, the more you abandon, the more you get out
                          of the way, the happier you feel.</em> Now this is a teaching of something very profound,
                          much deeper than you can read in a book or hear in a talk and certainly much more useful
                          than discussing these things over a coffee table. You're actually experiencing something.
                          This is getting towards the heart of religion, that which people call mysticism. You're
                          actually experiencing it for your self. In particular you are letting go of this
                          "controller," this "doer." Now that is the prime problem for human
                          beings. We can't stop messing things up. Very often we should just leave things alone but
                          we can't, we don't. Instead we make a mess. Why can't you just relax and enjoy yourself
                          instead of always doing something? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">It's hard to stop in meditation, but the more you stop the
                          more rewards you get, the more peace you get. When you let go in meditation, let go the
                          will, let go of the control, when you stop talking to yourself, you get inner silence. How
                          many of you are fed up yet with this racket that goes on inside your head all the time?
                          How many of you sometimes can't get to sleep at night when there's no noise from the
                          neighbours but there is something even louder between your ears. Yak, Yak, Yak, Worry,
                          Worry, Worry, Think, Think, Think! This is the problem with human beings, when it's time
                          to think they can't think clearly and when it's time to stop thinking they can't be at
                          peace. When we learn how to meditate we get this sense of being more balanced, and we know
                          how to let go. We now how to let go to the point where all thoughts disappear. These
                          thoughts are just commentaries, they're just descriptions. The difference between thought
                          and reality is the difference between, say, reading a book about New York and going to New
                          York. Which is more real? When you're there, you smell the air, you feel the atmosphere,
                          you sense the character, all of which are things you can't write in a book. <em>The truth
                          is always silent. The lie is always with words.</em> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: #800080;"><strong>When the Body Disappears.</strong></span> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Remember "con men," "con women" as
                          well. These con men can sell you anything! There's one living in your mind right now, and
                          you believe every word he says! His name is Thinking. When you let go of that inner talk
                          and get silent, you get happy. Then when you let go of the movement of the mind and stay
                          with the breath, you experience even more delight. Then when you let go of the body ,all
                          these five senses disappear and you're really blissing out. This is original Buddhism.
                          Sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch completely vanish. This is like being in a sensory
                          deprivation chamber but much better. But it's not just silence, you just don't hear
                          anything. It's not just blackness, you just don't see anything. It's not just a feeling of
                          comfort in the body, there is no body at all. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">When the body disappears that <em>really</em> starts to feel
                          great. You know of all those people who have out of the body experiences? When the body
                          dies, every person has that experience, they float out of the body. And one of the things
                          they always say is it's so peaceful, so beautiful, so blissful. It's the same in
                          meditation when the body disappears, it's so peaceful, so beautiful, so blissful when you
                          are free from this body. What's left? Here there's no sight, sound, smell, taste, touch.
                          This is what the Buddha called the mind in deep meditation. <em>When the body disappears
                          what is left is the mind.</em> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I gave a simile to a monk the other night. Imagine an
                          Emperor who is wearing a long pair of trousers and a big tunic. He's got shoes on his
                          feet, a scarf around the bottom half of his head and a hat on the top half of his head.
                          You can't see him at all because he's completely covered in five garments. It's the same
                          with the mind. It's completely covered with sight, sound, smell, taste and touch. So
                          people don't know it. They just know the garments. When they see the Emperor, they just
                          see the robes and the garments. They don't know who lives inside them. And so it is no
                          wonder they're confused about what is life, what is mind, who is this inside of here, were
                          did I come from? Why? What am I supposed to be doing with this life? When the five senses
                          disappear, it's like unclothing the Emperor and seeing what is actually in here, what's
                          actually running the show, who's listening to these words, who's seeing, who's feeling
                          life, who this is. When the five senses disappear, you're coming close to the answer to
                          those questions. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">What you're seeing in such deep meditation is that which
                          we call "mind," (in Pali it's called <em>Citta</em>). The Buddha used this
                          beautiful simile. When there is a full moon on a cloudy night, even though it's a full
                          moon, you can hardly see it. Sometimes when the clouds are thin, you can see this hazy
                          shape shining though. You know there is something there. This is like the meditation just
                          before you've entered into these profound states. You know there is something there, but
                          you can't quite make it out. There's still some "clothes" left. You're still
                          thinking and doing, feeling the body or hearing sounds. But there does come a time, and
                          this is the Buddha's simile, when the moon is released from the clouds and there in the
                          clear night sky you can see the beautiful full disc of the moon shining brilliantly, and
                          you know that's the moon. The moon is there; the moon is real, and it's not just some sort
                          of side effect of the clouds. This is what happens in meditation when you see the mind.
                          You see clearly that the mind is not some side effect of the brain. <em>You see the mind,
                          and you know the mind.</em> The Buddha said that the mind released is beautiful, is
                          brilliant, is radiant. So not only are these blissful experiences, they're meaningful
                          experiences as well. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">How many people may have heard about rebirth but still
                          don't really believe it? How can rebirth happen? Certainly the body doesn't get reborn.
                          That's why when people ask me where do you go when you die, "one of two places"
                          I say "Fremantle or Karrakatta" that's where the body goes! [3] But is that
                          where the mind goes? Sometimes people are so stupid in this world, they think the body is
                          all there is, that there is no mind. So when you get cremated or buried that's it, that's
                          done with, all has ended. The only way you can argue with this view is by developing the
                          meditation that the Buddha achieved under the Bodhi tree. Then you can see the mind for
                          yourself in clear awareness - not in some hypnotic trance, not in dullness - but in the
                          clear awareness. This is knowing the mind </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: #800080;"><strong>Knowing the Mind.</strong></span> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">When you know that mind, when you see it for yourself, one
                          of the results will be an insight that the mind is independent of this body. Independence
                          means that when this body breaks up and dies, when it's cremated or when it's buried, or
                          however it's destroyed after death, it will not affect the mind. You know this because you
                          see the nature of the mind. That mind which you see will transcend bodily death. <em>The
                          first thing</em> which you will see for yourself, the insight which is as clear as the nose
                          on your face, is that <em>there is something more to life than this physical body that we
                          take to be me. Secondly you can recognise that that mind, essentially, is no different
                          than that process of consciousness which is in all beings.</em> Whether it's human beings
                          or animals or even insects, of any gender, age or race, you see that that which is in
                          common to all life is this mind, this consciousness, the source of doing. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Once you see that, you have much more respect for your
                          fellow beings. Not just respect for your own race, your own tribe or your own religion,
                          not just for human beings, but for all beings. It's a wonderfully high-minded idea.
                          "May all beings be happy and well and may we respect all nations, all peoples, even
                          all beings." However this is how you achieve that! You truly get compassion only when
                          we see that others are fundamentally just as ourselves. If you think that a cow is
                          completely different from you, that cows don't think like human beings, then it's easy to
                          eat one. But can you eat your grandmother? She's too much like you. Can you eat an ant?
                          Maybe you'd kill an ant because you think that ants aren't like you. But if you look
                          carefully at ants, they are no different. In a forest monastery living out in the bush,
                          close to nature, one of the things you become so convinced of is that animals have
                          emotions and , especially, feel pain. You begin to recognise the personality of the
                          animals, of the kookaburras, of the mice, the ants, and the spiders. Each one of those
                          spiders has a mind just like you have. <em>Once you see that you can understand the
                          Buddha's compassion for all beings.</em> You can also understand how rebirth can occur
                          between all species - not just human beings to human beings, but animals to humans, humans
                          to animals. You can understand also how the mind is the source of all this. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The mind can exist even without a body in the realms of
                          ghosts and angels (what we call in Buddhism <em>Devas</em>). It becomes very clear to you
                          how they exist, why they exist, what they are. These are insights and understandings which
                          come from deep meditation. But more than that, when you know the nature of the mind then
                          you know the nature of consciousness. You know the nature of stillness. You know the
                          nature of life. You understand what makes this mind go round and round and round, what
                          makes this mind seek rebirth. You understand the law of Kamma. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: #800080;"><strong>The Three Knowledges.</strong></span> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>The First Knowledge. </strong>When the Buddha sat under the
                          Bodhi tree, according to tradition he gained three knowledge's. The first knowledge was
                          the memory of past lives. When you get close to the mind, there are certain powers that
                          come with that experience. The powers are no more than an ability, a dexterity with the
                          use of the mind. It's like the difference between a dog that has been running wild and a
                          dog that has been well trained. You can tell the trained dog to go and pick up the
                          newspaper. It wags its tail and goes and picks up the newspaper for you. Some people have
                          got their dogs so well trained that they can actually pick up the telephone. Maybe they
                          could answer the telephone as well, then that would really save you a lot of time! </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">When you get to these deep states of meditation often, the
                          mind becomes well trained. One of the things which the Buddha did (and which you can do
                          when you get into deep meditation) is tell the mind to go back to the past. What's your
                          earliest memory? Go back further and further and further. Monks who do this get early
                          memories of their childhood. They even get memories of the moment they were born.
                          Sometimes people say that when you're born, you have no consciousness because the neuron's
                          aren't developed yet, or something like that. But when you re-experience your birth, you
                          know that that is just not true. When the memory of your own birth appears, it is just
                          like you are there and you experience all feelings of that birth. Then you can ask
                          yourself for an even earlier memory, and then you get back into your past lives. That's
                          what the Buddha did under the Bodhi tree. Through meditation you know rebirth, you know
                          your own past lives. This is just what happens with the mind and you know how it happens.
                          That was the first knowledge that the Buddha had. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>The Second Knowledge. </strong>The second knowledge was to
                          know how you are reborn. Why you are reborn. Where you are reborn. This is the Law of <em>Kamma</em>.
                          Someone was showing me a book today which, unfortunately, we had for free distribution but
                          which I hadn't seen before. It had some really weird ideas in it about the Law of <em>Kamma</em>.
                          I think what it said was that if you read one of the <em>Suttas</em> while you are lying on
                          the ground, you will be reborn with a bad back, or something like that. Just stupid ideas!
                          <em>Kamma</em> is much more complex than that and it depends mostly upon the quality of your
                          intention. The movement of the mind itself is what determines the <em>Kamma</em>, <em>not
                          just the act, but why and where it came from.</em> You can see this in meditation, but also
                          you can see just how that mind gets fully liberated. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>The Third Knowledge. </strong>The third knowledge was the
                          ending of suffering. With understanding of The Four Noble Truths, you realise the Way and
                          what enlightenment really means. <em>It means freedom! The mind is liberated, especially
                          liberated from the body, liberated not just from the suffering of the body but liberated
                          from the happiness of the body as well.</em> That means that there is no more inclination
                          for sexuality, no fear of pain, no grief over the destruction of the body, no ill will and
                          no fear of criticism. Why do people get worried about bad words that are said? Only
                          because of ego. They <em>take</em> something to be themselves. Just imagine for a moment
                          being free from all of those things. What would that be like, no fear, no craving, no need
                          to move from this moment -<em> In other words nothing missing, and nothing left to do,
                          nowhere to go because you're completely happy right here no matter what happens!</em> This
                          is what we mean by enlightenment. <em>This meditation is the source of the Buddha's
                          enlightenment and the source of every person's enlightenment.</em> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">There is no enlightenment without that meditation. This is
                          why Buddhism is far more than a psychotherapy. It's far more than a philosophy. It's far
                          more than a religion. It goes deep into the nature of being, and it is accessible to all
                          people. You know how to meditate. Teachers are giving all the instructions free without
                          any charge. Do you want to do it? Usually the answer is, "Maybe tomorrow but not
                          today." Never the less because the seeds have been placed in the mind, because the
                          meditation has begun already, there is an interest. Already there is a sense of this
                          enlightenment, a fascination for peace, and you will not be able to resist that path. You
                          may be able to put it off for a while, maybe for lifetimes, but it's a strange thing that,
                          as someone said to me many years ago, <em>"When you hear these teachings you can't
                          discard them."</em> You just can't forget them. They aren't telling you what to
                          believe. They aren't giving you a theory which is merely rational. But they are pointing
                          you to something which you can understand and experience for yourself, and you get
                          intuitions of this the deeper you go. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The Buddha was a very remarkable person, his peacefulness,
                          compassion and wisdom, were legendary. There is something about enlightenment that is very
                          attractive. In the same way there is something about freedom that you cannot ignore. That
                          is why little by little, you will understand what Buddhism is all about. You won't
                          understand Buddhism from the books nor will you understand Buddhism from what I say. <em>You'll
                          only understand Buddhism in your own experiences of peaceful meditation.</em> That's where
                          Buddhism is taught. <em>So have fun with your meditation and don't be afraid of
                          enlightenment.</em> Get in there, enjoy it, and you will have no regrets. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">That's what Buddhism is. <em>That's its heart –
                          meditation and enlightenment. That's its meaning.</em> I hope you can understand some of
                          this. I can say no more because the time has gone. I'll complete my talk now. </span></p>

                              sutras. The actual purpose of cultivation is to eradicate our undesirable conduct and to

                              cultivate, lay-Buddhists also need to cultivate, if not more diligently. Even those who do
                              not subscribe to any religion need to cultivate. Cultivation is not only a matter for

              <p><span style="color: #0000a0;"><strong>What is cultivation? Where do we practise cultivation?
                          Let me tell you a story: More than twenty years ago, I took four years to cultivate as I
                          travelled across the country. Step by step, I covered Taiwan by walking. Once when I was
                          in Hua-Lian, an elderly Buddhist asked me, "Master! A monk should reside in the
                          temple to meditate, pray and chant sutras, but when you travel about what are you
                          cultivating? I replied, "That’s right! I am cultivating. Sakyamuni Buddha
                          teaches us to cultivate our conduct. He does not encourage us to cultivate sitting down!
                          In the past few years I had been practising sitting meditation, now I wish to travel
                          about. While walking and also amidst all my other activities, I do not commit evil deeds,
                          I chant the names of the Buddhas, I praise and commend others, I tell people about the
                          Dharma, I avoid the places of vice, this is the way I cultivate."</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000a0;"><strong>Thus, to cultivate means cultivating in the midst of our
                          activities. This is a point that many people do not understand. They think that
                          cultivation will result in a society that is pessimistic and low-spirited. This is a
                          mistake. Jen Chen Buddhism advocates cultivating in the midst of our daily activities.
                          Many retired old folks have no need to attend to household chores anymore, thus they can
                          afford to spend their time to chant the names of the Buddhas and to cultivate in the midst
                          of their leisure. However, there are many housewives who need to tend to their children,
                          household chores and many other matters. How do you expect them to cultivate in their
                          leisure? Thus, the need to cultivate in the midst of their activities; while cooking they
                          could chant the names of the Buddhas and the Bodhisattvas. No matter what activities they
                          are engaged in, it is always possible to cultivate. Instead of gossipping about our
                          neighbours and friends or engaging in other frivolous talks, why not refrain from all
                          these. This is cultivation. Therefore, only when we cultivate in the midst of our
                          activities do we understand the meaning of cultivation. To cultivate in our leisure may
                          cause others a lot of frustrations. For example, a husband may be upset because his wife
                          neglects the household by spending too much time chanting or running from temple to
                          temple. For her to introduce Buddhism to her husband, thus, would not be an easy task. If
                          she understands the principle of cultivating in the midst of her activities, it would be
                          acceptable to the husband. Should he be invited to places of vice, he would know how to
                          turn them down because his wife is a diligent cultivator. Both husband and wife are then
                          cultivating at the same time. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000a0;"><strong>There will be progress in our society when we understand
                          the principle of cultivation. Otherwise, society will backslide. Over the last few
                          decades, I have come to realize that we need to cultivate wherever we are. When we possess
                          the correct concept of cultivation, any time is an appropriate time for cultivation, any
                          place can be the place for us to seek enlightenment. If each and everyone of us conduct
                          ourselves in this way, then the world will become a pure land. If we think that we can
                          only cultivate in the temples, or that we cannot cultivate when we are working, then it is
                          very possible that we commit evils deeds without even knowing. When we are with Buddha
                          every moment, and cultivate constantly, then we are truly practitioners of Buddhism.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000a0;"><strong>As to when in the cultivation process does one awaken and
                          what it is like to be awakened, only when you follow the guidance of the Dharma and put it
                          into practice, will you know you have awakened: when you drink the water, only you know
                          how warm or cold it is.</strong></span></p>

                          other activities, but, Buddhism is best practised amid these activities. Should one be

                          all sorts of other problems not related to their work. In short, they may be occupied
                          physically, but mentally, their minds are not free or empty. As such, does learning and
                          practising Buddhism really pose a problem to our heavy schedules? This is definitely not
                          so. A verse from the "Seven Buddhas" reads: "Avoid all evils; do all that
                          are good; purify one’s mind. These are the teachings of all Buddhas". </strong></span></p>

                          enlightenment, sublime wisdom and blessings. On the other hand the commoner has lesser

                          Since there is no arising, then there is no cessation. The verse "Non-origination and

                              and the next it ceases. Now we need to know when these thoughts are arising and ceasing.
                              "To know" here means "awareness". Let me use my hand to illustrate so
                              that you may understand right away. I raise my hand now, and so my hand is "up".
                              When I put my hand down then it is "down". Our mind constantly behaves in the

                              thought is dead, it passes away (hand is down). This continuous process of birth and death
                              is called sentient beings. This process of birth and death brings forth boundless
                              sufferings. Sentient being is boundless and therefore suffering is also boundless. When we

                          beings and we all have a mind. We are frequently ‘deceived’ by our minds. For an
                          entire lifetime we are ‘deceived’ and ‘misled’ by our minds without
                          ever realizing it! If the mind is good, then of course, it is all very well. Such a mind
                          creates a good person; one can ascend to the heavens or one can perform a lot of virtuous
                          deeds. What happens if the mind is evil and becomes defiled? It can drag us to become
                          animals, ghosts and deities, or descend to hell. This is because our mind is not pure, and
                          therefore the world becomes a sea of suffering. This suffering world of ours is called the
                          "Saha World". It means having to endure and is also called the "World of
                          enduring sufferings".</strong></span>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000a0; font-size: small;"><strong>If
                          we all purify our minds, then the world becomes a heaven. Everybody is very happy and
                          there is no suffering. In learning and practising Buddhism, the most important thing is to
                          purify our minds. When we can purify our minds, then naturally there will be happiness in
                          our world.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000a0; font-size: small;"><strong>To do that we have to observe the
                          non-arising of the mind. This is called ‘contemplation of the mind’. When the
                          mind is polluted, then we cleanse it with the dew of the Buddha. And when our minds have
                          been purified, then they are the same as those of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. In this
                          way, we will progress very quickly in our cultivation.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000a0; font-size: small;"><strong>Observing the mind is very simple.
                          It is like watching out for the mouse. Everybody dislike mice because they steal our food
                          or they damage our clothings. An idiom describes this sentiment with the phrase,
                          ‘When the mouse crosses the street everybody goes after it.’ Obviously mice are
                          not welcomed and they have to be dealt with. One method of dealing with it, is the cat. At
                          the sight of a mouse, the cat puts his paws firmly on the ground and fixes its steely eyes
                          on the mouse. On seeing the cat, the mouse trembles with fear, not daring to make even the
                          slightest movement. Treat your mind as if it were a mouse and your awareness as the cat.
                          At every moment observe your mind, in the same way as the cat watching the mouse. The
                          mouse wants to live and hardly has time to think of its own safety, let alone of stealing
                          food. If we can observe our minds, then we will hardly have time enough to treasure our
                          wisdom life, let alone think of committing evil deeds.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000a0; font-size: small;"><strong>Therefore when we are learning and
                          practising Buddhism, we need to learn to "contemplate the mind". In this way, we
                          will very quickly be able to avoid all evils and do all that are good.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000a0; font-size: small;"><strong>"Avoid all evils; do all that
                          are good; purify one’s mind. These are the teachings of all Buddhas". Besides
                          avoiding all evils and doing all that are good, we need to purify our thoughts. When our
                          thoughts have been purified, then the mind is pure. The purpose of learning and practising
                          Buddhism is to purify the human mind. If the minds of everyone in the family is pure, then
                          our home is pure; if the minds of everyone in this society is pure, then our society is
                          pure; if the minds of everyone in the country is pure, then our land is pure; if the
                          entire human race in the world is pure, then our world is as happy as the Western Pure
                          Land. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000a0; font-size: small;"><strong>Our mind is like the stealthy
                          mouse, ever watchful of a chance to creep out to commit evil deeds, and we are not even
                          aware of that. I hope all of us will keep a cat to watch our minds, so that we can become
                          Buddha quickly.</strong></span></p>

                          and speeches will be pure. When our actions, speeches and thoughts are pure, then all our

              <p>Buddhism is about awakening, liberation, purification of the mind. It is also realising yourself and the true nature of reality... thereby awakening from our delusions causing endless suffering, greed, hatred, ignorance, and liberation from the cycle of samsaric rebirth in the 6 realms, and eventually attain Buddhahood. It is also to awake to the possibility of perfect bliss right here right now... not just in the afterlife. This bliss is not happiness that is conditioned by the things we own or sensory enjoyment (which is fleeting and unsatisfactory, and which Buddha calls of the nature of Dukkha - suffering), but comes from Transcendence of the conditioned and realising the unconditioned Reality, and then living everyday lives and meeting all life situations in unconditioned awareness.</p>
              <p>If you practice Buddhism, you will know why you want to practice. The experiences you have will make you want to practice further... because you will want to re experience them again. After glimpses, you are guided by the experience and your inner wisdom. Then even if there is no Buddha, no teachers around, you will still want to practice to experience by yourself. Of course, having an enlightened teacher as a source of guidance is still very very important and helpful.</p>

              <p>BTW Longchen made a gd observation that my experience isn't like death -- because during death there is a total shut down of both thoughts and sensory awareness, and that "cannot be cognited.... there is no understanding of anything there
                                      for the split second that the shut down is experienced."</p>
              <p>In my case, as I told him, "I do not think I experience total shut down of senses. It
                                      was thoughtless, but there is pretty much sensory awareness. In
                                      fact it becomes intensified, vivid, real, as if I am sensing its
                                      'pure existence' or 'aliveness' or 'energy' whatever you call it...
                                      but there is no separate experiencer." So certain aspect of 'self' has dissolved, but it is not a real clinical/physical death experience, and as Thusness said it is not yet the complete dissolution of the 'self'.</p>

              <p>Buddhism is about awakening, liberation, purification of the mind. It is also realising yourself and the true nature of reality... thereby awakening from our delusions causing endless suffering, greed, hatred, ignorance, and liberation from the cycle of samsaric rebirth in the 6 realms, and eventually attain Buddhahood. It is also to awake to the possibility of perfect bliss right here right now... not just in the afterlife. This bliss is not happiness that is conditioned by the things we own or sensory enjoyment (which is fleeting and unsatisfactory, and which Buddha calls of the nature of Dukkha - suffering), but comes from Transcendence of the conditioned and realising the unconditioned Reality, and then living everyday lives and meeting all life situations in unconditioned awareness.</p>
              <p>If you practice Buddhism, you will know why you want to practice. The experiences you have will make you want to practice further... because you will want to re experience them again. After glimpses, you are guided by the experience and your inner wisdom. Then even if there is no Buddha, no teachers around, you will still want to practice to experience by yourself. Of course, having an enlightened teacher as a source of guidance is still very very important and helpful.</p>
