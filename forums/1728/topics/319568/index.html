              <p>Perseverence to me means trying your very best in whatever you do, but it can be done with no attachment to the results that followed.  For e.g. I can do a project to my utmost, but if it still fails at the end, I won't be particularly upset about it, because I know I've done my best.  It is only when you are 'zhi zuo' about the results that you keep thinking about it, and you get angry with yourself for not meeting the target.  Therefore, my motto is - do your best without dwelling on the results.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hence, I think perseverence is a good thing, but 'zhi zuo' is bad. </p>

              <p>To my understanding, perserverence is a strength to move on and continue with whatever we are doing, and as a forummer said 'determined'... but we must always observe whether there is attachment involved, like whether there is attachment, unwillingness or reluctance to lose something, etc. Is our mind obsessed with external seeking that it loses itself in the future and reduce this moment as a means to an end?</p>
              <p>Whenever we do anything, don't let fear be the driving force.. Is there joy or is it fear or greed that drives you? Is there peace and contentment or resistance and discontent.</p>
              <p>Ask yourself -- is there joy, enthusiasm, or acceptance in what you do? (see below) What is the state of consciousness or driving force of perserverence.</p>
              <p>Always be aware of your inner state.. mindfulness/awareness is important, and whenever negative states/emotions/thoughts arise we must learn how to drop, dont let it pollute your inner state and affect what you do. Stay mentally clear and mindful and just do your best.</p>
              <p>Eckhart Tolle: <strong>"The modalities of awakened doing are acceptance, enjoyment,
                                      and enthusiasm. Each one represents a certain vibrational frequency
                                      of<br> consciousness. You need to be vigilant to make sure that one of
                                      them<br> operates whenever you are engaged in doing anything at all – from
                                      the most<br> simple task to the most complex. If you are not in the state of
                                      either<br> acceptance, enjoyment, or enthusiasm, look closely and you will
                                      find that<br> you are creating suffering for yourself and others."</strong></p>
              <p>I hope the following helps:</p>
              <p>AWAKENED DOING<br>Awakened doing is the outer aspect of the next stage in the evolution<br>of consciousness on our planet. The closer we get to the end of our present<br>evolutionary stage, the more dysfunctional the ego becomes, in the same way<br>that a caterpillar becomes dysfunctional just before it transforms into a<br>butterfly. But the new consciousness is arising even as the old dissolves.<br>We are in the midst of a momentous event in the evolution of human<br>consciousness, but they won't be talking about it in the news tonight. On our<br>planet, and perhaps simultaneously in many parts of our galaxy and beyond,<br>consciousness is awakening from the dream of form. This does not mean all<br>forms (the world) are going to dissolve, although quite a few almost certainly<br>will. It means consciousness can now begin to create form without losing<br>itself in it. It can remain conscious of itself, even while it creates and<br>experiences form. Why should it continue to create and experience form?<br>For the enjoyment of it. How does consciousness do that? Through<br>awakened humans who have learned the meaning of awakened doing.<br>Awakened doing is the alignment of your outer purposewhat<br>you do<br>– with your inner purpose – awakening and staying awake. Through<br>awakened doing, you become one with the outgoing purpose of the universe.<br>Consciousness flows through you into this world. It flows into your thoughts<br>and inspires them. It flows into what you do and guides and empowers it.<br>Not what you do, but how you do what you do determines whether<br>you are fulfilling your destiny. And how you do what you do is determined<br>by your state of consciousness.<br>A reversal of your priorities comes about when the main purpose for<br>doing what you do becomes the doing itself, or rather, the current of<br>consciousness that flows into what you do. That current of consciousness is<br>what determines quality. Another way of putting it: In any situation and in<br>whatever you do, your state of consciousness is the primary factor; the<br>situation and what you do is secondary. “Future” success is dependent upon<br>and inseparable from the consciousness out of which the actions emanate.<br>That can be either the reactive force of the ego or the alert attention of<br>awakened consciousness. All truly successful action comes out of that field<br>of alert attention, rather than from ego and conditioned, unconscious<br>thinking.</p>
              <p><br>THE THREE MODALITIES OF AWAKENED DOING<br>There are three ways in which consciousness can flow into what you<br>do and thus through you into this world, three modalities in which you can<br>align your life with the creative power of the universe. Modality means the<br>underlying energyfrequency<br>that flows into what you do and connects your<br>actions with the awakened consciousness hat is emerging into this world.<br>What you do will be dysfunctional and of the ego unless it arises out of one<br>of these three modalities. They may change during the course of a day,<br>although one of them may be dominant during a certain stage in your life.<br>Each modality is appropriate to certain situations.<br>The modalities of awakened doing are acceptance, enjoyment, and<br>enthusiasm. Each one represents a certain vibrational frequency of<br>consciousness. You need to be vigilant to make sure that one of them<br>operates whenever you are engaged in doing anything at all – from the most<br>simple task to the most complex. If you are not in the state of either<br>acceptance, enjoyment, or enthusiasm, look closely and you will find that<br>you are creating suffering for yourself and others.<br>ACCEPTANCE<br>Whatever you cannot enjoy doing, you can at least accept that this is<br>what you have to do. Acceptance means: For now, this is what this situation,<br>this moment, requires me to do, and so I do it willingly. We already spoke at<br>length about the importance of inner acceptance of what happens, and<br>acceptance of what you have to do is just another aspect of it. For example,<br>you probably won't be able to enjoy changing the flat tire on your car at night<br>in the middle of nowhere and in pouring rain, let alone be enthusiastic about<br>it, but you can bring acceptance to it. Performing an action in the state of<br>acceptance means you are at peace while you do it. That peace is a subtle<br>energy vibration which then flows into what you do. On the surface,<br>acceptance looks like a passive state, but in reality it is active and creative<br>because it brings something entirely new into this world. That peace, that<br>subtle energy vibration, is consciousness, and one of the ways in which ti<br>enters this world is through surrendered action, one aspect of which is<br>acceptance.<br>If you can neither enjoy or bring acceptance to what you do – stop.<br>Otherwise, you are not taking responsibility for the only thing you can really<br>take responsibility for, which also happens to be one thing that really<br>matters: your state of consciousness. And if you are not taking responsibility<br>for your state of consciousness, you are not taking responsibility for life.<br>ENJOYMENT<br>The peace that comes with surrendered action turns to a sense of<br>aliveness when you actually enjoy what you are doing. Enjoyment is the<br>second modality of awakened doing. On the new earth, enjoyment will<br>replace wanting as the motivating power behind people's actions. Wanting<br>arises from the ego's delusion that you are a separate fragment that is<br>disconnected from the power that lies behind all creation. Through<br>enjoyment, you link into that universal creative power itself.<br>When you make the present moment, instead of past and future, the<br>focal point of your life, your ability to enjoy what you do – and with it the<br>quality of your life – increases dramatically. Joy is the dynamic aspect of<br>Being. When the creative power of the universe becomes conscious of itself,<br>it manifests as joy. You don't have to wait for something “meaningful” to<br>come into your life so that you can finally enjoy what you do. There is more<br>meaning in joy than you will ever need. The “waiting to start living”<br>syndrome is one of the most common delusions of the unconscious state.<br>Expansion and positive change on the outer level is much more likely to<br>come into your life if you can enjoy what you are doing already, instead of<br>waiting for some change so that you can start enjoying what you do.<br>Don't ask your mind for permission to enjoy what you do. All you will<br>get is plenty of reasons why you can't enjoy it. “Not now,” the mind will say.<br>“Can't you see I'm busy? There's no time. Maybe tomorrow you can start<br>enjoying....” That tomorrow will never come unless you begin enjoying what<br>you are doing now.<br>When you say, I enjoy doing this or that, it is really a misperception. It<br>makes it appear that the joy comes from what you do, but that is not the case.<br>Joy does not come from what you do, it flows into what you do and thus into<br>this world from deep within you. The misperception that joy comes from<br>what you do is normal, and it is also dangerous, because it creates the belief<br>that joy is something that can be derived form something else, such as an<br>activity or thing. You then look to the world to bring you joy, happiness. But<br>it cannot do that. This is why many people live in constant frustration. The<br>world is not giving them what they think they need.<br>Then what is the relationship between something that you do and the<br>state of joy? You will enjoy any activity in which you are fully present, any<br>activity that is not just a means to an end. It isn't the action you perform that<br>you really enjoy, but the deep sense of aliveness that flows into it. That<br>aliveness is one with who you are. This means that when you enjoy doing<br>something, you are really experiencing the joy of Being in its dynamic<br>aspect. That's why anything you enjoy doing connects you with the power<br>behind all creation.<br>Here is a spiritual practice that will bring empowerment and creative<br>expansion into your life. Make a list of a number of everyday routine<br>activities that you perform frequently. Include activities hat you may<br>consider uninteresting, boring, tedious, irritating, or stressful. But don't<br>include anything that you hate or detest doing. That's a case either for<br>acceptance or for stopping what you do. The list may include traveling to and<br>from work, buying groceries, doing your laundry, or anything that you find<br>tedious or stressful in your daily work. Then, whenever you are engaged in<br>those activities, let hem be a vehicle for alertness. Be absolutely present in<br>what you do and sense the alert, alive stillness within you in the background<br>of the activity. You will soon find that what you do in such a state of<br>heightened awareness, instead of being stressful, tedious, or irritating, is<br>actually becoming enjoyable. To be more precise, what you are enjoying is<br>not really the outward action but the inner dimension of consciousness hat<br>flows into the action. This is finding the joy of Being in what you are doing.<br>If you feel your life lacks significance or is too stressful or tedious, it is<br>because you haven't brought that dimension into your life yet. Being<br>conscious in what you do has not yet become your main aim.<br>The new earth arises as more and more people discover that their main<br>purpose in life is to bring the light of consciousness into this world and so<br>use whatever they do as a vehicle for consciousness.<br>The joy of Being is the joy of being conscious.<br>Awakened consciousness then takes over from ego and begins to run<br>your life. You may then find that an activity that you have been engaged in<br>for a long time naturally begins to expand into something much bigger when<br>it becomes empowered by consciousness.<br>Some of those people who, through creative action, enrich the lives of<br>many others simply do what they enjoy doing most without wanting to<br>achieve or become anything through that activity. They may be musicians,<br>artists, writers, scientists, teachers, or builders, or they may bring into<br>manifestation new social or business structures (enlightened businesses).<br>Sometimes for a few years their sphere of influence remains small; and then<br>it can happen that suddenly or gradually a wave of creative empowerment<br>flows into what they do, and their activity expands beyond anything they<br>could have imagined and touches countless others. In addition to enjoyment,<br>an intensity is now added to what they do and with it comes a creativity that<br>goes beyond anything an ordinary human could accomplish.<br>But don't let it go to your head, because up there is where a remnant of<br>ego may be hiding. You are still an ordinary human. What is extraordinary is<br>what comes through you into this world. But that essence you share with all<br>beings. The fourteenthcentury<br>Persian poet and Sufi master Hafiz expresses<br>this truth beautifully: “I am a hole in a flute that the Christ's breath moves<br>through. Listen to this music.” 1<br>ENTHUSIASM<br>Then there is another way of creative manifestation that may come to<br>those who remain true to their inner purpose of awakening. Suddenly one<br>day they know what their outer purpose is. They have a great vision, a goal,<br>and from then on they work toward implementing that goal. Their goal or<br>vision is usually connected in some way to something that on a smaller scale<br>they are doing and enjoy doing already. This is where the third modality of<br>awakened doing arises: enthusiasm.<br>Enthusiasm mans there is deep enjoyment in what you do plus the<br>added element of a goal or a vision that you work toward. When you add a<br>goal to the enjoyment of what you do, the energyfield<br>or vibrational<br>frequency changes. A certain degree of what we might call structural tension<br>is now added to enjoyment, and so it turns into enthusiasm. At the height of<br>creative activity fueled by enthusiasm, there will be enormous intensity and<br>energy behind what you do. You will feel like an arrow hat is moving toward<br>the target – and enjoying the journey.<br>To an onlooker, it may appear that you are under stress, but the<br>intensity of enthusiasm has nothing to do with stress. When you want to<br>arrive at your goal more than you want to be doing what you are doing, you<br>become stressed. The balance between enjoyment and structural tension is<br>lost, and the latter has won. When there is stress, it is usually a sign that the<br>ego has returned , and you are cutting yourself off form the creative power of<br>the universe. Instead, there is only the force and strain of egoic wanting, and<br>so you have to struggle and “work hard” to make it. Stress always diminishes<br>both the quality and effectiveness of what you do under its influence. There<br>is also a strong link between stress and negative emotions, such as anxiety<br>and anger. It is toxic to the body and is now becoming recognized as one of<br>the main causes of the socalled<br>degenerative diseases such as cancer and<br>heart disease.<br>Unlike stress, enthusiasm has a high energy frequency and so<br>resonates with the creative power of the universe. This is why Ralph Waldo<br>Emerson said that, “Nothing great has ever been achieved without<br>enthusiasm.”2 The word enthusiasm comes from ancient Greek – en and<br>theos meaning God. And the related word enthousiazein means “to be<br>possessed by a god.” With enthusiasm you will find that you don't have to do<br>it all by yourself. In fact, there is nothing of significance that you can do by<br>yourself. Sustained enthusiasm brings into existence a wave of creative<br>energy, and all you have to do then is “ride the wave.”<br>Enthusiasm brings an enormous empowerment into what you do, so<br>that all those who have not accessed that power would look upon “your<br>achievements in awe and may equate them with who you are. You, however,<br>know the truth that Jesus pointed to when he said, “I can of my own self do<br>nothing.”3 Unlike egoic wanting, which creates opposition indirect<br>proportion to the intensity of its wanting, enthusiasm never opposes. It is<br>nonconfrontational.<br>Its activity does not create winners and losers. It is<br>based on inclusion, not exclusion, of others. It does not need to use and<br>manipulate people, because it is the power of creation itself and so does not<br>need to take energy from some secondary source. The ego's wanting always<br>tries to take form something or someone; enthusiasm gives out of its own<br>abundance. When enthusiasm encounters obstacles in the form of adverse<br>situations or uncooperative people, it never attacks but walks around them or<br>by yielding or embracing turns the opposing energy into a helpful one, the<br>foe into a friend.<br>Enthusiasm and the ego cannot coexist. one implies the absence of the<br>other. Enthusiasm knows where it is going, but at the same time, it is deeply<br>at one with the present moment, the source of its aliveness, its joy, and its<br>power. Enthusiasm “wants” nothing because it lacks nothing. It is at one<br>with life and no matter how dynamic the enthusiasminspired<br>activities are,<br>you don't lose yourself in them. And there remains always a still but<br>intensely alive space at the center of the wheel, a core of peace in the midst<br>of activity that is both the source of all and untouched by it all.<br>Through enthusiasm you enter into full alignment with the outgoing<br>creative principle of the universe, but without identifying with its creation,<br>that is to say, without ego. where there is no identification, there is no<br>attachment – one of the great sources of suffering. Once a wave of creative<br>energy has passed, structural tension diminishes again and joy in what you<br>are doing remains. Nobody can live in enthusiasm all the time. A new wave<br>of creative energy may come later and lead to renewed enthusiasm.<br>When the return movement toward the dissolution of form sets in,<br>enthusiasm no longer serves you. Enthusiasm belongs to the outgoing cycle<br>of life. It is only through surrender that you can align yourself with the return<br>movement – the journey home.<br>To sum up: Enjoyment of what you are doing, combined with a goal or<br>vision that you work toward, becomes enthusiasm. Even though you have a<br>goal, what you are doing in the present moment needs to remain the focal<br>point of your attention; otherwise, you will fall out of alignment with<br>universal purpose. Make sure your vision or goal is not an inflated image of<br>yourself and therefore a concealed form of ego, such as wanting to become a<br>movie star, a famous writer, or a wealthy entrepreneur. Also make sure your<br>goal is not focused on having this or that, such as a mansion by the sea, your<br>own company, or ten million dollars in the bank. An enlarged image of<br>yourself or a vision of yourself having this or that are all static goals and<br>therefore don't empower you. Instead, make sure your goals are dynamic,<br>that is to say, point toward an activity that you are engaged in and through<br>which you are connected to other human beings as well as to the whole.<br>Instead of seeing yourself as a famous actor and writer and so on, see<br>yourself inspiring countless people with your work and enriching their lives.<br>Feel how that activity enriches or deepens not only your life but that of<br>countless others. Feel yourself being an opening through which energy flows<br>form the unmanifested Source of all life through you for the benefit of all.<br>All this implies hat your goal or vision is then already a reality within<br>you, on the level of mind and of feeling. Enthusiasm is the power that<br>transfers the mental blueprint into the physical dimension. That is the<br>creative use of mind, and that is why here is no wanting involve. You cannot<br>manifest what you want; you can only manifest what you already have. You<br>may get what you want through hard work and stress, but that is not the way<br>of the new earth. Jesus gave the key to the creative use of mind and to the<br>conscious manifestation of form when he said, 'Whatever you ask in prayer,<br>believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.”4</p>

              <p>To my understanding, perserverence is a strength to move on and
              continue with whatever we are doing, and as a forummer said
              'determined'... but we must always observe whether there is
              attachment involved, like whether there is attachment,
              unwillingness or reluctance to lose something, etc. Is our mind
              obsessed with external seeking that it loses itself in the future
              and reduce this moment as a means to an end?</p>
              <p>Whenever we do anything, don't let fear be the driving force..
              Is there joy or is it fear or greed that drives you? Is there peace
              and contentment or resistance and discontent.</p>
              <p>Ask yourself -- is there joy, enthusiasm, or acceptance in what
              you do? (see below) What is the state of consciousness or driving
              force of perserverence.</p>
              <p>Always be aware of your inner state.. mindfulness/awareness is
              important, and whenever negative states/emotions/thoughts arise we
              must learn how to drop, dont let it pollute your inner state and
              affect what you do. Stay mentally clear and mindful and just do
              your best.</p>
              <p>I hope the following helps:</p>
              <p>AWAKENED DOING<br> Awakened doing is the outer aspect of the next stage in the
              evolution<br> of consciousness on our planet. The closer we get to the end of our
              present<br> evolutionary stage, the more dysfunctional the ego becomes, in the
              same way<br> that a caterpillar becomes dysfunctional just before it transforms
              into a<br> butterfly. But the new consciousness is arising even as the old
              dissolves.<br> We are in the midst of a momentous event in the evolution of
              human<br> consciousness, but they won't be talking about it in the news
              tonight. On our<br> planet, and perhaps simultaneously in many parts of our galaxy and
              beyond,<br> consciousness is awakening from the dream of form. This does not
              mean all<br> forms (the world) are going to dissolve, although quite a few
              almost certainly<br> will. It means consciousness can now begin to create form without
              losing<br> itself in it. It can remain conscious of itself, even while it
              creates and<br> experiences form. Why should it continue to create and experience
              form?<br> For the enjoyment of it. How does consciousness do that?
              Through<br> awakened humans who have learned the meaning of awakened
              doing.<br> Awakened doing is the alignment of your outer purposewhat<br> you do<br> – with your inner purpose – awakening and staying awake.
              Through<br> awakened doing, you become one with the outgoing purpose of the
              universe.<br> Consciousness flows through you into this world. It flows into your
              thoughts<br> and inspires them. It flows into what you do and guides and
              empowers it.<br> Not what you do, but how you do what you do determines
              whether<br> you are fulfilling your destiny. And how you do what you do is
              determined<br> by your state of consciousness.<br> A reversal of your priorities comes about when the main purpose
              for<br> doing what you do becomes the doing itself, or rather, the current
              of<br> consciousness that flows into what you do. That current of
              consciousness is<br> what determines quality. Another way of putting it: In any
              situation and in<br> whatever you do, your state of consciousness is the primary factor;
              the<br> situation and what you do is secondary. “Future” success is
              dependent upon<br> and inseparable from the consciousness out of which the actions
              emanate.<br> That can be either the reactive force of the ego or the alert
              attention of<br> awakened consciousness. All truly successful action comes out of
              that field<br> of alert attention, rather than from ego and conditioned,
              unconscious<br> thinking.</p>
              <p><br> THE THREE MODALITIES OF AWAKENED DOING<br> There are three ways in which consciousness can flow into what
              you<br> do and thus through you into this world, three modalities in which
              you can<br> align your life with the creative power of the universe. Modality
              means the<br> underlying energyfrequency<br> that flows into what you do and connects your<br> actions with the awakened consciousness hat is emerging into this
              world.<br> What you do will be dysfunctional and of the ego unless it arises
              out of one<br> of these three modalities. They may change during the course of a
              day,<br> although one of them may be dominant during a certain stage in your
              life.<br> Each modality is appropriate to certain situations.<br> The modalities of awakened doing are acceptance, enjoyment,
              and<br> enthusiasm. Each one represents a certain vibrational frequency
              of<br> consciousness. You need to be vigilant to make sure that one of
              them<br> operates whenever you are engaged in doing anything at all – from
              the most<br> simple task to the most complex. If you are not in the state of
              either<br> acceptance, enjoyment, or enthusiasm, look closely and you will
              find that<br> you are creating suffering for yourself and others.<br> ACCEPTANCE<br> Whatever you cannot enjoy doing, you can at least accept that this
              is<br> what you have to do. Acceptance means: For now, this is what this
              situation,<br> this moment, requires me to do, and so I do it willingly. We
              already spoke at<br> length about the importance of inner acceptance of what happens,
              and<br> acceptance of what you have to do is just another aspect of it. For
              example,<br> you probably won't be able to enjoy changing the flat tire on your
              car at night<br> in the middle of nowhere and in pouring rain, let alone be
              enthusiastic about<br> it, but you can bring acceptance to it. Performing an action in the
              state of<br> acceptance means you are at peace while you do it. That peace is a
              subtle<br> energy vibration which then flows into what you do. On the
              surface,<br> acceptance looks like a passive state, but in reality it is active
              and creative<br> because it brings something entirely new into this world. That
              peace, that<br> subtle energy vibration, is consciousness, and one of the ways in
              which ti<br> enters this world is through surrendered action, one aspect of
              which is<br> acceptance.<br> If you can neither enjoy or bring acceptance to what you do –
              stop.<br> Otherwise, you are not taking responsibility for the only thing you
              can really<br> take responsibility for, which also happens to be one thing that
              really<br> matters: your state of consciousness. And if you are not taking
              responsibility<br> for your state of consciousness, you are not taking responsibility
              for life.<br> ENJOYMENT<br> The peace that comes with surrendered action turns to a sense
              of<br> aliveness when you actually enjoy what you are doing. Enjoyment is
              the<br> second modality of awakened doing. On the new earth, enjoyment
              will<br> replace wanting as the motivating power behind people's actions.
              Wanting<br> arises from the ego's delusion that you are a separate fragment
              that is<br> disconnected from the power that lies behind all creation.
              Through<br> enjoyment, you link into that universal creative power
              itself.<br> When you make the present moment, instead of past and future,
              the<br> focal point of your life, your ability to enjoy what you do – and
              with it the<br> quality of your life – increases dramatically. Joy is the dynamic
              aspect of<br> Being. When the creative power of the universe becomes conscious of
              itself,<br> it manifests as joy. You don't have to wait for something
              “meaningful” to<br> come into your life so that you can finally enjoy what you do.
              There is more<br> meaning in joy than you will ever need. The “waiting to start
              living”<br> syndrome is one of the most common delusions of the unconscious
              state.<br> Expansion and positive change on the outer level is much more
              likely to<br> come into your life if you can enjoy what you are doing already,
              instead of<br> waiting for some change so that you can start enjoying what you
              do.<br> Don't ask your mind for permission to enjoy what you do. All you
              will<br> get is plenty of reasons why you can't enjoy it. “Not now,” the
              mind will say.<br> “Can't you see I'm busy? There's no time. Maybe tomorrow you can
              start<br> enjoying....” That tomorrow will never come unless you begin
              enjoying what<br> you are doing now.<br> When you say, I enjoy doing this or that, it is really a
              misperception. It<br> makes it appear that the joy comes from what you do, but that is
              not the case.<br> Joy does not come from what you do, it flows into what you do and
              thus into<br> this world from deep within you. The misperception that joy comes
              from<br> what you do is normal, and it is also dangerous, because it creates
              the belief<br> that joy is something that can be derived form something else, such
              as an<br> activity or thing. You then look to the world to bring you joy,
              happiness. But<br> it cannot do that. This is why many people live in constant
              frustration. The<br> world is not giving them what they think they need.<br> Then what is the relationship between something that you do and
              the<br> state of joy? You will enjoy any activity in which you are fully
              present, any<br> activity that is not just a means to an end. It isn't the action
              you perform that<br> you really enjoy, but the deep sense of aliveness that flows into
              it. That<br> aliveness is one with who you are. This means that when you enjoy
              doing<br> something, you are really experiencing the joy of Being in its
              dynamic<br> aspect. That's why anything you enjoy doing connects you with the
              power<br> behind all creation.<br> Here is a spiritual practice that will bring empowerment and
              creative<br> expansion into your life. Make a list of a number of everyday
              routine<br> activities that you perform frequently. Include activities hat you
              may<br> consider uninteresting, boring, tedious, irritating, or stressful.
              But don't<br> include anything that you hate or detest doing. That's a case
              either for<br> acceptance or for stopping what you do. The list may include
              traveling to and<br> from work, buying groceries, doing your laundry, or anything that
              you find<br> tedious or stressful in your daily work. Then, whenever you are
              engaged in<br> those activities, let hem be a vehicle for alertness. Be absolutely
              present in<br> what you do and sense the alert, alive stillness within you in the
              background<br> of the activity. You will soon find that what you do in such a
              state of<br> heightened awareness, instead of being stressful, tedious, or
              irritating, is<br> actually becoming enjoyable. To be more precise, what you are
              enjoying is<br> not really the outward action but the inner dimension of
              consciousness hat<br> flows into the action. This is finding the joy of Being in what you
              are doing.<br> If you feel your life lacks significance or is too stressful or
              tedious, it is<br> because you haven't brought that dimension into your life yet.
              Being<br> conscious in what you do has not yet become your main aim.<br> The new earth arises as more and more people discover that their
              main<br> purpose in life is to bring the light of consciousness into this
              world and so<br> use whatever they do as a vehicle for consciousness.<br> The joy of Being is the joy of being conscious.<br> Awakened consciousness then takes over from ego and begins to
              run<br> your life. You may then find that an activity that you have been
              engaged in<br> for a long time naturally begins to expand into something much
              bigger when<br> it becomes empowered by consciousness.<br> Some of those people who, through creative action, enrich the lives
              of<br> many others simply do what they enjoy doing most without wanting
              to<br> achieve or become anything through that activity. They may be
              musicians,<br> artists, writers, scientists, teachers, or builders, or they may
              bring into<br> manifestation new social or business structures (enlightened
              businesses).<br> Sometimes for a few years their sphere of influence remains small;
              and then<br> it can happen that suddenly or gradually a wave of creative
              empowerment<br> flows into what they do, and their activity expands beyond anything
              they<br> could have imagined and touches countless others. In addition to
              enjoyment,<br> an intensity is now added to what they do and with it comes a
              creativity that<br> goes beyond anything an ordinary human could accomplish.<br> But don't let it go to your head, because up there is where a
              remnant of<br> ego may be hiding. You are still an ordinary human. What is
              extraordinary is<br> what comes through you into this world. But that essence you share
              with all<br> beings. The fourteenthcentury<br> Persian poet and Sufi master Hafiz expresses<br> this truth beautifully: “I am a hole in a flute that the Christ's
              breath moves<br> through. Listen to this music.” 1<br> ENTHUSIASM<br> Then there is another way of creative manifestation that may come
              to<br> those who remain true to their inner purpose of awakening. Suddenly
              one<br> day they know what their outer purpose is. They have a great
              vision, a goal,<br> and from then on they work toward implementing that goal. Their
              goal or<br> vision is usually connected in some way to something that on a
              smaller scale<br> they are doing and enjoy doing already. This is where the third
              modality of<br> awakened doing arises: enthusiasm.<br> Enthusiasm mans there is deep enjoyment in what you do plus
              the<br> added element of a goal or a vision that you work toward. When you
              add a<br> goal to the enjoyment of what you do, the energyfield<br> or vibrational<br> frequency changes. A certain degree of what we might call
              structural tension<br> is now added to enjoyment, and so it turns into enthusiasm. At the
              height of<br> creative activity fueled by enthusiasm, there will be enormous
              intensity and<br> energy behind what you do. You will feel like an arrow hat is
              moving toward<br> the target – and enjoying the journey.<br> To an onlooker, it may appear that you are under stress, but
              the<br> intensity of enthusiasm has nothing to do with stress. When you
              want to<br> arrive at your goal more than you want to be doing what you are
              doing, you<br> become stressed. The balance between enjoyment and structural
              tension is<br> lost, and the latter has won. When there is stress, it is usually a
              sign that the<br> ego has returned , and you are cutting yourself off form the
              creative power of<br> the universe. Instead, there is only the force and strain of egoic
              wanting, and<br> so you have to struggle and “work hard” to make it. Stress always
              diminishes<br> both the quality and effectiveness of what you do under its
              influence. There<br> is also a strong link between stress and negative emotions, such as
              anxiety<br> and anger. It is toxic to the body and is now becoming recognized
              as one of<br> the main causes of the socalled<br> degenerative diseases such as cancer and<br> heart disease.<br> Unlike stress, enthusiasm has a high energy frequency and so<br> resonates with the creative power of the universe. This is why
              Ralph Waldo<br> Emerson said that, “Nothing great has ever been achieved
              without<br> enthusiasm.”2 The word enthusiasm comes from ancient Greek – en
              and<br> theos meaning God. And the related word enthousiazein means “to
              be<br> possessed by a god.” With enthusiasm you will find that you don't
              have to do<br> it all by yourself. In fact, there is nothing of significance that
              you can do by<br> yourself. Sustained enthusiasm brings into existence a wave of
              creative<br> energy, and all you have to do then is “ride the wave.”<br> Enthusiasm brings an enormous empowerment into what you do,
              so<br> that all those who have not accessed that power would look upon
              “your<br> achievements in awe and may equate them with who you are. You,
              however,<br> know the truth that Jesus pointed to when he said, “I can of my own
              self do<br> nothing.”3 Unlike egoic wanting, which creates opposition
              indirect<br> proportion to the intensity of its wanting, enthusiasm never
              opposes. It is<br> nonconfrontational.<br> Its activity does not create winners and losers. It is<br> based on inclusion, not exclusion, of others. It does not need to
              use and<br> manipulate people, because it is the power of creation itself and
              so does not<br> need to take energy from some secondary source. The ego's wanting
              always<br> tries to take form something or someone; enthusiasm gives out of
              its own<br> abundance. When enthusiasm encounters obstacles in the form of
              adverse<br> situations or uncooperative people, it never attacks but walks
              around them or<br> by yielding or embracing turns the opposing energy into a helpful
              one, the<br> foe into a friend.<br> Enthusiasm and the ego cannot coexist. one implies the absence of
              the<br> other. Enthusiasm knows where it is going, but at the same time, it
              is deeply<br> at one with the present moment, the source of its aliveness, its
              joy, and its<br> power. Enthusiasm “wants” nothing because it lacks nothing. It is
              at one<br> with life and no matter how dynamic the enthusiasminspired<br> activities are,<br> you don't lose yourself in them. And there remains always a still
              but<br> intensely alive space at the center of the wheel, a core of peace
              in the midst<br> of activity that is both the source of all and untouched by it
              all.<br> Through enthusiasm you enter into full alignment with the
              outgoing<br> creative principle of the universe, but without identifying with
              its creation,<br> that is to say, without ego. where there is no identification,
              there is no<br> attachment – one of the great sources of suffering. Once a wave of
              creative<br> energy has passed, structural tension diminishes again and joy in
              what you<br> are doing remains. Nobody can live in enthusiasm all the time. A
              new wave<br> of creative energy may come later and lead to renewed
              enthusiasm.<br> When the return movement toward the dissolution of form sets
              in,<br> enthusiasm no longer serves you. Enthusiasm belongs to the outgoing
              cycle<br> of life. It is only through surrender that you can align yourself
              with the return<br> movement – the journey home.<br> To sum up: Enjoyment of what you are doing, combined with a goal
              or<br> vision that you work toward, becomes enthusiasm. Even though you
              have a<br> goal, what you are doing in the present moment needs to remain the
              focal<br> point of your attention; otherwise, you will fall out of alignment
              with<br> universal purpose. Make sure your vision or goal is not an inflated
              image of<br> yourself and therefore a concealed form of ego, such as wanting to
              become a<br> movie star, a famous writer, or a wealthy entrepreneur. Also make
              sure your<br> goal is not focused on having this or that, such as a mansion by
              the sea, your<br> own company, or ten million dollars in the bank. An enlarged image
              of<br> yourself or a vision of yourself having this or that are all static
              goals and<br> therefore don't empower you. Instead, make sure your goals are
              dynamic,<br> that is to say, point toward an activity that you are engaged in
              and through<br> which you are connected to other human beings as well as to the
              whole.<br> Instead of seeing yourself as a famous actor and writer and so on,
              see<br> yourself inspiring countless people with your work and enriching
              their lives.<br> Feel how that activity enriches or deepens not only your life but
              that of<br> countless others. Feel yourself being an opening through which
              energy flows<br> form the unmanifested Source of all life through you for the
              benefit of all.<br> All this implies hat your goal or vision is then already a reality
              within<br> you, on the level of mind and of feeling. Enthusiasm is the power
              that<br> transfers the mental blueprint into the physical dimension. That is
              the<br> creative use of mind, and that is why here is no wanting involve.
              You cannot<br> manifest what you want; you can only manifest what you already
              have. You<br> may get what you want through hard work and stress, but that is not
              the way<br> of the new earth. Jesus gave the key to the creative use of mind
              and to the<br> conscious manifestation of form when he said, 'Whatever you ask in
              prayer,<br> believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.”4</p>
