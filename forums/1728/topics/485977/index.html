              <p class="story-body-text" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>Gary Gutting</span></strong><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>: Philosophy of religion typically focuses on
              questions and disputes about the ideas and doctrines of monotheistic religions,
              with Christianity the primary model. How does the discussion change if we add
              Buddhism, which is neither monotheistic nor polytheistic, as a primary model of
              a religion?</span></p>
              <p class="story-body-text" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>Jay Garfield</span></strong><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>: What gets called “philosophy of religion”
              in most philosophy departments and journals is really the philosophy of
              Abrahamic religion: basically, Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Most of the
              questions addressed in those discussions are simply irrelevant to most of the
              world’s other religious traditions. Philosophers look at other religious
              traditions with the presumption that they are more or less the same, at least in
              outline, as the Abrahamic religions, and even fight about whether other
              traditions count as religions at all based upon their sharing certain features
              of the Abrahamic religions. That is a serious ethnocentrism that can really
              blind us to important phenomena.</span></p>
              <p class="story-body-text" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>For instance, I recently moderated a
              discussion in Singapore with the philosopher A.C. Grayling, who claimed that
              Buddhism is not a religion because Buddhists don’t believe in a supreme being.
              This simply ignores the fact that many religions are not theistic in this
              sense. Chess is a game, despite the fact that it is not played with a ball,
              after all.</span></p>
              <p class="story-body-text" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>Now, when we address Buddhism, we must be
              very careful. The Buddhist world is vast, and Buddhism has been around in
              various forms for two and a half millennia. There are many forms of Buddhist
              practice and culture, many Buddhist communities of belief and practice and
              significant doctrinal differences among Buddhist schools. So generalization can
              be dangerous. Just as we need to be careful about lumping Unitarians and
              Catholics together when we ask whether Christians accept the transubstantiation
              of the host, we must be careful about lumping together, for instance, Theravada
              monks in Sri Lanka with lay Zen practitioners in San Francisco. And there is no
              central doctrinal authority or organization that covers all of the Buddhist
              world.</span></p>
              <p class="story-body-text" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>Still, there are some widely shared features
              of Buddhism that would make a philosophy of religion that took it seriously
              look quite different. First, since Buddhism is an atheistic religion, it
              doesn’t raise questions about the existence of God that so dominate the
              philosophy of Abrahamic religions, let alone questions about the attributes of
              the deity. Buddhists do worry about awakening (Buddhahood). How hard is it to
              achieve? What is it like? Is a Buddha aware of her surroundings, or do they
              disappear as illusory?</span></p>
              <p class="story-body-text" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>Buddhists also worry about the relation
              between ordinary reality, or conventional truth, and ultimate reality. Are they
              the same or different? Is the world fundamentally illusory, or is it real? They
              worry about hermeneutical questions concerning the intent of apparently
              conflicting canonical scriptures, and how to resolve them. They ask about the
              nature of the person, and its relationship to more fundamental psychophysical
              processes. Stuff like that. The philosophy of religion looks different if these
              are taken to be some of its fundamental questions.</span></p>
              <p class="story-body-text" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>G.G.</span></strong><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>: Given
              these widely shared features, would you venture to say what, over all, it is to
              be a Buddhist?</span></p>
              <p class="story-body-text" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>J.G.</span></strong><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>: To be a
              Buddhist is to take refuge in the three Buddhist refuge objects (often called
              “the three jewels”): the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha. To take refuge is to see
              human existence as fundamentally unsatisfactory and to see the three jewels as
              the only solution to this predicament.</span></p>
              <p class="story-body-text" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>The first refuge object is the Buddha: the
              fact that at least one person — the historical Buddha Siddhartha Gautama — has
              achieved awakening and release from suffering. This provides hope in one’s own
              future awakening, hope that through practice one can achieve a satisfactory
              existence. The second refuge is Dharma, or Buddhist doctrine. The third is the
              Sangha, or spiritual community, conceived sometimes as the community of other
              practitioners, sometimes as the community of monks and nuns, sometimes as the
              community of awakened beings. The project of full awakening is a collective,
              not an individual, venture.</span></p>
              <p class="story-body-text" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>G.G.</span></strong><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>: The first
              and the third refuges seem to correspond to a way of life, justified simply by
              its results in relieving sufferings. What’s involved in the second refuge, the
              doctrines?</span></p>
              <p class="story-body-text" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>J.G.</span></strong><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>: The
              foundation of doctrine in all Buddhist schools is the so-called four noble
              truths, explained by Siddhartha in his first talk after gaining awakening. The
              first is that life is fundamentally unsatisfactory, permeated by suffering of
              various types, including pain, aging and death and the inability to control
              one’s own destiny. The second is that this suffering is caused by attraction
              and aversion — attraction to things one can’t have, and aversion to things one
              can’t avoid, and that this attraction and aversion is in turn caused by primal
              confusion about the fundamental nature of reality and a consequent egocentric
              orientation to the world. The third is that if one extirpates these causes by
              eliminating attraction and aversion through metaphysical insight, one can
              eliminate suffering. The fourth is the specification of a set of domains and
              concerns — the eightfold path — attention to which can accomplish that.</span></p>
              <p class="story-body-text" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>G.G.</span></strong><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>: It seems
              then that the Buddhist way of life is based on, first, the plausible claim that
              suffering makes life unsatisfactory and, second, on a psychological account —
              again plausible — of the causes of suffering. But what’s the “metaphysical insight,”
              the truth about reality that shows the way to eliminating suffering?</span></p>
              <p class="story-body-text" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>J.G.</span></strong><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>: Buddhist
              doctrine regarding the nature of reality generally focuses on three principal
              characteristics of things. The first idea is that all phenomena are impermanent
              and constantly changing, despite the fact that we engage with them as though
              they are permanent; the second is that they are interdependent, although we
              engage with them as though they are independent; the third is that they are
              without any intrinsic identity, although we treat ourselves and other objects
              as though they have intrinsic identities.</span></p>
              <p class="story-body-text" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>Now, many Buddhists and Buddhist schools are
              committed to much more extensive and detailed metaphysical doctrines, including
              doctrines about the fundamental constituents of reality, or dharmas, often
              conceived as momentary property instantiations, or about the nature of
              consciousness, or about cosmology. Buddhist schools and traditions vary widely
              in these respects. And of course there are vast differences between what lay
              Buddhists and what scholars understand about Buddhist doctrine. In Buddhism, as
              in Christianity, for many lay people the religion is about daily rituals and
              practices, and doctrine is left to scholars and clerics. And ideas that are
              complex metaphors to the erudite are literal for the laity.</span></p>
              <p class="story-body-text" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>G.G.</span></strong><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>: You
              haven’t mentioned what, to many outsiders, might seem the most striking
              Buddhist doctrine: reincarnation.</span></p>
              <p class="story-body-text" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>J.G.</span></strong><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>: I would,
              first, drop the term “reincarnation,” which has a more natural home in a Hindu
              context, in favor of “rebirth,” which makes more sense in a Buddhist context.
              That is because we must understand this doctrine in relation to the central
              doctrine in all Buddhist schools: that there is no self or soul. So there is
              nothing that takes on new bodies as does the soul in the Hindu traditions from
              which Buddhism arose and against which it reacted.</span></p>
              <p class="story-body-text" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>Indeed, given the radical Buddhist notion of
              momentary impermanence, we can say without exaggeration that one is reborn
              every moment. Buddhism is an Indian tradition, and rebirth across biological
              lives is taken for granted in most classical Indian philosophical and religious
              traditions. Buddhism takes that over, and it is taken for granted in many
              Buddhist traditions that the same kinds of causal continuity that obtain among
              subsequent stages within a life obtain between stages of our current biological
              lives and those of past and future biological lives. Many Buddhists would even
              take this to be an essential commitment of the religious tradition. But in some
              Buddhist traditions, especially those of East Asia, this view plays no role at
              all, and many Western Buddhists reject it altogether.</span></p>
              <p class="story-body-text" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>G.G.</span></strong><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>: How do
              Buddhists think of other religions? On the one hand, there seems to be a
              tolerance and even an appreciation for a diversity of views. On the other hand,
              there is a strong history of missionary activity, aimed at conversion.</span></p>
              <p class="story-body-text" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>J.G.</span></strong><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>: Exactly
              right. And again, we must be careful about taking the Abrahamic traditions as a
              default framework in which to pose this question. The Abrahamic religions all
              prohibit syncretism, or the melding of beliefs from different creeds, but this
              is not a common feature of world religious traditions. Many Buddhists are
              syncretic to some degree. In Japan it is common to practice both Buddhism and
              Shinto; in Nepal many adopt Buddhist and Hindu practices; in China, Daoism,
              Confucianism and Buddhism blend happily. And Thomas Merton was a Catholic
              priest and a Buddhist practitioner.</span></p>
              <p class="story-body-text" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>But Buddhism has always been missionary.
              Buddhists have always thought that their doctrine and practices can help to
              alleviate suffering and so have urged others to accept them. Sometimes
              acceptance of Buddhist practices requires one to rethink other religious
              commitments; sometimes the two can be integrated. Sometimes there is creative
              tension.</span></p>
              <p class="story-body-text" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>G.G.</span></strong><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>: I can see
              Buddhist missionaries making an attractive case for their practices of
              meditation and their ethics of compassion. But the doctrine of rebirth — which,
              if true, would make a huge difference in how we view human existence — seems
              very implausible. How do Buddhists defend this doctrine?</span></p>
              <p class="story-body-text" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>J.G.</span></strong><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>: Once
              again, there is diversity here. Some Buddhists don’t defend the doctrine at
              all, either because they take it to be the obvious default position, as it is
              in some cultures, particularly in South Asia, or because it is not important or
              taken seriously, as in some East Asian or Western traditions. But others do
              defend it. One popular approach is an empirical argument, to wit, that some
              people have clear memories of past lives or make clear and accurate predictions
              about their next lives. One sees this primarily in the Tibetan tradition in
              which there is a widespread practice of identifying rebirths and of rebirth
              lineages for high lamas, such as the Dalai Lama.</span></p>
              <p class="story-body-text" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>G.G.</span></strong><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>: I suspect
              that people not already culturally disposed to accept rebirth aren’t likely to
              find such evidence convincing.</span></p>
              <p class="story-body-text" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>J.G.</span></strong><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>: Another
              approach is that of the Indian philosopher Dharmakirti, who argues for the
              necessity of believing in rebirth, though not directly for its reality.
              Dharmakirti argues that given the stupendous difficulty of achieving full
              awakening, the cultivation of a genuine aspiration to achieve awakening, which
              is essential to Mahayana Buddhist practice, requires one to believe in future
              lives; otherwise, one could not have the confidence in the possibility of
              success necessary to genuine resolution.</span></p>
              <p class="story-body-text" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>This is worth comparing to Kant’s argument
              that one must believe in free will in order to act and in order to treat
              oneself and others as moral agents, which nonetheless is not a direct argument
              for the freedom of the will, only for the necessity of the belief for moral
              life.</span></p>
              <p class="story-body-text" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>G.G.</span></strong><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>: Kant’s
              argument has received a lot of criticism from philosophers. Do you think
              Dharmakirti’s works?</span></p>
              <p class="story-body-text" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>J.G.</span></strong><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>: No, I have
              argued elsewhere that this is a bad argument for its intended conclusion. It
              confuses a commitment to the existence of future lives with a commitment to the
              existence of one’s own future life, and a commitment to the attainment of
              awakening with a commitment to one’s own awakening.</span></p>
              <p class="story-body-text" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>But I do think it’s a good argument for an
              important conclusion in the neighborhood. For the aspiration for awakening —
              for a complete, liberative understanding of the nature of reality and of human
              life — need not, and should not, for a Mahayana Buddhist, be personalized. Just
              as a stonemason building the ground floor of a medieval cathedral might aspire
              to its completion even if he knows that he will not personally be around to be
              involved in its completion, a practitioner who aspires that awakening will be
              achieved need not believe that she will be around to see it, but only hope that
              her own conduct and practice will facilitate that.</span></p>
              <p class="story-body-text" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>So, this suggests one way for a Buddhist not
              taken with the idea of personal rebirth across biological lives to take that
              doctrine as a useful metaphor: Treat the past reflectively and with gratitude
              and responsibility, and with an awareness that much of our present life is
              conditioned by our collective past; take the future seriously as something we
              have the responsibility to construct, just as much as if we would be there
              personally. This makes sense of the ideas, for instance, of intergenerational
              justice, or of collective contemporary responsibility for harms inflicted in
              the past, as well as our current personal responsibility to future generations.</span></p>
              <p class="story-body-text" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>As Buddhism takes root in the West and as
              Asian Buddhist traditions engage with modernity, we will see how doctrines such
              as this persist, fade, or are adapted. One thing we can see from the long and
              multicultural history of Buddhism is that it has always deeply affected the
              cultures into which it has moved, and has always been transformed in important
              ways by those cultures.</span></p>
              <p class="story-body-text" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>G.G.</span></strong><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>: Won’t the
              fundamental denial of a self be hard to maintain in the face of the modern
              emphasis on individuality?</span></p>
              <p class="story-body-text" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>J.G.</span></strong><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>: I don’t
              think so. For one thing, note that the view that there is no substantial self
              has a history in the West as well, in the thought of Hume, and of Nietzsche.
              For another, note that many contemporary cognitive scientists and philosophers
              have either rejected the view that there is such a self, or have defended some
              variety of a minimalist conception of the self. So the doctrine isn’t as secure
              in the non-Buddhist world as one might think.</span></p>
              <p class="story-body-text" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>And this may be a good thing, not only for
              metaphysical reasons. A strong sense of self — of one’s own substantial
              reality, uniqueness and independence of others — may not be psychologically or
              morally healthy. It can lead to egoism, to narcissism and to a lack of care for
              others. So the modern emphasis on individuality you mention might not be such a
              good thing. We might all be better off if we each took ourselves less seriously
              as selves. That may be one of the most important Buddhist critiques of
              modernity and contributions to post-modernity.</span></p>
              <p class="story-body-text" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>More positively, the Buddhist tradition
              encourages us to see ourselves as impermanent, interdependent individuals,
              linked to one another and to our world through shared commitments to achieving
              an understanding of our lives and a reduction of suffering. It encourages us to
              rethink egoism and to consider an orientation to the world characterized by
              care and joint responsibility. That can’t be a bad thing.</span></p>
