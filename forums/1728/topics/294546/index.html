If we killed someone and the ghost wants revenge, they can continue to haunt us in this lifetime.<br><br>As for NSmen, I think, ghost will not disturb them unless they disturb the ghost.</div>

If a ghost kills a human being, it will only increase his bad karma and possibly descend into even lower realms (such as hell).</div>

'cos if your ghosts are the one from the hungry ghost realm, most probably they are in such misery that they won't even entertain you.<br><br>If you consider them unbuddhistic (from this I assume that you're a buddhist), then you shouldn't be afraid.

            <div class='col-md body'>some people possess probrably because their mind are not positive or we call it in chinese 正 ，or if one's immune system is not that good(for eg. sick). It can also be due to karma one has done in his/her previous life. One more is that people often deal with occult matters, like medium tang ki or evoke spirits etc. I have one relative who was once possessed by my mother's grandmother because this relative is often exposed to temple mediums. Just like some people say, dont play with fire and you'll not get burnt.<br><br>To prevent such a risk, taking refuge in the triple gem is a wise thing to do. Sincerely repenting for our past bad karma is also a good way. To avoid negative energy, one has to be 正.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes unwholesome thought can be influence of planets, stars, surrounding or even anything. Its not only spirit. But when you truly understand that it is an unwholesome thought, then try to ignore it. Sometimes we cant control what we think seriously.
