              <div class="entry">(Last Updated: 14th March 2009)<br><br><span>Article written by: Thusness/PasserBy</span><br><br>Wonder
              why but of late, the topic on anatta kept surfacing in forums. Perhaps
              'yuan' (condition) has arisen. -:) I will just jot down some thoughts
              on my experiences of ‘no-self’. A casual sharing, nothing authentic.<br><br>The
              2 stanzas below are pivotal for leading me to the direct experience of
              no-self. Although they appear to convey the same stuff about anatta,
              meditating on these 2 stanzas can yield 2 very different experiential
              insights -- one on the emptiness aspect and the other, the non-dual
              luminosity aspect. The insights that arise from these experiences are
              very illuminating as they contradict so much our ordinary understanding
              of what awareness is.<br><br>
              <li><br>There is thinking, no thinker<br>There is hearing, no hearer<br>There is seeing, no seer<br></li>
              <br>
              <li><br>In thinking, just thoughts<br>In hearing, just sounds<br>In seeing, just forms, shapes and colors.<br></li>
              <br><br>Before
              proceeding any further, it is of absolute importance to know that there
              is no way the stanzas can be correctly understood by way of inference,
              logical deduction or induction. Not that there is something mystical or
              transcendental about the stanzas but simply the way of mental
              chattering is a 'wrong approach'. The right technique is through
              'vipassana' or any more direct and attentive bare mode of observation
              that allows the seeing of things as they are. Just a casual note, such
              mode of knowing turns natural when non-dual insight matures, before
              that it can be quite 'efforting'.<br><br><span style="font-size: large;"><a name="FirstStanza">On the first stanza</a></span><br><br>The
              two most obvious experiences from this initial glimpse of the first
              stanza is the lack of doer-ship and the direct insight of the absence
              of an agent. These 2 experiences are key for my phase 5 of the <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">7 phases of insights</a>.<br><br><span>1. The lack of doer-ship that links and co-ordinates experiences.</span><br>Without
              the 'I' that links, phenomena (thoughts, sound, feelings and so on and
              so forth) appear bubble-like, floating and manifesting freely,
              spontaneously and boundlessly. With the absence of the doer-ship also
              comes a deep sense of freedom and transparency. Ironical as it may
              sound but it's true experientially. We will not have the right
              understanding when we hold too tightly 'inherent' view. It is amazing
              how 'inherent' view prevents us from seeing freedom as no-doership,
              interdependence and interconnectedness, luminosity and non-dual
              presence.<br><br><span>2.  The direct insight of the absence of an agent.<br></span>In
              this case, there is a direct recognition that there is “no agent”. Just
              one thought then another thought. So it is always thought watching
              thought rather than a watcher watching thought. However the gist of
              this realization is skewed towards a spontaneous liberating experience
              and a vague glimpse of the empty nature of phenomena -- that is, the
              transient phenomena being bubble-like and ephemeral, nothing
              substantial or solid. At this phase we should not misunderstand that we
              have experienced thoroughly the ‘empty’ nature of phenomena and
              awareness, although there is this temptation to think we have. -:)<br><br>Depending on the conditions of an individual, it may not be obvious that it is <span>“always thought watching thought rather than a watcher watching thought.”  or "the watcher is that thought."</span> Because this is the key insight and a step that cannot afford to be
              wrong along the path of liberation, I cannot help but with some
              disrespectful tone say,<br><br><blockquote>For those masters that taught,<br>“Let thoughts arise and subside,<br>See the background mirror as perfect and be unaffected.”<br>With all due respect, they have just “blah” something nice but deluded.<br><br>Rather,<br><br>See that there is no one behind thoughts.<br>First, one thought then another thought.<br>With deepening insight it will later be revealed,<br>Always just this, One Thought!<br>Non-arising, luminous yet empty!<br></blockquote>And
              this is the whole purpose of anatta. To thoroughly see through that
              this background does not exist in actuality. What exists is a stream,
              action or karma. There is no doer or anything being done, there is only
              doing; No meditator nor meditation, only meditating. From a letting go
              perspective, "a watcher watching thought" will create the impression
              that a watcher is allowing thoughts to arise and subside while itself
              being unaffected. This is an illusion; it is 'holding' in disguise as
              'letting go'. When we realized that there is no background from start,
              reality will present itself as one whole letting go. With practice,
              ‘intention’ dwindles with the maturing of insight and ‘doing’ will be
              gradually experienced as mere spontaneous happening as if universe is
              doing the work. With the some pointers from 'dependent origination', we
              can then penetrate further to see this happening as a sheer expression
              of everything interacting with everything coming into being. <span>In
              fact, if we do not reify ‘universe’, it is just that -- an expression
              of interdependent arising that is just right wherever and whenever is. </span><br><br><blockquote>Understanding this, practice is simply opening to whatever is.<br>For this mere happening is just right wherever and whenever is.<br>Though no place can be called home it is everywhere home.<br><br>When experience matures in the practice of great ease,<br>The experience is Maha! Great, miraculous and bliss.<br>In mundane activities of seeing, eating and tasting,<br>When expressed poetically is as if the entire universe meditating.<br><br>Whatever said and expressed are really all different flavors,<br>Of this everything of everything dependently originating,<br>As this moment of vivid shimmering.<br></blockquote>By
              then it is clear that the transient phenomena is already happening in
              the perfect way; unwinding what must be unwinded, manifesting what must
              be manifested and subsides when it is time to go. There is no problem
              with this transient happening, the only problem is having an ‘extra
              mirror’, a reification due to the power of the mind to abstract. The
              mirror is not perfect; it is the happening that is perfect. The mirror
              appears to be perfect only to a dualistic and inherent view.<br><br>Our
              deeply held inherent and dualistic view has very subtly and unknowingly
              personified the "luminous aspect" into the watcher and discarded the
              "emptiness aspect" as the transient phenomena. The key challenge of
              practice is then to clearly see that luminosity and emptiness are one
              and inseparable, they have never and can never be separated.<br><span style="font-size: large;"><br></span><span style="font-size: large;"><a name="SecondStanza">On the second stanza</a></span><br><br>For the second stanza, <span>the focus is on the vivid, pristine-ness of transience phenomena</span>.
              Thoughts, sounds and all transient are indistinguishable from
              Awareness. There is no-experiencer-experience split, only one seamless
              spontaneous experience arising as thinker/thoughts, hearer/sounds,
              feeler/feelings and so on. In hearing, hearer and sound are
              indistinguishably one. For anyone that is familiar with the “I AM”
              experience, that pure sense of existence, that powerful experience of
              presence that makes one feel so real, is unforgettable. When the
              background is gone, all foreground phenomena reveal themselves as
              Presence. It is like naturally 'vipassanic' throughout or simply put,
              naked in awareness. From the hissing sound of PC, to the vibration of
              the moving MRT train, to the sensation when the feet touches the
              ground, all these experiences are crystal clear, no less “I AM” than “I
              AM”. The Presence is still fully present, nothing is denied. -:)<br><br><blockquote>Division of subject and object is merely an assumption.<br>Thus someone giving up and something to be given up is an illusion.<br>When self becomes more and more transparent,<br>Likewise phenomena become more and more luminous.<br>In thorough transparency all happening are pristinely and vividly clear.<br>Obviousness throughout, aliveness everywhere!<br></blockquote>It
              will be obvious by then that only the deeply held dualistic view is
              obscuring our insight into this experiential fact. In actual
              experience, there is just the crystal clarity of phenomena manifesting.
              Maturing this experience, the mind-body dissolves into mere non-dual
              luminosity and all phenomena are experientially understood as the
              manifestation of this non-dual luminous presence -- the key insight
              leading to the realization that <span>"All is Mind"</span>.<br><br>After
              this, not to be too overwhelmed or over-claimed what is more than
              necessary; rather investigate further. Does this non-dual luminosity
              exhibits any characteristic of self-nature that is independent,
              unchanging and permanent? A practitioner can still get stuck for quite
              sometimes solidifying non-dual presence unknowingly. This is leaving
              marks of the 'One mirror' as described in the stage 4 of the <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">7 phases of my insights</a>.  Although experience is non-dual, the insight of emptiness is still not there.  <span>Though the dualistic bond has loosen sufficiently, the 'inherent' view remains strong.<br><br>When
              the 'subject' is gone, experience becomes non-dual but we forgotten
              about the 'object'. When object is further emptied, we see Dharmakaya.</span> Do See clearly that for the case of a ‘subject’ that is first
              penetrated, it is a mere label collating the 5 aggregates but for the
              next level that is to be negated, it is the Presence that we are
              emptying -- not a label but the very presence itself that is non-dual
              in nature.<br><br>For sincere Buddhist practitioners that have matured
              non-dual insight, they may prompt themselves why is there a need for
              Buddha to put so much emphasis on dependent origination if non-dual
              presence is final? The experience is still as Vedantic, more 'Brahman'
              than 'Sunyata'. This 'solidity of non-dual presence' must be broken
              with the help of dependent origination and emptiness. <a href="http://www.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=3225985453951330898&amp;postID=7441223279998988739#Emptiness">Knowing this a practitioner can then progress to understand the empty (dependently originated) nature of non-dual presence</a>.  It is a further refining of anatta experience according to the first stanza.<br><br>As
              for those "I AMness" practitioners, it is very common for them after
              non-dual insight to stay in non-dual presence. They find delight in
              'chop wood, carry water' and 'spring comes, grass grows by its own'.
              Nothing much can be stressed; the experience do appear to be final.
              Hopefully 'yuan' (condition) can arise for these practitioners to see
              this subtle mark that prevent the seeing.<br><br><span style="font-size: large;"><a name="Emptiness">On Emptiness</a></span><br><br>If
              we observe thought and ask where does thought arise, how does it arise,
              what is ‘thought’ like. 'Thought' will reveal its nature is empty --
              vividly present yet completely un-locatable. It is very important not
              to infer, think or conceptualise but feel with our entire being this
              ‘ungraspability’ and 'unlocatability'. It seems to reside 'somewhere'
              but there is no way to locate it. It is just an impression of somewhere
              "there" but never "there". Similarly “here-ness” and “now-ness” are
              merely impressions formed by sensations, aggregates of causes and
              conditions, nothing inherently ‘there’; equally empty like ‘selfness’.<br><br>This
              ungraspable and unlocatable empty nature is not only peculiar to
              ‘thought’. All experiences or sensations are like that -- vividly
              present yet insubstantial, un-graspable, spontaneous, un-locatable.<br><br>If
              we were to observe a red flower that is so vivid, clear and right in
              front us, the “redness” only appears to “belong” to the flower, it is
              in actuality not so. Vision of red does not arise in all animal species
              (dogs cannot perceive colours) nor is the “redness” an inherent
              attribute of the mind. If given a “quantum eyesight” to look into the
              atomic structure, there is similarly no attribute “redness” anywhere
              found, only almost complete space/void with no perceivable shapes and
              forms. Whatever appearances are dependently arisen, and hence is empty
              of any inherent existence or fixed attributes, shapes, form, or
              “redness” -- merely luminous yet empty, mere appearances without
              inherent/objective existence.<br><br>Likewise when standing in front of
              a burning fire pit, the entire phenomena of ‘fire’, the burning heat,
              the whole sensation of ‘hotness’ that are so vividly present and seem
              so real but when examined they are also not inherently “there” --
              merely dependently manifest whenever conditions are there. It is
              amazing how dualistic and inherent views have caged seamless experience
              in a who-where-when construct.<br><br>All experiences are empty. They
              are like sky flowers, like painting on the surface of a pond. There is
              no way to point to a moment of experience and say this is ‘in’ and that
              is ‘out’. All ‘in’ are as ‘out’; to awareness seamless experience is
              all there is. It is not the mirror or pond that is important but that
              process of illusion-like shimmering phenomenon of the paint on the
              surface of the pond; like an illusion but not an illusion, like a dream
              but not a dream. This is the ground of all experiences.<br><br>Yet this
              ‘ungraspability and unlocatabilty’ nature is not all there is; there is
              also this Maha, this great without boundaries feeling of Emptiness.
              When someone hits a bell, the person, the stick, the bell, the
              vibration of the air, the ears and then the magically appearance of
              sound -- ’Tongsss…re-sounding…’ is all a seamless one happening, one
              experience. When breathing, it is just this one whole entire breath; it
              is all causes and conditions coming together to give rise to this
              entire sensation of breath as if the whole of universe is doing this
              breathing. The significance of this <a href="http://www.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=3225985453951330898&amp;postID=7441223279998988739#Maha">Maha experience</a> is not in words; in my opinion, without this experience, there is no
              true experience of 'interconnectedness' and non-dual presence is
              incomplete.<br><br>The experience of our empty nature is a very
              different from that of non-dual oneness. ‘Distance’ for example is
              overcome in non-dual oneness by seeing through the illusory aspect of
              subject/object division and resulted in a one non-dual presence. It is
              seeing all as just ‘This’ but experiencing Emptiness breaks the
              boundary through its empty ungraspable and unlocatable nature.<br><br>There
              is no need for a ‘where-place' or a ‘when-time' or a ‘who-I' when we
              penetrate deeply into this nature. When hearing sound, sound is neither
              ‘in here’ nor ‘out there’, it is where it is and gone! All centers and
              reference points dissolve with the wisdom that manifestation
              dependently originates and hence empty. The experience creates an
              "always right wherever and whenever is" sensation. A sensation of home
              everywhere though nowhere can be called home. Experiencing the
              emptiness nature of presence, a sincere practitioner becomes clear that
              indeed the non-dual presence is leaving a subtle mark; seeing its
              nature as empty, the last mark that solidifies experiences dissolves.
              It feels cool because presence is made more present and effortless.<span> We then move from "vivid non-dual presence" into "though vividly and non-dually present, it is nothing real, empty!"</span>.<br><br><span style="font-size: large;"><a name="Maha">On Maha and Ordinariness</a></span><br><br>The
              experience of Maha may sound as if one is going after certain sort of
              experience and appears to be in contradiction with the 'ordinariness of
              enlightenment' promoted in Zen Buddhism. This is not true and in fact,
              without this experience, non-dual is incomplete. This section is not
              about Maha as a stage to achieve but to see that Sunyata is Maha in
              nature. In Maha, one does not feel self, one 'feels' universe; one does
              not feel 'Brahman' but feels 'interconnectedness'; one does not feel
              'helplessness' due to 'dependence and interconnection' but feels great
              without boundary, spontaneous and marvelous. Now lets get back to
              'ordinariness'.<br><br>Ordinariness has always been Taoism’s forte. In
              Zen we also see the importance of this being depicted in those
              enlightenment models like <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2008/02/tozan-ryokais-verses-on-five-ranks.html">Tozan’s 5 ranks</a> and the The Ten Oxherding Pictures. But ordinariness must only be
              understood that non-dual and the Maha world of suchness is nothing
              beyond. There is no beyond realm to arrive at and never a separated
              state from our ordinary daily world; rather it is to bring this
              primordial, original and untainted experience of non-dual and Maha
              experience into the most mundane activities. If this experience is not
              found in most mundane and ordinary activities then practitioners have
              not matured their understandings and practices.<br><br>Before Maha
              experience has always been rare occurrence in the natural state and was
              treated as a passing trend that comes and goes. Inducing the experience
              often involves concentration on repeatedly doing some task for a short
              period of time for example,<br><br>If we were to breathe in and out, in
              and out…till there is simply this entire sensation of breath, just
              breath as all causes and conditions coming into this moment of
              manifestation.<br><br>If we were to focus on the sensation of stepping,
              the sensation of hardness, just the sensation of the hardness, till
              there is simply this entire sensation ‘hardness’ when the feet touches
              the ground, just this ‘hardness’ as all causes and conditions coming
              into this moment of manifestation.<br><br>If we were to focus on
              hearing someone hitting a bell, the stick, the bell, the vibration of
              the air, the ears all coming together for this sensation of sound to
              arise, we will have Maha experience.<br>...<br><br>However ever since
              incorporating the teaching of dependent origination into non-dual
              presence, over the years it has become more ‘accessible’ but never has
              this been understood as a ground state. There seems to be a predictable
              relationship of seeing interdependent arising and emptiness on the
              experience of non-dual presence.<br><br>A week ago, the clear
              experience of Maha dawned and became quite effortless and at the same
              time there is a direct realization that it is also a natural state. In
              Sunyata, Maha is natural and must be fully factored into the path of
              experiencing whatever arises. Nevertheless Maha as a ground state
              requires the maturing of non-dual experience; we cannot feel entirely
              as the interconnectedness of everything coming spontaneously into being
              as this moment of vivid manifestation with a divided mind.<br><br><blockquote> The universe is this arising thought.<br>The universe is this arising sound.<br>Just this magnificent arising!<br>Is Tao.<br>Homage to all arising.<br></blockquote><span style="font-size: large;"><a name="SpontaneousPerfection">On Spontaneous Perfection</a></span><br><br>Lastly,
              when these 2 experiences inter-permeate, what that is really needed is
              simply to experience whatever arises openly and unreservedly. It may
              sound simple but do not underestimate this simple path; even aeon lives
              of practices cannot touch the depth of its profundity.<br><br>In fact
              all the subsections -- “On Stanza One”, “On Stanza Two”, “On
              Emptiness”, there is already certain emphasis of the natural way. With
              regards to the natural way, I must say that spontaneous presence and
              experiencing whatever arises openly, unreservedly and fearlessly is not
              the 'path' of any tradition or religion -- Be it Zen, Mahamudra,
              Dzogchen, Advaita, Taoism or Buddhism. In fact the natural way is the
              'path' of Tao but Taoism cannot claim monopoly over the 'path' simply
              because it has a longer history. My experience is that any sincere
              practitioner after maturing non-dual experiences will eventually come
              to this automatically and naturally. It is like in the blood, there is
              no other way then the natural way.<br><br>That said, the natural and
              spontaneous way is often misrepresented. It should not be taken to mean
              that there is no need to do anything or practice is unnecessary. Rather
              it is the deepest insight of a practitioner that after cycles and
              cycles of refining his insights on the aspect of anatta, emptiness and
              dependent origination, he suddenly realized that anatta is a seal and
              non-dual luminosity and emptiness have always been ‘the ground’ of all
              experiences. Practice then shift from ‘concentrative’ to ‘effortless’
              mode and for this it requires the complete pervading of non-dual and
              emptiness insights into our entire being like how “dualistic and
              inherent views” has invaded consciousness.<br><br>In any case, care
              must be taken not to make our empty and luminous nature into a
              metaphysical essence. I will end with a comment I wrote in another blog
              <a href="http://luminousemptiness.blogspot.com/">Luminous Emptiness</a> as it summarizes pretty well what that I have written.<br><br><blockquote style="font-size: 11pt;">The degree of “un-contrivance”,<br>Is the degree of how unreserved and fearless we open to whatever is.<br>For whatever arises is mind, always seen, heard, tasted and experienced.<br>What that is not seen, not heard and not experienced,<br>Is our conceptual idea of what mind is.<br><br>Whenever we objectify the “brilliance, the pristine-ness” into an entity that is formless,<br>It becomes an object of grasp that prevents the seeing of the “forms”,<br>the texture and the fabric of awareness.<br>The tendency to objectify is subtle,<br>we let go of 'selfness' yet unknowingly grasped ‘nowness’ and ‘hereness’.<br>Whatever arises merely dependently originates, needless of who, where and when.<br><br>All experiences are equal, luminous yet empty of self-nature.<br>Though empty it has not in anyway denied its vivid luminosity.<br><br>Liberation is experiencing mind as it is.<br>Self-Liberation is the thorough insight that this liberation is always and already is;<br>Spontaneously present, naturally perfected!<br></blockquote>PS:<br>We
              should not treat the insight of emptiness as 'higher' than that of
              non-dual luminosity. It is just different insights dawning due to
              differing conditions. To some practitioners, the insight of our empty
              nature comes before non-dual luminosity.<br></div>

              <div>(Last Updated: 9th March 2009)<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Article written by: Thusness/PasserBy</span><br><br>Wonder why but of late, the topic on anatta kept surfacing in forums. Perhaps 'yuan' (condition) has arisen. -:) I will just jot down some thoughts on my experiences of ‘no-self’. A casual sharing, nothing authentic.<br><br>The 2 stanzas below are pivotal for leading me to the direct experience of no-self. Although they appear to convey the same stuff about anatta, meditating on these 2 stanzas can yield 2 very different experiential insights -- one on the emptiness aspect and the other, the non-dual luminosity aspect. The insights that arise from these experiences are very illuminating as they contradict so much our ordinary understanding of what awareness is.<br><br>
              <ul>
              <li><br>There is thinking, no thinker<br>There is hearing, no hearer<br>There is seeing, no seer<br></li>
              <li style="list-style: none"><br></li>
              <li><br>In thinking, just thoughts<br>In hearing, just sounds<br>In seeing, just forms, shapes and colors.<br></li>
              <li style="list-style: none"><br><br>Before proceeding any further, it is of absolute importance to know that there is no way the stanzas can be correctly understood by way of inference, logical deduction or induction. Not that there is something mystical or transcendental about the stanzas but simply the way of mental chattering is a 'wrong approach'. The right technique is through 'vipassana' or any more direct and attentive bare mode of observation that allows the seeing of things as they are. Just a casual note, such mode of knowing turns natural when non-dual insight matures, before that it can be quite 'efforting'.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 16pt;">On the first stanza</span><br><br>In the first case, there is a direct recognition that there is “no agent”. Just one thought then another thought. So it is always thought watching thought rather than a watcher watching thought. However the gist of this realization is skewed towards a spontaneous liberating experience and a vague glimpse of the empty nature of phenomena -- that is, the transient phenomena being bubble-like and ephemeral, nothing substantial or solid. At this phase we should not misunderstand that we have experienced thoroughly the ‘empty’ nature of phenomena and awareness, although there is this temptation to think we have. -:)<br><br>The most obvious experience of this initial glimpse is the lack of doer-ship and the direct insight of the absence of an agent that links and co-ordinates experiences. Without the 'I' that links, phenomena (thoughts, sound, feelings and so on and so forth) appear bubble-like, floating and manifesting freely, spontaneously and boundlessly. With the absence of the agent also comes a deep sense of freedom and transparency. Depending on the conditions of an individual, it may not be obvious that it is <span style="font-weight: bold;">“always thought watching thought rather than a watcher watching thought.” or "the watcher is that thought."</span> Because this is the key insight and a step that cannot afford to be wrong along the path of liberation, I cannot help but with some disrespectful tone say,<br><br>And this is the whole purpose of anatta. To thoroughly see through that this background does not exist in actuality. What exists is a stream, action or karma. There is no doer or anything being done, there is only doing; No meditator nor meditation, only meditating. From a letting go perspective, "a watcher watching thought" will create the impression that a watcher is allowing thoughts to arise and subside while itself being unaffected. This is an illusion; it is 'holding' in disguise as 'letting go'. When we realized that there is no background from start, reality will present itself as one whole letting go. With practice, ‘intention’ dwindles with the maturing of insight and ‘doing’ will be gradually experienced as mere spontaneous happening as if universe is doing the work. With the some pointers from 'dependent origination', we can then penetrate further to see this happening as a sheer expression of everything interacting with everything coming into being. <span style="font-weight: bold;">In fact, if we do not reify ‘universe’, it is just that -- an expression of interdependent arising that is just right wherever and whenever is.</span><br><br>By then it is clear that the transient phenomena is already happening in the perfect way; unwinding what must be unwinded, manifesting what must be manifested and subsides when it is time to go. There is no problem with this transient happening, the only problem is having an ‘extra mirror’, a reification due to the power of the mind to abstract. The mirror is not perfect; it is the happening that is perfect. The mirror appears to be perfect only to a dualistic and inherent view.<br><br>Our deeply held inherent and dualistic view has very subtly and unknowingly personified the "luminous aspect" into the watcher and discarded the "emptiness aspect" as the transient phenomena. The key challenge of practice is then to clearly see that luminosity and emptiness are one and inseparable, they have never and can never be separated.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 16pt;">On the second stanza</span><br><br>For the second stanza, the focus is on the transience phenomena - ‘just thoughts’, just ‘sounds’. It is a direct and <span style="font-weight: bold;">holistic experience of the pristine-ness, non-dual (no division), presence and clarity of transience phenomena</span>. There is no-experiencer-experience split, only one seamless spontaneous experience arising as thoughts, sounds, feelings, sensations and so on. In hearing, there is always just sound and in seeing, always just scenery.<br><br>For anyone that is familiar with the “I AM” experience, that pure sense of existence, that powerful experience of presence that makes one feel so real, is unforgettable. When the background is gone, all foreground phenomena reveal themselves as Presence. It is like naturally 'vipassanic' throughout or simply put, naked in awareness. From the hissing sound of PC, to the vibration of the moving MRT train, to the sensation when the feet touches the ground, all these experiences are crystal clear, no less “I AM” than “I AM”. The Presence is still fully present, nothing is denied. -:)<br><br>It will be obvious by then that only the deeply held dualistic view is obscuring our insight into this experiential fact. In actual experience, there is just the crystal clarity of phenomena manifesting. Maturing this experience, the mind-body dissolves into mere non-dual luminosity and all phenomena are experientially understood as the manifestation of this non-dual luminous presence -- the key insight leading to the realization that <span style="font-weight: bold;">"All is Mind"</span>.<br><br>After this, not to be too overwhelmed or over-claimed what is more than necessary; rather investigate further. Does this non-dual luminosity exhibits any characteristic of self-nature that is independent, unchanging and permanent? A practitioner can still get stuck for quite sometimes solidifying non-dual presence unknowingly. This is leaving marks of the 'One mirror' as described in the stage 4 and 5 of the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">6 phases of my insights</a>. Although experience is non-dual, the insight of emptiness is still not there. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Though the dualistic bond has loosen sufficiently, the 'inherent' view remains strong. Effectively when the 'subject' is gone, experience becomes non-dual but we forgotten about the 'object'. When object is further emptied, we see Dharmakaya.</span><br><br>For sincere Buddhist practitioners that has matured non-dual insight, they may prompt themselves why is there a need for Buddha to put so much emphasis on dependent origination if non-dual presence is final? The experience is still as Vedantic, more 'Brahman' than 'Sunya'. This 'solidity of non-dual presence' must be broken with the help of dependent origination and emptiness. Knowing this a practitioner can then progress to understand the empty (dependently originated) nature of non-dual presence. It is a further refining of anatta experience according to the first stanza.<br><br>As for those "I AMness" practitioners, it is very common for them after non-dual insight to stay in non-dual presence. They find delight in 'chop wood, carry water' and 'spring comes, grass grows by its own'. Nothing much can be stressed; the experience do appear to be final. Hopefully 'yuan' (condition) can arise for these practitioners to see this subtle mark that prevent the seeing.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 16pt;">On Emptiness</span><br><br>If we observe thought and ask where does thought arise, how does it arise, what is ‘thought’ like. 'Thought' will reveal its nature is empty -- vividly present yet completely un-locatable. It is very important not to infer, think or conceptualise but feel with our entire being this ‘ungraspability’ and 'unlocatability'. It seems to reside 'somewhere' but there is no way to locate it. It is just an impression of somewhere "there" but never "there". Similarly “here-ness” and “now-ness” are merely impressions formed by sensations, aggregates of causes and conditions, nothing inherently ‘there’; equally empty like ‘selfness’.<br><br>This ungraspable and unlocatable empty nature is not only peculiar to ‘thought’. All experiences or sensations are like that -- vividly present yet insubstantial, un-graspable, spontaneous, un-locatable.<br><br>If we were to observe a red flower that is so vivid, clear and right in front us, the “redness” only appears to “belong” to the flower, it is in actuality not so. Vision of red does not arise in all animal species (dogs cannot perceive colours) nor is the “redness” an inherent attribute of the mind. If given a “quantum eyesight” to look into the atomic structure, there is similarly no attribute “redness” anywhere found, only almost complete space/void with no perceivable shapes and forms. Whatever appearances are dependently arisen, and hence is empty of any inherent existence or fixed attributes, shapes, form, or “redness” -- merely luminous yet empty, mere appearances without inherent/objective existence.<br><br>Likewise when standing in front of a burning fire pit, the entire phenomena of ‘fire’, the burning heat, the whole sensation of ‘hotness’ that are so vividly present and seem so real but when examined they are also not inherently “there” -- merely dependently manifest whenever conditions are there. It is amazing how dualistic and inherent views have caged seamless experience in a who-where-when construct.<br><br>All experiences are empty. They are like sky flowers, like painting on the surface of a pond. There is no way to point to a moment of experience and say this is ‘in’ and that is ‘out’. All ‘in’ are as ‘out’; to awareness seamless experience is all there is. It is not the mirror or pond that is important but that process of illusion-like shimmering phenomenon of the paint on the surface of the pond; like an illusion but not an illusion, like a dream but not a dream. This is the ground of all experiences.<br><br>Yet this ‘ungraspability and unlocatabilty’ nature is not all there is; there is also this Maha, this great without boundaries feeling of Emptiness. When someone hits a bell, the person, the stick, the bell, the vibration of the air, the ears and then the magically appearance of sound -- ’Tongsss…re-sounding…’ is all a seamless one happening, one experience. When breathing, it is just this one whole entire breath; it is all causes and conditions coming together to give rise to this entire sensation of breath as if the whole of universe is doing this breathing.<br><br>The experience of our empty nature is a very different from that of non-dual oneness. ‘Distance’ for example is overcome in non-dual oneness by seeing through the illusory aspect of subject/object division and resulted in a one non-dual presence. It is seeing all as just ‘This’ but experiencing Emptiness breaks the boundary through its empty ungraspable and unlocatable nature.<br><br>There is no need for a ‘where-place' or a ‘when-time' or a ‘who-I' when we penetrate deeply into this nature. When hearing sound, sound is neither ‘in here’ nor ‘out there’, it is where it is and gone! All centers and reference points dissolve with the wisdom that manifestation dependently originates and hence empty. The experience creates an "always right wherever and whenever is" sensation. A sensation of home everywhere though nowhere can be called home. Experiencing the emptiness nature of presence, a sincere practitioner becomes clear that indeed the non-dual presence is leaving a subtle mark; seeing its nature as empty, the last mark that solidifies experiences dissolves. It feels cool because presence is made more present and effortless. <span style="font-weight: bold;">We then move from "vivid non-dual presence" into "though vividly and non-dually present, it is nothing real, empty!"</span>.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 16pt;">On Spontaneous Perfection</span><br><br>Lastly, when these 2 experiences inter-permeate, what that is really needed is simply to experience whatever arises openly and unreservedly. It may sound simple but do not underestimate this simple path; even aeon lives of practices cannot touch the depth of its profundity.<br><br>In fact all the subsections -- “On Stanza One”, “On Stanza Two”, “On Emptiness”, there is already certain emphasis of the natural way. With regards to the natural way, I must say that spontaneous presence and experiencing whatever arises openly, unreservedly and fearlessly is not the 'path' of any tradition or religion -- Be it Zen, Mahamudra, Dzogchen, Advaita, Taoism or Buddhism. In fact the natural way is the 'path' of Tao but Taoism cannot claim monopoly over the 'path' simply because it has a longer history. My experience is that any sincere practitioner after maturing non-dual experiences will eventually come to this automatically and naturally. It is like in the blood, there is no other way then the natural way.<br><br>That said, the natural and spontaneous way is often misrepresented. It should not be taken to mean that there is no need to do anything or practice is unnecessary. Rather it is the deepest insight of a practitioner that after cycles and cycles of refining his insights on the aspect of anatta, emptiness and dependent origination, he suddenly realized that anatta is a seal and non-dual luminosity and emptiness have always been ‘the ground’ of all experiences. Practice then shift from ‘concentrative’ to ‘effortless’ mode and for this it requires the complete pervading of non-dual and emptiness insights into our entire being like how “dualistic and inherent views” has invaded consciousness.<br><br>In any case, care must be taken not to make our empty and luminous nature into a metaphysical essence. I will end with a comment I wrote in another blog <a rel="nofollow" href="http://luminousemptiness.blogspot.com/">Luminous Emptiness</a> as it summarizes pretty well what that I have written.<br><br>PS:<br>We should not treat the insight of emptiness as 'higher' than that of non-dual luminosity. It is just different insights dawning due to differing conditions. To some practitioners, the insight of our empty nature comes before non-dual luminosity.<br><br>For a more detailed conceptual understanding of Emptiness, do read the article "<a rel="nofollow" href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/02/nondual-emptiness-teachings.html">Non-Dual Emptiness</a>" by Dr. Greg Goode.</li>

              <p>If you are a Vajrayana practitioner... you can receive Mahamudra and Dzogchen instructions from your teacher if they do teach that.They are very effective practices for gaining realisation. I don't know too much about other Vajrayana practices in general and it depends on whether your guru wishes to teach that also.</p>
              <p>The book 'Clarifying the Natural State' by Dakpo Tashi Namgyal, a 14th century Mahamudra master, is also a good read.</p>
              <p>What I can share here, is from the general perspective of Vipassana (insight) practice. To practice Vipassana properly first we have to have the establishment of the right views. We should have the right view first, then the right path (practices) and then fruition can result. </p>
              <p>For example, our ordinary way of viewing ourselves and the world is as solid entities, very dualistic. That means, I perceive myself and the world as separate -- hence the duality of Subject and Object. I am the agent, the experiencer, doer, of things. I am not the sound -- the sound is 'out there' and I am the perceiver 'in here', hence setting up a duality. And the things I see, hear, etc have inherent existence. That is the way ordinary people view the world and themselves -- dualistically and inherently.</p>
              <p>Hence, we have to establish the right understanding of Dependent Origination, of Emptiness and No-Self... then we should proceed with a correct path, a practice, so that we can realise and experience these truths ourselves.</p>
              <p>This path should be a non-conceptual path -- which means the practice is about bare attention, observing in direct experience the nature of mind or reality... instead of through logical analysis or conjecture. The nature of reality exhibits itself fully in each moment of experience... whether we see it or not is another matter.</p>
              <p>Through Vipassana, we must feel the vivid clarity in all manifestation, all experiences... through mindful awareness. Whatever manifest is totally vivid, luminous and clear -- yet at the same time ungraspable, empty, impermanent. With deep clarity we are able to see through the apparent solidity of sensate reality to perceive its arising and subsiding nature. We should bear in mind the dharma seals while practicing Vipassana (such as impermanence, suffering, no-self)... be mindful that this is the characteristic of every experience.</p>
              <p>We can also experience the no-self nature of each experience -- everything is happening on its own accord, sound/hearing is happening on its own accord, seeing/sight is happening on its own accord... same for thoughts, taste, smell, touch.... and there is no observer or controller apart from that experience. So in the Satipatthana Sutta we are taught to observe the sensation IN the sensation -- that means each sensation are aware where they are, without a separate self or observer apart from them... nor is there any self or solidity in them -- for they are just sensations arising and vanishing according to conditions, being dependently arisen are empty of any inherent existence.</p>

              <p>An Eternal Now, thank you very much for the explanation and link. I can understand no-self, but what is emptiness? Is it because of Dependent Origination that we say everything we perceive is of no self or no essence of itself so it is empty?</p>

              <p>For example, our ordinary way of viewing ourselves and the world is as solid entities, very dualistic. That means, I perceive myself and the world as separate -- hence the duality of Subject and Object. I am the agent, the experiencer, doer, of things. I am not the sound -- the sound is 'out there' and I am the perceiver 'in here', hence setting up a duality. And the things I see, hear, etc have inherent existence. That is the way ordinary people view the world and themselves -- dualistically and inherently.</p>
              <p>Hence, we have to establish the right understanding of Dependent Origination, of Emptiness and No-Self... then we should proceed with a correct path, a practice, so that we can realise and experience these truths ourselves.</p>
              <p>This path should be a non-conceptual path -- which means the practice is about bare attention, observing in direct experience the nature of mind or reality... instead of through logical analysis or conjecture. The nature of reality exhibits itself fully in each moment of experience... whether we see it or not is another matter.</p>
              <p>Through Vipassana, we must feel the vivid clarity in all manifestation, all experiences... through mindful awareness. Whatever manifest is totally vivid, luminous and clear -- yet at the same time ungraspable, empty, impermanent. With deep clarity we are able to see through the apparent solidity of sensate reality to perceive its arising and subsiding nature. We should bear in mind the dharma seals while practicing Vipassana (such as impermanence, suffering, no-self)... be mindful that this is the characteristic of every experience.</p>
              <p>We can also experience the no-self nature of each experience -- everything is happening on its own accord, sound/hearing is happening on its own accord, seeing/sight is happening on its own accord... same for thoughts, taste, smell, touch.... and there is no observer or controller apart from that experience. So in the Satipatthana Sutta we are taught to observe the sensation IN the sensation -- that means each sensation are aware where they are, without a separate self or observer apart from them... nor is there any self or solidity in them -- for they are just sensations arising and vanishing according to conditions, being dependently arisen are empty of any inherent existence.</p>

              <p>It is really worth reading. I am always lazy when it comes to the practice of mindfulness, but after reading the article, it motivates me to practice mindfulness with mindfulness and effort. It never occur to me that mindfulness meant so much, although I know that it is important.</p>

              <p>The are two aspects of Emptiness.</p>
              <p>Based on a <a href="http://www.sutrasmantras.info/glossary.html">Buddhist glossary</a>, and Thusness thinks the definition is very well written: the two emptinesses (äºŒç©º) include (1) emptiness of self, the Ä�tman, the soul, in a 
                                                              person composed of the five aggregates, constantly changing with causes and 
                                                              conditions; and (2) emptiness of selves in all dharmas—each of the five 
                                                              aggregates, each of the twelve fields, and each of the eighteen spheres, as well 
                                                              as everything else with no independent existence. No-self in any dharma implies 
                                                              no-self in a person, but the latter is separated out in the first category.</p>
              <p>While the Buddhist glossary states that practitioner who realise (1) becomes Arhats and Pratyekabuddhas while those who realise (1) + (2) enters the Bodhisattva bhumis, I don't really think this is such a good distinction/discrimination.</p>
              <p>Anyway, Part (1) Corresponds to the 'Anatta' section in this article, and Stage 4 and 5 of <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">Thusness's Six Stages of Experience</a></p>
              <p>Part (2) Corresponds to the 'Emptiness' section in this article, and Stage 6 of <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">Thusness's Six Stages of Experience</a></p>
              <p>In Thusness's words:</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">"When the 'subject' is gone <em>(Stage 4/5)</em>, experience becomes non-dual but we
                                                                                      forgotten about the 'object'. When object is further emptied <em>(Stage 6)</em>, we
                                                                                      see Dharmakaya.</span> Do See clearly that for the case of a
                                                                                      ‘subject’ that is first penetrated, it is a mere label collating
                                                                                      the 5 aggregates but for the next level that is to be negated, it
                                                                                      is the Presence that we are emptying -- not a label but the very
                                                                                      presence itself that is non-dual in nature."</p>
              <p>This means that when the illusion of the 'subject' (self) is gone, this corresponds to the 'emptiness of self'. But the next realisation, the 'emptiness of selves in dharma' means seeing that all sensations, the 5 skhandas, the very presence (which is all sensations) is itself empty of any independent existence</p>
              <p>For example, the sound that is heard, though vividly clear and there is no self observing the sound (which is talking about the Anatta part), <strong>furthermore, </strong>the sound itself is empty of any independent existence -- so does <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>"each of the
                          five aggregates, each of the twelve fields, and each of the
                          eighteen spheres, as well as everything else with no independent
                          existence."</strong></em></span> <strong>Why?</strong> <strong>Because it is the 'interconnectedness' that give rise to sound or experience. And one must bring this experience to 'the universe is doing the work'.</strong> This is then related to the Maha experience.<strong> </strong></p>
              <p>For a further explanation of Emptiness or dependent origination, read Thusness's explanation on Emptiness starting with the red flowers and other examples...</p>
