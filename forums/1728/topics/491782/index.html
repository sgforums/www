              Mahatma himself, Mohandas Gandhi warned how “silence becomes cowardice when
              occasion demands speaking out the whole truth and acting accordingly.” After
              all the assumption that silence means assent is so old as to be a Latin
              proverb. “Qui tacet consentire videtur, ubi loqui debuit ac potuit,” that is
              “He who is silent, when he ought to have spoken and was able to, is taken to
              agree.”</span></p>

              on the other hand we get Mark Twain, who tells us “It is better to keep your
              mouth closed and let people think you are a fool than to open it and remove all
              doubt.” A hint at the great not knowing at the heart of genuine wisdom.</span></p>

              <h1 style="line-height: 130%;"><span style="font-size: 18.0pt; line-height: 130%; color: #111111;">Translator's Introduction</span><span style='font-size: 18.0pt; line-height: 130%; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; color: #111111;'></span></h1>
              <p style="line-height: 130%;"><span style='font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 130%; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; color: #111111;'>In this discourse, the Buddha
              shows the factors that go into deciding what is and is not worth saying. The
              main factors are three: whether or not a statement is true, whether or not it
              is beneficial, and whether or not it is pleasing to others. The Buddha himself
              would state only those things that are true and beneficial, and would have a
              sense of time for when pleasing and unpleasing things should be said. Notice
              that the possibility that a statement might be untrue yet beneficial is not
              even entertained.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 130%;"><span style='font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 130%; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; color: #111111;'>This discourse also shows, in
              action, the Buddha's teaching on the four categories of questions and how they
              should be answered (see </span><a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.042.than.html"><span style='font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 130%; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif";'>AN
              4.42</span></a><span style='font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 130%; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; color: #111111;'>). The prince asks him two questions, and in both cases he
              responds first with a counter-question, before going on to give an analytical
              answer to the first question and a categorical answer to the second. Each
              counter-question serves a double function: to give the prince a familiar
              reference point for understanding the answer about to come, and also to give
              him a chance to speak of his own intelligence and good motives. This provides
              him with the opportunity to save face after being stymied in his desire to best
              the Buddha in argument. The Commentary notes that the prince had placed his
              infant son on his lap as a cheap debater's trick: if the Buddha had put him in
              an uncomfortable spot in the debate, the prince would have pinched his son,
              causing him to cry and thus effectively bringing the debate to a halt. The
              Buddha, however, uses the infant's presence to remove any sense of a debate and
              also to make an effective point. Taking Nigantha Nataputta's image of a
              dangerous object stuck in the throat, he applies it to the infant, and then
              goes on to make the point that, unlike the Niganthas — who were content to
              leave someone with a potentially lethal object in the throat — the Buddha's
              desire is to remove such objects, out of sympathy and compassion. In this way,
              he brings the prince over to his side, converting a potential opponent into a
              disciple.</span></p>

              only <em>about</em> right speech, but also shows right speech in action.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 130%;"><span style='font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 130%; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; color: #111111;'>I have heard that on one
              occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the
              Squirrels' Sanctuary.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 130%;"><span style='font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 130%; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; color: #111111;'>Then Prince Abhaya went to
              Nigantha Nataputta and on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side.
              As he was sitting there, Nigantha Nataputta said to him, "Come, now,
              prince. Refute the words of Gotama the contemplative, and this admirable report
              about you will spread afar: 'The words of Gotama the contemplative — so mighty,
              so powerful — were refuted by Prince Abhaya!'"</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 130%;"><span style='font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 130%; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; color: #111111;'>"But how, venerable sir,
              will I refute the words of Gotama the contemplative — so mighty, so
              powerful?"</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 130%;"><span style='font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 130%; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; color: #111111;'>"Come now, prince. Go to
              Gotama the contemplative and on arrival say this: 'Lord, would the Tathagata
              say words that are unendearing &amp; disagreeable to others?' If Gotama the
              contemplative, thus asked, answers, 'The Tathagata would say words that are
              unendearing &amp; disagreeable to others,' then you should say, 'Then how is
              there any difference between you, lord, and run-of-the-mill people? For even
              run-of-the-mill people say words that are unendearing &amp; disagreeable to
              others.' But if Gotama the contemplative, thus asked, answers, 'The Tathagata
              would not say words that are unendearing &amp; disagreeable to others,' then
              you should say, 'Then how, lord, did you say of Devadatta that "Devadatta
              is headed for destitution, Devadatta is headed for hell, Devadatta will boil
              for an eon, Devadatta is incurable"? For Devadatta was upset &amp;
              disgruntled at those words of yours.' When Gotama the contemplative is asked
              this two-pronged question by you, he won't be able to swallow it down or spit it
              up. Just as if a two-horned chestnut<a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.058.than.html#fn-1"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 130%;">[1]</span></a> were stuck in a man's
              throat: he would not be able to swallow it down or spit it up. In the same way,
              when Gotama the contemplative is asked this two-pronged question by you, he
              won't be able to swallow it down or spit it up."</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 130%;"><span style='font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 130%; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; color: #111111;'>Responding, "As you say,
              venerable sir," Prince Abhaya got up from his seat, bowed down to Nigantha
              Nataputta, circumambulated him, and then went to the Blessed One. On arrival,
              he bowed down to the Blessed One and sat to one side. As he was sitting there,
              he glanced up at the sun and thought, "Today is not the time to refute the
              Blessed One's words. Tomorrow in my own home I will overturn the Blessed One's
              words." So he said to the Blessed One, "May the Blessed One, together
              with three others, acquiesce to my offer of tomorrow's meal."</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 130%;"><span style='font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 130%; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; color: #111111;'>The Blessed One acquiesced
              with silence.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 130%;"><span style='font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 130%; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; color: #111111;'>Then Prince Abhaya,
              understanding the Blessed One's acquiescence, got up from his seat, bowed down
              to the Blessed One, circumambulated him, and left.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 130%;"><span style='font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 130%; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; color: #111111;'>Then, after the night had
              passed, the Blessed One early in the morning put on his robes and, carrying his
              bowl and outer robe, went to Prince Abhaya's home. On arrival, he sat down on a
              seat made ready. Prince Abhaya, with his own hand, served &amp; satisfied the
              Blessed One with fine staple &amp; non-staple foods. Then, when the Blessed One
              had eaten and had removed his hand from his bowl, Prince Abhaya took a lower
              seat and sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One,
              "Lord, would the Tathagata say words that are unendearing &amp;
              disagreeable to others?"</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 130%;"><span style='font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 130%; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; color: #111111;'>"Prince, there is no

              if a two-horned chestnut were stuck in a man's throat: he would not be able to

              was lying face-up on the prince's lap. So the Blessed One said to the prince,
              "What do you think, prince: If this young boy, through your own negligence
              or that of the nurse, were to take a stick or a piece of gravel into its mouth,
