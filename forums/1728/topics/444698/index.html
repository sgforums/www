Then<br>there is the Secret School. Secret means "no mutual knowing". The Pure Land School teaches the<br>exclusive mindfulness and recitation of "Na Mo A Mi T'o Fo", the "Vast Six Character Name".<br><br>The first character is "[B]nan (Sanskrit: om)[/B]". When you recite "nan" once, all ghosts and spirits<br>must place their palms together. Why do they put their palms together? To maintain the rules and<br>regulations. Conforming to the regulations, they follow the correct way. Recite this one<br>character and all ghosts and spirits do not dare rebel and create confusion; they do not dare<br>disobey orders. This is called leading sound-meaning, i.e. lead to the mantra to be mentioned<br>below. This is the first sound in the mantra.<br><br>"[B]Ma ni (Sanskrit: mani)[/B]" means "wisdom silence". Using wisdom one is able to understand all<br>principles, and thus is able to be silently extinguished, without production. It is also defined<br>as "separating from filth" which means leaving all dust and filth. It can be compared to the<br>"precious as-you-will pearl" which is extremely pure, with no defilement. Whatever excellence<br>you wish to bring forth, if you have the "precious as-you-will pearl" it can be done. It can<br>also fulfill your wishes in accord with your thoughts. Every vow you make will be fulfilled.<br>These are its benefits.<br><br>"[B]Pa mi (Sanskrit: padme) actually should read "pa t'e mi[/B]". It means "light perfectly<br>illuminating", and is also defined as "the opening of the lotus". It is analogous to the<br>wonderful lotus flower, which can complete, perfect, and fulfill, without obstruction. It is the<br>wonderful mind of Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva. This is "pa mi".<br><br>Next comes "[B]hung ( Sanskrit: hum) which means "put forth[/B]". Anything at all can be born from this<br>character "hung". It also means "to protect and support". Recite this character and all Dharma<br>protectors and good spirits come to support and protect you. It also means "eradicating<br>disasters". Recite this character and whatever difficulties there are will be eradicated. It<br>also means "success"; whatever you cultivate can be accomplished.<br><br>Recite the Six-Character Great Bright Mantra once, and the immeasurable Buddhas, Bodhisattvas,<br>and Vajra Dharma protectors constantly support and protect you. Therefore, when Avalokitesvara<br>Bodhisattva finished saying this Six-Character Great Bright Mantra, there were seven million<br>Buddhas who came to support, protect, and surround him. The strength and function of the<br>Six-Character Great Bright Mantra are inconceivable, the intertwining of the response and way<br>unimaginable; therefore it is called the Secret School. If one were to explain in detail, the<br>meanings would be immeasurable and unlimited; they cannot be completely spoken.<br><br>Now I will tell you a little of that which cannot be told of the Secret School's strength. Why<br>do I say "of that which cannot be told"? Because my talking does not even contain one<br>ten-thousandth part of it. What is it? If you are able to constantly recite and maintain the<br>Six-Character Great Bright Mantra, there will be six paths of light changing the darkness of the<br>six paths into brightness. It is necessary that you turn your mind to one when reciting this<br>mantra to obtain this type of samadhi. Then, not only will the six paths put forth light, but<br>all of the ten dharma realms will become the "great light bright treasury". So now we know that<br>the Six-Character Great Bright Mantra has great strength. I hope that everyone will set aside<br>time from his or her activities to recite the Six-Character Great Bright Mantra.<br><br>LECTURE GIVEN BY TRIPITAKA MASTER HSUAN HUA, 1971<br><br>=======================================================<br><br>[B]OM MANI PADME HUM[/B]<br><br>Each syllable in this six syllable Mantra liberates us from one realm of<br>suffering out of each of the six realms of suffering filled existence.<br><br>[B]OM[/B] - liberates and purifies us from the emotions of bliss and pride in the<br>samsaric realm of the Gods.<br><br>[B]MA[/B] - liberates and purifies us from the emotions of jealousy and lust for<br>entertainment in the samsaric realm of Demi-Gods.<br><br>[B]NI[/B] - liberates and purifies us from the emotions of passion and desire in the<br>samsaric realm of Humans.<br><br>[B]PAD[/B] - liberates and purifies us from the emotions of stupidity and prejudice<br>in the samsaric realm of animals.<br><br>[B]ME[/B] - liberates and purifies us from the emotions of poverty and possessiveness<br>in the samsaric realm of hungry ghosts.<br><br>[B]HUM[/B] - liberates and purifies us from the emotions of agression and hatred in<br>the samsaric realm of hell.<br> <br>In this way by freeing our consciousness, our spirit energy from the<br>neurotic attachments that  our senses are bonded with  through the cravings<br>and aversions constantly taking place inside of us ...<br><br>and in this way creating negative karmas that keep us bound to sufferings<br>and also creating samsara.<br><br>The mantra [B]OM MANI PADME HUM[/B] purifies us at 3 levels -<br><br>[B]Mind, Speech and Body[/B]<br><br>and in this way liberates us from all our negative karmas. <br><br>---------------------------------------------------<br>Six Syllable Mantra (MP3):<br><br>Direct Download : http://ff05d05.filefactory.com/dlp/c05c0e1/n/LZDMZ_v6.mp3<br>Backup Download : http://rapidshare.com/files/2448540962/LZDMZ_v6.mp3<br><br>for More Detail : http://lzdmz.webs.com/lzdmz_e.htm<br>---------------------------------------------------<br><br>..</p></div>
