              <p>Since FireIce or Jason has been so insistent on closing threads on Pastor Rony in this forum for reasons they have not explained, I'll just put a read only thread for clarifying the errors of Pastor Rony videos.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>------------------------------<br> <br> <strong><br> Buddhists aim to be more powerful than God</strong><br> <br> He has a misconception that Buddhist aims to become more 'powerful', 
              which is totally besides the point. Buddhism only seeks to end 
              suffering.<br> <br> <strong><br> Karma is fatalistic</strong><br> <br> He mistakens that karma is predeterminism or fatalism which the Buddha 
              clearly rejected as false views. Whereas the Buddha taught very clearly 
              that not everything is caused solely by karma as there are many other 
              types of conditions. You definitely can't blame on karma if you get 
              cancer when you continue smoking - that is your current life conditions 
              and not everything is the result of karma.<br> <br> There are also ways to remedy bad karma, like repentance and dharma 
              practice. Repentance and dharma practice can lighten one's karma. It can
               even lead to liberation.<br> <br> A person by the name of Angulimala killed almost a thousand men, but was
               converted by Buddha while he was chasing the Buddha to kill him. Buddha
               used his psychic powers and appeared to be walking at normal speed yet 
              Angulimala could not catch up with Buddha no matter how he ran. 
              Angulimala shouted to Buddha to stop, and the Buddha told him, I have 
              stopped, how about you? Angulimala was puzzled, and the Buddha explained
               that he had stopped, having compassion for all beings, he stood still 
              and never brought harm to beings.<br> <br> After being converted, he was not only guaranteed freed from rebirth in 
              lower realms, but he transcended rebirth in all realms, having attained 
              Arhatship, enlightenment, liberation, he is freed from any further 
              uncontrolled cycles of rebirth.<br> <br> The Buddha said that if it were not for having entered the path, he 
              would have suffered terribly (like in the hell realm), but his only bad 
              karmic consequence in that life was being shunned by people and not 
              being able to receive much alms.<br> <strong><br> There is no rebirth</strong><br> <br> The pastor have not read of the countless cases of children who remember
               past lives. Which is scientifically documented. (search: Dr Ian 
              Stevensons)<br> <strong><br> Man &gt; Woman &gt; Cow</strong><br> <br> It's funny how some people are mistaken that woman have lower stature in
               Buddhism, which has no scriptural basis. We recognise the potential of 
              all beings for attaining Buddhahood. There is no difference of sex, 
              race, whatever, when it comes to Buddha-Nature.<br> <strong><br> Blind leading Blind</strong><br> <br> Even if the temple head has not attained Nirvana, doesn't mean there 
              weren't people who attained enlightenment... in fact many did even 
              today, even some in this forum. The point is, not everyone is blind, and
               there are in fact those who have 'seen' and is leading the rest.<br> <strong><br> Conclusion</strong><br> <br> Basically that guy did not understand Buddhism well, was probably and 
              unfortunately not properly guided or not guided enough, and it is 
              unfortunate that the pastor is relying on faulty 'testimonials' and 
              understandings of Buddhism.<br> <br> ............<br> <strong><br> Next video<br> </strong><br> <em><br> What is your counter-argument for the pastor's claim that all animals do
               not possess a moral compass, thus his basis for the rejection of the 
              reincarnation theory.</em><br> <br> I just found the video you were refering to: Pastor Rony continues 
              criticism of non-christian religion.flv<br> <br> About the tiger: a tiger will be stuck in the tiger realm for many many 
              lifetimes before being reborn again in another realm. Could be millions 
              of lifetimes, never know.<br> <br> It does not however contradict the existence of rebirth.<br> <br> Also those who think that tiger has no moral compass and is incapable of
               being good or loving, please watch this video: <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x69l9p_explore-travel-tiger-temple_travel">http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x69...-temple_travel</a><br> <strong><br> There were no past lives before 5 lifetimes ago because that is all she 
              remembers</strong><br> <br> If you had any basic knowledge of Buddhism at all, you will know that 
              samsara is beginningless and there is no such thing as a 'first 
              lifetime'. We all had countless past lives though it is not often the 
              case we remember them, much less remember many of them.<br> <br> She remembered just 5 lifetimes. So of course she cannot know the whole 
              story. The number of lifetimes you can remember depends on you deeply 
              you enter into meditation. Some people remember only 1, some 5, some 
              hundreds, etc. It doesn't mean there is no more past lifes after that.<br> <br> Some forummers in this forum remember many many more lifetimes than 
              that. You can remember hundreds, thousands, millions of lifetimes if you
               enter deeply into meditation. Buddha personally remembered 91 aeons of 
              past lives.<br> <strong><br> Buddha's said while dying that he was still searching the way, while 
              Jesus said I am The Way</strong><br> <br> It is ridiculous he said that Buddha is still searching the way, when 
              the Buddha is adamant in having found what he sought for - 
              enlightenment, liberation from suffering. He then set out to show The 
              Way to enlightenment, and many people have as a result, till this day, 
              attained enlightenment and nirvana. He has totally ended suffering right
               there and then.<br> <br> His actual final words were: "All conditioned things are impermanent. 
              Strive on with diligence."<br> <strong><br> What is the difference between Rebirth in Buddhism and Reincarnation of 
              other religions?<br> </strong><br> Continuing consciousness after death is, in most religions, a matter of 
              revealed truth. In Buddhism, the evidence comes from the contemplative 
              experience of people who are certainly not ordinary but who are 
              sufficiently numerous that what they say about it is worth taking 
              seriously into account. Indeed, such testimonies begin with those of the
               Buddha himself.<br> <br> Nevertheless, it’s important to understand that what’s called 
              reincarnation in Buddhism has nothing to do with the transmigration of 
              some ‘entity’ or other. It’s not a process of metempsychosis because 
              there is no ‘soul’. As long as one thinks in terms of entities rather 
              than function and continuity, it’s impossible to understand the Buddhist
               concept of rebirth. As it’s said, ‘There is no thread passing through 
              the beads of the necklace of rebirths.’ Over successive rebirths, what 
              is maintained is not the identity of a ‘person’, but the conditioning of
               a stream of consciousness.<br> <br> Additionally, Buddhism speaks of successive states of existence; in 
              other words, everything isn’t limited to just one lifetime. We’ve 
              experienced other states of existence before our birth in this lifetime,
               and we’ll experience others after death. This, of course, leads to a 
              fundamental question: is there a nonmaterial consciousness distinct from
               the body? It would be virtually impossible to talk about reincarnation 
              without first examining the relationship between body and mind. 
              Moreover, since Buddhism denies the existence of any self that could be 
              seen as a separate entity capable of transmigrating from one existence 
              to another by passing from one body to another, one might well wonder 
              what it could be that links those successive states of existence 
              together.<br> <br> One could possibly understand it better by considering it as a 
              continuum, a stream of consciousness that continues to flow without 
              there being any fixed or autonomous entity running through it… Rather it
               could be likened to a river without a boat, or to a lamp flame that 
              lights a second lamp, which in-turn lights a third lamp, and so on and 
              so forth; the flame at the end of the process is neither the same flame 
              as at the outset, nor a completely different one…<br> <br> (Rizenfenix)<br> <br> .....<br> <em><br> <br> Originally posted by likeyou:<br> <br> When one is dreaming, will one be back to the past?<br> </em><br> No.<br> <br> You need to enter into meditation, and you will remember your past lives
               with clarity.<br> <br> Sometimes, but not always, you can remember in such clarity that you 
              actually 're-live' the whole scene. Like you are really right there with
               your whole body. Sometimes it can be traumatic as Longchen told me (he 
              remembered for example, fighting in WW1 in France). He also used to be a
               monk, a Tibetan lama 2 lifetimes ago. He also lived in Japan, China, 
              and many other places. When I met him he told me in detail about many of
               his past lives and the consequences it had on his current life, which 
              was actually quite interesting, but I digress.<br> <br> If you can remember past lives with such clarity, you will become 
              doubtless about your past lives, just as you cannot possibly doubt your 
              having had a cup of tea just an hour ago.<br> <br> ......<br> <em><br> Originally posted by Fantagf:<br> <br> Rony is indirectly hard selling his religion la. Every christian is 
              expected to be salesman, saleswoman selling the product called 
              chrisitianity.<br> <br> To date, I received news that 2 of the people i know of gave up on 
              christianity. hahaha<br> <br> I am thankful that buddhism is not condeming others and other religion 
              and the buddhists are not pushy, proud and quick to judge.</em><br> <br> You're right that pastors felt the obligation to lead people to 
              Christianity including by ways like putting down other religions.<br> <br> That is precisely what my Buddhist master did when he was still a 
              pastor. He was very active in preaching, and even wrote a book on the 
              bible.<br> <br> My Master used to be a Christian pastor who insulted Buddhism (claiming 
              it is superstitious and demonic which is due to a gross misunderstanding
               of what Buddhism is) wherever he go because of the pressure by other 
              Christian pastor friends who did the same thing.<br> <br> When his university lecturer asked him to stop his blatant insult which 
              is very unwelcome and unlikeable by people and do something more 
              professional like researching on what Buddhism is about to write a 
              proper thesis on the faults of Buddhism that he actually went to the 
              libraries to find out what Buddhism is about.<br> <br> After he read through the books, he converted to a Buddhist monk. He 
              found what he wanted.<br> <br> .........<br> <br> Anyway what Pastor Rony did is probably much much more common in 
              Christian circles, and has been so for a long time. I am in fact a 
              little surprised that such videos only surface recently.<br> <br> For me: obviously, spreading of total misunderstandings of Buddhism, and
               spreading intolerance such as these, have to stop.<br> <br> Please keep these videos coming, this is the internet age.<br> <br> We need all such videos publicized and correct them so people can be 
              informed of the right information and not given blatant misinfo about 
              Buddhism.</p>
