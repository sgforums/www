            <div class='col-md body'>Concious is our very mind. Even the mind is not obtainable. Why? Because the mind we are using is the delusive mind, and not the Buddha mind. How? The Buddha mind is unmoving, our mind has constant rising and falls. Thus the delusive mind in which we are using only causes more and more delusion in the end. We indulge on many things we come into contact with, in our minds we keep hold of many things which we believe is important, dear to us. Upon hearing Buddha's teachings we still cannot get our head around as to let it go, understand that all of this is just your delusive thoughts. You miss someone? Delusive thoughts. Someone made you angry? Just you delusive thoughts. You feel happy? Also you delusive thoughts. Life is painful? Still your delusive thoughts.<br><br>Thus you must understand, in this world we live in there is nothing which causes us happy experience or painful sufferings. It is all in your mind. People these days are under much emotional depression and pain, understand that all that pain will go away as soon as you stop indulging on it. But why shouldnt you indulge on it? The past is always gone, what you have gone through and remembered in your mind will never become real nor will it come back ever again. The present keeps fading, what you are experiencing right now, whether good or bad, happy or sad is just a gush of water flowing past you; you only experience it once and then it's gone forever. The future still isnt here, thus the things you hope for, the things you expect for, is still ultimately like a poor drunk man talking about his dreams.<br><br>You indulge. But what have you gained? What benifit have you gained? Nothing. Tell me, what can you possibly gain from thinking, from indulging, from wanting, from hoping? You think this person is your enemy? Look closely, they arent. You think your loved ones have left you because they love you no more? Look closely. Your's and their debts has been fully paid. Karma resolved. No more fooling around. You think you are suffering from stress, from your house bills, from your finance, from your life? Look closely at your bills, at your money, at your life. Everything is nothing but karma.<br><br>So you must understand, indulgences is like a wall protecting our delusive root. One must let go of all, every single one of our indulgences in order to have the least success in this lifetime. Once the Wall is down, the Emperor is on the verge of desolation. Dont give up dudes. Let go of all you can let go, keep your mind simple. Real happiness, real freedom is there.<br><br>These two teachings alone gives Pure Land Buddhism students enough motivation, enough reasons to practice reciting Amitabha. For me anyway.<br><br>So that is the main reason i made this topic, it feels like im ranting, but im not. Im just pointing out what Buddha pointed out, our common illness. Indulgences. And we must leave them for good if you wish to use this life well. Otherwise, only suffering awaits, and once you sink, the moment your last breathe ends, that is it. No one can save you. Personally i owe many thanks to this Sutra as it has shown me what i come to experience with, what i come in terms with really is. To make one's indulgences less strong as it used to be. To live a life of freedom, easy come easy go. Ultimately, how should one do this? By viewing the world as a dream. Thus Buddha finally taught in this Sutra:<br><br>QUOTE<br><br>All conditioned phenomena<br>Are like a dream, an illusion, a bubble, a shadow<br>Like the dew, or like lightning<br>You should discern them like this<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"Can the mind even see the mind? We have to answer yes and no. No, because the mind canÂ’t be a subject and object at the same time. The mind interferes, whether it wants to or not, whether it knows it or not, in all that is observes; and with all the more reason when it is a question of itself. But the mind cannot see itself completely. However, the principal tool for purifying the mind is the mind itself. The mind is its own creator, as every instant. Hence, itÂ’s responsibility, which is essential.<br><br>"In modern scientific terms, physicists, in their pursuit of understanding the nature of physical reality, have reached a stage where they have lost the concept of solid matter; they canÂ’t come up with the real identity of matter. So they are beginning to see things in more holistic terms, in terms of interrelationships rather than discreet, independent, concrete objects.<br><br>"Occasionally people who do not have a proper knowledge of karmic law say that such and such person is very kind and religious, but he always has problems, whereas so and so is very deceptive and negative, but always seems very successful. Such people may think that there is no karmic law at all. There are others who got to the other extreme and become superstitious, thinking that when someone experiences illness, it is all due to harmful spirits. However, there is a definite relation between causes and effects: that actions not committed will never produce an effect; and that once committed, actions will never lose their potentiality.<br><br>"It is important to think very well before entering a particular spiritual tradition. Once you have entered you should stick to it. Do not be like a man who tastes food in the different restaurants but never actually gets down to eating a meal. Think carefully before adopting a practice; then follow it through. This way you will get some results from dedication even a little time each day. Alternatively, if you try to follow all the various paths you will not get anywhere.<br><br>"Irrespective of whether we are believers or agnostics, whether we believe in God or karma, moral ethics is a code which everyone is able to pursue. We need human qualities such as moral scruples, compassion, and humility. Because of our innate human frailty and weakness, these qualities are only accessible through forceful individual development in a conducive social milieu, so that a more humane world will come into being."
