              <li>
              <p><strong>Seaweed is the secret to super nutrition</strong></p>
              <p>Ocean vegetables are getting more and more in demand today mainly due to their many health benefits, and not just because sushi bars have mushroomed in our midst!</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Ocean vegetables are one of Nature’s richest sources of vegetable protein.</li>

              <p> </p>
              <li>Ocean vegetables provide full concentrations of beta-carotene, chlorophyll, enzymes, amino acids, and fiber.</li>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <li>Ounce for ounce, along with herbs, they are higher in vitamins and minerals than any other food. </li>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <li>Ocean vegetables are considered the most nutritionally dense plants available in the planet!</li>
              </ul>
              <strong>Discover more about incredible seaweed benefits:</strong><br>
              <ul>
              <strong>1.</strong> When compared to plants that grow on land, <strong>sea vegetables are 10 to 20 times higher in vitamins, minerals and amino acids</strong>. Seaweed nutrition is found to be higher than land vegetables.

The symptoms of iodine deficiency include chronic fatigue, apathy, dry skin, intolerance to cold, weight gain, and enlargement of the thyroid (goiter). These symptoms are the same as those of thyroid hormone deficiency.</p>
              <p>According to noted herbalist, Dr. Ryan Drum, you would have to eat about 40 lbs of fresh vegetables and/or fruits (that's a lot of veggies!) to get as much iodine as you would from 1 gram of whole leaf kelp.</p>

              <p><strong>9.</strong> Seaweed is <strong>high in fiber</strong>. Our colons rejoice when they get their daily dose of it! Seaweed cleans our digestive system: it soothes, disinfects, and nourishes distressed surfaces; helps out with the metabolism of lipids; and maintains a healthy balance of digestive yeasts and bacteria in the intestines.</p>

Consider this one of those freebie seaweed benefits, particularly vitamin A. Who wouldn't want to have noticeably healthy hair and skin?</p>
              <p><strong>11.</strong> The <strong>naturally occurring sodium found in several types of seaweed</strong> bathes our body with rich salty nourishment, needed by our glands to communicate with one another. It also assists in the proper functioning of our nerves and muscles. Yes, salt is healthy when taken in moderation. Eat too much, and you're in trouble, health wise, that is.</p>
