In fact I believe there more people are afraid of death than people who are afraid of ugly girls.<br><br>And anyway my point is [b]not</strong> whether one is afraid of death or not. Pls read my previous reply and you will know. My point is to know that death is a fact that is equal in all beings and in all our livetimes, in fact also in all things that we possess, and to transcend birth and death and dukkha we have to practise.[/b]</blockquote>how many times do i have to say that i am not "afraid" of ugly girls? are you trying to become bohiruci?<br><br>and usually i dont like to use the word "ugly" and this topic is like overusing it</div>

Also, you post a topic in an open forum like this, you must expect replies. It is not a place where you simply say a one liner statement and let people read - you can do that on a website.
