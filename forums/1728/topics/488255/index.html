              across the hardwood floor, my head bent in silent prayer to the spirits of my
              ancestors. I heard muffled sounds of chanting monks through the old music
              player at the side of the decaying red shrine.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 14.05pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; font-stretch: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'>There was no silence on Saturday
              morning for me. A little after the crack of dawn, my grandmother would rise and
              kowtow to our ancestors and pray for a better life for our family. It wasn't
              that we didn't already have a good life, but the promise of a better life was
              reserved for those who could make the effort to sacrifice an hour of their
              sleep. Only then could we acknowledge and appreciate the work of our
              predecessors who brought us into this world.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 14.05pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; font-stretch: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'>My grandmother spoke in her native
              Fujianese tongue while we kneeled. Although I was fluent in the dialect, I
              found the words translating into English in my head. For a brief moment, I
              wondered how and why I could understand something spoken in so many different
              ways, and whether the physical sounds of language were a manifestation of
              something much bigger. For instance, I could not understand anything in the
              recording of chanting monks, yet I understand their sentiment perfectly. They
              could have been singing gibberish, but the meaning resonated with me.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 14.05pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; font-stretch: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'>There is a concept known as the
              Buddhist Theory of Language, which is a theory that all aspects of language are
              derived from a combination of interlocking traits, such as impermanence and the
              realization of transience, present in all forms of communication. Although the
              concept is not uniquely Buddhist, it derives its roots from Buddhist concepts
              of the Four Noble Truths and arbitrariness. The former explains that all
              temporary states are unsatisfying, yet we continue to crave them, and that only
              following the Noble Eightfold Path will relieve us from this craving. The
              latter explains that self-determination gives meaning to life, and prevents us
              from the arbitrary powers of an external force, such as random chance.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 14.05pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; font-stretch: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'>Linguists have described the root of
              language as suffering. In the Buddhist sense of the term, suffering represents
              an acknowledgement of spiritual hardships. It comes from a sense of
              responsibility: to take control and place yourself in a position that you
              cannot escape. According to the Four Noble Truths, in creating language, we
              pursue the idea of a temporary meaning that we crave to control and use to
              represent our own thoughts and feelings. However, in order to achieve true
              inner peace, we have to cease in this craving. Only then may we achieve peace.
              Therein lies the difficulty. This sense of separation and need to control is
              essentially what many feel drives them. To eliminate such a need requires the
              redefinition not only of one's mindset, but of one's very life.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 14.05pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; font-stretch: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'>We Buddhists are taught that it is
              essential to become aware of this suffering in order to fully appreciate our
              lives. Since grade school, we are taught that using kind words and treating
              others well equate to duty and responsibility. Although following these duties
              may not seem to be an act of "suffering", we are acknowledging that
              we cannot exhibit total and complete free will. We have a responsibility to
              hold others up to a similar standard that we hold ourselves and we recognize
              this as duty.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 14.05pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; font-stretch: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'>This responsibility towards others is
              exemplified through the use of the Eightfold Path, a concept in Buddhism that
              acts as a guidebook for a path in life that will lead to the end of suffering.
              The third factor of this path is known as Right Speech: individuals should take
              responsibility for what they say, not use their words too negatively, and speak
              only words that will do no harm.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 14.05pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; font-stretch: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'>While Buddhism is traditionally
              thought of as a religion, it plays a broader role for those who follow a
              Buddhist lifestyle. It serves as a guideline for a life that explores the
              reasons for our existence and presents methods for better understanding the
              unsatisfactory nature of many of our everyday experiences. Similarly, according
              to the Buddhist Theory of Language, language is simply an outline of our
              communication, not the communication itself.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 14.05pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; font-stretch: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'>Another concept in Buddhism is
              emptiness, the belief that nothing comes into existence by the power of itself,
              and that impermanence and change are fundamental. The Buddha showed through his
              teachings the true nature of conditioned existence and, depending on the sect
              of Buddhism one followed, presented various methods for leading a flourishing
              life. In terms of how we communicate, sounds and meanings are just as empty as
              the impermanence of existence. Sounds are essentially waves vibrating particles
              of air, and meanings are simply ideas we give to certain thought processes that
              somehow allow us to conceive of incredibly complex ideas. To Buddhists, this
              means that sound and meaning are both impermanent ideas. We should seek to not
              develop our perception of language around such arbitrary external states.
              Instead, we should recognize that language is all-encompassing. It is not an
              understanding of sounds or objects, but an indescribable entity that represents
              our thoughts in a comprehensible form.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 14.05pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; font-stretch: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'>While certain combinations of sounds
              may mean one thing in one language, another combination of the same sounds
              could mean something completely different in another. Even the same combination
              of the same sounds could mean radically different things, depending on who you
              ask. The words written on this screen might hold meaning for you, but they
              could easily appear as scribbles on a brightly lit wall for those unfamiliar
              with written English. Nevertheless, the ideas that these words represent exist.
              Certain permutations might not exist for people in different cultures not
              exposed to the same ideas as us, but the ideas can still be manifested by the
              human mind. Thus, it brings up the question as to why language is so necessary
              in the first place, and why we chose speaking and writing as our primary means
              of communication.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 14.05pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; font-stretch: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'>That different aspects of language
              can simultaneously be arbitrary and meaningful is astounding. Interdependence
              is a concept in Buddhism that describes how the different elements in the world
              relate. Just as we learned to speak from our parents, and they from their
              predecessors, we are constantly influencing those around us. Languages weave in
              and out of human existence, building upon earlier generations of languages and
              influencing newer generations to come.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 14.05pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; font-stretch: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'>My traditions as a Buddhist remain
              more religious than secular, but I believe that even the religious aspects can
              be meaningful in secular contexts. Rather than viewing the Noble Eightfold Path
              as a distinctly Buddhist concept, applying the actions to everyday life can
              have just as much impact. Following the concepts taught by Buddhist monks is
              not akin to believing in a higher-order deity or in spirits that may dictate
              our actions. Rather, Buddhist beliefs are more of a guide for how we perceive
              our world, and how we can make our own impact, even through actions as small as
              saying a few words.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 14.05pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; font-stretch: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'>Even today, I relish the early
              mornings spent by my grandmother's side. Although the words fly off my tongue
              like silken thread, I still fail to understand their true meaning. And it
              doesn't matter. Knowing that all languages are interconnected is a soothing
              understanding, because rather than fighting to comprehend the various clicks
              and slurs, it is far easier to comprehend the spiritual undertones of the
              phrases. Just as the Buddhist Theory of Language holds that all languages are
              simultaneously meaningless and meaningful, I understand now that it doesn't

              reed-thin stick of incense between my fingers, I let the songs and chant wash
              over me, the sweet smell of burning herbs enveloping me, allowing me to slip
              into a spiritual experience. The words themselves, after all, are just sounds
              vibrating through the air. What they represent is more than their external
              manifestation. They represent harmony and interdependence, the cornerstone of
              Buddhism, language, and society.</span></p>
