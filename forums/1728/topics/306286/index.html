              <p>Do not wrongly identify the pure sense of you as the YOU.</p>
              <p>Do not wrongly perceive the thinker, the knower, the eternal witness as buddha nature.</p>

              <p>Thats why must see conditions... see the person's experience and understandings. You see, dharma is not fixed dharma... (fa wu ding fa, ding fa fei fa) one should only speak and write based on conditions. When "maggot" suggested something like learning about Shurangama Sutra I quickly told him that for you, I think it is better to start on beginner and more understandable books, because the condition is that that is most suitable. Because for starters it is best not to get confused.</p>
              <p>I highly recommend you to grab some good Buddhist books that is more suitable for starters.. to learn more about Buddhism. If you take some of the free CDs from the Vihara you went for the Da Bei Can.. then you will certainly learn more about 'how to realise Buddha Nature'.</p>

              <p><br>Generally, one need to do the following:<br>1)Take Refuge<br>2)Have faith in buddha<br>3)Take precepts, mind your action and mind<br>4)Attend dharma talk, understand how to practice then start practicing everyday</p>
              <p>As you progress further, pls remember.<br>1)Number one rule, all dharma are buddha's teaching, while you are practicing this dharma door (æ³•é—¨), you must not despise or lookdown on other method, else it will create very bad karma for you.<br>2)It is good to gain knowledge, but must apply it in life.<br>3)Progress means reduction in the 3 poisons, greed, hatred, ignorance. Become more compassion &amp; wise, less wondering thoughts.<br>4)Join a buddhist group, discuss together, share your thoughts with them.<br>5)Don't expect to clear all your bad karma or even be enlightened overnight, we all live countless unenlightened lifes in the past. The fastest way to liberate from samsara is to practice correctly and step by step.</p>
              <p>also, welcome to sgforums and buddhism forum, hope to see you more often. :)</p>

              <p>Found this today:</p>
              <p><br> Then the venerable Sariputra said to the goddess, "Goddess, how
                                      long have you been in this house?"<br> <br> The goddess replied, "I have been here as long as the elder has
                                      been in liberation."<br> <br> Sariputra said, "Then, have you been in this house for quite some
                                      time?"<br> <br> The goddess said, "Has the elder been in liberation for quite some
                                      time?"<br> <br> At that, the elder Sariputra fell silent.<br> <br> The goddess continued, "Elder, you are 'foremost of the wise!' Why
                                      do you not speak? Now, when it is your turn, you do not answer the
                                      question."<br> <br> Sariputra: Since liberation is inexpressible, goddess, I do not
                                      know what to say.<br> <br> Goddess: All the syllables pronounced by the elder have the nature
                                      of liberation. Why? Liberation is neither internal nor external,
                                      nor can it be apprehended apart from them. Likewise, syllables are
                                      neither internal nor external, nor can they be apprehended anywhere
                                      else. Therefore, reverend Sariputra, do not point to liberation by
                                      abandoning speech! Why? The holy liberation is the equality of all
                                      things!<br> <br> Sariputra: Goddess, is not liberation the freedom from desire,
                                      hatred, and folly?<br> <br> Goddess: "Liberation is freedom from desire, hatred, and folly"
                                      that is the teaching of the excessively proud. But those free of
                                      pride are taught that the very nature of desire, hatred, and folly
                                      is itself liberation.</p>

              with that, the entire world self-liberates, because there is simply no
              "me" to expect anything of it, to make demands of it, to claim to know
              how any of it works. Freed from the stranglehold of thought, freed from
              the burden of "me and all my problems", there is a great ease which
              permeates everything. Freed from goals and meanings, every moment is a
              goal in itself, everything is intrinsically meaningful, because every
              moment is all there is, or ever was. Freed from self-consciousness,
              everything is permissible and consequences are not even possible. And
              there may still be pain and anger and sadness, but this happens for
              nobody, and so it doesn't <em>matter</em> anymore (since there's simply nobody here to whom it <em>could</em> possibly matter!). There's pain and anger and sadness, but they don't
              belong to anyone. And so, since nobody is claiming them, they just
              dissolve of their own accord, in their own time.</p>
              <p><br>And everything being talked about here is <em>already</em> the case, for all of us (and yes, that includes "you", of course!).
              Already, there is liberation. Already, there is freedom from it all.
              Truly, right now, there is nothing more to attain. Thoughts arise,
              sounds arise, sights arise, feelings in the body arise, but they always
              already arise for nobody.<br><br>And this may be noticed, or it may
              not; it really doesn't make a blind bit of difference. There's nobody
              there to notice it, anyway. And nobody would "get" anything from
              noticing this, even if they could...<br><br>~ Jeff Foster (do check his site, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.lifewithoutacentre.com/">http://www.lifewithoutacentre.com/</a>)<br><br>--------------<br><br>"...it
              seems that lots of effort need to be put in -- which is really not the
              case. The entire practice turns out to an undoing process. It is a
              process of gradually understanding the workings of our nature that is
              from beginning liberated but clouded by this sense of ‘self’ that is
              always trying to preserve, protect and ever attached. The entire sense
              of self is a ‘doing’. Whatever we do, positive or negative, is still
              doing. Ultimately there is not-even a letting go or let be, as there is
              already continuous dissolving and arising and this ever dissolving and
              arising turns out to be self-liberating. Without this ‘self’ or ‘Self’,
              there is no ‘doing’, there is only spontaneous arising. <img title="Smile" src="http://sgforums.com/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" border="0" alt="Smile">"<br><br>~ our forummer, Thusness (source: <a rel="nofollow" href="../../../?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=225462">Non-dual and karmic patterns</a>)<br><br>"...When
              one is unable to see the truth of our nature, all letting go is nothing
              more than another from of holding in disguise. Therefore without the
              'insight', there is no releasing.... it is a gradual process of deeper
              seeing. when it is seen, the letting go is natural. You cannot force
              urself into giving up the self... purification to me is always these
              insights... non-dual and emptiness nature...."<br><br>~ Thusness<br>--------------<br><br>From
              a pure insight practice point of view, you can’t ever fundamentally

              <div class="msg-body">ucing admonition would decline, or
              at least be properly explained. However, if you simply investigate the
              truth of the Three Characteristics of the sensations that seemed to be
              a solid thing, you will come to the wondrous realization that reality
              is continually “letting go” of itself! Thus, “let it go” at its best
              actually means, “don’t give a bunch of transient sensations an
              excessive sense of solidity.” It does not mean, “stop feeling or
              caring,” nor does it mean, “pretend that the noise in your mind is not
              there.”<br><br>~ Theravadin teacher, Dharma Dan<br><br>--------------<br><br>...The
              particular method of Dzogchen is called the Path of Self-Liberation,
              and to apply it nothing need be renounced, purified, or transformed.
              Whatever arises as one's karmic vision is used as the path. The great
              master Pha Tampa Sangye [South Indian Yogin of the 11 century (ed.)]
              once said: It is not the circumstances which arise as one's karmic
              vision that condition a person into the dualistic state; it is a
              person's own attachment that enables what arises to condition him. If
              this attachment is to be cut through in the most rapid and effective
              way, the mind's spontaneous capacity to self-liberate must be brought
              into play. The term self-liberation should not, however, be taken as
              implying that there is some 'self' or ego there to be liberated. It is
              a fundamental assumption...at the Dzogchen level, that all phenomena
              are void of self-nature. 'Self -Liberation', in the Dzogchen sense,
              means that whatever manifests in the field of experience of the
              practitioner is allowed to arise just as it is, without judgement of it
              as good or bad, beautiful or ugly. And in that same moment, if there is
              no clinging, or attachment, without effort, or even volition, whatever
              it is that arises, whether as a thought or as a seemingly external
              event, automatically liberates itself, by itself, and of itself.
              Practicing in this way the seeds of the poison tree of dualistic vision
              never even get a chance to sprout, much less to take root and grow.(p33)<br><br>So
              the practitioner lives his or her life in an ordinary way, without
              needing any rules other than one's own awareness, always remaining in
              the primordial state through integrating that state with whatever
              arises as part of experience -- with absolutely nothing to be seen
              outwardly to show that one is practicing. This is what is meant by
              self-liberation, this is what is meant by the name Dzogchen - which
              means Great Perfection - and this is what is meant by non-dual
              contemplation, or simply contemplation....<br><br>~ Dzogchen teacher, Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche<br><br>-------------------<br>
              <p>Then the venerable Sariputra said to the goddess, "Goddess, how long
              have you been in this house?"<br> <br> The
              goddess replied, "I have been here as long as the elder has been in
              liberation."<br> <br> Sariputra said, "Then, have you been in this house for quite some                         time?"<br> <br> The goddess said, "Has the elder been in liberation for quite some                         time?"<br> <br> At that, the elder Sariputra fell silent.<br> <br> The goddess continued, "Elder, you are 'foremost of the wise!' Why do
              you not speak? Now, when it is your turn, you do not answer the
              question."<br> <br> Sariputra: Since liberation
              is inexpressible, goddess, I do not know what to say.<br> <br> Goddess: All the syllables pronounced by the elder have the nature of
              liberation. Why? Liberation is neither internal nor external, nor can
              it be apprehended apart from them. Likewise, syllables are neither
              internal nor external, nor can they be apprehended anywhere else.
              Therefore, reverend Sariputra, do not point to liberation by abandoning
              speech! Why? The holy liberation is the equality of all things!<br> <br> Sariputra: Goddess, is not liberation the freedom from desire, hatred,
              and folly?<br> <br> Goddess: "Liberation is
              freedom from desire, hatred, and folly" that is the teaching of the
              excessively proud. But those free of pride are taught that the very
              nature of desire, hatred, and folly is itself liberation.</p>

              <p>-------------------</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Good sons, all hindrances are none other than ultimate enlightenment.
              Whether you attain mindfulness or lose mindfulness, there is no
              non-liberation. Establishing the Dharma and refuting the Dharma are
              both called nirvana; wisdom and folly are equally prajna; the method
              that is perfected by bodhisattvas and false teachers is the same bodhi;
              ignorance and suchness are not different realms; morality,
              concentration and wisdom, as well as desire, hatred and ignorance are
              all divine practices; sentient beings and lands share the same dharma
              nature; hell and heaven are both the Pure Land; those having
              Buddha-nature and those not having it equally accomplish the Buddha's
              enlightenment. All defilements are ultimately liberation. The
              reality-realms's ocean-like wisdom completely illumines all marks to be
              just like empty space. This is called 'the TathÄ�gata's accordance with
              the nature of enlightenment.' "</p>

              only that. This work by Padmasambhava is truly deep and profound; it
              discloses the self-liberating aspect of our intrinsic nature. It is
              especially important for you now.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">At that time when you posted the thread of </span><strong style="font-style: italic;">non-dual and karmic pattern</strong><span style="font-style: italic;">,</span><br><a style="font-style: italic;" rel="nofollow" href="../../../?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=225462">http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=225462</a><span style="font-style: italic;">, the condition is only right for understanding </span><strong style="font-style: italic;">'the strength of karmic propensities’</strong><span style="font-style: italic;">, as such, this aspect was not disclosed. </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Instead,
              the second door of impermanence was introduced and it was introduced
              with the purpose to complement the no-self experience you had in order
              to give rise to this insight of “Self-Liberation”</span>.  The sole purpose of the practice of the second door of impermanence is for this insight to arise.<br>
              <div class="msg-body" style="font-style: italic;"><br>I
              was reading some commentaries about this work, I was disappointed; and
              with all due respect, I must say it is terribly distorted. The
              commentator has transformed this great work of Padmasambhava to an
              Advaita or neo-Advaita teaching. Self Liberating nature of our pristine
              nature is not to posit naked-awareness as a background where “all
              thoughts arise and subside’ and the background is not affected by this
              transient nature of thoughts, it remains constant, changeless and
              unmoved. ‘Self liberation’ should never be taken to mean this.<br><br>There
              is no Awareness apart from the arising and ceasing of thoughts and yet
              thought spontaneously arise and subsides in its own accord
              (self-liberating). It liberates at that very moment of ‘passing
              away’ (the practice of second door) without the need of effort, simply
              so. From moment to moment it is so. Thus comes and thus goes. This is
              its emptiness nature. The emptiness nature liberates instantaneously.
              By simply so, it is spontaneously self-perfected.<br><br>Sentient mind
              however posit a ‘self’ and holds. Whether the “thought” is good or bad,
              it attempts to do something to change, whatever direction it goes
              either good or bad, all is ‘doing’ (karma) and prevents the liberating
              nature. However without the experience of no-self (Buddhism non-duality
              not Adviata non-dual), one can never understand this intuitively.<br><br>Do read with a reverent heart.  Homage to Padmasambhava...</div>
              <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff0000;">UPDATE:
              Thusness warned that one should never talk about spontaneous arising
              and self-liberation before the insights of Non-Duality and Emptiness.
              Only when Non-duality and Emptiness is realised, can spontaneous
              arising be comprehended.</span></div>

              <p>I have to agree with Thusness as well. I don't think everyone who reads extensively or not about the methods to achieve non-duality here or elsewhere will truly be able to achieve true non-duality by self-practice alone. Even with a teacher, it is not guaranteed, only that the chances are higher.</p>
              <p>But I do agree suffering is always self-liberating, for it pushes us to find ways to achieve liberation.</p>
              <p>My understanding about all dharma doors is that actually, in essence, all have the power to help its practitioners in both external and self aspects of cultivation.</p>
              <p>For example, what most consider Pureland practice to be a other-power practice, is in essence, a balanced self-liberating and other-power dharma door at the same time.</p>
              <p>For those practising Zen, it's a very, very direct method to achieve liberation, hence it is viewed by most as just self-liberating, but that doesn't mean it does not have its other-power aspect. It's just not easily observed to be so.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family: "Arial Unicode MS";'>What I meant is
              there is no actual benefit in terms of practice before non-dual experience and
              insight into our emptiness nature.<span>  </span>We cannot
              talk about self-liberating nature from a ‘dualistic’ and ‘inherent’ standpoint; at least
              from the perspective of Buddhism or from an experiential point of view. <span> </span>It is
              pointless to keep talking about it because it will only lead to
              misinterpretation and misunderstanding.<span>  </span>However
              at certain point of our practice, the ‘already is’ is important because as what
              Longchen has expressed in his post:</span></p>
              <p><em><span style='font-family: "Arial Unicode MS";'>“Yes, there are some
              challenging situations to non-dual presence. I will share it on the forum..</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style='font-family: "Arial Unicode MS";'>In my case, nondual is easier
              to experience when there are bodily movement. This is when i am walking or
              eating. The mind rest and just feeling the sensations.</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style='font-family: "Arial Unicode MS";'>However, when thinking kicks
              in... it is not so easy. This can be liken to a dog trying to bite its own
              tail. The habitual tendency to let go of these thoughts becomes the arising of
              the dualistic perception. 'Let go' becomes the very effort.  and a 
              loop cycle ensues. However, there are also  time when the 'let go effort'
              drops and restfulness follows. ... and one wonders just how silly the 'let go'
              effort is. LOL.</span></em></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial Unicode MS";'><em>The guess is that one must sustain
              a 'deeper' level of 'knowing' non-efforting.... that cannot be sought after.”</em></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family: "Arial Unicode MS";'>It is the very
              insight of “already is” that will lead to ‘effortlessness’.<span>  </span>Expression of 'what already is' is not to
              proclaim about one’s insight or attainment but rather to bring across to
              practitioner that the ‘key’, the ‘antidote’ to clear the ‘hurdle’ of
              effortlessness of sustaining non-dual presence lies in<span>  </span>the ‘already is’, <span></span>i.e, after the right understanding of our
              non-dual and non-inherent nature;  and this understanding must take place in our inmost consciousness.<br></span></p>

              <p>I have to agree with Thusness as well. I don't think everyone
                      who reads extensively or not about the methods to achieve
                      non-duality here or elsewhere will truly be able to achieve
                      true non-duality by self-practice alone. Even with a teacher, it is
                      not guaranteed, only that the chances are higher.</p>

              <p>This is not what I meant.</p>
              <p>What I meant was, from the experiential point of view, as Thusness has said, it is not useful to discuss or talk to much about self-liberation especially to beginners. Because  without the insights into non-duality and emptiness, self-liberation will only be misunderstood.</p>
              <p>Hence, when we guide beginners, we should guide them to experience the non-conceptual, symbolic-free realm, to touch/have a direct glimpse of his true nature, and also to guide him to have the right understanding of Anatta (no-self). Only when the insights of No-Self and Emptiness has sufficiently penetrated into his consciousness, can he begin to penetrate self-liberation. When self-liberation has completely penetrated into his consciousness totally, he will attain the effortless stage of Non-Meditation or Non-Practice, which is the 8th Bhumi.</p>
              <p>It is important to note what I meant by self-liberation here, when I talk about self-liberation, Self-liberation does not mean that a self
                                          liberates himself or herself from delusorily valued thoughts or
                                          delusory experiences; what it means is that delusorily valued
                                          thoughts and delusory experiences liberate themselves spontaneously
                                          (which may take place in three main ways). (Source: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://eliascapriles.dzogchen.ru/self-liberation.pdf">http://eliascapriles.dzogchen.ru/self-liberation.pdf</a>)</p>
