              <p>The thing is because one word in Buddhism has too many hidden or
              subtle meanings, it does not really help beginners. This will only
              cause most of them to åˆ†åˆ« and æ‰§è‘—ã€‚</p>
              <p>The more terms that appear, more terms that are used to explain
              that term, the more we lead others further away from the Truth.</p>
              <p>Because it is so hard to lead others to really understand
              Anatta, emptiness and the self-liberation (in terms of delusional
              thoughts and experiences liberating themselves spontaneously) by
              words alone to beginners, it's best we stick to explaining in
              more elaborate and practical terms what is compassion in both
              secular and Buddhist ways, how to show compassion and how to
              overcome anger. We can show by example why it is so necessary
              to show compassion and where it is so necessary to overcome anger
              from both a secular and Buddhist point of view.</p>

              <p>It depends on what you mean by 'beginner'. The beginner I'm talking about is someone who has entered Buddhism for some time and is seriously into dharma and practice... not those who are still complete newbies. But anyway, teaching about going beyond symbols and practicing such, and explaining about Anatta isn't really difficult, in fact they are quite suitable for beginners.</p>

              <p><br> The real answer is that there is no real truth and it's all in your

              <p>In Buddhism, the reality is that nothing has reality -- i.e., nothing has inherent existence.</p>
              <p>Of course even that isn't a "reality", because emptiness is also empty, so the "reality" there is no 'reality'. Emptiness. But then again emptiness is not a non-existence, and emptiness cannot be understood apart from form (which are vivid appearances).</p>
              <p>But when you talk about relative truths, there are truths. Like obviously the truth is that your mother is a woman. Your father is a man. Etc.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, no inherent existence.</p>

              <p>I agree with you to some extent. However, I wonder if you have thought about why some beginners are able to be serious and committed to practising the dharma even when they have just been introduced to it, whereas some are still half-hearted in degree of faith and commitment despite being known by others as having interest in learning about Buddhist teachings.</p>
              <p>A simple way to explain is that some 'beginners' dharmma karma has ripened from their past lives' cultivation, hence they are able to quickly practise seriously and diligently. Whereas those who can't or are reluctant to, can be said that they have just come out of evil realms and their evil karma and habits are hindering them from understanding or appreciating the dharma. It is also possible, as mentioned by many examples in scriptures, that they may not have been from evil realms, but their previous good karma in understanding and practising the dharma has not ripened yet.</p>
              <p>So what can or should a fellow Buddhist do to help such brothers or sisters? We are not Bodhisattvas, so we do not have the divine psychic powers to know exactly what ways of training works for a particular individual and what will repel him/her where it works for others.</p>
              <p>The above concern is one of my greatest priorities and goals when understanding and applying Buddhist teachings into daily life.</p>
