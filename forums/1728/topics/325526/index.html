              <p>OK, why edit out my quote of mandalas made out of excrement? There has been mandalas made out of shit before.</p>
              <p>Kindly please emphasize on what mandala are you looking for.</p>
              <p>If you are looking into Shingon Buddhism, note there are 2 kinds of mandala.(of Diamond or Womb realm.)</p>
              <p>Tibetan Buddhism has sand mandalas.</p>

              <p>When practicing, don't practice for selfish reasons/benefits, but practice for your own liberation and the liberation of all other sentient beings. Then that is pure motivation.</p>

              <p>Training one-pointedness is very important and is part of the goal of chanting and meditation. Don't be disheartened if you initially feel distracted, it happens to everyone and that is why we need meditation training.</p>
              <p>At first distractions will arise, but we should ground ourselves into just chanting with a clear mind, with clear mindfulness/awareness. When we develope mindfulness strong enough, whenever even a moment of distraction arise, we are able to remain aware and unaffected.</p>
              <p>Just remain a mirror-like awareness reflecting everything -- when no thoughts arise, there is just the awareness of chanting, but if even just a single thought arise or just a speck of dust appears in front of you, it is also clearly known/reflected in awareness... but there is no grasping of thought, it comes and goes in its own accord leaving no trace in the mirror.</p>
              <p>Initially it is difficult but after practicing for some time it becomes increasingly easy.</p>

              <p>From another thread, I posted:</p>
              <p><em>...But the most important benefit is that it can calm your mind...
                                              when you are chanting, you must be aware of the chanting. If your
                                              mind wanders on what you are going to do next, or what someone has
                                              done to you, what happened to you, i.e. past and future, then the
                                              chanting will not be of much effect.</em></p>
              <p><em>My local dharma teacher tells of 3 stages of chanting... I can
                                              only type from what I remember, briefly:</em></p>
              <p><em>1) Chanting as a means to control our mind. Our mind is lost in
                                              discursive thinking, and lost its calmness. So by focusing our
                                              attention on chanting, we can prevent the discursive mind from
                                              wandering again. Unfortunately, many people at this stage simply
                                              'chants with his mouth'. That is useless. His mind wanders on other
                                              things, and is not even aware that is chanting. It is only his
                                              mouth that 'chants'. The mind is not chanting. We must avoid this
                                              by all means, and chant with sincerity and one pointedness.</em></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><em>2) When we chant for a long period of time, the chanting itself
                                              becomes a momentum that gathers strength and helps us in daily
                                              life, constantly 24/7. Even in sleep. That means lets say you chant
                                              Amitabha (or any other chant), you will reach a stage where you
                                              automatically chant the mantra... its like motor going by itself in
                                              your head... you just keep chanting, the chanting takes place
                                              'automatically' even without your intention to start chanting. This
                                              is important so that whenever you face any situations, you will not
                                              lose your calm and samadhi (one pointedness). Even in sleep, even
                                              in dreams, if you have a nightmare or you dream of ghosts chasing
                                              you, you will automatically start chanting... and free yourself
                                              from such situations. If something bad happens to you, even if your
                                              past life debtors or spirits want to take away your life, you will
                                              automatically chant and even if you die you will be able to be born
                                              in higher realms or in the pure lands.</em></p>
              <p><em>3) Be-with-buddha chanting. You maintain ever present awareness
                                              that knows your chanting. That means, you are aware of chanting
                                              Om-ma-ni-pad-me-hum... totally present, aware, as you chant. This
                                              awareness is also aware of every arising thought, or even when
                                              there is no thoughts, it is present. With this awareness you will
                                              not be tricked by ignorant thoughts, whether the thought is good or
                                              bad, awareness is present and knows. When you reach this level, it
                                              is 'nian zhong you fo'. Every 'nian' got 'Buddha'. What is Buddha?
                                              Buddha is our Awareness. It is our true nature that is ever present
                                              and inherent in every being. If you reach this level, you are being
                                              with buddha'.</em></p>

              <p>Training one-pointedness is very important and is part of the goal of chanting and meditation. Don't be disheartened if you initially feel distracted, it happens to everyone and that is why we need meditation training.</p>
              <p>At first distractions will arise, but we should ground ourselves into just chanting with a clear mind, with clear mindfulness/awareness. When we develope mindfulness strong enough, whenever even a moment of distraction arise, we are able to remain aware and unaffected.</p>
              <p>Just remain a mirror-like awareness reflecting everything -- when no thoughts arise, there is just the awareness of chanting, but if even just a single thought arise or just a speck of dust appears in front of you, it is also clearly known/reflected in awareness... but there is no grasping of thought, it comes and goes in its own accord leaving no trace in the mirror.</p>
              <p>Initially it is difficult but after practicing for some time it becomes increasingly easy.</p>

              <p>They are teaching this sunday. I havent bought the mandela yet.
              Need to buy the kind of mandela that you can afford . Best is gold
              , follow by silver , copper and brass. Materials best buy precious
              gems ( 1 packet $10 ) , crystals . Second best are
              seashells and rice. Will be practising with rice this week.</p>
              <p>I am a bit worried , never practise with a pure , good
              motivation will cause a decrease in merits.</p>

              <p>Who got teach the mandala offering?</p>
              <p>I find that sometime after we start to do certain practice, then we realize we need to improve on the basic requirement like selfless, single pointedness, all these.<br>Spiritual practice is really a very down to earth thing, must be done step by step.</p>
