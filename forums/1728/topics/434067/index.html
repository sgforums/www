              <br> At base, the main fetter of self-grasping is predicated upon naive 
              reification of existence and non-existence. Dependent origination is 
              what allows us to see into the non-arising nature of dependently 
              originated phenomena, i.e. the self-nature of our aggregates. Thus, 
              right view is the direct seeing, in meditative equipoise, of this this 
              non-arising nature of all phenomena. As such, it is not a "view" in the 
              sense that is something we hold as concept, it is rather a wisdom which 
              "flows" into our post-equipoise and causes us to truly perceive the 
              world in the following way in Nagarjuna's Bodhicittavivarana: <br> <br> "Form is similar to a foam, <br> Feeling is like water bubbles, <br> Ideation is equivalent with a mirage, <br> Formations are similar with a banana tree, <br> Consciousness is like an illusion."<br> <br> ... <br> <br> "In other words, right view is the beginning of the noble path. It is 
              certainly the case that dependent origination is "correct view"; when 
              one analyzes a bit deeper, one discovers that in the case "view" means 
              being free from views. The teaching of dependent origination is what 
              permits this freedom from views. The teaching of dependent origination 
              is what permits this freedom from views." <p></p>

              Fcukpap, actually view is belief, and view stands in the way of true freedom. The dissolving of views is liberation. Please read http://nickdowntherabbithole.blogspot.com/2011/07/conversations-breakthrough.html#more
              
              Conversations: Breakthrough!!!
              
              
              I am the most relaxed I have been ever. This just got easier. NowÂ stay soft, stay supple, stay interested, have fun. It's all just causes and conditions, man. Â :-)
              
              Me: Something seems to beÂ reoccurring as I try toÂ Â maintain attentiveness to sensuousnessÂ and that is whether this process/path to AF, is about "seeing"Â somethingÂ in the right way, or more so about cultivating the rightÂ conditionsÂ (just being attentive to sensuousness) long enough for the brain to flip a switch (AF)Â because when the mind leans to the "seeing"Â somethingÂ in the right way, I wonder, what am I not seeingÂ and when it leans to the other way, I wonder if all it takes is just doing this continuously non-stopÂ 
              AFer: it entails a commitment to live like this for as long as now lasts .Â its a lifestyle, not a means to an end,Â living like this is it.Â 
              Me:Â What do you mean?Â 
              AFer:Â living like this is the answer already,Â suppose no one had told you that af exists.Â 
              Me:Â oh man, I just saw what I'm doing.....so goal oriented...addictive personality shining through. If no-one told me AF existed, I'd just beÂ cultivatingÂ the modes that make life happierÂ and I'd be happier.
              ThisÂ realizationÂ latter on in the day led to a breakthroughÂ whichÂ I described to my good friend Owen.
              Me:Â IÂ realizedÂ "I" am aiming for a goal, and that is subtly inhibiting the process of freedom.Â I saw that I was holding onto a belief,Â a stream of thought: "I had to work to get AF!"Â 
              No doubt, there is some "work" involved but as you know it's a tricky business. So, I looked at the belief. The thought that came up,Â came up with agitation tooÂ and I looked at the sensations of agitation in the chestÂ and the thoughts of goal oriented-nessÂ andÂ realizedÂ that they were justÂ beliefsÂ and belief isÂ "me".Â I saw that there is a beliefÂ that those sensations are unpleasant.Â I saw that there was a belief that "I" was agitated and "I" had the desire to not be agitated.Â 
              Then everything that came up,Â relationshipÂ stuff, practice stuff,Â all of it was seen to be supported by a belief,Â and one by one beliefs came up left right and centre,Â virtually everything I think about--&gt; based on an unquestioned belief.Â Â 
              And belief is what stands in the way of actuality! Plop!....aÂ magnificentÂ entrance to a PCE. Up comes another belief. I look at it Â and see it is what seems to hold everything else in place. "I" believe that "I" exist via Â a flow of becoming, via Â a sense of "being"--&gt; "I" believe that the flow of sensations at the chest are "unpleasant" and worthy ofÂ causingÂ tension in this mind/bodyÂ organism--&gt; "I" believe that the "unpleasant" sensations must be waited out with equanimity due to them being "unpleasant"--&gt; and on and on. Belief after belief, identity after identity, all entangled up together to support the flow of becoming. Look at the belief that those sensations are worthy of their "unpleasant" for a feeling "me" status......no, they aren't!....plop!....Â magnificentÂ entrance to PCE
              
              "These sensations areÂ negative" is aÂ belief...looking at it like it from the angle of belief and it allÂ evaporates. Everything that I believe somehow for better or for worseÂ conditionsÂ the currentÂ experienceÂ of the flow of sankhara. SoÂ analyzingÂ every belief that comes up cuts the sequence that leads to sankhara forming. What remains without any beliefÂ conditioningÂ the flow of sankhara? Actuality! So manyÂ subtleÂ beliefs of how the current moment need play out, conditioningÂ the flow of becoming.Â Â 
              Owen: the end of notions
              Me:Â actuality is not about belief. Belief is the thicket of viewsÂ and views are 'me"Â and "me" always stands in the way of actuality. Goal oriented-ness is all about belief. Results do occurÂ but actualityÂ doesÂ not in the moment. Â ActualityÂ occurs when beliefs drop away.
              Owen:Â something I read a while back in one of thich nah han's books "Right View is No View".Â 
              Me:Â so, Ive just blown the door wide open and seen all theÂ blocks. Whatever stands in the way ofÂ actualityÂ is being held stuck in place by a belief. SoÂ subtleÂ and tricky this mind. Suffering is a belief. It occursÂ becauseÂ there is a belief that suffering occurs. No belief there to condition suffering, no suffering!Â 
              Owen:Â that's lovely....god, it all comes back to zenÂ 
              Me: if you question all beliefs, including the one which is behind why you aren't free from suffering right now in this very moment,Â perhaps you will be. Beliefs are thought patterns that loop back endlessly, locking the mind on a route that for good or bad keeps actuality at bay.Â Â 
              They are like the cords that tie us down. They foster the sense of beingÂ and strengthen it's compounding. Seeing the illogic nature of each belief, seems to make it disperse like clouds in the windÂ Â 
              As I was doing this on the bus,Â just watching every feeling every thought, they were all based on some belief or other. Why is PCE mode not occuring? Because PCE mode can't occur at theÂ moment asÂ Â "I" am agitated. Who is agitated???? Look closer! And there is the belief that there is a feeling "me" that is Â agitated....but the further back I go, the actual sensations that seem to be the trigger ofÂ agitationÂ are "believed" to be "unpleasant".Â 
              Another frickn belief!!!!...that there isÂ agitationÂ there,Â that it is influencing being,Â that it is aÂ hindrance,Â that it causes suffering---&gt;Â all based on belief;Â a locked in loop of ignorant belief....and as I watched, each belief kind of evaporated...made my brain go blank ...almost like momentary fruitions...and plop! PCE...then more beliefs, and then evaporating and then plop! PCE....and now..Â 
              Owen:Â wowÂ 
              Me:Â it seems it is key. "I" am my beliefs. What stands in the way of actuality? "Me" !
              Owen:Â ok, I got to play with that. Thanks man.

              <p>Just posted in ttb:
              I have just come to a new realisation of the implications of views in daily life. I could have misunderstood what goldisheavy meant but I think it has to do with the fields of meaning.
              I have realised how ideas, beliefs, notions, views pervade our life and causes attachment.</p>
              <p>I now see that every single attachment is an attachment to view, which, no matter what it is, comes to two basic clinging: the view 'there is' and the view 'there isn't'.</p>
              <p>I started by noticing how in the past I had a sense of self, body and awareness... That these all seem so real to me and I kept coming back to that subjective sense and this is no longer the case now: I don't even have a sense of a body nowadays. Then I realized that all these clingings are related to view.</p>
              <p>The view of There is.... Self, body, mind, awareness, world, whatever. Because of this clinging on to things as existent, they appear real to us and we cling to them. The only way to eradicate such clingings is to remove the root of clinging: the view of 'there is' and 'there isn't'.</p>
              <p>The realization of anatta removes the view of 'there is self', 'there is awareness' as an independent and permanent essence. Basically, any views about a subjective self is removed through the insight that "seeing is just the seen", the subject is always only its objective constituents. There is no more sense of self, body, awareness, or more precisely there is no clinging to a "there is" with regards to such labels. It is seen that these are entirely ungraspable processes. In short the clinging and constant referencing to an awareness, a self dissolves, due to the notion "there is" such things are being eradicated.</p>
              <p>The realization of dream-like reality removes the view of 'there are objects', the universe, the world of things... One realizes what heart sutra meant by no five skandhas. This is basically the same realization as anatta, except that it impacts the view "there is" and "there isn't" in terms of the objective pole, in contrast to the earlier insight that dissolves "there is" of a subjective self.</p>
              <p>What I have overlooked all these while is the implications of views and how the thicket of view causes all clingings and suffering and what underpins those thicket of views, and how realization affects and dissolves these views.</p>

              body and awareness... That these all seem so real to me and I kept
              coming back to that subjective sense and this is no longer the case
              now: I don't even have a sense of a body nowadays. Then I realized
              that all these clingings are related to view.</p>
              <p>The view of There is.... Self, body, mind, awareness, world,
              whatever. Because of this clinging on to things as existent, they
              appear real to us and we cling to them. The only way to eradicate
              such clingings is to remove the root of clinging: the view of
              'there is' and 'there isn't'.</p>
              <p>The realization of anatta removes the view of 'there is self',
              'there is awareness' as an independent and permanent essence.
              Basically, any views about a subjective self is removed through the
              insight that "seeing is just the seen", the subject is always only
              its objective constituents. There is no more sense of self, body,
              awareness, or more precisely there is no clinging to a "there is"
              with regards to such labels. It is seen that these are entirely
              ungraspable processes. In short the clinging and constant
              referencing to an awareness, a self dissolves, due to the notion
              "there is" such things are being eradicated.</p>
              <p>The realization of dream-like reality removes the view of 'there
              are objects', the universe, the world of things... One realizes
              what heart sutra meant by no five skandhas. This is basically the
              same realization as anatta, except that it impacts the view "there
              is" and "there isn't" in terms of the objective pole, in contrast
              to the earlier insight that dissolves "there is" of a subjective
              self.</p>
              <p>What I have overlooked all these while is the implications of
              views and how the thicket of view causes all clingings and
              suffering and what underpins those thicket of views, and how
              realization affects and dissolves these views.</p>
