              <p>Followings are the true stories of Christians being trapped in the ghosts realm. I swear that they were true stories unless the person who told me lied to me which I don't think so. It is not worth for me to make up stories and risk my chance of going to Amitabha's Pureland.</p>
              <p>Reason for telling these stories is for Buddhists who care and concern for their loved ones who were Christians. Please è¶…åº¦and dedicate merits to them even though they had the Christian funernal.</p>
              <p>1) A friend who comes from a Christian family told me she saw her father's spirit in her house. Her father was a Christian or Catholic (can't remember but my friend was a Christian) since young. Each time she saw his spirit was in split second. Her mother è¶…åº¦her father upon a friend's advise. One night, she saw a flash of white light flowing out from her house. Since then, she did not see her father's spirit. Last year, her mum took the 3 refuges and my friend is now learning to chant.</p>
              <p>2) A friend told me she and her brother dreamt of the same dream. They dreamt that their late brother who was a Christian telling them that he had nothing to eat and wear and was suffering. They held Taoist prayers for her late brother after the dream.I told her about  è¶…åº¦ but she does not seem to understand.</p>
              <p>3) My immediate neighbour told me that one of her friend was offering food to her ancestors in her house. One of the family's friend who had 3rd eye told her that there was another spirit standing at the door of her house. Her friend with 3rd eye told them the descriptions of the spirit (she had not met her brother-in-law before). They knew it was their brother-in-law who was a Christian. Her friend with 3rd eye said it was unable to enter the house because his name was not in the tablets. My friend asked the friend with 3rd eye to invite her brother-in-law's spirit into the house.</p>
              <p>4) This is a hearsay story about an old woman who dreamt of her son who passed away in his early twenties. Her son was a Christian. She dreamt her son asked her to bring offering food when she visited his grave because he felt embarrassed that each time he had to ask food from his taoist "friends".</p>
              <p>I know some Buddhistsè¶…åº¦ their loved ones who were Christians but there are still many who do not. Thus, if you really care and concern for your dear ones, è¶…åº¦ and dedicate merits to them even though they were Christians. For all you know, they may not be in heaven but suffering in the ghosts realm. </p>

              <p>Regardless of what religion or faith one has, including free-thinkers, it's still possible for them to be stuck here in our realm as ghosts (lost souls) upon death, if they don't feel ready to move on, for various reasons.</p>
              <p>Even if one has died and crossed over properly, they can still return occasionally to our realm to visit as spirits, if they wish, though it's not often. But that will be fine as they are not 'lost', so they can come and go as they wish in such situations.</p>

              <p>è¶…åº¦is one of the Buddhist prayer. è¶…åº¦is to dedicate merits to the deceased by chanting. This is to let the deceased to be born in Amitabha's Pureland, if not a better rebirth or a better life in his already reborn realm. I understand there are ghosts with merits and ghosts with no merits. Of course, ghosts with no merits will suffer more.</p>
              <p>Taoists will normally pray to the deceased by offering food and burning incense papers like in case 2.</p>

              <p>I think the taoists call it å�šåŠŸå¾· which they will burn houses and incense papers hoping that the deceased in the ghost realm will have a better life.</p>
              <p>However, in Buddhism åŠŸå¾· can only be accumulated by doing good deeds, in fact is more than doing good deeds (hard to explain  åŠŸå¾·in Buddhism). Anyone can help? In Buddhism, by offering food and burning houses will only encourage the deceased stay in the ghost realm, thus it is strongly discouraged.</p>

                      Deva-ear to hear all sounds regardless of the distance. 
              Furthermore, he 
                      had the ability to read and understand whatever was in a 
              person's mind. 
                      He also had the ability to see clearly the events that occurred 
              in a person's 
                      many past lives aeons ago. Thus, Maudgalyayana is considered to 
              be a Maha-Bodhisattva 
                      who is foremost in supernatural powers. <br> <br> </strong></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #0000a0; font-size: normal;"><strong>One 
                      day, his Deva-eye saw that his deceased mother had transmigrated
               to the 
                      realm of the hungry ghost. Her stomach was enlarged and she had 
              tiny limbs. 
                      Her throat was as normal as the eye of a needle, and as a result,
               it was 
                      impossible for her to eat any food or even to swallow a drop of 
              water. 
                      Maudgalyayana could not bear the sight of his mother in such an 
              extreme 
                      state of suffering. He immediately filled his alms bowl with 
              food and 
                      with the immense power that he possessed, he sent it to his 
              mother. However, 
                      she could not have the food because each time it turned into 
              charcoal 
                      before she could put it in her mouth. It hurt Maudgalyayana to 
              see what 
                      was happening and because of his strong emotion for his mother, 
              it hindered 
                      his ability to see the karma that she had committed in her past 
              lives. 
                      He went to Buddha for advice. The Buddha closed his eyes and 
              entered into 
                      pure contemplation. With great compassion and gentleness, he 
              said: "Maudgalyayana, 
                      your mother did not believe in the retributions arising from the
               law of 
                      cause and effect. She committed many evil deeds. She dishonoured
               the Buddha 
                      and insulted the <span style="color: #cc0000;">Sangha [1]</span>, had no
               respect 
                      for the Three Treasures (Buddha, Dharma and Sangha), was greedy,
               filled 
                      with hatred, ignorant and arrogant. She was a wicked person who 
              committed 
                      many evils, and she teased others giving them no peace. 
              Therefore, she 
                      is suffering such a bitter consequence. Even though you are her 
              son and 
                      your filial piety touches the heavens, these are still not able 
              to save 
                      a person who had committed such serious evil karma." On hearing 
              this, 
                      Maudgalyayana wept in pain. </strong></span></p>

                      Buddha continued to console him, "It is impossible to rely 
              solely 
                      on your own effort to save your mother from the realm of the 
              hungry ghost. 
                      The only way is to use the combined merits of the Sangha. The 
              15th day 
                      of the 7th month of each year is designated "Buddha's Joy Day". 
                      This is the last day of the Sangha's summer retreat, and because
               of the 
                      purity with which the Sangha observed the precepts and practised
               cultivation, 
                      many attain the <span style="color: #cc0000;">Bodhi [2]</span>. The 
              merits that 
                      they accumulate are immense beyond imagination, and the Buddha 
              is most 
                      delighted. If you make an offering to these Sangha during this 
              time, you 
                      can liberate your deceased parents and relatives from the 
              suffering of 
                      the three evil realms (realms of animal, hungry ghost and hell) 
              through 
                      their immense merits. If the parents are still living, then they
               shall 
                      be blessed with good health, happiness and a life of abundance. 
              This is 
                      the truly marvellous method of giving salvation to the 
              deceased." 
                      Maudgalyayana was delighted to hear this, and carried out the 
              Buddha's 
                      advice accordingly. Thus, on the 15th of the 7th month after the
               offering 
                      to the Sangha, Maudgalyayana's mother was liberated from the 
              suffering 
                      of the realm of the hungry ghost.</span></strong></p>

                      give offering to the Sangha in this way is called the 
              'Ullambana' method. 
                      After Maudgalyayana received the benefits from this Dharma, he 
              was very 
                      grateful to the Buddha and praised the merits of the Three 
              Treasures. 
                      He advised people to promote the 'Ullambana Dharma'. This day, 
              the 15th 
                      of the 7th month, can also be considered an occasion to express 
              our gratitude 
                      and filial piety to our parents and ancestors. Unfortunately, 
              the passage 
                      of time saw a gradual erosion in its understanding and purpose, 
              so much 
                      so that this special occasion is not performed in accordance to 
              the Dharma. 
                      Today, this auspicious celebration has become a day of 
              widespread slaughter 
                      of animals to be used as offering to the hungry ghosts. The 
              original act 
                      of performing offerings to the Sangha has become a day for 
              feasting and 
                      making offerings to the hungry ghosts, often referred to as 'to 
              invite 
                      the good brothers to a feast'. These practices are not only 
              against the 
                      compassion of the Buddha, but also a let down to Maudgalyayana 
              who had 
                      advised the world to be filial and to perform good deeds.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #0000a0; font-size: normal;">When 
                      we refrain from killing and protect all lives, we actually 
              accumulate 
                      the merit of longevity and good health. It is meaningless to 
              kill other 
                      living beings and offer them to the ghost, because they cannot 
              benefit 
                      from these at all. Instead, those who kill shall have to repay 
              for their 
                      action by suffering endlessly in hell. Unless we put an end to 
              all forms 
                      of killing, the world forever shall not have peace. If the 
              tradition of 
                      offering to the ghosts and the deceased on this day cannot be 
              changed, 
                      the least we could do is to replace the slaughter and offer of 
              meat with 
                      vegetarian food, flowers or fruits. It does not matter if we are
               not able 
                      to make offerings to the Sangha on this day, but at least we 
              could invite 
                      them to chant the sutra for the purpose of liberating the 
              deceased. In 
                      this way, it benefits both the living and the deceased.</span></strong></p>

If you want to dedicate merits, try to find a Buddhist temple that conducts Ullambanadharma pujas, so that you can attend their chanting, and also donate to the sangha, and dedicate these merits to the deceased.

              If it is a Buddhist temple and they have monks or nuns, then yes.
              
              Not dedicating merits to Sangha, it is dedicating merits (of the chanting, donation, etc) to the deceased.
              
              Regarding dedication verse I think others can help you with it. It is just a simple dedication to the person you intend to dedicate to.
              
              But if you are attending the Ullambanadharma Puja in the 7th month, it should be guided.

              <p>Whether there is a superior religion or faith isn't the matter here.</p>
              <p>It is that there are a lot of misunderstandings.</p>
              <p>For example: Christians usually think that all of their kind will go to heaven.</p>
              <p>In Buddhism, our understanding is that this is not the case. People go to different realms according to karma. It is not always that a person *must* go to heaven just because they hold certain beliefs.</p>
              <p>Similarly, some folk Chinese thinks that all who deceased will turn into ghosts. Which is not always the case as well. We recognise that there are 6 realms, not just one or two that one can be reborn to.</p>
              <p>They also have the misunderstanding that just by burning things, the other beings can receive them: cars, houses, etc, in their 'afterlife'. First of all if a person turns into ghost, they cannot possibly enjoy cars, houses, and money. All these are useless. Secondly if they are truly in the ghost realm, what is important is to help them out of that realm, and the only way is via dedication of merits.</p>
              <p>Hence this is again a false understanding. In Buddhism we recognise the only way we can help them is to dedicate merits to them. And this is true - there are many people who personally experienced its effectiveness.</p>
