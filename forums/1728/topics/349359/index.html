              <p>Shakyamuni Buddha is someone born 2500 years ago discovered the truth of life, the fact of suffering, the cause of
              suffering, as well as the path to the end of suffering. He said that
              all of us have Buddha Nature, and all of us can achieve the same
              enlightenment as he did... and there continues to be practitioners who
              achieves enlightenment even till this date.<br> <br> The Buddha is someone who discovered the true nature of all phenomena
              and broke free from all clingings, ignorance and deceit, and mental
              afflictions... and hence achieved liberation from all suffering and the
              cycle of rebirth and samsara (freedom from birth and death) and
              experience the highest bliss of Nirvana.</p>
              <p>A god is different from Buddha. A god is a celestial being in heaven, but he has not escaped from samsara or gained enlightenment. He will still be subjected to karma and rebirth within the 6 realms after his life ended (though it is a very very long life). Therefore the goal of Buddhism is not to become a god, or to be reborn in heaven.</p>
              <p>We do not worship celestial beings also... actually we also don't really worship Buddha, but we pay deep respect and reverence for him and treat him as our greatest teacher. We ourselves aim to attain Buddhahood and enlightenment... through practicing his teachings.</p>

              <p>You totally misunderstood my intentions here. I have no intention of making fun of anyone.</p>
              <p>I am telling Chenrezig, that though his post is well written, talking about ultimate reality to someone new is totally inappropriate. I do not think anyone (including me) when just starting to learn about Buddhism will understand about these things. Hence his post is inappropriate and out of context.</p>
              <p>His reply is more suitable to someone who have misunderstood ultimate reality to be an ontological essence, or for someone having had a mystical/transcendental experience and reified that experience into an independent, ultimate entity. For your case I doubt you fall under either category, hence his post is like I said... inappropriate and out of context.</p>
              <p>If you wish to learn about Shakyamuni Buddha, I recommend buying or borrowing a book on his life story.</p>

              Dear [3Dd|E],
              
              Gods (or commonly referred as Devas) are superior beings that live in the heavens by their own rights. They are not created , nor creators. They exist there because of their Kamma , having cultivated virtues and morality in their former lives. They are now reaping the benefits of their wholesome conducts.
              
              However, they have a certain lifespan which will expire sooner or later (very long time in human terms), and when they do expire, they would die and take rebirths - subjected to Kamma too. A god can even take rebirths in Hells. 
              
              A Buddha, is a being that is enlightened. In layman's term, Buddhas and Arhats no longer create Kamma, all conditions for rebirth ceases once one becomes enlightened. That is to say, once an enlightened person dies (buddha and arhats), they will no longer appear in any place in the universe. This is the real ending of suffering.
              
              Hope this helps.

              <p>Zen Master Seung Sahn:</p>
              <p>When you are thinking, your mind, my mind, and all people's minds are different. If you
                          cut through all thinking, your mind, my mind, and all people's minds are the same. The
                          mind that cuts through all thinking is the true empty mind. The true empty mind is before
                          thinking. Your substance is before thinking. Your substance is universal substance. Before
                          thinking, there is no speech and no language. There is no God, no Buddha, no mountains, no
                          rivers, no things at all. Thus, no form, no emptiness.</p>
              <p><strong>But, "before thinking" is truly just like this. No form, no emptiness is
                          itself a clinging to emptiness. Put it down! Then, you will have no inside and no outside;
                          you will attain the Absolute. Everything that you see, hear, taste, and smell is the
                          truth. God is God, Buddha is Buddha, mountains are mountains, rivers are rivers. The truth
                          is like this. Form is form, emptiness is emptiness. </strong></p>

              <p>Let go and relax is important.</p>
              <p>But Emptiness is also not different from the words appearing on the screen right now, the sound of my stereo, sensation of typing on keyboard. As Heart Sutra states, Form is Emptiness, <strong>Emptiness is Form</strong>.</p>
              <p>Also, as Thusness said before, <em>"Non-conceptuality is just the beginning, it is far from the
                              totality of our marvelous nature's manifestation. Use words and engage
                              in speeches, dirty your hands and walk on!"</em><br><br>The Vimalakirti Sutra:<br><br><em>Then the venerable Sariputra said to the goddess, "Goddess, how long have you been in this house?"<br><br>The goddess replied, "I have been here as long as the elder has been in liberation."<br><br>Sariputra said, "Then, have you been in this house for quite some time?"<br><br>The goddess said, "Has the elder been in liberation for quite some time?"<br><br>At that, the elder Sariputra fell silent.<br><br>The
                              goddess continued, "Elder, you are 'foremost of the wise!' Why do you
                              not speak? Now, when it is your turn, you do not answer the question."<br><br>Sariputra: Since liberation is inexpressible, goddess, I do not know what to say.<br><br>Goddess:
                              All the syllables pronounced by the elder have the nature of
                              liberation. Why? Liberation is neither internal nor external, nor can
                              it be apprehended apart from them. Likewise, syllables are neither
                              internal nor external, nor can they be apprehended anywhere else.
                              Therefore, reverend Sariputra, do not point to liberation by abandoning
                              speech! Why? The holy liberation is the equality of all things!</em></p>

              <p>Hui-Neng's poem 'Pu Ti Ben Wu Shu' is Pian Kong (lean towards voidness) and does not reflect the realisation of non-duality. Regarding Hui-Neng I just wrote this in another forum some days back, and this is not just my own claims but also based on what my Taiwanese teacher, our moderator Thusness, Master Yuan Yin, and other teachers have said:</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><br>It should also be noted that when Hui-Neng wrote
                                      the 'Pu Ti Ben Wu Shu' or 'Bodhi originally has no tree' poem, he has
                                      not attained great awakening yet.</strong></span></span> At that point in time, he only
                                      understood the formless aspect of Awareness, like the AMness
                                      experience. If you read that poem -- every line is talking about the
                                      formless, forever untainted aspect of awareness. He has not experienced
                                      the non-dual (that Mind and Form are one) aspect at that time, and so
                                      the 5th patriarch wiped the poem off with his shoes and proclaimed that
                                      he has not attained (many people thought this is to ward off jealousy
                                      but it is not only that) -- and it is only later when they met and 5th
                                      patriarch is giving his commentary on Diamond Sutra, Hui-Neng had his
                                      Great Awakening and woke up to the non-dual nature of reality.</p>
              <p><br>When the famous 6th Zen Patriarch Hui-Neng attained Great Awakening, this is what happened:<br><br><em>Knowing
                                      what his message meant, in the third watch of the night I went to his
                                      room. Using the robe as a screen so that none could see us, he
                                      expounded the Diamond Sutra to me. When he came to the sentence, "One
                                      should use one's mind in such a way that it will be free from any
                                      attachment," <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">I at once became thoroughly enlightened, and realized that all things in the universe are the Essence of Mind itself.</span></strong><br><br>"Who
                                      would have thought," I said to the Patriarch, "that the Essence of Mind
                                      is intrinsically pure! Who would have thought that the Essence of Mind
                                      is intrinsically free from becoming or annihilation! Who would have
                                      thought that the Essence of Mind is intrinsically self-sufficient! Who
                                      would have thought that the Essence of Mind is intrinsically free from
                                      change! <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Who would have thought that all things are the manifestation of the Essence of Mind!</span></strong>"
                                      Knowing that I had realized the Essence of Mind, the Patriarch said,
                                      "For him who does not know his own mind there is no use learning
                                      Buddhism.</em></p>

              <p>Mind IS, but where does not apply. Whatever heard, seen, smelled, touched, is Mind. 'Where' does
                                                                  not apply, in the seen there is just the seen, in the heard just the
                                                                  heard. No separate cognizer. And what is seen, heard etc does not make up or link up into a locality -- only a bunch of disjoint
                                                                  yet complete sensations. They're like bubbles, ephemeral, like a mirage, like an illusion. None of them make up an entity, location, etc.</p>
              <p>Mind is non-dual and cannot be found by looking for it (for that would imply the duality of looker and looked). Whatever IS, IS Mind (mountains, rivers, sky...)</p>
              <p>Mind is manifesting right now as everything (everything seen, heard, smelled, etc), so it's nature is luminous clarity. Everything is insubstantial, empty of anything graspable, or any independent essence, being dependently originated its essence is empty. Being empty, locality does not apply.</p>
              <p>Everything is Mind Only.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>p.s. on non locality:</p>
              <p>When causes and condition is, vision manifest, appearance of
                                          locality manifest but does not mean there is truly 'location'. We
                                          believe we reside in a specific locality because we think what we see
                                          is solid -- truly 'out there'. But if I put you in a virtual reality
                                          machine like the matrix, and give you the illusion of seeing from outer space, you might
                                          think it is real also... but it's just like an illusion. When condition
                                          is, it appears... but it's empty of any solid reality or locality.
                                          Whatever we experience is like that -- only appearances. Due to certain
                                          conditions we see red flower, due to certain conditions dog sees black.
                                          Doesn't mean there is truly a black flower or red flower out there. Due to certain conditions some people see spirits, some don't. If scientists
                                          develope quantum glasses, one may see 99.999% void. All just conditions,
                                          dependently originated appearances... empty. Like a dream. Like a magic
                                          trick. Yet all is Mind Only.</p>

              <p>Actually i think it is okay to quote from the sutra as long as the example is appropriate to the reader. A simple verse from the sutra can also enlightened somebody by chance or simply clarify somebody's doubts. Just as what happen to Hui neng who listen to the Diamond sutra and was suddenly enlightened. Though one must have very good roots in order to attain sudden enlightenment.</p>
              <p>I have to agreed with both of you. For him who does not know his mind, there is no use learning Buddhism :)</p>
