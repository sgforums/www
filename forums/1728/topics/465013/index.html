              <p>Daniel:<br><br>I myself have never used the term technical 4th, and I am not sure where it originated.<br><br>Lots
               of people, even those in this community, use the terms discussed here 
              in many different ways, and they tend to get loosely applied a lot of 
              the time.<br><br>I am currently thinking about the models very 
              differently from the general way presented in MCTB, in case anyone is 
              asking, with an increased appreciation of the basic concept, expressed 
              in MCTB, that there are many axes of development, and the assumption 
              that they will all occur simultaneously in a very specified sequence 
              often not reflecting what actually happens in the wild.<br><br>That 
              said, the language is still in use, and I use it sometimes also these 
              days, for better or for worse, though I am trying to get away from it 
              more and more, as it causes a lot of trouble, and there seem to be many 
              layers to the thing that often surprise people when they show up 
              unexpectedly when they thought they had something totally nailed, as 
              happened to me many, many times over many years, as noted in MCTB.<br><br>Anyway, back to the topic at hand...<br><br>Some
               people use Technical or MCTB 4th to mean the general feeling that they 
              are done, with that feeling of doneness being the primary criteria. 
              Kenneth Folk, the primary proponent of this particular meaning, was just
               here at Hurricane Ranch working on his book, and we had long 
              discussions about this, with me advocating for this not to be the 
              primary thrust of the term, and him thinking that the feeling of 
              doneness was of primary importance. I argued for the following as being 
              more along the lines of what I considered relevant: an undifferentiated 
              field of selfless causality doing its natural thing with no sense of 
              center-point, doer, controller, perceiver, or agent of any kind. Anyway,
               experts clearly disagree, and so long as people qualify how they are 
              using the term, I am not sure it matters, or does it? Actually, it 
              probably does, so back to the drawing board...<br><br>As posted in an 
              earlier thread, I think a more nuanced model that allows for flexibility
               and many areas of development and evolution of the practitioner in time
               is going to be what we end up with, following something like a more 
              medical model of all of this.<br><br>For instance, when I am admitting a
               patient from the emergency department and speak on the phone with my 
              consulting/admitting hospitalist, I don't just say, "Mrs. Jones has 
              pneumonia, admit her."<br><br>Instead, I might say, "Mrs. Jones is a 75 
              year-old female with pneumonia who needs admission. She has mild 
              emphysema, diet-controlled diabetes, hypertension and a previous case of
               pneumonia 3 years ago. She was just admitted to the hospital 3 weeks 
              ago for a right hip replacement by Dr. Smith. Her primary care doctor is
               Dr. Brown, for whom you admit. She had been recovering well at home for
               3 days after 2 weeks in a rehab facility who presented with shortness 
              of breath, fever to 102.1, a blood pressure of 102/45, a heart rate of 
              120, and an pulse ox of 89% on room air. She was found to have bilateral
               patchy infiltrates on chest x-ray, a white count of 17.5 with 92% neuts
               and 3% bands, platelets are a bit elevated 580, has mild anemia, a 
              glucose of 216, a normal urinalysis, a sodium that was just a bit low at
               131, normal potassium, mild dehydration with a BUN of 25 and a Cr of 
              1.2. She improved after 1L of normal saline IV fluids, with her blood 
              pressure coming up to 110/58, and we gave her levaquin 750mg IV, 
              doripenem 500mg IV, and vancomycin 1g IV, given her low blood pressure, 
              concern for sepsis, and recent extensive health-care exposure raising 
              concern for resistant organisms. Her hip wound is healing well without 
              erythema. Her breathing responded well to one hour of albuterol and 
              atrovent nebulized, and she should probably go to the RCU."<br><br>In 
              the same way, of some practitioner I might say, "Mrs. Jones is a 35 
              year-old female with about 9 months of retreat time total, mostly 
              Goenka, Mahasi, but also a bit of Soto Zen and Dzogchen, who has been 
              practicing for 16 years total with a good daily practice. She also 
              practiced in a mixed Wiccan/Golden Dawn-influenced magickal tradition in
               the past and still does on occasion. She has 4 jhanas most of the time 
              in daily life and can get real formless jhanas on retreat up to the 8th 
              reliably after a week of practice to warm up and occasionally in the 
              height of Equanimity during new cycles. She has attained to what she 
              thinks is Nirodha Samapatti 4 times with heavy afterglow and proper set 
              up, again on retreat. Her current practice focuses on meditation at all 
              times in daily life, and integrating what she thinks of as ultimate and 
              relative perspectives. By her report she is now walking around mostly in
               a field that appears mostly without boundaries, but still at points 
              catches glimpses of formed patterns that clearly have some tinge of a 
              sense of identification and separateness to them sometimes, and 
              debunking these are what she considers her cutting edge of practice. She
               easily attains to Fruitions up to a few per day in daily life when in 
              Review phases, and has gone through what feels like an insight cycle 
              every 2-3 months for the last 3 or so years. When in the A&amp;P phase 
              she has a high degree of talent for out of body travel, something she 
              started practicing as a teenager. She also feels she can at times see 
              auras and subtly manipulate her own and others energetic fields. She has
               had a few prognosticative dreams of uncanny accuracy, none in the last 
              two years. She just crossed the A&amp;P last about 6 days ago, and is 
              currently struggling a bit in Re-Observation, but bleed-through is 
              minimal, her having easily identified this phase from long familiarity 
              with it, and her job as a physical therapist is going well despite a 
              relatively large amount of daily practice, about 2-3 hours/day of 
              sitting at this point, which at this time is making her feel a bit edgy,
               though nothing nearly as bad as it used to during this phase, and she 
              is confident she will hit Equanimity any time now. She is planning a 
              retreat of 2 weeks duration at the Forest Refuge in 4 months, with her 
              goal being total field integration. She also practices Bikram yoga in a 
              hot studio 3 times/week and finds it very helpful, something she has 
              done on and off for 5 years. She has noticed a marked increase in her 
              emotional balance and ease after a major shift about 5 months ago that 
              she has no good name for, as it doesn't seem to correlate that well with
               any standard map. The benefits of that shift have held up well in the 
              face of some recent family stressors, with clear and automatic 
              improvement in the way she processed old triggers by her parents. She 
              does occasionally suffer from insomnia, but uses the time to meditate. 
              She also volunteers occasionally at the local art museum front desk and 
              occasionally paints water colors, and she was actually painting when her
               last major breakthrough occurred and considers it part of her practice.
               She has a small local sangha, mostly of mixed practitioners, many of 
              whom are also members of her yoga studio. She teaches informally through
               Skype on occasion."<br><br>Here is a repost of the thread content, as somehow I can't find the original thread: <br><br>"A
               large number of recent conversations with relatively talented 
              practitioners revolved around various things that practice had done to 
              everyone, and what the similarities and differences were. These 
              conversations mercifully weren't along the lines of, "Yeah, I'm an MCTB 
              Arahat," or whatever, and instead focused on the phenomenology, which is
               always more fun and straightforward anyway, and is often less 
              politically charged, it seems.<br><br>Basically, the attempts of the 
              conversations were either consciously less so (but the effect was the 
              same) to put the member of the groups discussing this on a virtual grid 
              something like this.<br><br>On one axis you have those discussing what they can do and what they have attained. <br><br>On the other axis, you have something like this, in no particular order:<br><br>Agency:
               completely gone, even more completely gone, sometimes completely gone, 
              at times has been completely gone, is somewhat attenuated, is 
              occasionally attenuated, is still quite present.<br><br>Panoramic Perspective: how well does the concept of panoramic perspectives describe your practice and how has this changed?<br><br>Dreams:
               did you dream before and do you dream now and how are they the same or 
              different? Have you lucid dreamed and how has this changed with 
              practice?<br><br>Traveling: have you ever and can you still travel out 
              of body, with what degree of regularity and control, duration, etc? Can 
              you do it from waking or do you have to start in a lucid dream? Can you 
              come back to body being fully awake or do you have to come back to a 
              dream? etc.<br><br>Sleep: do you need more, less, or what, if anything, is different.<br><br>Visualization ability: same, different, there, not there, or what?<br><br>Cycling:
               do you cycle through the insight stages or something like them, and did
               you cycle before, and what it is it like now and how has it changed?<br><br>Fruitions:
               have you ever attained them, can you attain them now, did you ever have
               the notion that they had duration of any kind (either experienced or 
              not experienced), how many could you at your best attain/day and how 
              rapidly from inclination to them happening, can you get multiple back to
               back, etc.?<br><br>Subject/Observer: seems to be localized, seems diffuse, seems gone some of the time, seems utterly and completely gone, or what?<br><br>Affect: do you still have the internal feeling of feelings, and if so is anything different about the way you experience them?<br><br>Similarly:
               Affect triggers: is there anything different about how stimuli that 
              would have at some point in the past (and perhaps now) have triggered 
              feelings are reacted to and if so, what is different, if anything, and 
              how has this changed?<br><br>External Affect: do people still perceive 
              you to have feeling and, if so, how has this changed as a result of 
              practice, if at all?<br><br>Formed Jhanas: did you ever have and do you 
              still have jhanas, and if so, which ones and how developed (stability, 
              duration, rapidity of access, various objects, etc.)?<br><br>Formless 
              Realms: did you ever have they and do you still have them, and if so, 
              how developed were/are they (with formed/bodily phenomena somewhat 
              present, very present, subtle or gone or what, stability, access, 
              duration, etc.)?<br><br>Brahma Viharas: have you practiced them, and 
              could you stay with the phrases, feel the actual feelings, take them to 
              their ultimate jhanas (3rd or 4th, depending) and how has this changed 
              with time?<br><br>Powers: did you ever have any, do you still have them 
              or can you access them, and if so how often, how easily, what conditions
               required, etc.? How has your interpretation of those experiences varied
               with time?<br><br>Energetics: have you ever perceived energetic stuff 
              (vibrations, chakras, energy channels, etc.) and could you ever 
              manipulate them, and can you now and what conditions would be required 
              to do that?<br><br>Nirodha Samapatti: do you think you have ever 
              attained it, which version did you attain (NS Lite: sense of 
              duration/experience still somehow present, or NS Deluxe: experience and 
              everything else utterly gone), can you still attain it, do you have any 
              notion of how long the attainment has been able to last (either by 
              external or internal reference) and what conditions would be required 
              for you to do that?<br><br>Suffering: what is suffering like for you now
               on any level and how do you describe it? What causes the mind to be 
              disturbed, if anything?<br><br>Memory: has practice changed your memory of events in any way and if so how?<br><br>Visual Field: anything different about it, or any other sense door, for that matter?<br><br>Relationships
               with others: has practice changed the way you related to others and if 
              so how, assuming the ability to generalize this very complex topic?<br><br>Compassion:
               do you feel compassion, and, if so, how has practice changed it if at 
              all or your understanding of what compassion is?<br><br>Peace: is your mind more or less peaceful or what and how has this changed with time?<br><br>Ethics: has your practice changed your concept of morality and ethics, and if so, how and how has this evolved with time?<br><br>Task Fatigue: has meditation practice changed your ability to stay on tasks with less fatigue in any way?<br><br>Silence: do you perceive your mind as silent and if so when/how often?<br><br>Thoughts: how has meditation practice changed what thoughts do and how often you perceive them to occur?<br><br>Time: anything interesting about it?<br><br>There
               are probably a bunch more things that could be placed on this grid, but
               those are some of the more common ones that have been bandied about 
              recently, and these sorts of conversations turn out to be so much more 
              fun than trying to shoehorn people into very narrow concepts such as 
              single path names and the like, as it turns out that there is all sorts 
              of variability in how people respond to those questions even among 
              people who claim the same crudely labeled attainments.<br><br>While 
              these could end up looking a bit like a character sheet from D&amp;D 
              (for those old enough to remember what that was), the effect is a much 
              more nuanced and productive discussion of exactly what people are 
              experiencing and it also leads nicely to all sorts of fascinating 
              practice discussions, I have found.<br><br>This is actually a setup for a
               more sophisticated discussion of the goal and promises of practice and 
              what is possible and how developments may occur in a non-parallel 
              fashion sometimes, as well as terms such as "enlightenment", which, 
              given that the level of discussion is now at this much more nuanced 
              level, seem paltry by comparison."<br><br>See the difference?<br><br>Daniel	<br><br>.....<br><br>Thanks.<br><br>Here is a fragment from MCTB2 in its rough form that I was just working on recently.<br><br>"The Problems with Most Current and Former Models<br><br> There are large numbers of problems with many of the models of 
              meditative development that we have inherited from the past as well as 
              those we are creating today. I will get right to the point and list the 
              major problems and then spend some time flushing them out:<br><br> 1.	
              Some models assume predictable linear development, such that if you 
              attain this, next you will attain that, and so on, with this and that 
              being very specifically defined. I call this the Linear Fallacy. It is 
              not that there aren’t some truths in these models, but there are 
              generally problems as well.<br><br> 2.	Some models assume that if you 
              attain or understand one thing, you will automatically attain or 
              understand something else which might be entirely unrelated, something I
               call the Package Fallacy. It is not that packages of abilities and 
              understandings don’t occur, as they definitely do, but most Package 
              Models presume it will always happen that way.<br><br> 3.	Some models 
              assume that if you can perceive or do something now that you will always
               be able to (at least until you die, that is in most models that don’t 
              assume that realizations carry on into the “next life”.) I call this the
               Permanence Fallacy. It is not that there aren’t some very long-lasting 
              and resilient transformations that can occur, but some of these models 
              have problems that I will touch on in a bit. <br><br> 4.	Some models 
              assume that if you attain to something you will automatically describe 
              it in certain ways. I call this the Descriptive Fallacy.<br><br> 5.	Some
               models assume that if you attain to something you will automatically 
              know you have attained it, what it is, what it does, and what it means. I
               call this the Diagnostic Fallacy. It is in many ways related to the 
              Descriptive Fallacy.<br><br> 6.	Some models assume that there is only 
              one endpoint that is a valid or final or ultimate endpoint and that it 
              will look a certain way. I call this the Final Fallacy, or, as my friend
               Kenneth Folk calls it, Pernicious Convergence, meaning that all roads 
              lead to some specific final point if you take them all far enough, and 
              this is not referring to that obvious endpoint, namely death, as least 
              not in some models...<br><br> It is worth noting that I have fallen 
              victim to believing all of these fallacies to some degree at some point,
               though now don’t totally believe any of them. Exactly how these 
              Fallacies do and don’t apply is complicated. The problem is that many of
               them are getting at something that can happen sometimes or something 
              that is at least partly true with some qualifiers at points. I will 
              illustrate this by way of specific examples now.<br><br> The Linear 
              Fallacy is probably the most pernicious of them all. Most models that 
              are not single shot models (meaning models that are not Total Package 
              Models, in which everything that you could every know and do is gained 
              all at once in one big “Zap!”) involve some aspect of the Linear 
              Fallacy. The Four Path Model, the Tibetan Five Path Model, the Bhumi 
              Model, and many others all involve this one to some degree. The problem 
              is not that they are not getting at something that may have some value 
              as a model, as many of them have some specific merits at times with many
               qualifiers..."<br><br>Anyway, much more work to do on that.</p>
