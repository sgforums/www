                      that is so real, it feels so real. But few people contemplate what on 
                      earth is "self" actually? Where is it? What does it look like? Those who
                       contemplate, fish for evidence (investigate), and those who knows and 
                      sees it as it is - all of these have become realized beings, awakened 
                      beings, great liberated beings. In truth, is there any "self"? If we say
                       that there is, why is it that all the great venerable masters and all 
                      the realized beings have said that there is no self? If we say that 
                      there isn't (a self), why is it that all ordinary people feel like there 
                      exists a self?<br> <br> <br> è‹¥æƒ³è°ˆæˆ‘ï¼Œé¦–å…ˆå¾—ç¡®å®š

                       exactly is the “self”? What characteristics does it have? What natures 
                      must it possess in order to be called a self? Self would have to possess
                       two points: first is eternal and unchanging, second is ability to 
                      dictate/control phenomena. Only when it possesses these two points, 
                      could it be called a self, otherwise based on what are we calling it 
                      self? There is one thing, if it is like this yesterday, tomorrow it is 
                      like that, the next day, the next year, and many years later, a decade 
                      later it is completely of another state, then it cannot be said to be 
                      self. Why is it so? Self is unchanging, if it has changed why call it 
                      self again (it is no longer self already)? This is point one. The second
                       point is, if it is I/mine then we could have things happen the way the 
                      mind desires, and hold onto events and phenomena, whatever events should
                       be under our management and control, otherwise why call it self? As for
                       the body, when it is time to get old can you make it not get old? When 
                      the stomach is hungry are you able to make it not get hungry? When sick,
                       can you make it not get sick? With regards to mind, when there’s 
                      suffering can you make it not suffer? When the brain is thinking can you
                       make it not think? When craving, anger and ignorance arise can you 
                      control it not to arise? As with body and with mind, you are unable to 
                      dictate or take control of them, nor can you hold onto them without 
                      letting them change, therefore from these we could know, having looked 
                      everywhere there is nothing that fulfils these two points in which the 
                      “self” exists.<br> <br> è¿™æ˜¯ä»Žç�†æ™ºä¸Šæ‰¾ä¸�åˆ°ä¸€ä¸ªèƒ½ç¬¦å�ˆä¸Šè¿°ä¸¤ç‚¹çš„å­˜åœ¨ï¼Œæ•…è¯´æ— æˆ‘ã€‚ä½†è¿™å�ªæ˜¯ç�†è®ºä¸Šçš„ï¼Œè¦�æ„Ÿæ€§åœ°çŸ¥é�“æ— æˆ‘ï¼Œè¿˜éœ€è¦�ä½ åŽ»å®žé™…åœ°è€ƒå¯Ÿã€�è®¤è¯�ï¼Œè¿™å°±æ˜¯ä¿®è¯�ã€‚æ—¢ç„¶æ²¡æœ‰æˆ‘ï¼Œé‚£

                      points stated above through intellectual reasoning, therefore 
                      saying/concluding that there is no self. However this is only the 
                      theoretical side, if we want to understand no-self on a 
                      perceptual/experiential level, you still need to practically 
                      investigate/examine/observe and authenticate, that is cultivation and 
                      realization. Since there is no self, then who is it that knows and who 
                      is it that is aware? Who is it that is able to think? Who is seeing, 
                      hearing, awaring, eating, drinking, shitting, pissing and sleeping? 
                      Coming to this point, this is precisely where you should give rise to 
                      doubt, where you should clarify/make clear!! Coming to this point, even 
                      the Buddha is unable to make you understand through speaking, therefore 
                      there is a saying, “one road going upwards, a thousand sages does not 
                      pass down”; it is not that they do not pass down (teachings) nor speak, 
                      rather it is that they have spoken and transmitted much but it is just 
                      that you do not understand. Because this matter calls for an intimate 
                      seeing (insight). For example, the World Honoured One (Buddha) bites an 
                      Amla fruit (apple), and was profuse in his praises, saying its taste is 
                      so wonderful and so crisp, fragrant and pleasant. However no matter how 
                      realistically he narrates that taste, no matter how accurate, how apt, 
                      how vivid, how rich, you are still unable to understand it, unless you 
                      also take a bite. This is the important point and crucial key towards 
                      attaining the way!<br> <br> æ— æˆ‘ä¹‹æ—¶ï¼Œè¯¸äº‹è¯¸ç‰©ï¼Œ

                      seeing, hearing, and awaring is missing. There is no self, but there’s 
                      the ability to know, the ability to be aware, the wonderful taste of 
                      this can only be known by those who have realized this themselves. 
                      Wisdom is self-known, it has nothing to do with a personal/subjective 
                      self. The wondrous functions of the sands of ganges (meaning: countless)
                       naturally manifests. Knowing, doing (manifest) but there is no self, in
                       the background of the mind and body, there is no actor, there is no 
                      doer, there is no receiver/feeler, yet all works and assignments 
                      continue to be accomplished as usual, furthermore the efficiency at work
                       is high, no longer giving rise to suffering, it is truly wonderful. The
                       knowing of no-self, knows away all knower; the function/uses of 
                      no-self, uses up all user/function-er. In brief, no-self is replete with
                       (countless) wondrous virtues like sands of ganges. There is knowing, 
                      but one does not impute knowing on top of knowing, that is original 
                      knowing, and that is the knowing (wisdom) functions of no-self. Like a clear mirror, is always able to reflect, but the mirror that is able to reflect does not say I am able to reflect. (Note: I'm not too sure of the following translation so please suggest any corrections where needed) If the mirror says that I am able to reflect, the mirror's energy/spirit/divinity goes out. When the mirror's energy/spirit/divinity goes out, the mirror loses its originality, enters into illusions, and whatever one sees are illusions. If the mirror's energy does not deludedly give rise to I-reflect/subject-reflector in the midst of original reflection, that is the divine mirror’s original state. Our life is just like a divine mirror, that other situation is just like this, they are not two. All who deeply tastes this explanation, can you suddenly penetrate (and see)? Wisdom knows by itself, in it there is no self. Knowing without a self, is known as true knowing. The knowing of true knowing, is the same as Buddha’s knowing/knowledge.<br> <br> <br> æ— æˆ‘çš„ä½“éªŒå¹¶ä¸�æ˜¯ç¥žç§˜

                      reach, ordinary people often experience it, and often enter it. It is 
                      only that they do not know it. For example, when one is concentrated and
                       fully engaged in one’s work, one forgets one’s self and enters into 
                      joy, during sleep when there is no thinking nor dreams, at those times 
                      where have the self gone to? All these are the times when ordinary 
                      people enter into the state of no-self, it is only that they do not know
                       it, and cannot realize the wisdom of “always already no-self” from 
                      this! All these times of forgetting self are the entries and 
                      opportunities for entering and realizing no-self. We often think that 
                      forgetting the self means there is a self, but you temporarily forgot 
                      about it. If there was truly a self that you have forgotten about, then 
                      who is there during the state of forgetting that is seeing, hearing, and
                       awaring, and accurately dealing with whatever comes up? Our experience 
                      of forgetting self is one of the opportunities and gateways for 
                      realizing no-self; when we forget the self and yet is able to see, hear 
                      and be aware, that capacity and knowing that responses to everything is 
                      life’s divinity and light (original consciousness, original awareness) 
                      that we have to recognise and encounter! Usually, when we no longer feel
                       a self – the times of forgetting self, no self, one is yet better able 
                      to serve others and face everything; but when we feel that there is a 
                      self, we’re however unable to dictate or take control of all the events 
                      and phenomena. From this we can know, “self” is in truth an illusion, 
                      when there is no self it is not that there is truly no self, when there 
                      is self it is not that there is truly a self. In that original state, it
                       is not that there is a self, nor is it that there is no self, as for 
                      this actual condition, how can we put it? <br> <br> æœ¬æ�¥æ— æˆ‘ï¼Œå¤§ä¼—ä¸ºä½•å�´å�ˆæœ‰æ˜Žæ˜¾ã€�çœŸå®žçš„æˆ‘æ„Ÿï¼ˆæˆ‘çš„æ„Ÿè§‰ï¼‰ï¼Ÿä¸€åˆ‡ç”Ÿå‘½ï¼Œæœ¬æ�¥æ— æˆ‘ï¼Œä½†å› æœ€åˆ�

                      obvious, (seemingly) real sense of self (feeling of self)? All lifeforms
                       are always already without a self, but due to a mistaken thought at the
                       beginning, a wrong identification, a wrong belief, that gave rise to 
                      self, and thought after thought agrees/affirms, thought after thought 
                      strengthens this sense of a subjective self, a feeling of existence, 
                      reality, seemingly real, and solid. All these made us stop doubting and 
                      contemplating “what is the self, does it even exist or not in final 
                      analysis?” Society and the masses commonly regard the self to be 
                      existing, and our stories mutually support each other, society’s laws 
                      are also built upon such, therefore there is the current situation of 
                      today whereby the sentient beings of Jambudvipa commonly holds onto a 
                      (notion of) self. Because the sentient beings of this world have varying
                       knowledge and understandings, therefore they have different 
                      understandings with regards to the Subject-entity of "Self": generally, 
                      children treat the “body” as self, ordinary adults treat the “mind” as 
                      self, while those that have pondered over and explored, or those who 
                      have some knowledge and understandings, would go a step further and 
                      abstractify various illusory phenomena as Self such as a “soul”, “Great 
                      Self”, “Brahman”, “God”, etc. However, no matter what the masses 
                      conceive, the truth of things does not change, no matter how (seemingly)
                       real that sense of self is or how strong it is, it is but a deluded 
                      conceiving, an understanding that is not in the least substantive (with 
                      basis)!<br> <br> è™½ç„¶æœ¬æ�¥æ— æˆ‘ï¼Œä½†å¤§ä¼—

                      what is that feeling of “self” of the masses like? Where does it abide 
                      in? How does it come and go? All sentient beings are always already 
                      without a self, “self” is just that flashing moment of thought during 
                      pondering, it is a solid illusion/wrong impression from without 
                      beginning, it is illusory like phenomena in a dream, like reflections of
                       a mirror, like the moon in the pond, like the resounding in space, like
                       the child of a stone-woman (barren woman), like the second head of a 
                      person, it appears through imagination, it (appears) real due to 
                      identification, it (seems) true due to not being awakened/aware. How do 
                      we narrate the face of “self”? It is like the ghost of a painting, it is
                       like the god of a cat, it is like a pinacosaurus, it is like the eight 
                      year old child narrating the faces of his eighteenth generation’s 
                      descendents, it is like… All in all, there is always already no self, 
                      there is no where (which self) abides; there is originally/always 
                      already no self, no coming nor going; always already no self, illusorily
                       appears and illusorily ceases. Finally, one must still be clear about: 
                      there is always already no self, but there is an innate/natural wisdom; 
                      that natural/innate wisdom too is illusory, everything is unreal; all 
                      forms are illusory!<br> <br> Namo Amitabha Buddha.</p>
