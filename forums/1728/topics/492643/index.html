              <p>Inverted Men </p>
              <p>Although Ananda and the assembly had heard these words, they remained speechless. As they did not awaken to the Teaching, they brought their palms together and waited for the Buddha further instruction with their minds set on hearing it.</p>
              <p>The worlding's inverted views </p>
              <p>The Buddha then held up His shining hand, straightened His fingers to give (further) instruction to Ananda and the assembly and asked: After I attained Enlightenment (Bodhi), I went to Margadava park where I told Ajnata-Kaundinya and his group of five bhikhus as well as you monks, nuns and devotees, that all living beings failed to realize Enlightenment and became Arhats because they were misled by foreign dust which created delusion and distress (by entering their minds). What at that time caused you to awaken so that you can now win the holy fruit?</p>
              <p>Ajnata-Kaundinya then rose from his seat and replied to the Buddha: I am now a senior in the assembly in which I am the only one who has acquired the art of interpreting because I had awakened to (the meaning of) the expression </p>
              <p>"foreign dust", so that I won the (holy) fruit. World Honoured One (foreign dust) is like a guest who stops at an inn where he passes the night or eats something and then packs and </p>
              <p>continues his journey because he cannot stay longer. As to the host of the inn, he has nowhere to go. My deduction is that one who does not stay is a guest and one who stays is a </p>
              <p>host. Consequently, a thing is "foreign" when it does not stay. Again, when the sun rises in a clear sky and its light enters (the house) through an opening, the dust is seen to dance in the ray of light whereas the empty space does not move. I deduce that that which is still is the void and that which moves is the dust. Consequently, a thing is "dust" when it moves.</p>
              <p>The Buddha said: Correct.</p>
              <p>The Hinayanist’s inverted views </p>
              <p>The Buddha then bent, straightened and rebent his fingers and asked Ananda: What did you see? Ananda replied: I saw the Buddha open and close His fist.The Buddha asked: You say that you saw my fist open and close; was it my fist or your seeing that opened and closed?Ananda replied: As the Buddha's fist opened and closed, I saw that it and not the nature of my seeing did so by itself. The Buddha asked: Which one moved and which was still? Ananda replied: The Buddha's hand was not still; as to the nature of my seeing which was already beyond the state of stillness, it could not move.</p>
              <p>The Buddha said Correct</p>
              <p>Thereupon the Buddha sent out from His palm a radiant ray of light to Ananda's right, and the disciple turned to look at it. Then He sent out another ray to ‚Ananda's left and the disciple turned to look at it. The Buddha then asked: Why did your head move? Ananda replied: I saw the Buddha send out radiant rays of light to my right and left, I turned to look at them and so my head moved.í (The Buddhaí said:) As you turn to the right and left to see the Buddha-light, is it your head or your seeing that    </p>
              <p>moves?í (Ananda replied:) World Honoured One, it is my head that turns; as to my seeing which is already beyond (the state of) stillness, how can it move?</p>
              <p>The Buddha said: Correct.</p>
              <p>The Buddha then declared to the assembly: So every worldly man knows that what moves is dust. and that he who does not stay is a guest. You have seen Ananda whose head moved of itself whereas his seeing was unmoved. You have also seen my fist which opened and closed of itself whereas his seeing neither expanded nor contracted. Why do you still </p>
              <p>regard the moving as your body and surroundings, and so, from beginning to end, allow your thoughts to rise and fall without interruption, thereby losing (sight of) your true </p>
              <p>nature and indulging in backward actions? By missing the (True) Mind of your nature and by mistaking (illusory) objects for your Selves, you allow yourselves to be caught in the wheel (of samsara) thereby forcing yourselves to pass </p>
              <p>through transmigrations </p>
              <p>The heretics’ inverted view of annihilation </p>
              <p>After Ananda and the whole assembly had heard the Buddhaís words, their bodies and minds became calm and composed. They thought that, since the time without beginning, they had lost (sight of) their own minds by wrongly clinging to the shadows of their differentiated causal conditions and that they had only now awakened to all this, like a (hungry) baby who had not suckled for some time and suddenly saw its loving mother. They brought their palms together to thank the Buddha and wished to hear His teaching on the dual states of reality and unreality, existence and non-existence and mortality and immortality of body and mind :)</p>
