              <p>The old masters always said, your present mind is Buddha! Don't seek after 
                                                                  states, don't seek for experience, don't even seek for something called "enlightenment".Â  Sure, if there is ignorance obscuring the nature of 
                                                                  mind, then more investigation would be necessary. Ignorance being false views of 
                                                                  self and objects taken as reality.<br><br>Nevertheless, reality as it is cannot 
                                                                  be found through searching externally (for more amazing experiences, states, etc). Whatever you are searching for, is already fully present, is what you are, right here, right now (that is of course just speaking conventionally because if your nature of mind is empty, then self, time and location don't apply). The masters often give analogies like riding on a bull searching for his bull, looking everywhere for the missing key that actually resides in his pocket, and so on to demonstrate the absurdity of such actions, and naturally this means ALL contrived actions are ultimately not going to 'bring you there' which actually is 'where you already are'! The nature of mind is already complete and whole as 
                                                                  it is in this moment. That is why all contemplative investigation is not about attaining a more special state or experience, it is about investigating your present natural mind to discover its nature. And enlightenment is simply realizing your nature of mind as it is presently presenting itself in its ordinariness and naturalness, and apart from this, there is nothing else.</p>

                                                                  independently existing entity called mind. As this is not a denial of mind, the 
                                                                  statement that Mind is Buddha still stands. All is Mind, No Mind, not contradictory! However, mind is empty of an entity 
                                                                  called mind, and as such mind is a label collating the endless stream of 
                                                                  experiences - all are the illusory display of mind, intimate, non-dual without 
                                                                  subject or object. Just like the word 'wind' is simply a label collating the everchanging activities of 'blowing'.</p>
              <p>Nowadays, I don't cling to anything including even 'Buddha-nature', 'Truth', 'Ultimate Reality', or even 'Awareness', etc. There is no such thing in my experience! Not because there is no <em>awareness</em>, but because <em>awareness</em> is empty of an aware-ness, so it is more like awar-ing. Awareness too is empty of self. So there is no mind, no buddha, just experien<em>cing</em>: colours and shapes and sounds, a

                                                                  revealing itself by its brilliant self-luminosity, gone upon its inception due to the 
                                                                  departing of conditions, no traces (unless there is clinging, craving,

              <p>Non abidance is the key message of Buddha. Not to grasp this point is to fail to understand what the Buddha's teachings are about.</p>

              <p>Yesterday, I had this weird dream where there is this woman telling me (my memory of the 
                          words are no good but it goes something like this:) she likes animals like birds, cats, etc, because they have a sense of wonder in them, then more so should we (I presume its
              referring to buddhist practitioners), experience that like twenty times more.</p>
              <p>At that 
                          point, my dream blanked out into blackness, and I entered into a samadhi
                          like state, where the sense of wonder and bliss was so incredibly intense... 
                          After that I woke up. And though I didn't sleep much, I felt very refreshed 
                          and awake and not tired at all.</p>
              <p>I had many spiritual and prophetic dreams (very accurate) of late, but decided to share this one partly because Thusness told me to, and also I felt it is also important for others.</p>

              <p>Don't try to become "more aware". Like what satsang nathan said, what many 
                  people are practicing mindfulness is simply practicing the i-thought. (See <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bZmm6jH4C4&amp;feature=results_video&amp;playnext=1&amp;list=PLA35815749C414E5F">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bZmm6jH4C4&amp;feature=results_video&amp;playnext=1&amp;list=PLA35815749C414E5F</a> ) True mindfulness can be said to be mindlessness - empty of a subjective mind 
                  or observer. Any attempt to confirm a state of awareness (due to reifying 
                  awareness as real and existent) is illusory and intrinsically linked to the 
                  illusion of I - instead, not under the spell and illusion of self, all 
                  experience reveals its own nature and essence, the nature of mind reveals 
                  through and as all appearances. (Note: nature of mind is inseparability of 
                  emptiness, luminosity, and appearances)<br><br>When you realize all spontaneous 
                  happenings are self-luminous, luminosity is itself the magical display, then any 
                  contrivance to maintain an existing state of awareness is an illusion. Existence 
                  and non-existence does not apply to awareness/experience/appearances. The entire 
                  notion of inherent existence is itself a belief which we cling tightly due to 
                  ignorant uninvestigated false views, and this view is what led to all clingings, 
                  effort and contrivance. When view of inherency dissolves via the realization of 
                  the twofold emptinesses, there is no holdings whatsoever, just self-shining 
                  non-local appearances emerging and releasing on its own (via d.o.), like 
                  painting on water.<br><br>If awareness is co-emergent with appearances, then all 
                  that is necessary is simply to rest as the natural display which dependently 
                  originates.<br><br>Also, although there is no center and border to experience 
                  and therefore awareness can be said to be space like, any ideas about what 
                  awareness is, including being space like, is a phantasm. Since awareness is 
                  fundamentally empty and groundless, even to say "awareness is" is an illusion. 
                  Awareness is not space anymore than the sound of fan humming. There is no 
                  independent or unchanging Awareness or Source - just experiences which 
                  dependently originates, and are the self-luminous display of mind. And when I 
                  say mind I don't mean there is "a mind". Mind is itself the magical display. It 
                  could be better described as mind moments or just "experience". Sound of rain 
                  dripping on the ground just this speaks it all, I do not reference pure 
                  experience to some lofty ideations of some cosmic "One Mind".<br><br>If we do 
                  not realize the emptiness of all phenomena including space-like awareness, we 
                  will tend to reify certain sensations like space-like awareness into an 
                  unchanging ground out of which epiphenomena like body and mind arise from. But 
                  once we realize twofold emptiness, all phenomenon including space-like awareness 
                  are self-liberated upon inception, leaving no trace. Space-like awareness - 
                  self-liberated. Constricted awareness - self-liberated. Thoughts - 
                  self-liberated. Sights, sounds, smell, taste, touch - self-liberated. Ignorance 
                  - self-liberated. Wisdom - self-liberated. No modification whatsoever necessary 
                  - only the presence of prajna wisdom, the wisdom that realizes and recognizes 
                  the inseperability of luminosity and emptiness. Everything is as vivid and clear 
                  as can be by the presence of luminous clarity, but utterly intangible and 
                  empty.<br><br>And because there is no attempt to hold onto a state as 
                  solid/unchanging, realizing no existent state could be found, awareness 
                  self-liberates. Because awareness being seen as co-emergent with all 
                  appearances/experiences which simply self-liberates without trace, we cannot establish 
                  awareness as being the source of a current thought or phenomenon. Since 
                  self-arising and self-release happens spontaneously and instantly, being too 
                  quick for thought, each experience remains completely referenceless and we 
                  cannot establish conceptual relationships like "source" and "manifestation" - a 
                  previous moment of awareness (being empty of inherent existence) has already 
                  self-liberated and completely traceless before you can make such a linkage. If 
                  awareness is held onto as truly existent due to false view, then such a 
                  relationship could be established, but since we realize that awareness is 
                  completely empty of a self, that awareness is simply a convention for 
                  empty-selfluminous-manifestations, then all attachments cease and hence 
                  experience can only self-liberate without trace. <br><br>Due to the insight of 
                  emptiness and the dissolving of the view of inherency and hence seeing 
                  everything as dream-like and ungraspable, we do not cling to each moment of 
                  experience. We do not cling even to "awareness". Therefore, each moment of 
                  awareness self-liberates and no position of an existent, source, ground or 
                  essence can be established - be it of a self, of awareness, of mental and 
                  physical phenomenon. Everything is just a coreless, non-locatable, ungraspable, 
                  dream-like, self-releasing magical display like drawing paintings on water, or 
                  like a movie. Nothing is real, nothing can be established to have 'existence' - 
                  including Awareness, and this distinguishes Buddhism from non-Buddhist or 
                  Advaita teachings - luminosity, awareness itself is utterly empty, unestablished 
                  and self-liberating.<br><br>Not realizing the true face of awareness, we attempt 
                  to get behind thoughts and try to "get back" to an existent state of awareness, 
                  which basically means dissociation. Because true awareness cannot be separated 
                  into a subject and an object, all that is necessary is to remain in that state 
                  of non-dual contemplation where all thoughts and perceptions self-liberate 
                  effortlessly without intentions or a subjective reaction or dissociation. All 
                  attempts at dissociation are based on the false view of a self and a false 
                  subject-object dichotomy. In the true presence of awareness, it is simply seeing 
                  forms - self-liberate, hearing sounds - self-liberate, thoughts manifest vividly 
                  - self-liberate. <br><br>The practice of the four foundations of mindfulness 
                  coupled with the right insights, the three dharma seals and sunyata, is simply 
                  to recognize and experience all sensations displaying themselves in their 
                  spontaneously perfected bright self-luminosity and self-release by its 
                  emptiness. Freed from false views of duality and inherent existence, no efforts 
                  to cling to any states, and no efforts to dissociate from any experience is 
                  required.<br><br>Any false views that we cling to will prevent automatic, 
                  spontaneous liberation and effortless awareness, even though we may mistakenly 
                  think we are beyond effort before emptiness is realized. When the two emptiness 
                  dawns and our false views are overthrown, all experiences reveal themselves as 
                  self-perfected and self-liberating spontaneous presence.</p>

              <p>To truly begin to even practice, you really have to distinguish mind and 
              awareness.<br><br>Mind is your concepts, ideas, emotions, stories, etc. 
              Awareness however is the recognition of the essence of mind, the intrinsic 
              luminous clarity and emptiness inseparable. Awareness is opposed to ignorance or 
              unawareness.<br><br>If you cannot distinguish mind and awareness, you can't even 
              practice, and liberation will seem like aeons away. You will remain trapped in 
              your concepts and afflictions. You are going in circles never touching the 
              essence. Once you can realize and sustain that knowing throughout your life from 
              day to night, liberation is at hand.<br><br>What is awareness? How do I know if 
              I am at this moment aware? Awareness has self-certainty - it is the bright pure 
              presence of knowing that contains no doubt. If at that moment there is any 
              uncertainty or doubt "am I aware?" That thought is called mind and is an 
              indication of unawareness. If there is a doubtless, certain, presence of 
              knowing, without needing to establish any conceptual positions like "I am 
              aware", that is awareness.<br><br>If there is a pure presence of doubtless 
              knowing, that is awareness. It is important to understand however that 
              recognizing or even realizing the radiant aspect of awareness (the luminous 
              clarity) does not entail realization of emptiness. The former happens first and 
              is easier, the latter requires right view and further contemplations on the 
              twofold emptinesses. The former can be recognized in the gap between two 
              thoughts, or realized through self-inquiry, however often it is reified into 
              non-Buddhist notions of atman-Brahman. Therefore it must not be mistaken as the 
              realization of emptiness.<br><br>Awareness is not inferred but non-conceptually 
              present. However this does not mean awareness and thoughts are two different 
              opposing things. Awareness can "co-exist" with thoughts, I.e. The realization or 
              recognition of the nature of mind can happen with or without thoughts, however 
              that it is not realized through thoughts but non-conceptual wisdom. All thoughts 
              and sense perceptions are of the nature of mind, however whether we are aware of 
              it is a different matter.<br><br>Awareness is utterly unestablished and is not 
              some existent seperate knower, it is not a "thing" separate from appearances - 
              it is simply a presence of knowing, co-emergent with all appearances. Under the 
              influence of ignorance we call it eight consciousnesses, with awareness, 
              the eight consciousnesses transform into the five wisdoms. Awareness is not 
              separate from the various modes of knowing, it is not an ultimate 
              reality.<br><br>Under the spotlight of wisdom or awareness, all thoughts are 
              seen to be luminous and empty. All thoughts and perceptions reveals as bright 
              luminous clarity, but utterly empty and illusory, like a magic show, like a 
              dream, appearing from nowhere, at nowhere, going nowhere - merely a magical 
              display of dependent origination. The magical effect of seeing the illusory 
              nature of everything is that all perceptions, thoughts and afflictions simply 
              effortless self-liberate without modification.<br><br>It is like realizing the 
              monster in your dream is utterly illusory - what happens? Without trying to 
              fight off the monster, the monster simply dissolves on its own accord. 
              Everything releases, this is the magical effect of prajna wisdom that recognizes 
              emptiness.<br><br>If you can do this then everything becomes easy - no need to 
              fight thoughts, they just release by themselves simply by seeing its 
              intangibility.<br><br>If however there is any kind of distraction, any kind of 
              clinging and being conditioned by our afflictions of craving, aversion and 
              ignorance, we can be sure that we are still in unawareness.</p>
              <p>True and complete state of 
              awareness (which includes the actualization of the view of the twofold emptinesses) is utterly unconditioned by any such clingings and distractions.</p>
