(DrServo�)<br>[00:21]  is it<br>[00:21]  yup u will receive a refuge certificate<br>[00:21]  u took under which tradition?<br>[00:21]  theravadins maybe dun have?<br>[00:21]  got cert ?<br>[00:21]  got cert one ar<br>[00:21]  i tink have bah<br>[00:21]  samsam: yah, fu hui will issue u one<br>[00:22]  mine is mahayana<br>[00:22]  mahayana should issue<br>[00:22]  n ur dharma name will be written on it<br>[00:22]  ic<br>[00:22]  but i not really mahayana<br>[00:22]  theravadin one, depends on the temple<br>[00:22] * ZeN`out sets mode: +vv LawrenceM samsam<br>[00:22]  but most if not all chinese mahayana ones should issue<br>[00:22]  take refuge and take 5 precept is it the same<br>[00:22]  errr...<br>[00:22]  no leh<br>[00:22]  the 2nd time,i did it in a temple<br>[00:23]  lawrenceM, on a special day like Vesak n all this?<br>[00:23]  i though take refuge and 5 precept should be together<br>[00:23]  with a monk/nun presiding?<br>[00:23]  its during my job<br>[00:23]  samsam: well, in chinese mahayana depends on the temple<br>[00:24]  i attended a dunno wat eight forbidden thing<br>[00:24]  cannot talk,cannot eat event<br>[00:24]  can't get u rei<br>[00:24]  Fu Hui will conduct both simultaneously but only those who wanna take the precepts together will take the precept ceremony<br>[00:24]  NOT everyone will be takin the precepts<br>[00:24]  some will only take the refuge<br>[00:24]  oh, 8 precepts ceremony<br>[00:25]  ya<br>[00:25]  lawrenceM: 8 precepts<br>[00:25]  but i personally dun believe in it<br>[00:25]  in tat case, no cert is issued<br>[00:25]  still considered taking refuge?<br>[00:25]  for the 8 precepts i mean<br>[00:25]  8 precepts is practised throughout all traditions, theravada, mahayana, vajrayana i tink.<br>[00:25]  but the 3 refuge should be considered in it liao<br>[00:25]  not sure about vajrayana<br>[00:25]  take refuge dun take precept , will it defeat purpose<br>[00:25]  but mostly it's practised during retreats<br>[00:25]  samsam : not true. but best is to take refuge<br>[00:25]  no, becos not all r ready to take their precepts<br>[00:25]  take refuge got different meaning from taking precepts<br>[00:26]  for precepts, its a means to safeguard your blessings.<br>[00:26]  u dont want bad karma.. u want to retain a human rebirth next time... keep the precepts<br>[00:26]  i din really like it then<br>[00:26]  so like for my case, i took refuge first, n then took the precepts only about 6 mths later<br>[00:26]  lawrenceM: haha, i know wat u mean, i went for one myself too...<br>[00:27]  zen : wat is the point take refuge , dun take precept<br>[00:27]  i mean..after everything...everyone goes back to normal<br>[00:27]  its just going camping for fun only<br>[00:27]  bascially, the 8 precepts is only taken for 1 day n 1 nite<br>[00:27]  "Taking refuge means to return to the Buddha's domain and to rely on the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha as our teacher."<br>[00:28]  normally only the 5 precepts r required for laypple<br>[00:28]  --------------<br>[00:28]  What does taking refuge mean? In mandarin this phrase is made up of two characters: "gui" meaning to return to and "yi" meaning to rely on. From the aeons of births, from time immemorial, the Buddha-nature in each and everyone of us is an integral part of the Buddha domain. It is because of ignorance that we are departed from this domain and are caused to exist in the fire of the three planes of existence, namely, the worlds of sensuous desire, form and the formless, and to transmigrate in the six realms of existence, namely, deva, human being, asura, animal, ghost and hell. At times we are in the heavenly realm, yet at others we may be human, ghost, animal or in hell. It is like leaving the comforts of our home and parents to wander about as a vagabond. After having encountered a lot of difficulties and sufferings, and being helpless, we finally remember our parents at home and decide to return home to them.<br>[00:28]  -------------<br>[00:28] * fAtgh0st has joined #buddhism<br>[00:28] * ZeN`out sets mode: +v fAtgh0st<br>[00:28]  the other 3 r only taken for tat 1 day<br>[00:28]  taking precepts is also important.<br>[00:28]  wat r the 5 precepts?<br>[00:28]  if u cannot attain enlightenment this life... if you want to be reborned in 3 higher realms next life to continue your cultivation, u have to keep the precepts and not go against it<br>[00:28]  no lying,no stealing,no killing,no sexual misconduct,no liquor?<br>[00:28]  Abstinence from killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lyin n liquor<br>[00:28] * |ing| has quit IRC (Excess Flood�)<br>[00:28]  yah<br>[00:29]  u named it<br>[00:29]  wow..i can rem<br>[00:29]  i think i must stop lying<br>[00:29]  ic<br>[00:29]  samsam: anyway, when u go for the ceremony, most of the pple will not be takin the precepts on tat day<br>[00:30]  or mite not be takin the precepts<br>[00:30]  becos many of them mite not be "prepared" to take it yet<br>[00:30] * o_0__|_ has quit IRC (Quit ()�)<br>[00:30]  so some of them will only be takin the 3 refuges<br>[00:30]  i think the them is take refuge and 5 precept . rei-shou<br>[00:30]  wats the 3<br>[00:30]  theme<br>[00:31]  yah, san gui wu jie<br>[00:31]  yes<br>[00:31]  but the "wu jie" is not compulsory<br>[00:31] * COW_MILK has joined #buddhism<br>[00:31] * COW_MILK has left #buddhism<br>[00:32]  u registered to take the precepts as well?<br>[00:32]  all together one<br>[00:33]  so i think both take refuge and 5 precept . i register<br>[00:33]  my sis take refuge only recently<br>[00:34]  oh, where at?<br>[00:34]  zhu lin shi at rever valley<br>[00:34]  but no taking precept yet<br>[00:34]  zhu lin si? isnt tat at bukit batok/gombak?<br>[00:34]  river valley is ju shi lin...<br>[00:35]  at  river valey ju shi lin<br>[00:36]  i tell her info wrongly that she need to follow 5 precept. she take refuge only<br>[00:36]  well, nothin wrong with tat<br>[00:37]  she like to play mahjong, i stop her<br>[00:38]  bcos i say she need to follow 5 precept and ten good deed<br>[00:38]  5 precepts and 10 virtuous deeds are the basis for a virtuous human rebirth and to attain plenty of blessings. it is also possible to attain the virtue of being reborned in the deva realms<br>[00:38]  if u practise the 10 virtuous deeds<br>[00:39]  but i need to explain clearly to her . cannot misslead her<br>[00:39]  yes true<br>[00:39]  u have to explain properly to her<br>[00:40]  yah i think i need to explain if not i feel bad<br>[00:40]  after taking refuge, being a buddhist we should abide by the 5 precepts, practise the 10 virtuous deeds and the 8-fold path.<br>[00:40]  1.

One is not addicted to drinks or drugs.<br>[00:50]  2. One does not revel, oblivious to time.<br>[00:50]  3. One is not bent only on entertainment.<br>[00:50]  4.
