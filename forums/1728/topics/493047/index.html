              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Ohio Attacker Was Wrong, Rohingyas Too Have A Bloody History
              To Answer For </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Jaideep Mazumdar - November 30, 2016, Swarajya</span><span style="font-size: 16.0pt; line-height: 107%;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The facts of history are clear. The Rohingya side has a lot
              of violence, atrocities, and plunder to answer for in Myanmar. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Abdul Razak Ali Artan fumed against persecution of Rohingyas
              (migrants from Bangladesh’s Chittagong province) in Myanmar (Burma) and used
              that as a justification to carry out an act of terror in Ohio, USA. He drove a
              car into a crowd of students, staff and faculty of Ohio State University on Monday,
              where he was a student, and then got down to attack them with a butcher’s
              knife, leaving eleven persons injured. Artan was then shot dead by a police
              officer.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But Artan was ignorant of history. Had he studied the history
              of Myanmar, and of that country’s Rakhine province that the Rohingyas populate,
              he would have got to know how the Rohingyas themselves had massacred, raped,
              looted, enslaved and forcibly converted the indigenous Buddhist people of
              Rakhine region for many decades.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Artan would have got to know that Rohingyas have been, since
              the 15th century, an unwelcome presence in Rakhine. Muslims from Bengal, which
              was then ruled by Sultans, made their first appearance in Rakhine in the first
              part of the 15th century. In the earliest part of the 15th century, due to a
              line of weak Rakhine kings, its two powerful eastern neighbours--the kingdoms
              of Ava and Hanthawaddy (Pegu)--started jostling for control. Rakhine became the
              theatre for a forty year war between Ava and Pegu that drove out the Rakhine
              king Narameikhla Min Saw Mon (1380 to 1433) from his kingdom in late 1406.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Saw Mon sought refuge in neighbouring Bengal and entered the
              service of Bengal Sultan Jalaluddin Muhammad Shah. Saw Mon proved to be a good
              commander and became close to the Sultan. In 1429, he convinced the Sultan to
              help him invade Rakhine; the Sultan agreed and provided troops, mainly Afghan
              adventurers. The attackers defeated the then rulers of Arakan, as Rakhine was
              known as then, and Saw Mon was installed as the Rakhine king.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">However, Saw Mon, who founded the kingdom of Mrauk U, became
              a vassal of the Bengal Sultan and was forced to allow thousands of Bengali
              speaking Muslims to settle in his kingdom. He was also forced to accept the use
              of Islamic coins of Bengal and was given an Islamic title despite being a
              Buddhist. Historians say that an estimated 18,000 Bengali Muslims settled in
              Rakhine that time. Rakhine remained a vassal state of Bengal till 1531.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But from 1531 to 1629, Portuguese pirates operating along
              Bengal’s western coast (especially around Chittagong, sold many Bengali Muslim
              boys and girls they used to capture from Bengal to rulers and nobles of Rakhine
              and, thus, the population of Bengali Muslims in Rakhine increased further in
              the early 17th century.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Rakhine was conquered by Burma’s Konbaung dynasty in 1785 and
              following persecution of the Rakhine people by the Bamars (the dominant ethnic
              group in Burma), tens of thousands of Rakhines fled to Chittagong province. The
              Bamars also executed thousands of Rakhine men and deported most of the local
              population to central Burma. Many Burmese historians quote texts and accounts
              of those times to hold that the Bengali Muslims, who had started calling
              themselves Rohingyas (people of Rooingya, as the Bengalis used to call Arakan),
              helped the Bamars persecute the Rakhines. In return, the Rohingyas received
              protection from the Bamars. The Rohingyas’ co-religionists in Bengal also
              started looting and torturing the Rakhine refugees, raping their women and
              forcibly converting them to Islam.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Rakhine thus became a thinly populated province by the time
              of the First Anglo-Burmese War (1824-1826) which resulted in the annexation of
              Arakan by the British. And then started the second, and more intense wave, of
              migration of Bengali Muslims to Arakan. The British started bringing in Bengali
              Muslims to work as labourers in farmlands and other trades. The population of
              Bengali Muslims increased dramatically and by the late 19th century, they
              formed more than 20 per cent of the population of Arakan. The fact that the
              British East India Company extended theBengal Presidency to Arakan also
              encouraged this migration and demographic change in Arakan.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">This demographic shift caused by the unabated migration of
              Bengali Muslims from Chittagong to Arakan triggered racial tensions between the
              indigenous Rakhines and the settlers. Clashes started erupting between the two
              groups, forcing the British to set up a special investigation commission led by
              one James Ester and Tin Tut (who became independent Burma’s first foreign
              minister). Though the commission recommended a halt to further migration and
              sealing the borders of Arakan with Bengal, these remained only on paper since
              the British retreated from Arakan at the outbreak of World War II.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">And then started another bloody chapter in relations between
              the Muslim Rohingyas and Buddhist Rakhines. The absence of the British sparked
              violent clashes between the two groups. The British had given huge caches of
              arms to the Rohingyas in northern Arakan to stave off the invading Japanese and
              act as a buffer to British India, as also to take on the Rakhines who had
              started supporting the Japanese. In March 1942, Rohingyas killed 20,000
              Rakhines in northern Arakan, something that the Somali-origin Artan (the Ohio
              attacker) who spent seven years in Pakistan before migrating to the US in 2014
              would have been blissfully unaware of.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Once the Japanese overran large stretches of Burma, they
              started committing atrocities not only on the Rohingyas, but also the
              indigenous Burmese (including the Rakhines), Anglo-Burmese, British and the
              Indian migrants settled in Burma. They all fled to India; about 22,000
              Rohingyas took shelter in Bengal. The British once again armed the Rohingyas
              and organised them under a ‘Volunteer Force’ to harass the Japanese. But the
              Rohingyas once again turned on the Rakhines, killing them and destroying their
              houses, Buddhist monasteries and pagodas, raping their women and forcibly
              converting them. Artan would also have been ignorant of this.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Rakhines started harbouring a deep-seated distrust and
              animosity towards the Rohingyas. This became more deep-seated when the
              Rohingyas started demanding integration of Arakan with East Pakistan during the
              mid-1940s when two-nation demand gained ground. Just before Burma gained
              independence in January 1948, the Rohingyas appealed to Pakistan’s founder
              Muhammad Ali Jinnah to ask the British to incorporate Arakan in East Pakistan.
              Jinnah refused, saying he did not want to interfere in Burma’s affairs.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But the unfazed Rohingyas founded the Mujahid Party in 1948
              to carry on a jihad against the Rakhines in northern Arakan with the ultimate
              aim of creating a Muslim country of Arakan. They carried out many strikes
              against the Rakhines and their Buddhist shrines and monasteries, even torturing
              and killing Buddhist monks. It was only after the 1962 coup in Burma by General
              Ne Win that the military started cracking down on Rohingya terrorists who had
              the complete support of all the Rohingyas in Arakan. This triggered a moderate
              exodus of Rohingyas, who still form about 40 per cent of the population of
              Rakhine province, to East Pakistan. Many Rohingyas also migrated to West
              Pakistan.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But another wave of migration of Bengali Muslims to the
              Rakhine province took place during the genocide unleashed by West Pakistani
              troops on the Bengali-speaking people of East Pakistan in 1971. This migration,
              totalling to an estimated 750,000, to Burma continued even after the formation
              of Bangladesh (in December 1971) till 1973. Due to immense pressure from
              Buddhist monks and indigenous people of Burma, and fed up with the continuing
              attacks on security forces and installations as well as killings of indigenous
              Burmese by Rohingya terrorists, Ne Win’s government drove off 200,000 Rohingyas
              to Bangladesh till 1978. Bangladesh protested, and the UN intervened to force
              Burma to take back all the ousted Rohingyas. The New Win regime then enacted a
              citizenship law denying citizenship status to Rohingyas.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Rohingya terrorists have been carrying out many attacks in
              the Rakhine province and in the northern part of the province where they form
              nearly 90 per cent of the population, they have long followed a systematic
              pogrom of killing and driving away the indigenous Rakhines, and destroying
              Buddhist shrines. The Myanmar authorities have, naturally, cracked down very
              hard on them, thus triggering their exodus to Bangladesh and South-East Asia.
              The Rohingyas have killed scores of Myanmarese troops and police officers. The
              latest was a series of attacks on Myanmarese posts bordering Bangladesh by a
              Rohingya Islamic terror organisation called Rohingya Solidarity Organisation in
              early October that left nine police officers dead. Myanmarese security forces
              are engaged in a fresh anti-terror operation against the Rohingya terrorists
              which the Rohingyas and bleeding-heart human rights bodies term as ethnic
              cleansing.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The propaganda whitewashing centuries of bloody acts by the
              Rohingyas, their ethnic cleansing and genocide against Rakhines and their
              trying to take over an integral part of Myanmar by sheer force after totally
              altering its demographic composition is what drove Artan to his dastardly act.
              Human rights activists gloss over the fact that the Rohingyas too have blood on
              their hands. They paint the Rohingyas as the only victims of ethnic cleansing
              in Myanmar when the facts of history are quite contrary to that. Unfortunately,
              most of the world buys this false narrative.</span></p>
