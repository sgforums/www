When a practitioner first experienced this Â‘SelfÂ’, it is not uncommon to get overwhelmed by this/ experience and conclude this Â‘Self as the ultimate core of our Beingness.  The result of this experience is partly due to the luminous nature of consciousness and partly the habitual tendencies of our current mode of enquiry.  First we must understand that Consciousness need not fit in nicely into the structure of Â“what, who, where, why and howÂ” which is merely one particular system of enquiry that assumes reality is made up of isolated objects.  Although this is currently the ruling mode of knowing the phenomenon world; it is by no means the only way or the best way.  Imagine what if consciousness is not an object of anything and cannot be bounded within a space-time continuum?  Will such mode of enquiry that is strictly based on grouping, categorization, measurement and comparison understand the essence consciousness?  If not what other modes of knowing are available?  In Buddhism, mindfulness is a preferred mode of experiencing reality as it is.  It goes beyond symbols, labels, thoughts and Â‘seeÂ’ reality in a raw and undefined mode.  By going beyond this layer of abstraction, one is able to perceive without any in between intermediary leading to the gradual dissolving of illusionary categorization and division.  Â‘SelfÂ’ dissolves too as it can only lives in symbols.  Only then we are equipped with the condition to understand more about our true nature.  This is a pre-requisite.<br><br>Next, if we merely think that the flow is only a chain of thoughts, emotions, mental states in a series of self1, self2, self3 changing from moment to moment, we still missed something valuable.  It is not just so.<br><br>When a mind reaches certain level of clarity, thoughts subsides and before perception arises, what happened to the series again?  Does it cease to interact and stop becoming a flow, a flux of becoming or a stream of moments?  Has each of the moment of the self series (self1, self2Â…selfN) ever appear to us that it is the light of the sun, the blue color of the sky, the taste of the food?<br><br>The purpose of all teachings and all sutras are provisional means to bring us to the intuitive insight of the immediate moment.  In lightning flash moment, the vividness, the color, the sound, the texture and the fabric of reality are manifested and instantaneously it is gone.  All karmic propensities and the entire mystery of life and death are in this instantaneous moment of arising and ceasing.  It is not else where, it is the depth of clarity that matters.  It takes the perfect mental clarity of the Blessed One to penetrate to the deepest depth of this moment.  Do not overlook it.<br><br>My 2 cents.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

And what for do i need to stop doing bad deed? </span><br><br>it's a very good question.<br><br>since u mentioned that it is a mental continuum; and that of ever-changing. so let say, good deed is associated with happy mood and bad deed as angry mood.<br>then how long does it take for an angry mood to CHANGE to a happy mood and let along Change to a Peaceful mood? Normally It takes Time.<br>karma is kind of like mood swing ,like habit, like a momentum. without practice of controling it, it's not very easy to quit something that's been habitual for quite sometime.<br>Cultivation is to purify the mind. happy mood(good deed) is although better than angry mood(bad karma). But we are to cultivate Pure mood (pure karma, a form of karma that's neither good nor bad).<br><br>reference:<br><blockquote>4.

            <div class='col-md body'>kind of think of it, the hell beings (which are associated with anger/fear) takes quite some time before they can calm down their mood(or purify their negative karma). hence their rebirth are normally step by step toward better karmic conditions, from hell to hungry ghosts(greed) or animal(folly) or  to human(doubt) to asura(envy) to heavenly realm(happy) to form realm(no desire) and so on. but of course there are exceptional cases where they can skip some 'steps'.<br>and those heavenly beings when in happy mood, they are not easily angry in a short period of time. most asura beings are reborn into hell realms, just as it's easier to get angry when we are in a state of jealousy.<br>one can contemplate on people's mood swing to somehow see how rebirth/karma works.<br><br>imho,<br>/\</div>
