              <p><span>SEOUL - Tens of thousands of South Korean Buddhists rallied
              Wednesday in central Seoul to protest alleged pro-Christian bias by the
              government of President Lee Myung-Bak.
              <br> <br>A crowd estimated by police at 55,000, including thousands of
              grey-robed monks, packed City Hall Plaza for the rare protest which
              began with the beating of a giant drum. <br> <br> Organisers said Buddhist temples across the country rang bronze bells simultaneously.
              <br> <br> "Buddhists united to stop religious bias," read one banner.
              <br> <br> A police search involving Jigwan, head monk of the country's main Jogye Buddhist order, was the trigger for the mass rally.
              <br> <br> "This is only the beginning of our struggle," said Jinhwa, a monk acting as spokesman for the organisers.
              <br> <br> "This is the first time all 27 (Buddhist) orders have held a rally," he
              said, reiterating demands for an apology from Lee, the resignation of
              police chief Eo Cheong-Soo and legislation formally banning religious
              discrimination.
              <br> <br>Buddhists have been uneasy over what they see as Christian bias
              since Lee, a Presbyterian church elder, came to power in February. They
              were unhappy when he included members of his church network in his
              first Cabinet.
              <br> <br> An online map published by two ministries, showing Seoul's churches but not major Buddhist temples, also sparked anger.
              <br> <br>In early July, seven activists wanted by police following protests
              against US beef imports took refuge in Seoul's Jogyesa temple.
              <br> <br> Tensions grew late last month when police stopped a car carrying Jigwan outside the temple and searched the boot.
              <br> <br>Police chief Eo apologised and disciplined two senior officers. But
              Buddhists accused police of treating the head monk like a criminal and
              called for Eo's resignation.
              <br> <br> The government has tried to placate the Buddhists, with Culture Minister Yu In-Chon expressing regret Tuesday at the dispute.
              <br> <br>Yu said regulations would be introduced to ban religious
              discrimination by government officials. Lee has urged his officials not
              to make controversial remarks on matters of faith.
              <br> <br>But Buddhists were unappeased. Spokesman Jinhwa said that if their
              demands are not met, they would hold more protests across the country.
              <br> <br> Official data shows South Korea has about 10 million Buddhists and 13.7 million Christians.
              <br> <br>"This government is trying to evangelise the whole country and turn
              it into a Protestant state," said protester Suk Jin-Heung, carrying a
              banner demanding the resignation of the police chief.
              <br> <br> He said many Protestant leaders were under the illusion that the country became a Protestant state when Lee was elected.
              <br> <br>"But Lee must know he is not president only for Protestants but for
              Buddhists and Catholics too, and unbelievers as well," Suk told AFP.

              <p>Yah, not easy...</p>
              <p>Actually it's kind of a deja vu to me. I mean I remember in the early 80s in Singapore, many of us including the Malaysians, had the feelings that Singapore was a Christian nation too.

              <p>However, all  is well now. That's how I feel at least. Many Buddhists and Venerables had worked hard in building up the dharma studies centers in those difficult years and now the result is very possitive. The govt. has been very supportive towards Buddhism developement ( as well as other religions ) all these years and has try to be as secular as possible for the purpose of racial and religion harmony.</p>
              <p>So I guess all is not lost as long as we Buddhists encourage and support each other in the dharma path, for the good of ourselves as well as for the good of all sentient beings. Or simply put, just walk on no matter how tough the road is in front of us.</p>

              <h1 style="margin: 0pt 0pt 5px;">South Korea: Religious misunderstandings must be resolved</h1>
              <h3 style="margin: 0pt 0pt 5px;">Chosun Ilbo, Aug.28, 2008</h3>
              <p style="margin: 0pt;"><strong>Seoul, South Korea</strong> -- Around 200,000 Buddhist monks
              and laypeople rallied in downtown Seoul on Wednesday protesting against
              what they said was religious bias and constitutional infringement by
              the Lee Myung-bak administration. Police estimated 60,000 Buddhists
              took part in the rally in front of City Hall.</p>
              </div>
              <p><strong><img src="http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/picture/upload/korea-protest-2808-s.jpg" alt="" align="left">&lt;&lt;
              Tens of thousands of South Koreans, including 7,000 monks, gathered at
              City Hall in Seoul to protest against what they say is a pro-Christian
              bias in President Lee Myung-bak's government. BBC picture</strong></p>
              <p>The protesters issued a resolution saying a series of expressions of
              religious bias by public servants in the administration and President
              Lee Myung-bak’s tacit tolerance of such practices have undermined
              national harmony and the Constitution, which stipulates the prevention
              of religious discrimination and the separation of government and
              religion. They called on the president to break down the walls
              separating religious, social and regional groups and lead them to unity.</p>
              <p>A survey by the National Statistical Office in 2005 showed that
              24.97 million Koreans or 52.8 percent of the population adhered to a
              particular religion. There were 10.72 million Buddhists, 8.61 million
              Protestants and 5.14 million Catholics. There were also Won Buddhists
              and followers of “Chondogyo” as well as Confucians. It is simply a
              shame to see members of our largest religious group having to hold such
              a protest rally in the middle of the capital.</p>

              <p>In June and August, a computerized public transport information system
              operated by the Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs and a
              digital map created by the Ministry of Education and Science omitted
              information on Buddhist temples. The same company was responsible for
              making both programs.</p>
              <p>In March, it appointed as its vice president a person who had served
              as a senior advisor to the presidential Transition Committee. Buddhists
              not surprisingly raised suspicions of favoritism as this company went
              on to win two more large-scale map projects form the government, even
              after the Buddhist temple issue had created controversy.</p>
              <p>The poster advertising one sermon held by a large Protestant church
              in June to convert police officers showed Police Commissioner Eo
              Cheong-soo standing side by side with the pastor of that church. It was
              placed on all notice boards at police stations across the country.
              There are more incidents that have angered Buddhists.</p>
              <p><strong><img src="http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/picture/upload/korea-protest-2808-2-s.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="193" align="right">Religious
              tolerance is prized in South Korea. Buddhism is the oldest religion but
              officials say Christians make up about 29% of the population compared
              to the Buddhists' 23%.. BBC picture  &gt;&gt;</strong></p>
              <p>The government must set up a team to investigate exactly what
              triggered the anger among Buddhists. If such acts were intentional,
              then the people involved should be punished, and if they were
              unintentional, they should be clearly explained and measures taken to
              prevent them from happening again.</p>
              <p>On Monday, President Lee ordered public officials to be careful not
              to damage “religious harmony.” Ahead of the rally, Buddhists said they
              hoped the gathering, which aimed at voicing hope of an end to religious
              division and a beginning of unity, would not end up becoming a
              gathering to sever ties with the Lee administration. Countries around
              the world suffering from endless strife and violent clashes between
              different religious groups are said to be envious of our country, where
              so many different religions coexist without problems.</p>
              <p>To preserve this intangible asset of our society, the government
              must waste no time to listen to the voices of the Buddhist community,
              rectifying what needs to be rectified and resolving any
              misunderstandings. Buddhists, too, should consider what the Korean
              public is worried about at this moment.</p>

              <p>Hi all, I read your posts with interest.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Korean is a hotbed for fundamental Christianity, unfortunately. Do you know of the Christian cult group called "the Moonies"? I believe this group is banned in Singapore and it refers to the Unification Church founded by Korean Rev Sun Myung Moon. It grew to have much influence and Rev Moon even said that the Jewish halocaust during WWII was fair justice visited on the Jews for rejecting Jesus. This is such cruel and wrong thinking!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am a Christian and I feel sad that Jesus' message of love and compassionate has often been corrupted by fundamentalists who make use of religion for selfish political ends.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But I must congratulate the Buddhist movement in Singapore in sharing the Dharma actively eg Kong Meng San Park Kor See has many free publications in good, clear English. I feel that the Buddhist movement has gained many headways in sharing the spiritual path with others. I am one of those who have gained from reading Buddhist books in English. It helped me to be a clearer-visioned Christian.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some of you have expressed alarm and even fear that Buddhism is loosing out to Christianity and feel that you must do something. When we feel that our turf is being trampled on, we tend to react in fear and anger - this is against the spirit of Buddhism. What I admire about Buddhism is that you share the dharma not to "extend the kingdom" of Buddha but you share out of love and compassion - to help someone end his suffering.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Continue to speak against fundamentalism and extremism of all forms and not be silent. But hold on to the spirit of love and compassion taught by Buddha and Jesus, even while you see the tide of fundament Christianity sweeping across Korea. Try to see that these fundamental Christians are suffering too due to wrong thinking and ignorance. Even Jesus has said compassionately of those who persecuted him and put him on the cross:"Father, they know not what they do."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let us use this forum for strengthening each other in our spiritual paths, whether Buddhists or Christians, in tolerance, acceptance and love.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Om shanti (peace) to all.</p>
