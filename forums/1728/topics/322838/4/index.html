              <p>Hi all, I read your posts with interest.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Korean is a hotbed for fundamental Christianity, unfortunately. Do you know of the Christian cult group called "the Moonies"? I believe this group is banned in Singapore and it refers to the Unification Church founded by Korean Rev Sun Myung Moon. It grew to have much influence and Rev Moon even said that the Jewish halocaust during WWII was fair justice visited on the Jews for rejecting Jesus. This is such cruel and wrong thinking!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am a Christian and I feel sad that Jesus' message of love and compassionate has often been corrupted by fundamentalists who make use of religion for selfish political ends.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But I must congratulate the Buddhist movement in Singapore in sharing the Dharma actively eg Kong Meng San Park Kor See has many free publications in good, clear English. I feel that the Buddhist movement has gained many headways in sharing the spiritual path with others. I am one of those who have gained from reading Buddhist books in English. It helped me to be a clearer-visioned Christian.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some of you have expressed alarm and even fear that Buddhism is loosing out to Christianity and feel that you must do something. When we feel that our turf is being trampled on, we tend to react in fear and anger - this is against the spirit of Buddhism. What I admire about Buddhism is that you share the dharma not to "extend the kingdom" of Buddha but you share out of love and compassion - to help someone end his suffering.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Continue to speak against fundamentalism and extremism of all forms and not be silent. But hold on to the spirit of love and compassion taught by Buddha and Jesus, even while you see the tide of fundament Christianity sweeping across Korea. Try to see that these fundamental Christians are suffering too due to wrong thinking and ignorance. Even Jesus has said compassionately of those who persecuted him and put him on the cross:"Father, they know not what they do."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let us use this forum for strengthening each other in our spiritual paths, whether Buddhists or Christians, in tolerance, acceptance and love.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Om shanti (peace) to all.</p>

              <p>Certainly I do not think Christianity deliberately promotes cults. But interestingly, many cults have some basis in traditional religions. For instance, the Ku Klux clan in which advocated white supremacy was strongly influenced by fundamental Christian ideas. Then there is also the Branch Dravidians (the infamous Waco case in USA) where more than 80 people commited suicide at the instruction of their leader David Koresh. It also has its roots in pseudo-Christians ideas.</p>
              <p>The core of Christianity promotes peace and love but some people choose to interpret the bible according to their own purposes. They also do not consider the old testament is an ancient people's subjective understanding of their experience of God so when they win a war they believe that God is on their side.  I do not believe in such a naive and literal reading of the bible.</p>
              <p>What is boils down to is that many religions, especially the monotheistic ones (single god religions) tends to appeal strongly to faith and emotions, unlike Buddhism which to me (a Christian) seems more logical and rational. Thus, the faithful in monotheistic religions are more open to the dangers of charismatic leaders while Buddhists have been taught by Buddha to question even the teachings of your teachers to see if they make sense before acceptance.</p>
              <p>Monotheistic religions such as Judaism, Christianity and Islam (they all come from the same roots) have a historical record of violence not just in the form of cults but also against each other and against others. Some exampls from the Christian tradition are the Crusades, the Spanish Inquisitions and the Salem witch hunts in USA all condoned by the religions establishments of their day. Here a site on Christian terrorism: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_terrorism">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_terrorism</a></p>
              <p>Strangely, when I google "Buddhist terrorism" there is almost nothing much, except that all the sites point the Buddhism is against terrorism. I am sure there are some errant monks or abbotts throughout history who have used violence for his own political ends. But it is likely to be more on an individual basis rather than the mass actions that we have historically seen among those who claim to be Christians and Muslims. Maybe someone can enlighten me if there is anything on this scale in Buddhist history. It seems as a whole, there is no major war fought in the name of Buddha, haha.</p>
              <p>So why am I, a Christian, saying all these things seemingly against my own religion and still remain a Christian?</p>
              <p>Because I feel that fundamental Christians have missed the point of the Jesus' key message. Because I feel that fundamental Christianity has a very aggressive streak. Because I feel that many Christians are not objective enough for fear of criticising God. Because I feel many fundamental Christian elements and wrong beliefs have entered mainstream Christianity.</p>

              <p>Hi Maggie.meepok,</p>
              <p>Buddhism is very profound. Along the spiritual path, one will also be able to understand what is the nature of 'God' and its 'relationship' to the apparent physical world that we are living in.</p>
              <p>Strangely, our consciousness and beingness are not what it appears to be <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
              <p>Can God separate itself from its creations? If that is possible, then Space will be before God... because for any separation to occur... space must be present to apply distance and differences in location. If that is the case, Space will be the creator of God. Can you see the dichotomy?</p>
              <p>Buddhism is profound in that the very assumption of your own existence is throroughly investigated and explored.</p>
              <p>I hope that i am not being too hard-selling here. Just wish that you can give this area an investigative relook. Not easy and quite fearful for one to break away from the comfort zone.</p>

              <p>Hi longchen,</p>
              <p>If I am not wrong, you are saying in a very, very tactful way to me to question if there is such a thing as a personal, creator God which the Christians believe in, correct? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/wink.png" alt="wink.png"> </p>
              <p>Actually, in the liberal circles of Christianity, there are thinkers who challenge the traditional, theistic concept of God. A theistic god is one that is external to you, like some God in heaven who is like a person, who can comfort or punish you like a parent and who can, at will, interfere with the laws of nature and create miracles. </p>
              <p>American transcendentalist movements in the 19th century believe that the spiritual is in all creation and within your depths, and that this transcends beyond the physical and empirical and beyond the doctrines of traditional religion.</p>
              <p>A current day leading advocate who challenge the traditional idea of a personal, creator god is John Selby Spong who was the Bishop of the Episcopal (Anglican) Church at Newark, USA. Maybe he does not have the vocab for it like the yogis do, but he talks about God as a 'ground of being' within you not external to you, of finding something that is true inside of yourself like what the yogis call "purusha" or true nature.</p>
              <p>You are right that it being hard (for me) to leave one's comfort zone, to give up the idea of a personal, creator God that one is used to for so long. But I am on a journey of learning and exploration and I'd have to see how it goes. Yogic ideas and some readings on quantum physics (little bit only lah) do give very interesting possibilities.</p>
              <p>Even Jesus has said: "The kingdom of God of cometh not with outward show; neither shall they say, Lo here! or, Lo there! for behold, The kingdom of God is within you."</p>
              <p>So, it seems that Jesus also said that heaven is not an external place but a state of being.</p>

              <p>Hi all.</p>
              <p>Once, we are having social studies and we had a discussion on the conflicts in northern ireland. There is a conflict between Protestants and Catholics. My classmates said that there is alot of problem with christian, and terrorists using islam to kill whereas buddhist did nothing and were neutral. My teacher disagreed and replied that Buddhist also have problem, you can see in myanmar the case of monks protesting. This triggered lots of emotions in me. Now, there's a case on <br>Korea. If we looked at this problem at different views, one can conclude that the monks have much intergrity and wish to protect Buddhism whereas in another point of view, the monks are just trying to stir up problems and people will think bad of buddhism for what the monks are doing. This will give Buddhism a bad reputation in another word.</p>
              <p>There's a rise in the convertion of buddhists to christians in Singapore, or Southeast Asia in whole. As i am studying in a buddhist school, every morning the buddhists are suppose to recite the morning recital. Which means, we have to put our palms together and recite. However, the number of people putting their hands together decreases drastically as i observed. Many of my friends are devoted christians i can say. Though i am a buddhist, i believe that there's God, but what i lack is proof. I rely more on the teachings of buddhism, so i am a buddhist and not that i believe there are so many shen xian.</p>
              <p>What the monks are doing... is for the Buddhism's good? Or for their own egoism?</p>
              <p>To an outsider, is it considered a right act? or a way to gain popularity? or a bad act?</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>unfortunately i don't think your teacher knows why the monks in Myanmar, Tibet and S Korea are protesting. If not, he/she wouldn't have made such a statement. In Myanmar and Tibet the ordinary folk, of whom are mostly Buddhists, are being supressed by the authoritarian govts there.</p>
              <p>Monks in these two places are like the "spokespeople" and are highly respected by the laypeople there. So in fact they feel that it is their duty to protect the Buddha-Dharma; same lies in S Korea, because the persistent discrimination (and it's not recent but has been like that even under past presidents, only that the current one has crossed the border-line). However, there were not acts of terror, what happened in Myanmar and Tibet started off as peaceful demonstrations until the police and govt authorities used hard-handed means to suppress that it escalated, so it's not due to the fault of the monks there.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, being in a Buddhist school does not mean one will ultimately become a Buddhist; same as in a Christian Mission school. However, there needs to be a lot of improvement on how Buddhism is being taught. My friend, who was a teacher at Manjusri, told me how "boring" the class on Buddhism was and how uninterested the students were. So it's no surprise that they get "turned off". Likewise, friends of mine who attended mission schools also got "turned off" during bible classes.</p>

              <p><strong>South Korean Buddhist monk slashes himself in protest</strong><br><em>The Associated Press, August 30, 2008</em><br><br>SEOUL,
              South Korea -- A Buddhist monk slashed himself in South Korea's capital
              Saturday to protest alleged religious discrimination by the country's
              Christian president.<br>The 60-year-old monk used a knife to slit his
              stomach at Seoul's Jogye Temple, headquarters of South Korea's largest
              Buddhist sect bearing the same name, said sect official Lee Mi-ran.<br><br>The
              monk, identified by his Buddhist name, the Venerable Sambo, was taken
              to a hospital and his condition was not life-threatening, Lee said.<br><br>She
              said the monk left a note written in blood that read, "The government
              of (President) Lee Myung-bak should stop oppressing Buddhism."<br><br>Many
              Buddhists have accused Lee of favoring Christianity over their religion
              and filling most of his Cabinet and top presidential posts with other
              Christians.<br><br><em>Kinds of
              reminds me of the monks of South Vietnam in the 1960s who burnt
              themselves in protest of the persecution of Buddhism by the then
              president, a Roman Catholic.</em><br><br><em>Also,</em><br></p>

              South Korea -- Buddhists repeated their demand Monday for President Lee
              Myung-bak to apologize for alleged discrimination against their
              beliefs. They announced that they are preparing for a drawn out protest
              against the administration.<br><br>``If the government continues to
              neglect our demands, it will have to take full responsibility for the
              terrible situation that may follow,'' Ven. Seungwon, the spokesperson
              of the Jogye Order said at a press conference held at Jogye Temple
              Monday.<br><br>He also added that the Buddhist community will strengthen its countermeasure commission and make it a permanent organization.<br><br>``Buddhist leaders will hold a meeting Wednesday and make specific decisions,'' he said.<br><br>The
              leaders of the Buddhist community held ``protest'' services at temples
              nationwide Sunday. Ten thousand temples of 27 Buddhist orders
              simultaneously held a religious service across the nation to protest
              what they called the government`s religious bias.<br><br>Around 9:30
              a.m., the temples rang their bells simultaneously to start the service.
              Buddhist monks said the incumbent administration is biased toward
              Christianity and urged religious harmony, and followers took turns in
              criticizing the government.<br><br>Between 2,000 and 3,000 followers
              attended the service at leading temples in Seoul and other areas. Ten
              monks burned fluffs on their arms in a self-purification ceremony at
              Hwagye Temple in Seoul. Temples that missed the service will hold a
              similar one today.<br><br>The organizers of the Buddhist service will
              discuss holding another rally after the Chuseok holidays once their
              representatives review the government`s response after Wednesday.<br><br>President
              Lee, a Presbyterian, has been criticized for filling his Cabinet with
              member of his church and for not sending a congratulatory messages on
              Buddha's birthday, which was later explained as a technical error.<br><br>The
              Buddhist leader mentioned that despite the ongoing efforts demanding an
              apology and the prevention of similar religious discriminations at a
              Buddhist rally Thursday, the President invited New Right leaders to
              Cheong Wa Dae the following day.<br><br>Regarding Ven. Sambo's suicide
              attempt Sunday, Ven. Seungwon advised fellow Buddhists that they should
              express their demands in a peaceful way.<br><br>``Ven. Sambo attempted
              to disembowel himself based on the `webeopmanggu' (willing to hurt the
              flesh for justice and law) spirit. Our beliefs of trying to end
              religious discrimination and realize public harmony must be carried out
              peacefully and abide by Buddhist teachings, not radical actions,'' he
              added.<br><br>The monk concluded that if the government does not offer
              a convincing response, Buddhists will continue their protests and
              rallies starting in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province after Chuseok,
              or Korean Thanksgiving.</div>
              <p><br><br><em>Finally, another commentary in the newspapers,</em><br></p>
              <div class="quotemain"><strong>South Korea: Who’s Really to Blame for Religious Bias?</strong><br><em>Chosun Ilbo, Aug 31, 2008</em><br><br>Seoul,
              South Korea -- The Ministry of Public Administration and Security says
              it will offer classes to all public servants on how to avoid religious
              bias. From September, they will be trained in how to avoid religious
              bias in their daily work with classes being offered in regular monthly
              addresses to staff at central and provincial governments and during
              special education hours.<br><br>And starting next year, classes in religious neutrality will be mandatory.<br><br>A
              few days ago, Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism Yu In-chon
              announced that he intends to pursue the passage of a law to prevent
              religious bias and would set up regulations banning such bias and to
              punish public servants who break the rules. He also vowed to include
              programs on religious neutrality in training for public servants. With
              Buddhists demanding regulations to prevent religious bias among
              government officials, the government has chosen frontline public
              servants as the first to be scolded.<br><br>But the government’s
              “religious bias,” as cited by Buddhists, is not due to the behavior of
              low-level public servants, but from the words and actions of senior
              officials. Buddhists suspect that religious preferences played a large
              role in the selection of many high-ranking officials.<br><br>One man
              who used to be a pastor was appointed as a presidential secretary and
              went on to compare protesters to “Satan’s minions.” The president
              personally attends or sends videotaped messages of congratulation to
              evangelical events. But Buddhists say a presidential message of
              congratulation either arrived late on the Buddha’s Birthday or a ward
              official delivered the leader’s offerings instead.<br><br><em><strong>There were
              several incidents that incited the Buddhist community. For instance, a
              large poster advertising an evangelical rally for police held by a
              large church displayed the police commissioner’s picture and was posted
              on the walls of police stations across the country. Also provoking the
              Buddhist community, the chief of presidential security said his dream
              was to spread “Christianity” through all of the government’s branches.
              These incidents did not happen because of the mistakes of rank-and-file
              officials.</strong></em><br><br>The educational programs to prevent religious bias
              among public servants must seem to Buddhists and the government workers
              who will have to endure them as a preposterous game of pass-the-buck.
              It also shows that the government is still not taking the situation
              seriously. To calm seething discontent among Buddhists and resolve the
              situation quickly, the government should take measures to deal with the
              fundamental causes of the problem.</div>

              <p>I am quite sure self-mutilation is against the teachings of Buddhism. It is a tad puzzling that the venerable would resort to practices not in accord with Buddhist teachings to protest against government oppression to the <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">practice</span></em> of Buddhism.... But on the other hand, this just shows how desperate the Buddhist community in Korea has become...</p>
              <p>Perhaps the lesson we can learn here is to more actively propagate the dharma, lest we Buddhist become an oppressed minority in Singapore. </p>

              <p>Of course, self-mutilation is not condoned in Buddhist practice per se but since ancient times there have been cases where both Sangha and Lay members have sacrificed their lives for the Buddha-Dharma.</p>
              <p>For example, in the 1960s quite a number of Sangha and Lay members (i think around 20 in total, but can't really remember the exact number) in South Vietnam immolated themselves to protest against the persecution of Buddhism by both the then president of South Vietnam who was a Catholic, and by the Communist North Vietnam. The "self-immolations" became very famous when some American journalists took pictures and published it in the newspapers in the US. There was even a book published in Taiwan about them, i think i read it at the Singapore Buddhist Lodge (Jushilin) Library.</p>

              <p>Actually, the Buddhist community there became more strengthened. However, as we all know, unfortunately a few years later the Vietnam War broke out and the Communists from North Vietnam won.</p>
              <p>Of course, these are acts of extremism that preferably, should never have happened. But it does show one thing - that Buddhists should not always be removed, docile and play duck.

              <h3 style="margin: 0pt 0pt 5px;">Chosun Ilbo, Sept 4, 2008</h3>
              <p style="margin: 0pt;"><strong>Seoul, South Korea</strong> -- The conflict between the
              government and Korea’s largest religious group has lasted for more than
              two months. On July 3, Buddhist demanded that officials involved in
              what they see as discrimination are fired and basic remedies offered.</p>
              </div>
              <p><img src="http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/picture/upload/korea-protest-2808-2-s.jpg" alt="" align="left">On
              Aug. 27, some 200,000 Buddhist monks and laymen held a large-scale
              rally denouncing the government in the heart of the capital. Yet no way
              has been found to resolve the conflict.</p>
              <p>Grand National Party chairman Park Hee-tae notes flaws in the
              administration's responses on a daily basis, and lawmakers suggest that
              the administration deal with the issue more actively. But there is no
              sign that the government is doing anything other than mutter of
              “misunderstandings” and repeat that the president has already expressed
              regret. No wonder there are concerns that the administration does not
              realize how serious the situation is.</p>
              <p>All religions exist on the foundation of saving mankind. Because
              religions embrace such a basic human problem, conflicts between
              religions preaching limitless love and unending mercy invite extreme
              dichotomies, dividing people involved in disputes into good and evil.
              That is why conflict between religions ignite annihilating hatred and
              lead to bloodshed.</p>

              </div>
              <p>Because all religions have such a dual nature, it is taboo in civilized
              societies to drag religion into politics or for politics to interfere
              in religion. Once the taboo is broken, national and social misfortune
              follows, and the wounds may never heal. There have been many countries
              in this unfortunate situation, both in history and in the world today.</p>
              <p>The Korean Constitution stipulates that no state religion is
              recognized and that religion is separate from politics. It is because
              of that historical lesson that most modern states uphold separation of
              religion from politics.</p>
              <p>The administration must take positive steps to alleviate the growing
              unease in our minds. A stitch in time saves nine, they say, and with
              good reason. If a mishap is repeated time after time, it takes on the
              appearance of intent. Take the omission of temples from a public
              transport information site covering the Seoul metropolitan area,
              prepared by the Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs: the
              same thing was repeated in an online map prepared by the Ministry of
              Education, Science and Technology. Judgement on government actions is
              often passed based on subjective and emotional factors, and
              protestations that the government “didn’t mean it” fall on deaf ears.</p>
              <p>Thus the suspicion that a certain religious group was favored in
              appointments to important government posts, the invitation to the
              presidential office of other religious leaders in the wake of a
              Buddhist protest rally, the appearance of the police commissioner in a
              poster for an evangelical event, and a rude search of a car in which
              the leader of the Jogye Order was traveling: they add up to a pattern.
              Separately, all the incidents may have been accidents and
              misunderstandings, but it is hard to congratulate the government for
              having done the right thing.</p>
              <p>The president has already said several times that it was all
              unintentional and has pledged to educate public servants in avoiding
              bias against any religion. But what is really needed is not some vague
              program at the working level but a genuine attempt at the highest level
              to reassure, specifically, Buddhists.</p>
              <p>Given that the president's own evangelical religion is entangled in
              the current situation, it would be sensible for Lee, never mind right
              or wrong, to visit Buddhist leaders and listen to them. Once hearts are
              pacified, other issues, major and minor, can be resolved through mutual
              concessions. What both sides should pay particular attention to in the
              process is mutual respect: they must ensure that no needless
              provocation or insult to the other’s religion is committed.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0pt;"><strong>SEOUL, South Korea</strong> -- South Korea's President Lee
              Myung-Bak apologised Tuesday to the nation's Buddhists following
              nationwide protests against alleged religious bias by his
              administration.</p>
              </div>
              <p><strong><img src="http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/picture/upload/leemyungbak1.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="200" align="left">&lt;&lt; South Korean President Lee Myung-Bak</strong></p>
              <p>Lee, a Christian, was speaking at a Cabinet meeting, which approved
              regulations banning religious discrimination by public servants.</p>
              <p>"It is deeply regrettable that some government officials offended
              the Buddhist community -- even if they did not not mean to -- with such
              words and behaviour as could cause misunderstanding about a religious
              bias," he said.</p>
              <p>Leaders of the country's 10 million Buddhists -- outnumbered by 13.7
              million Christians -- had threatened more mass protests unless Lee
              apologised.</p>
              <p>The Buddhist dispute, rare in a country that guarantees freedom of
              religion, follows months of street rallies against US beef imports,
              which rocked Lee's administration.</p>

              <p>Buddhists have been uneasy over what they see as a Christian bias since
              Lee, a Presbyterian Church elder, came to power on February 25.</p>
              <p>The largest Order, the Jogye, lists on its website 23 cases of
              alleged favouritism, including the appointments of Protestants to major
              government posts.</p>
              <p>An online map published by two ministries, showing Seoul's churches but not major Buddhist temples, also sparked anger.</p>
              <p>Tensions grew in July when police stopped a car carrying Jigwan, the
              Jogye Order's head monk, outside the temple and searched the boot.</p>
              <p>Police were then searching for illegal anti-US rally organisers who had taken refuge in the Jogyesa temple.</p>
              <p>Tens of thousands of Buddhists staged a massive rally in Seoul in
              late August, demanding that the police chief be sacked, and Lee
              apologise and enact a law to ban religious discrimination.</p>
              <p>Police chief Eo Cheong-Soo, who is Christian, has apologised and disciplined two senior officers.</p>
              <p>Lee told Cabinet ministers on Tuesday to ensure officials stay
              neutral in religious matters but did not address the demands to sack Eo.</p>
              <p>However, he instructed the police chief to visit the Jogyesa temple to apologise to the head monk.</p>
              <p>"Regardless of the motives behind the search, the police chief has
              to visit Buddhist leaders and offer an apology. He must also promise to
              prevent the recurrence of similar incidents," he said.</p>
              <p>The president was expected to reiterate his determination to
              maintain religious neutrality during a 100-minute "town hall" meeting
              starting at 10pm (1300 GMT) and to be televised live.</p>

              <p><br>I am quite sure the buddhists in Southern Vietnam during the Ngo Dinh Diem era will not agree with you.</p>
              <p>If the current trend of Buddhist persecution in Korea is not arrested by the Buddhist protests, South Korea may well be heading in the same direction as Vietnam in the 1960s. As it is, there are already many reported cases in Korea of Christians destroying Buddhist temples and sutras... and I believe if you do a youtube search, you can find many vids of Korean Christians praying for the destruction of Buddhist temples.</p>

              <p><br>Looks like they really hate the Buddhists so much...Quite over the top. How come? A bit abnormal. I mean why they behaved as if they came from the communist era of the past? Can this means that if the fundamentals of any religions or ideology are incomplete( ä¸�äº†ä¹‰ï¼‰,  such a scenario is not suprising? It's just a matter of time for the catalyst to appear, be it in the form of a  person, an harmless incident, or anything.</p>
              <p>But i guess it's really becos sentient beings are getting more and more defiled, æ²¡æœ‰å–„æ ¹ï¼Œcannot see clearly anymore...</p>

              <p>Just to share with u guys a incident that happened to my mom on her Korea trip many years ago. </p>
              <p>She and the other tourists were on a tour bus going to some destination, then when their bus stopped for traffic lights or something, a group of ppl suddendly appeared from nowhere and started waving their bibles and shouting ( i think they r just trying to get the tourists attention) at the bus. Some even banged the bus with their hands. Everyone on the bus were shocked. The tour guide said those were christains trying to share their bible knowlegde with the tourists. Of cos the driver didn't open the door to let them in but zoomed away as fast as possible.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/cry.png" alt="cry.png"></p>
