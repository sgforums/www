              <p>In 2006, Lee also sent a video prayer message to a Christian rally held in the southern city of Busan in which the worship leader prayed feverishly: "Lord, let the Buddhist temples in this country crumble down!" That footage - which someone poked fun at by cleverly comparing it to Ronald Reagan's famous speech, "Mr [Mikhail] Gorbachev, tear down this wall!" - drew palpable and anticipated uproars from the Buddhists and even some from Christians.</p>

              <p>SUBJECT: Rebuttal to Chan Akya:</p>
              <p><em>“Islam and the absence of Chinese terrorists”</em> By Chan
              Akya.Asia Times refused to print this reponse to Akya even though
              regular diatribes on Islam are regularly printed in the online paper</p>
              <p>The incomprehensible “gabalty-gook” written by Chan Akya in his
              article “Islam and the absence of Chinese terrorists” was totally
              devoid of any semblance to reality. His selective use of historical
              facts showed dishonesty and blatant Islamphobic bigotry.</p>
              <p><strong>FACT:</strong> Hinayana Buddhism lost its classical fight
              against Brahmanism in Hindu Kush, Taxila, Kushan, Kashmir, and other
              areas of the Subcontinent and was banished from India</p>
              <p><strong>FACT:  </strong>To survive in China<strong> </strong>Hiniyana
              transformed itself into Mahayana (Hiniyana light with a more acceptable
              light skinned oriental Buddha, instead of a dark-skinned Indian
              Siddharta/Buddha).</p>
              <p>Sitting on a sanctimonious horse acting “holier than though”, and
              passing judgment on another religion shows pure unadulterated racism.
              Living in a Buddhist glass house, Ankya should know better than to
              throw stones at Islam!.</p>
              <p>Neither Hiniyana, nor Mahayana Buddhist is immune to violence or
              terrorism. Ankya says that “the history of Buddhism has much to do with
              this divergence.”. He may be partially right, Muslim terrorists
              originally trained by the CIA (Bin Laden who turned on the their maker)
              kill one or two, or dozens or hundreds. For every Bin Laden there is a
              Kim Jung II.</p>
              <p>Buddhists also kill by the dozens, but there is a qualitative and
              quantitative difference in Buddhist atrocities. The Buddhist terrorists
              kill millions. Let me remind Akya of some historical anomalies in his
              ridiculous article.</p>
              <p>1)       The Sinhalese-Tamil (Buddhist-Hindu) civil war in Sri Lanka
              is of course taken toll of thousands of lives, and as of last week was
              on the cover story of all major news organizations. The Sri Lankan
              government and the Tamils are both accused of terror tactics and
              committing atrocities.</p>
              <p>2)     The Cambodian killing fields were red in blood, not because the Khemers were docile Buddhists.</p>
              <p>3)     The violent perpetuated in Buddhist Vietnam between rivals
              (US as well as Vietnamese) was more violent than any we have seen in
              recent times.</p>
              <p>4)      Where was Mahayana Buddhism during the Sun Yet Sun and Maoist civil war?</p>
              <p>5)     Where was Buddhist “<em>ahimsa</em>” (non-violence) during the Cultural Revolution?</p>
              <p>6)     Why was Buddhist-Taoist philosophy unable to “to fill the
              poor with greater optimism about their lot” during the Japanese
              invasion of Korea?</p>
              <p>7)     Why was Buddhist philosophy in hiding during the rape of Nanking by Buddhist (Japanese) soldiers?</p>
              <p>8)     Why was the “enlightenment” absent during the abduction of 300,000 Korean women by Buddhist (Japanese) soldiers in Korea?</p>
              <p>9)     Why doesn’t Mahayana Buddhist-Taoist philosophy stop the genocide of Ughurs?</p>
              <p>10)  The human rights records of Laos, and Burma are not written in gold in the history books of tolerance and enlightenment.</p>
              <p>11) ) The Thai massacres of Muslims in Thailand should not be a reason to criticize all Buddhists!</p>
              <p>All Buddhist countries have seen unprecedented violence in the past
              70 years. To pretend otherwise is disingenuous! Ankya knows well, that
              neither Islam, nor Hinduism, nor Sikhism, nor Judaism, nor Buddhist nor
              Christianity has a monopoly on terror or violence or genocide.</p>
              <p>It is not the religion, but politics, injustice, colonialism, and occupation that create violence.</p>

              <p>A: The Tamils want to fight for their own independent land in Sri Lanka, something of course the Sinhalese definetly do not agree with.</p>

              <p>Unfortunately, communism had already made its mark on the government, and resulted in the killing. Buddhism itself and Buddhists were being persecuted, so how can you link Buddhism to the killing?</p>
              <p>3)     The violent perpetuated in Buddhist Vietnam between rivals (US as well as Vietnamese) was more violent than any we have seen in recent times.</p>
              <p>North Vietnam was already communist, and South Vietnam had a staunch Catholic who also persecuted Buddhism, resulting in some famous incidents of self-immolation by Buddhist monks.</p>
              <p>4)      Where was Mahayana Buddhism during the Sun Yet Sun and Maoist civil war?</p>
              <p>Like South Korea now, Chiang Kai-shek and his wife were staunch Christians, and there were several generals who also persecuted Buddhism. Maoists do not believe in any religion, period.</p>
              <p>5)     Where was Buddhist “<em>ahimsa</em>” (non-violence) during the Cultural Revolution?</p>
              <p>All forms of religion were persecuted during the Cultural Revolution by the CCP, period. Temples were torn down or converted to factories, monks and nuns were sent to labour camps or even killed on the spot. How?</p>
              <p>6)     Why was Buddhist-Taoist philosophy unable to “to fill the poor with greater optimism about their lot” during the Japanese invasion of Korea?</p>
              <p>7)     Why was Buddhist philosophy in hiding during the rape of Nanking by Buddhist (Japanese) soldiers?</p>
              <p>8)     Why was the “enlightenment” absent during the abduction of 300,000 Korean women by Buddhist (Japanese) soldiers in Korea?</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the Japanese were led by a pro-war government, which regarded the Emperor as a god, this is called "state Shintoism". But as a Singaporean practicing a form of Japanese Pure Land, i agree, this is something that is shameful in Japanese Buddhist history. But, it's not the fault of the Buddhists or Buddhism per se.</p>
              <p>9)     Why doesn’t Mahayana Buddhist-Taoist philosophy stop the genocide of Ughurs?</p>
              <p>CCP isn't Buddhist, it's communists.</p>
              <p>10)  The human rights records of Laos, and Burma are not written in gold in the history books of tolerance and enlightenment.</p>
              <p>When the rulers forget the teachings of Buddhism, this is what happens. Remember, in Burma its now the monks who are leading the fight for democracy.</p>
              <p>11) ) The Thai massacres of Muslims in Thailand should not be a reason to criticize all Buddhists!</p>
              <p>Like Sri Lanka, the Thai muslims want independence for themselves, which of course the Thais do not agree with. And, from reports, it's mostly the Muslims killing their own people.</p>

              <p>Obviously Buddhists fought war, but you should know most Buddhists are merely Buddhist by name, how many know about the teachings? How many take the teachings to heart?</p>
              <p>Also they <strong>cannot</strong> be called 'Buddhist terrorists', because they did not fight wars in the name of Buddhism (unlike say, Osama Bin Laden, al qaeda and the various terrorist groups we now commonly know).</p>
              <p>There are also many Christian terrorist groups, though of course less deadly than some of the well known Islamic ones -- such as Al Qaeda. The Christian terrorist groups did kill people in the name of Christianity, they bomb abortion clinics and so on. Perhaps you didn't heard of, because you didn't read the news often or read history.</p>

              <p><strong>Oh yes, you can find long articles on Christian terrorism and Islamic terrorism in Wikipedia, but theres no article on 'Buddhist terrorism'</strong></p>
              <p>Simply because there was almost no violence fought and justified in the name of Buddhism before, and no Buddhist scriptures provide any support for such violence. (a rare exception is the case of a few patriotic/nationalistic japanese buddhist priests in the past supporting the WW2 by Japan, which is really unfortunate but there was obviously no scriptural basis and support for any of such aggression -- only due to the loyalty to their emperor) There has however been many wars started by and justified in the name of Christianity and Islam in history.</p>
              <p>Whether the Quran has been wrongly interpreted by the hands of the terrorists to justify and inspire their cause may be debatable, but Buddhist scriptures basically leave no room at all for such violence. So any acts of aggression by Buddhist doesn't have any scriptures for 'support', and are only purely motivated by greed and politics. Buddhism is out of the picture.</p>
              <p>Also, you'll never see Buddhists praying for the destruction of Christian churches, because Buddhists do not judge, and have prejudices against Christianity. It is simply against the Buddhist spirit of understanding, loving-kindness, non-violence.</p>

                                                                    (non-violence) during the Cultural Revolution?</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Cultural Revolution was the aggression of the <strong>Atheist</strong> red army of the CCP, silly! Buddhism is one of the victims of this aggression. It's quite silly they said this, obviously they didn't have any idea what the Cultural Revolution is and who is behind them. They should read up on history.</p>

                                      and he used to denounced Buddhism through offensive remarks and
                                      degradation of Buddhism as superstitious and demonic (obviously at
                                      that time he has mistaken Buddhism as a kind of 'folk religion' and
                                      has little understanding of the Buddhist teachings). He was also an
                                      author of a Christian book, on the study of the bible.</em></p>
              <p><em>His excuse when asked by his professor for insulting Buddhism is
                                      "the other pastors are all doing it, if I don't, they'll say I
                                      don't know how to preach." His university professor then asked him
                                      to go do research and will be fully supportive of him if he writes
                                      a critique out of it. After he did his research, he realised he has
                                      completely wronged Buddhism, and found what he has always sought
                                      for... and converted.</em></p>
              <p><em>Even the intention of blasphemy can become a good condition...
                                      provided that he is open minded and actually reads and consider
                                      what is being taught. My master said, the reason he came to

                                      Christian pastors who wished to denounce Buddhism, went to research
                                      on it and converted instead. Some of them became famous Buddhist
                                      translators.</em></p>

              <p>Well actually there are those who claim that they WERE serious practicing Buddhists.

              <p>Actually, the situation in Korea now is like Taiwan several decades ago, especially when Chiang Kai-shek (è”£ä»‹çŸ³) was president.
