              <p><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 100%;"><strong>Jogye Order says Korean government of favoring Christianity</strong></span><br><em>The Indian Catholic, July 1, 2008</em><br>SEOUL, South Korea -- Buddhists in South Korea have protested what they see as the new government's bias against Buddhism and in favor of Christianity.<br><br>The Jogye Order, the country's largest Buddhist denomination, on June 24 issued a statement charging that Seoul's transport information system, Algoga (find your way), "intentionally" omitted mention of any Buddhist temples.<br><br>It pointed out that the system's online map (www.algoga.go.kr) did not include the famous Jogyesa and Bongeunsa temples, which many foreigners visit in the capital. The Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs maintains the map, which it says 20,000 Internet users visit every day.<br><br>Venerable Seungwon, Jogye spokesperson, signed the statement, titled We strongly condemn religiously biased actions of President Lee's government. In it the monk accuses President Lee Myung-bak's administration of favoring Christianity, especially Protestantism.<br><br>In 2003, when the previous government built the online information system, the Buddhist temples were marked on the map. But a version updated on June 9 dropped them. The ministry, at a June 23 press conference, admitted a "mistake," and the Buddhist temples reappeared on the map four days later.<br><br>Meanwhile, however, on June 25, all 28 first-time elected members of the Jogye Order's 81-member Central Council issued another statement. They contended the omission was not just a mistake, because the map showed even small Protestant churches, marked with a red cross and their name.<br><br>The Buddhist monks also accused Lee of favoring Protestants for his Cabinet and the Presidential Office since his inauguration in February. Of the current 15 ministers, 10 are Protestants, two are Catholics and the religious affiliation of the other three is not known.<br><br>The monks also noted that the deputy head of presidential security, a Protestant, said in a newspaper interview that "his dream is to evangelize all government ministries." Another incident they cited involved a presidential secretary, who is a Protestant pastor, reportedly telling a Presbyterian gathering in Seoul on June 5 that people attending candlelight vigils to protest U.S. beef imports are "a host of Satans."<br><br>"Such religiously biased incidents are done with government connivance," the Jogye council members charged. They asked the government to introduce legal measures to prevent such religious bias or discrimination.<br><br>The Religious Peace Commission of the order has also demanded the transport minister's resignation. The commission has issued several statements protesting the government's alleged religious bias.<br><br>In a June 25 statement, it disclosed that Eo Cheong-soo, head of the national police, openly supported Protestant police personnel's "fasting prayers for the evangelization of all the police." According to the commission, a photo of Eo, a Catholic, appears on a poster to publicize the prayers along with Reverend Cho Yong-gi of the Full Gospel Church.<br><br>Reverend Park Deuk-hoon, co-representative of Christian Alliance for Church Reform, told UCA News on June 27 that "such incidents should not have occurred." The police chief's photo on the poster, he said, "very possibly pressed his people" to participate in the prayers.<br><br>A Protestant official, Reverend Kim Tae-hyon, director of the Church and Ecumenical Relationship Department of the National Council of Churches in Korea, acknowledged the general issue as very sensitive. He told UCA News the people in Lee's government "are not qualified morally."<br><br>Park Kwang-seo, co-representative of the Korean Institute for Religious Freedom, claims that governments have given preferential treatment to Christianity and discriminated against Buddhism since the Republic of Korea was established in 1948.<br><br>The Buddhist professor at Jesuit-run Sogang University in Seoul told UCA News on June 27 that Buddhists have suffered discrimination under Christian presidents. Four out of the country's 10 presidents have been Christians.<br><br>Park also noted that Christian pastoral ministry in the military started in 1948, while Buddhists could only begin such work in 1968. A Protestant radio service, he added, began airing in 1954, but Buddhists were only allowed to start such a service in 1990.<br><br>James Byun Jin-heung, former secretary general of the Korean Conference on Religion and Peace, told UCA News the president should be neutral in religious issues. Even before Lee took office, many people worried about his strong Protestant conservatism, the Catholic layman noted.<br><br><em>(http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=45,6726,0,0,1,0)</em> </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong>Seoul Transport Map Omits Names of Buddhist Temples<br></strong><em>Chosun Ilbo, June 24, 2008</em><br>Seoul, South Korea -- The Seoul metropolitan area transport information system Algoga (“find your way”) is at the center of controversy after it was revealed that it omits the names of the major Buddhist temples.<br><br>The Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism, the largest Buddhist order in Korea, argues this clearly represents the evangelical tendency of the Lee Myung-bak administration.<br><br>According to the Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs, typing in the names of Seoul’s major temples like Jogye Temple and Bongeun Temple on Monday, the system indicates their location on the map with an arrow, but their names do not appear. For example, in case of Bongeun Temple, the names of seven to eight small and medium-sized nearby churches are marked on the map with a cross and their names, but not the temple. The Jogye and Guryong Temples and Nungin Sunwon are not marked on the map. The Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism appears on the map for the headquarters of the order but not the Jogye Temple.<br><br>The Ministry of Construction and Transportation, the precursor of the current ministry, invested W 1.5 billion (US$1 = W1,039) in Algoga, which provides information on public transport in the Seoul metropolitan area, in 2003. At that time, the names of Buddhist temples were marked on the map. After criticisms that Algoga does not contain enough information, Korea geoSpatial Information and Communication, which participated in developing the system from the beginning and was commissioned to maintain the system, updated Algoga in April this year. That is when the names of Buddhist temples were dropped.<br><br>An average of 15,000 to 20,000 people visit the Algoga site daily. After it stirred up controversy, the ministry hurriedly called a press conference to explain the omission was a “mistake,” saying the person in charge did not double-check.<br><br>Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs Minister Chung Jong-hwan plans to make an apology to senior Buddhist figures. The Bus Transportation Business Association, which runs the site, also apologized, saying it was perplexed by the number of protest calls, and sorry “to have occasioned Buddhist members of society so much concern and anxiety.” <br><br>Korea geoSpatial said it has not entered the names “of some temples, parks and golf clubs” in the upgrading process and will finish entering the information within the week.<br><br>LayBuddhist.Net and the Religious Peace Council of the Jogye Order released a statement on Monday that called for “an immediate revamp of Algoga, which eradicated 1,700 years of Buddhist traditions and culture” and for the resignation of the transport minister. The statement says the names were left out intentionally at the orders of someone in authority. <br><br>“We condemn the religious two-facedness of the Lee Myung-bak administration, and demand strict punishment of officials and relevant institutions who intend to serve the benefit of a particular religious group,” the statement said.</p></div>

With religious groups joining the candlelight rallies, the protests have grown and are peaceful once again. The government, for its part, seems to be trying to reach out to the organizations.<br><br>On July 1, Christian groups, including the National Council of Churches in Korea, said they would hold an “emergency prayer meeting” in front of Seoul’s City Hall on the evening of July 3. Buddhist groups, including the Solidarity for Buddhist Environment and LotusWorld, plan to hold a large-scale Buddhist service on July 4.<br><br>“Catholic, Christian and Buddhist groups are trying to overcome the situation. If there is no change in the government’s stance, we will consider issuing a statement signed by the leaders of seven groups representing seven different denominations,” said Yang Deok-chang, a senior official with the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of Korea.<br><br>The “emergency mass” held by the CPAJ on June 30 was attended by some 30,000 citizens, all holding candles, on the plaza in front of City Hall. Led by the Catholic priests, citizens marched peacefully past Namdaemun, Seoul’s South Gate, and Myeong-dong, instead of heading to the presidential office of Cheong Wa Dae, or the Blue House.<br><br><em>The activities of the Buddhist groups in particular have put the government on edge. Buddhist groups have long felt that the government is more partial to Christian groups, perhaps because President Lee Myung-bak is a confirmed Christian and an elder at Somang Presbyterian Church in Seoul.</em><br><br>The CPAJ’s participation is also worthy of note. It was active in the pro-democracy movement of the 70s and 80s and has come to serve as a kind of moral compass. Last fall, it represented Kim Yong-cheol when he brought allegations of corruption against Samsung Group.<br><br>As if the government sensed the urgency of the situation, Prime Minister Han Seung-soo said, without any prior notice, that he would meet with Ven. Jigwan, the executive chief of the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism, the country’s biggest Buddhist sect. The meeting was cancelled, however, due to a protest by alliance of Buddhist groups organizing the July 4 Buddhist service, which called on the prime minister to first draw up his plans for renegotiation of the U.S. beef agreement before meeting with the Ven. Jigwan. The prime minister is also believed to be considering meeting with various religious leaders, including leaders of Catholic and Christian groups.<br><br>In a rare move, Culture Minister Yu In-chon proposed opening a “direct dialogue” between the government and the People’s Countermeasure Council Against Mad Cow Disease, which has been a leading organizer of the candlelight rallies. In an interview with CBS radio, Yu said, “So far, (the government and the organizers of the candlelight rallies) have only told their side of the story, but it seems there has not been much chance for the two sides to meet and talk with each other. The most urgent thing is dialogue.”<br><br>“As the government has no channel for talks with the rally organizers, I’m asking some people to hold talks. To open a channel for discussion, I think the organization leaders who are in detention need to be treated with leniency,” Yu said.<br><br>Cheong Wa Dae has so far declined to comment on the situation, but was believed to be monitoring the situation closely. It also appears to be taking extra precautions as religious groups are now involved in the candlelight demonstrations.<br><br>However, it’s uncertain whether the government action will placate candlelight protesters and religious groups because it lost trust with a violent crackdown on the rallies, during which it called the candlelight protests “illegal” and “violent.” Civic groups responding to the culture minister’s proposal to hold talks with the People’s Countermeasure Council said that the proposal is “nonsense, because police have already arrested some of the activists from the council.”<br><br>(http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=45,6739,0,0,1,0) </div></div>

              <p>Actually, the start of the persecution of Buddhism in Korea was not by the Christians (at least before 1910-1945), but by the Confucianistic Lee Dynasty. When the Japanese colonised the Korea Peninsula, Buddhists were allowed to build temples in the cities which was banned during the Lee Dynasty, and many Japanese Buddhist denominations did propagation work in colonised Korea.</p>
              <p>Christianity was sort of seen as the "liberator" from colonisation and in the years after WW2 and before the Korean War, to be Buddhist probably meant you were pro-japanese. This i think, led many decided to convert, especially in the South with the help American sponsored, fundamentalistic evangelical churches. That, and having 4/10 presidents staunch christians, "added fuel to the fire".</p>

              <p><br>Thats we "buddhist" need to educate more people to see what is the truth, non other than the context of the buddhist truth. A person without the compassion heart in this world, is only living in the world of delusion...he will only perceive that heaven is near, yet hell is just round the corner.</p>
              <p>----------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Confusicious, buddhism and taosim are very closely in certain expect in the philosophy teaching. To practise a religion, one should practise compassion and benevolence to all sentinent beings, that is the truth, if having to win over a person to commit in that religion and make harm to anyone...that is totally untrue and unvirture. All the religious SAGA has shown themselves to be compassion and benevolence, and they did sacrifices to mankind, that is their spirit which WE should learn, and not hovering against each other just to find this bare truth.</p>

              <p>Buddhism is also attempting to reform itself to the needs of modernity. Buddhism is very flexible in culture and adaptation, while the core teachings remains unchanged. It has been so since the start of Buddhism 2500 years back, evolving where it goes to. But more still needs to be done for now.</p>
              <p>If you look at Buddhism in Singapore recently, there has been some new developments.</p>
              <p>In any case, Buddhism really suits everyone no matter
              where they come from. It's just how the teachings are presented to
              people... it requires wisdom and expedient means to spread the dharma.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>p.s. if you look into the west, Buddhism is the one that is quickly gaining converts now... where many people find Buddhism suiting their needs, while Christianity is declining fast there. In the east, after the influx of westerners, Christianity is gaining converts as well. All part of 'globalisation'.</p>

Since the inauguration of President Lee, Buddhist groups have felt a sense of alienation because Lee appointed a number of Christians to posts in the Cabinet and at the presidential office of Cheong Wa Dae, or the Blue House. The decision came after the government excluded big temples from inclusion in “Algo Ga,” its new transportation information system.<br><br>The Buddhist groups plan to take an active role in Buddhist services set for July 4 in front of City Hall and Jogyesa, a move expected to have an influence on the candlelight demonstrations.<br><br><br>In a statement released the same day, the Buddhist groups said, “Government officials, who have to function as public servants, have carried out the activities of missionaries or forced people to believe in their religion by exploiting their official posts. These are unpatriotic acts that undermine national harmony, split public sentiment and trigger disputes among different religions. We will deal sternly with government officials who have been partial to a certain religion to keep the principle of separation of church and state, which is clarified by Constitutional Law Article No. 20.”<br><br>At the meeting, the Buddhist groups offered various cases that prove the government’s Christian bias. Immediately after President Lee’s inauguration, a worship service led by Pastor Kim Jin-hong was held at Cheong Wa Dae. Joo Dae-joon, the deputy chief of the presidential security division, publicly stated, “My dream is to bring evangelism to all government agencies.” Cheong Wa Dae “mistakenly forgot” to send a congratulatory message to the major Buddhist temples on Buddha’s Birthday. Choo Boo-gil, Cheong Wa Dae’s public relations and planning adviser described the candlelight protesters as Satanic.<br><br>In addition, the Buddhist groups plan to hang large banners, which highlight the government’s Christian bias, at each temple. At Buddhist services, they plan to publicize the issue and the importance of harmony among religions. They are also planing to place calls to Cheong Wa Dae, the Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs and other related government agencies to protest.<br><br>The 20 groups brought together by the Jogye Order will form a coalition with the Cheongtae Order, the Taego Order and other Buddhist Orders.<br><br>Please direct questions or comments to [englishhani@hani.co.kr]<br><em>(Taken from E-Sangha forum)</em></p></div>
