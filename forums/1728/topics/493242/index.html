              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Christian
              author and scholar Huston Smith lived many faiths in his spiritual journey.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              world’s most renowned scholar and sage on religions, Huston Smith, passed away
              at his home in Berkeley on Friday at the age of 97. Smith earned a reputation
              as being the one who truly understood eastern religions and helped the west
              better comprehend them. His demise was announced by his wife, Kendra Smith.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">What
              set Smith apart from other researchers is rather than simply studying a
              religion theoretically, he actually practiced whatever religions he was
              studying. As a result, when he studied the Zen philosophy, he was a Buddhist.
              When he studied Mexican Indian beliefs, he dropped peyote with their shamans.
              Naturally, the information he presented to the world was not a third-party
              interpretation by a western, Christian man, but a first-hand account of someone
              who had actually lived those faiths.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Born
              to Methodist missionaries, Dr. Smith had a desire to become a missionary
              himself. However, through the course of his research, he discovered every
              religion gave only one perspective to the divine. This is why he said when a
              person is rooted in only one tradition, it’s as though he’s only half alive
              spiritually. It’s when we approach spirituality by incorporating all ways of
              thought that we achieve our full potential. In fact, in the very opening of his
              famous book, The World’s Religions, he says: “The other half that beats with
              the pulse of all humanity has yet to be awakened."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Smith’s
              faith was tested as he sat by his daughter’s deathbed. His eldest daughter,
              Karen Smith, had a rare form of cancer and died not long after turning 50 years
              old. During this time, Smith consulted the religious knowledge he had studied
              throughout the years, such as chants of Buddhist monks: “I will lose my youth,
              my health, my loved ones, everything I hold dear and, finally, life itself by
              the very nature of being human.” At one point Smith said he “had trouble
              believing in what he had long written about: God’s ‘justice and perfection.’ ”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">He
              was still a Christian when he passed away. Regarding his Christian faith, he
              said “God is defined by Jesus but not confined to Jesus.” His research showed
              him his faith was not the ultimate truth, and spirituality takes on various
              forms.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">His
              book, originally titled The Religions of Man, published in 1958 has sold over
              two million copies. This work of his remains one of the world’s most sought
              after book on religious studies.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Strongly
              a Methodist, Dr. Smith’s favorite prayer was “Dear God, I’m doing the best I
              can.”</span></p>
