              <div class="entry" style="line-height: 1.4em;">
              <p>Well i have been keeping kmt for at lease 15 yrs……</p>
              <p>from i know nothing abt it, to i know alot , now i could even create 1………</p>
              <p>I used to detest pppl who said negative remarks on KMT…i will surely rebutt them..till they tiam tiam…</p>
              <p>I think i have total created abt 89 kmt who is aborted by their parents…</p>
              <p>and i hv let ppl chow kmt from me abt 300 over..</p>
              <p> i used to love them soo much, call them my son and tell them im their papa..</p>
              <p>kmt not only is my spiritual companion, they are also my 100% faithful hu fa…not only protecting me.. they also run “errands”  for me. … With them , i could also use them as a source of cosmic energy to see ppl past lives…n then advise them</p>
              <p>frankly speaking i really hv no resons not to love them…!</p>
              <p>However recently i deleted my hot kmt thread in my forum and start to b “anti” kmt…</p>
              <p>resons is i relize many ppl hv been misuse kmt….parent who aborted thier child out of no choice ,then keep them as kmt, this i understand, but for kids around 15 to 21 start carry kmt n use them to accumulate negative karma this is really  cant b forgiven…and also 10 out of 9 ppl who chow kmt, are not really into the true loving kindness..they merely wana used kmt as a money spinning machine or some when take them as toy/ pet ..this is a very very wrong trend..i promise myself from then own i will not creat kmt anymore or being pro kmt……….</p>
              <p>many do not understand with such kind of mentality, u not only create negative karma , u also cos the kmt to lengthen their rebirth Q…or sometime even not going to hv it…</p>
              <p>ppl jus refuse to see themselves…jus want short cut to archive their own well beings..</p>
              <p>Well i will like to wait n see hw long karma will catch up with them………………</p>
              <p>I hv come to apoint , i understand that..the so call kindness in creating kmt  from aborted spirits  is not a true kindness….the true kindness is to spread moral education to ppl n prevent them from aborting child………….</p>
              <p> well even i dun do..in the market they r still tons of ajhans who becos of money will b more than willing to do…</p>
              <p>sometimes i really feel ashame of them….wouldnt they worry abt the “future ” of the kmt? and also their own karma?</p>
              <p>i know im jus a small fry…i cant convince the loads of greedy ppl around…to stop keeping kmt..as noo demand no supply….</p>
              <p> u can alot of layman..look at kmt bucha n start with silly comments say they hw cute hw cute….but if they hv third eye they will see hw horrible is actually the kmt look…</p>
              <p> im not asking ppl to dispise kmt or even their look…</p>
              <p>but please stop it….stop misuse kmt…help urself n at the same time spare a tot for the poor cosmic beings.. </p>

              <p>For a number of reasons as well, one should avoid making contacts with the dead... especially these kind of relationships with the lower realms and karmic affinity.</p>
              <p>What happens when you die and these beings appear to you? Your chances of falling into the spirit realm is very high.</p>

              <p>The problems of ku man thong is severe .Many people abuse the spirit to get great wealth .This is quite a severe issue</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway recently i realised the little statue in my house among the Buddha Altar is a kumantong .</p>
              <p>But i never offer it .I just let it stand comfortably to listen to Guru Rinpoche chanting and several mantra hoping it will have better rebirth.Its just a weird encounter my father was given this by someone .Let the unfortunateness of such spirit turn into a good one when it hears my chanting everyday :)</p>

              <p>I wish to stressed i never let it feed blood or any kind .It must be kinda of boring at my altar .But anyway ,its to help him find a better rebirth .Who knows if He is already in Western Paradise with so many nice chanting heard ??</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if u go sgclub.com there is a forum on ku man thong .the statue is small and a standing figure with his head like a thai baby with tie -up .His two hand holding both side of his waist like a boy throwing tantrum .not advisable to post it here .bcos i never believe in rearing it at all.</p>
              <p>If i throw it into the rubbish bin ,it will do him harm and he will be harmed by the ghoulish who lived in the rubbish dump..</p>

              <p>Maintaining "conditional contracts" with such spiritual entities, including Nature spirits is seriously not advisable. "Conditional contracts" with entities <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> </strong>from the Light have a price that need to be paid eventually. The price could be much more painful than expected. Greed and Fear are often the lessons to be learnt from entering such contracts.</p>
              <p>Spiritual entities of the Light from the higher realms will give <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">unconditional</span></strong> help, if there is a real need to. Selfish desires do not fall under the category of "real need". To ask for help to correct a mistake of one's own doing seldom gets answered, though guidance may be given. People are expected to learn from their own mistakes. :)</p>

              <p>Spirit possession is much more common than what people are aware of. It's not like in the movies where the spirit takes total control of the person's body.</p>
              <p>In reality, the mildest effects of spirit possession (or negative energy attachments) can cause the person to be extra negative, eg. extremely irritated very often, gets angry easily, etc. Depending on the person's mental (and spiritual) strength, stronger effects of the possession/attachment could cause the person to start losing memory, fall (very) sick due to the negative energy in the body, change behaviour and personality, etc. </p>

              <p>My personal view (sorry, I've to be blunt here, to highlight the consequences):</p>
              <p>The only compassionate way to help these lost/wandering spirits is to guide them back to the Light (spiritual realm), where they will feel peace again, not keep them in our realm, like pets. Life is not like a computer game, where we can keep elementals and spirits to boost our own "magical powers". While there are no consequences in a game, there can be very serious negative consequences in real life.</p>
              <p>In your original posting, you asked the following question: <em>"Anyone have idea how to boost the power to greater height.". </em>It would be wise for yourself to know what are your true intentions.</p>
              <p>It's your own freewill to choose your own life options. The rest of us can only offer our sincere advice. Just be aware that we have to be prepared to reap what we sow. Many people are constantly making life choices which they will end up regretting later in this lifetime, or even many lifetimes in future. I've had to help people who had made very serious vows in a previous life long ago, and are still suffering from the consequences in this current lifetime. Greed brings grief eventually.</p>
