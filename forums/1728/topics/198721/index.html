Do not kill<br>2. Do not steal<br>3. Do not indulge in sexual misconduct<br>4. Do not make false speech<br>5. Do not take intoxicants</strong><br><br>10 Virtuous Deeds:<br><br><strong>1. Do not kill<br>2. Do not steal<br>3. Do not indulge in sexual misconduct<br>4. No lying<br>5. No double-tongued speech<br>6. No abusive speech<br>7. No irresponsible speech<br>8. No greed<br>9. No hatred<br>10. No delusion</strong><br><br>-------<br>The Six Realms (which consists of 31 Planes of Existences):<br><br><strong>3 higher realms</strong><br><br>Heaven<br>Humans<br>Asura<br><br><strong>3 lower realms</strong><br><br>Animals<br>Spirits<br>Hell<br><br>-------<br><br>But, not only must we perform all that is virtuous, and avoid all that is evil, very importantly we have to develope Samadhi and Wisdom, and to Purify one's mind. This is what sets Buddhism different from many other religions which only emphasizes on 'doing good, avoiding evil' but not so much on 'purifying one's mind'.<br><br>Basically there are 4 stages on the path to Arhantship, and 10 stages on the Bodhisattva path to Buddhahood. To even enter the first stage of each path, one has to attain an insight into the nature of reality - the nature of emptiness. There are many different ways to lead one to realise this truth, many different dharma doors of different sects.. there are the zen sect, tibetan sects, vipasanna meditation, and so on. 84000 Dharma doors, and you have to choose one and then keep on practising it.<br><br>Lastly, the wisdom and merits you cultivated in this lifetime will not be lost in your next lifetime. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>There are only four things we can bring to our next life.<br><br>1) Wisdom (Zhi Hui)<br>2) Blessings (Fu Bao)<br>3) Cause and Conditions (Yin Yuan)<br>4) Karmic force (Ye Li)<br><br>And yes, there is a higher chance for us to attain enlightenment in the human form, so we must appreciate this human form and cultivate.<br><br>The cycles of rebirth is neverending, what you achieve in this lifetime, you cannot bring to the next, and everything will start again anew. You do not recognise your old parents, your old friends, your old spouse. In that new lifetime, they will just look like passerbys and you do not recognise them at all. If one can remember our past lives, one will find it quite meaningless because it is always "me" that is acting out a story, again and again, never stopping. Through practise we can free ourselves from the cycle reincarnation, although the Bodhisattva does not stop here and continues to save sentient beings in Samsara out of compassion.<br><br>That is why it is very important to cultivate wisdom and blessings, these should be the higher purpose of our life, and furthermore these are more precious because these can be brought to the next lifetime, you cant bring money, material possessions, your children, your wife/husband, etc, along.</div>

It all depends on self cultivational experience.   My understanding is that there's no specific description of these stages, it's like once you are there, either you know it or you don't.  If in doubt, can approach someone whom you know have that knowledge/wisdom, so that you know you are still on the correct path.  Books provides a guideline, and examples, and will help if you can grasp the idea behind it.<br><br>Of course, I could be wrong here.

It's ok if there are certain things you do not understand, I myself do not understand many things, but when we "attain" enlightenment, the entire Tripitaka will be understood by us. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>The practise of mindfulness will eventually lead us to realising the truths ourselves, for that to happen, the practitioner's mind must tremendously attentive, vivid, sharp, alive and clear can he then be ready.</div>

Both Mahayana and Theravada uses the Tripitaka (3 baskets), the major difference being that Mahayana has some additional Mahayana sutras, for example, Heart Sutra, Diamond Sutra, Lankavatara Sutra, Lotus Sutra, Shurangama Sutra, etc etc.<br><br>Btw I recall you were still searching for a sangha the last time you posted... so which Sangha have you joined? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
