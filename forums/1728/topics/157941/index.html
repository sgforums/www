It is particularly the Abhidhamma which rejects Antarabhava, however, it should be noted that the Abhidhamma is a latter commentary and not a discourse given by Buddha himself.<br><br>Apart from many other fundamentalist Theravadins who accept the Anatarabhava, the famous Theravada Venerable Ajahn Brahmavamso, the Australian monk who just came to Singapore to give a discourse, himself accepts the existence of the Anatarabhava due to his own experience dealing with the dead.</div>

Hoping he<br>has written on this and will be published.</span><br><br>From <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Pali/message/7751?viscount=100" rel="nofollow">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Pali/message/7751?viscount=100</a>,<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">&gt; &gt;*Intermediate State between Existences*<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;In contrast to the orthodox stand, there is significant Pali canonical<br>evidence strongly suggestive of an intermediate state between one existence and<br>another, a view supported by Theravada fundamentalists. Various suttas from the<br>Nikayas clearly talk about a state of existence before actual rebirth as a<br>another sentient being. Let me quote some examples from them.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;In Mahatanhasankhaya Sutta (MN 3<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> the Buddha states that for conception to<br>occur, one of the conditions is that the being to be reborn (gandhabba) has to<br>be present at the moment of union between the father and mother. Here, it is<br>implicitly stated that there is an intermediate state of existence between death<br>in the previous existence and rebirth in the next.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;There are various references to the rebirths of bodhisattas as well as other<br>beings, which also imply as much. According to Sampasadaniya Sutta (DN 2<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> and<br>Sangiti Sutta (DN 33), some beings "enter the mother's womb unknowing, stay<br>there unknowing and leave it unknowing", while others "enter the mother's womb<br>knowing, stay there knowing, and leave it unknowing". One who "enters the<br>mother's womb knowing, stays there knowing and leaves it knowingï¿½ is, according<br>to the commentary, a bodhisatta in its last rebirth. This is confirmed by<br>several suttas that describe the bodhisatta's moment of entry into the mother's<br>womb as "being mindful and fully awareï¿½. [Mahapadana Sutta (DN 14);<br>Acchariya-abbhuta Sutta (MN 123); Pathama-tathagata-acchariya Sutta (AN 4: 27);<br>Bhumicala Sutta (AN 8:70)].<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;There are references to a fivefold typology of non-returners, one of which is<br>called antaraparinibbayi (ï¿½attainer of Nibbana in the intervalï¿½<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">, in the<br>Samyutta Nikaya (SN 48:15, 24, 66, 51:26, 54:5, 55:25); Purisagati Sutta (AN<br>7:55) and Samyojana Sutta (AN 4:131). Ven Bhikkhu Bodhi, in his "The Connected<br>Discourses of the Buddha: a new translation of the Samyutta Nikaya", Volume II<br>(Note 65, Pp 1902-1903), argues (with support from Samyojana Sutta) that the<br>antaraparinibbayi is "ï¿½one who has abandoned the fetter of rebirth<br>(upapattisamyojana) without yet having abandoned the fetter of existence<br>(bhavasamyojana)."<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;Orthodox Theravadins argue against this interpretation of the<br>antaraparinibbayi because in the Kathavatthu (e.g. Kv 366), an Abhidhamma text<br>regarded by them as canonical, the idea of antarabhava (intermediate life) was<br>strongly refuted.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;However, there is further evidence to consider. In Metta Sutta (Khp 9, Sn<br>1:<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> there is reference to bhuta (those who have been born) and sambhavesi<br>(those seeking birth). Several suttas [Channovada Sutta (MN 144); Channa Sutta<br>(SN 4:35:87); Catuttha-nibbana-patisamyutta Sutta (Ud 74)] mention the states of<br>"here or beyond or between the two". Kutuhala Sutta (SN 4:44:9) also tells of "a<br>being [that] has laid down his body but has not yet been reborn in another<br>body".<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;All the above references from the suttas implying an intermediate state of<br>existence should provide sufficient food for thought by Theravadins and ample<br>reason to keep an open mind regarding the mystery of dying and rebirth.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;Although fundamentalist Theravadins may subscribe to a belief of an<br>intermediate afterlife, it does not necessarily mean that they accept all of the<br>bardo (ï¿½gap in betweenï¿½ or intermediate state) teachings postulated by the<br>Vajrayana tradition.</span><br><br>btw, i was told by someone who visited Ajahn Brahm yesterday (he came Singapore for a talk), that Ajahn Brahm cld read his mind  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To those scepticists who think that Consciousness does not survive death, I can tell you that there are uncountable cases of NDE experiences. These experiences only occur when a person is DEAD, and such people often report floating up the body - and WITNESSING THE MEDICAL PROCEDURES. This is absolute proof that consciousness does indeed survive after death. Only the due to the dogmas of certain people cld not accept this.<br><br>For me, I have one such "dead" experience during sleep even though I have not been dead. I believe many of you have experience being unable to move at all in sleep, yet feeling 'awake' and conscious. For once, I have floated up my body, I was unable to control my body. I was aware of the surroundings of that room, and unable to get back to my body. I chanted buddha name and someone came into the room and woke me up. There are alot of such out of body experiences, sometimes in meditation (this is a side effect, not everyone experiences this, and also does not necessarily reflect a person's meditation achievements)</div>
