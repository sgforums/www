All don't matter, why do one seek for answers? Maybe they are lost. Each person thinks by himself and whether he puts his thoughts to action or not, he is bound to leave traces in his mind be it more or less. His speech and action will also leave imprints in other people's minds depending on how they take to them, how receptive they are. These impressions, whether they be good or bad will accumulate to be a force which will trigger future action. The work &amp; law of cause &amp; effect known as "Karma"? Life and death are also governed by the law of cause and effect. All sentient beings do not live just one life but continues on like running water in a stream, in endless time, with an endless past and an endless future.The law of cause &amp; effect is not restricted to just extension of Time but transcend all Realms of Existence. Emancipation of one's own mind from attachment isn't that what everyone here should try to achieve rather than seeking answer that is obviously nothing that ever-exist, Delusion aplenty in this realm of existence. Don't you think so?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos </span></strong></div>

Heavenly bliss or Nirvanic bliss can also be experienced within this very life time. You donÂ’t have to wait until you die.<br><br>This is why the Buddha always welcomed people to come and observe His way of teaching; not to come and believe it all at once. He actually advised people on how to choose a proper religion, by considering, analysing and investigating it in various ways without accepting anything through emotion or blind faith. Of course all religions promote faith.<br><br>But faith in Buddhism is not a surrender to the unknown; it is not submission to fear and punishment. Buddhist faith is the courageous acceptance of what one has found out through careful observation and analytical investigation. This is why Buddhism is called a doctrine of analysis. This religion contains a profoundly scientific and psychological analysis of mind and matter which many great modern thinkers have admired.<br>Universal Laws<br><br><strong>To those who talked about the first cause of this world, the Buddha responded by saying that it is impossible to find a first cause since everything is changing, interdependent and conditioned by other things. Something that acts as the cause in the present may become the effect in the future. Later that same effect may again become the cause. Such phenomenon continues ad infinitum. It is called the universal law of Anicca or impermanency.<br><br>With regard to the origin of the world itself, the Buddha did not claim it was the property of Buddhism or that existing world systems and living things were controlled according to the Buddhist Order, but by universal law or natural phenomenon. Man was simply to accept his position in the world and regard himself and all things, animate and inanimate, as a compound.<br><br>According to the scholar Dr. Rhys Davids, Â“in each individual, without any exception, the relation  of its component  parts  to  one  another  is  ever changing, so that it is never the same for two consecutive moments. It follows that no sooner has separateness begun than dissolution, disintegration, also begins; there can be no individuality without a putting together; there can be no putting together without a becoming; there can be no becoming without a becoming different; and there can be no becoming different without dissolution, a passing away which sooner or later will become inevitably complete".<br><br>The Buddha was the teacher who discovered the real nature of the universal cosmic law and who advised people to live in accordance with this law, such as going against nature, and leading an immoral life, must be ready to face the consequences. It is possible to escape from the reactions of such cosmic laws simply by praying to god, because this universal law is unbiased. Yet the Buddha taught us how to stop the reactions of certain bad practices by doing more and more good deeds, by training the mind and eradicating evils thoughts from the mind. After violation the cosmic order of the universal law there is no other method to get rid of the reaction except by co-operating and conforming with the same cosmic law.</strong></div>
