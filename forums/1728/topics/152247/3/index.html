As I have mentioned before, I have brought someone (who have some psychic powers) to my dharma teacher before... who wishes to "burn away his karma" and even wishes to be completely freed from all karma by this life. My dharma teacher reminded him that it is impossible to do so - and pointed out that even Buddha had to suffer many karmic consequeunces over his 500 lives as a Bodhisattva in the Jataka Tales, and even as Buddha himself. The Buddhist way is by honest practise, purification of the mind etc.<br><br>On the other hand however it is also not to be mistaken that there is no ways to purify past karmas. One of the purification practise that my Master Shen Kai, and also your Master Chin Kung advocated is Repentance. In fact Repentance is advocated in all traditions in Buddhism. For my dharma teacher, apart from daily sitting meditation routine, she spends 45 minutes in doing 108 repentance (verse and bowing).<br><br><a href="http://buddhism.kalachakranet.org/karma.html#8" rel="nofollow">http://buddhism.kalachakranet.org/karma.html#8</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">THE FOUR POWERS OF PURIFICATION<br><br>The purification practices found within Buddhism are not unlike the practices applied in many other religions. The most essential mental factor that one requires is sincerity or honesty with oneself. When one wants to purify past negative karma, one has to do some action with the correct motivation.<br>This is summarised in the following Four Powers of Purification:<br>1. Power of the Object: One should practice thinking of all sentient beings one may have hurt. Traditionally, one remembers all sentient beings and the Three Jewels of Refuge (Buddha, Dharma and Sangha), by generating compassion for all sentient beings and taking refuge.<br>2. Power of Regret: This should not be senseless guilt or self-recrimination, which are said to be useless emotional torture. What is intended here is to examine oneself and one's actions and to recognise that negative actions done in the past were very unwise.<br>3. Power of Promise: As a logical consequence of the above, one should promise not to repeat these negative actions. It is good if one can promise to avoid a negative behaviour for a specific time, or at least promise that one will put effort in avoiding repetition. Not being honest at this stage makes the practice useless or even harmful to oneself.<br>4. Power of Practice: Basically any positive action with a good motivation can be used as practice. Traditionally in Buddhism, one can practice e.g. making prostrations (throwing oneself to the floor - as a means to destroy pride), making offerings (to counteract greed), reading Buddhist texts (to counteract ignorance and negative thoughts), reciting mantras etc.<br><br>It is often explained that one needs to clear a field by purifying it from rocks and weeds, then planting seeds by study and meditation, giving water and fertiliser by doing positive actions, and automatically new harvest will grow.</span></div>

All don't matter, why do one seek for answers? Maybe they are lost. Each person thinks by himself and whether he puts his thoughts to action or not, he is bound to leave traces in his mind be it more or less. His speech and action will also leave imprints in other people's minds depending on how they take to them, how receptive they are. These impressions, whether they be good or bad will accumulate to be a force which will trigger future action. The work &amp; law of cause &amp; effect known as "Karma"? Life and death are also governed by the law of cause and effect. All sentient beings do not live just one life but continues on like running water in a stream, in endless time, with an endless past and an endless future.The law of cause &amp; effect is not restricted to just extension of Time but transcend all Realms of Existence. Emancipation of one's own mind from attachment isn't that what everyone here should try to achieve rather than seeking answer that is obviously nothing that ever-exist, Delusion aplenty in this realm of existence.

Something good can be a start to something bad... and likewise, something bad can be a start to something good. These are dualities and cannot exist without each other.. but a Buddhist also eventually trascends this duality.<br><br><a href="http://www.bpf.org/tsangha/loy-goodevil.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bpf.org/tsangha/loy-goodevil.html</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">There are different ways to understand that emptying, but as a Zen Buddhist I am reminded of the 13th century Japanese Zen master Dogen, who wrote something that resonates in much the same way: ﾒTo study Buddhism is to study yourself; to study yourself is to forget yourself; to forget yourself is to be awakened and realize your intimacy with all things.ﾓ The fruit of the Buddhist path, the end of a life organized around fear, is to lose and empty yourself by forgetting yourself, which is also to find your true self: not an alienated self threatened by the world and trying to secure itself in defense against those anxieties, but a nondual self that knows itself to be an expression or a manifestation of the world.</span><br><br>This is not reachable by ordinary intelligence by through wisdom. Which is why, apart from doing good/avoiding evil, Buddhism, unlike other religions, stresses on the part of the purification of the mind.<br><br>p.s in non-dualism there is unconditional love <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
