              358<br> <br> <br> THE THIRTEEN GOLDEN DHARMA OF THE SAKYA<br> The Thirteen Golden Dharma is a group of very 
              treasured Teachings
                                      of the Sakya whose preciousness could only be 
              expressed in Gold to
                                      the Teacher.This teaching was so well guarded 
              since the time of
                                      Sachen Kunga Nyingpo, that it was only given and
               taught within the
                                      boundary of the Sakya Monasteries for many 
              centuries.<br> <br> The Thirteen Golden Dharma consists of a total 
              of sixteen
                                      empowerments of which only 13 are given at one 
              time. Owing to its
                                      wide variety of deities of empowerment, it 
              encompasses a full range
                                      of activities necessary for the practices to 
              attain full
                                      enlightenment. These activities include (a) the 
              ability to achieve
                                      full enlightenment quickly through the 3 red 
              deities of Marmo Kusum
                                      blessing empowerments, (b) the ability to 
              acquire power and
                                      domination through the 3 wrathful great red 
              Marpo Kusum deities, ©
                                      acquiring special power and wealth through the 
              three small red
                                      ones, (Marchung Kusum) and Red Jambala, (d) 
              various practices to
                                      overcome illnesses and naga diseases through 
              Garuda and Singhanada
                                      Jehnang, (e) Physical and mental well beings 
              through Black
                                      Manjushri and Singhamukha and (f) increasing 
              one’s lifespan through
                                      the practice of long life deities like the 9 
              deities Amitayu and
                                      Amaravajradevi.<br> <br> This is an excellent grouping of specific and 
              supporting practices
                                      that are required for the practitioner to 
              traverse the path to full
                                      Enlightenment. In the past, many great Indian 
              and Tibetan
                                      practitioners relied on the practices of the 
              deities of the
                                      Thirteen Golden Dharma to overcome spiritual and
               natural obstacles
                                      encountered in the Path. All the Sakya sub-sects
               have their special
                                      deities in the Golden Dharma but they all have 
              in common in the
                                      practice of the specific Red female deity, 
              Vajrayogini.<br> <br> Her Eminence Jetsun Kusho will be giving the 
              standard Thirteen
                                      Golden Dharma Empowerments. In order for all 
              newcomers to qualify,
                                      she will first give the 2-day Wang Chen of the 
              Cause Hevajra before
                                      giving empowerments of the 13 Golden Dharma. 
              Most of the deities of
                                      the Golden Dharma belong to the higher class of 
              Tantra and as such
                                      need the Annutarayoga Tantra Wang Chen first 
              before proceeding to
                                      Jehnang or Chin lab of individual 
              deity.Therefore please take note
                                      to register yourself for the 2 day Cause Hevajra
               empowerment if you
                                      have not taken any Annuttrayoga Tantra Wang Chen
               before.<br> Let us look forward for the coming teaching of 
              the Thirteen Golden
                                      Dharma by Her Eminence Jetsun Kusho in 
              mid-December which will be

                                      Teachings and empowerments from many great 
              Masters. Being the elder
                                      sister of His Holiness The Sakya Trizin, she 
              also received much of
                                      her training alongside her brother. She received
               Teachings and
                                      empowerments from great Teachers like Dampa 
              Rinpoche Zhenphen
                                      Nyingpo, Jamyang Khyentze Chokyi Lodro, Khangsar
               Shabdrung
                                      Rinpoche, and Ngawang Lodro Tenzin Nyingpo.<br> <br> She first meditated at the age of six on 
              Manjhusri, ordained as a
                                      nun at eight, completed her first retreat on 
              Vajrapani at ten and
                                      received her first Lam Dre teaching at 17 with 
              His Holiness, and
                                      then undergone retreats on Hevajra and other 
              deities. By the time
                                      she was eighteen, she was able to give the first
               Lam Dre Teaching
                                      to an audience of monks from Kham for three 
              months.<br> <br> <br> She had to leave Tibet with His Holiness in 1959
               at the age of 21,
                                      and stayed in India till 1971 when she emigrated
               to Canada. During
                                      this time, Her Eminence had disrobed and married
               Sey Kusho, the
                                      younger brother of Luding Khenchen Rinpoche. In 
              Canada, Her
                                      Eminence had to divide her time to take care of 
              the family, work
                                      and meditational practices for many years until 
              she retired from
                                      her job when her children had grown up. His 
              Holiness had requested
                                      Her Eminence to give Dharma teachings on several
               occasions in the
                                      past; and with her retirement, she is able to 
              travel to many Sakya
                                      Centres around the world like our centre, giving
               valuable Teachings
                                      and Dharma advices.<br> <br> Her Eminence has vast experience as a long time 
              lay practitioners
                                      steeled in discipline and patience. Being 
              brought up and trained in
                                      the traditional Tibetan way in the Khon Family, 
              Her Eminence give
                                      strict and genuine Teachings of the Buddha 
              Dharma, specifically the
                                      Sakya. Possessing such qualities as a Teacher, 
              Her Eminence is well
                                      respected by all Her disciples and is an 
              inspiration for all lay
                                      practitioners who need to incorporate their 
              practice into their
                                      daily lifestyle. Her Eminence is the few female 
              Teachers of Tibetan
                                      Buddhism who has the authority and 
              qualifications to transmit the
                                      Sakya teachings. We all look forward to receive 
              Her Eminence’s

              <h1>Tara Retreat From Afar December 14, 2009 to March 10, 2010</h1>
              <p>Dear Friends,<br> <br> The residents of Sravasti Abbey will soon begin 
              their annual
                                      retreat—this year on the Tara practice with 
              meditations on the
                                      Gradual Path to Enlightenment. While some of you
               will join us at
                                      the Abbey for this, others are not able to 
              attend in person.<br> <br> We would like to offer you the opportunity to do
               the Retreat from
                                      Afar and make a connection with the retreat by 
              participating along
                                      with us.<br> <br> By doing a daily practice during the same dates 
              as the retreat, you
                                      will develop your Dharma practice while feeling 
              the support of the
                                      Abbey residents who are doing the same. You will
               also give your
                                      support to those of us doing the retreat at the 
              Abbey, encouraging
                                      our practice.<br> <br> The Abbey has offered the Retreat from Afar in 
              previous years, and
                                      people have loved doing it. They maintained a 
              regular daily
                                      practice, deepened their understanding of the 
              Dharma, and gained
                                      many insights into their lives. Last year, 
              around 120 people joined
                                      the Retreat from Afar. We enjoyed seeing their 
              photos each time we
                                      entered the meditation hall to do sessions.<br> <br> This year there is a three-month retreat, 
              December 14, 2009 to
                                      March 10, 2010. To participate you commit to at 
              least one session
                                      of the Tara practice with 108 recitations (or 
              more) of the mantra
                                      every day. This would probably be a session of 
              about 30 minutes. An
                                      additional 10 minutes of Lamrim meditation would
               be very
                                      beneficial.<br> <br> Tara represents the enlightened activity of all 
              the Buddhas and is
                                      especially efficacious for eliminating obstacles
               and bringing
                                      success. Doing the Tara practice is an excellent
               way to develop
                                      compassion and forgiveness towards yourself and 
              others.<br> <br> The practice also helps us to purify a great 
              amount of destructive
                                      karmic seeds on our mind stream and to create a 
              huge amount of
                                      merit which enriches our mind and is the cause 
              of happiness. By
                                      contemplating the empty yet dependent arising 
              nature of the Tara,
                                      your wisdom understanding the complementary 
              quality of dependent
                                      arising and emptiness will increase.<br> <br> <br> If you would like to participate in the Retreat 
              from Afar, please

                                      obstacles-material,<br> emotional and spiritual. It continually

                                      one's<br> body, mind and spirit, as well as healing 
              others. Relying on

              practice, it is
                                      rightly<br> famed for its ability to transform the mind and

              Flagstaff), take the
                                      Cordes Junction exit and drive west on Highway 
              69 toward Prescott.
                                      You will pass through Prescott Valley and then, 
              on the outskirts of
                                      Prescott, stay in the far right lane and take 
              the turnoff (to the
                                      right or north) to Highway 89 to Chino 
              Valley.Drive north on
                                      Highway 89 about 15 miles to Chino Valley, and 
              stay in the
                                      right-hand lane. Continue on Highway 89 through 
              the stop light by a
                                      large Safeway store. Watch for the Stockman's 
              Bank on your right,
                                      then a small blue triangular “County Road 70” 
              sign , then a green
                                      “Perkinsville Road” sign — turn right (east) 
              onto Perkinsville
                                      Road.<br> <br> Drive east on Perkinsville Road for 9.5 miles — 
              the road is paved
                                      for about the first 3 miles, and then turns to a
               gravel road. Drive
                                      carefully and slowly (do not exceed the speed 
              limit, as town police
                                      regularly patrol this road), watching for 
              free-roaming cattle and
                                      antelope. At about 9.25 miles you will see a 
              farm house with a
                                      windmill on your right. Keep driving about 
              another quarter mile on
                                      Perkinsville Road, and you will see our gate on 
              your right. Our
                                      gate is green metal and has a white sign saying 
              "Garchen Buddhist
                                      Institute.” The sign on the gate is hard to read
               at night, but it
                                      has a reflective-tape border that glows bright 
              blue at night,
                                      making it easy to locate after sundown. Turn 
              right into our unpaved
                                      driveway and follow it about 1/2 mile to the 
              visitors’ parking lot.
                                      You will pass a house on your left before going 
              up the hill to the
                                      parking lot. From the parking lot walk up the 
              path to the temple
                                      and office. For handicapped access or 
              deliveries, drive through the
                                      parking lot and take the first right, which 
              leads to handicapped
                                      parking, the temple, stupa, office, and dining 
              room/kitchen.<br> <br> &lt;!-- m --&gt;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.garchen.net/images/map-interstate.gif"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://www.garchen.net/images/map-interstate.gif</span></span></a>&lt;!--

              <p>The 12th Nubpa Tulku Konchok Tenzin Rinpoche 
              was recognized
                                      while still in his mother's womb by the 34th 
              Drikung Throne Holder,
                                      His Holiness Shewe Lodro (1874-1945). Rinpoche 
              was enthroned when
                                      he was only five years old and started formal 
              studies at the age of
                                      six. He learned Tibetan scripture and ritual 
              practices from Pasang
                                      until the age of 14. At 15, he joined the 
              Sun-ray Garden Institute
                                      (Nyichang Shedra, located near Drikung Thil 
              Monastery) for higher
                                      Buddhist philosophical and Tantric studies.</p>
              <p>Nubpa Rinpoche has received all of the 
              Drikung Protector
                                      initiations and transmissions from H.E. Lho 
              Drongtul Rinpoche. He
                                      has received all of the Fifty Collections of 
              Initiation, the
                                      Treasure of Kagyu Instructions, the Treasure 
              Discoverer Yangzab
                                      teaching (by Gyalwang Rinchen Phuntsok), and the
               Yamantaka from
                                      Regent H.E. Tritsab Rinpoche, as well as the 
              Nyingma Collection of
                                      Initiations from the previous H.E. Nyizong Tripa
               Rinpoche.</p>
              <p>By 1959, Rinpoche had mastered the Chinese 
              language. By 1966,
                                      due to the political changes in Tibet , he had 
              learned the ways of
                                      the farmer. Returning to Lhasa in 1974, he found
               work as a stone
                                      mason, but in 1979, Rinpoche resumed his 
              academic career as the
                                      editor of the magazine, the "Tibetan Buddhist 
              Association". In
                                      1989, under the arrangement of the 10th Pachen 
              Lama, Rinpoche
                                      joined the Peking Buddhist College of Higher 
              Studies and there
                                      received his academic degree.</p>
              <p>Rinpoche always says that his time spent 
              learning about Buddhist
                                      teachings was very precious, as were the oral 
              transmissions he
                                      received from Pachung Vajradhara, Khenchen 
              Jigmey Phuntsok, and
                                      Gyendun Gyatso, among others.</p>
              <p>In 1992, he arrived in India to serve His 
              Holiness Drikung
                                      Kyabgon Trinle Lhundrup, his root Guru, who was 
              then working to
                                      preserve the Drikung Lineage. While there, 
              Rinpoche became the
                                      supervisor for the re-publications of the 24th 
              Drikung Throne
                                      Holder's, His Holiness Kunkhen Ringzen Chödrak's
               (1595 to 1659),
                                      fifteen volume compendium of transcribed oral 
              instructions from the
                                      Tibetan Buddhist tradition [Kabum]. Rinpoche has
               received many
                                      authentic teachings and oral transmissions from 
              those living and
                                      parinirvana masters.</p>
              <p>Since that time, Rinpoche has conducted 
              retreats whenever
                                      possible in Labchi, the holiest place of Yogi 
              Jetsun Milarepa.
                                      These retreats involve an arduous, week-long 
              journey by foot.
                                      Rinpoche made one extended retreat for more than
               three years and
                                      has since made four additional journeys 
              there.Today, due to
                                      Rinpoche's altruistic mind of enlightenment, 
              over thirty
                                      practitioners have gathered on "conduct" 
              retreats under his
                                      guidance in that holy place. As a result of his 
              loving kindness and
                                      compassion, there are plans to build a monastery
               in Kathmandu ,
                                      Nepal for the sake of all Dharma practitioners.</p>

              <p>Information about the Retreat Practices<br> This retreat was designed by Ven. Khenchen 
              Thrangu Rinpoche for
                                      the<br> Shambhala Buddhist community in 1989. Because he
               understood that
                                      the<br> view of the Vidyadhara, Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche
               was to create
                                      an<br> enlightened society, Thrangu Rinpoche wanted 
              this retreat to
                                      be<br> divided into segments that would allow 
              practitioners to
                                      maintain<br> relationships with family and their career.</p>
              <p>In 2004, with the blessing of the Sakyong and
               Thrangu Rinpoche,
                                      the<br> decision was made to open up the retreat modules
               so that
                                      practitioners<br> who were unable to attend the entire retreat 
              could do one or
                                      more<br> sections of it. This has proven to be a great 
              success as people in
                                      our<br> community discover the hidden treasure of Sopa 
              Choling.</p>
              <p>1. Mahamudra retreat: The first three months 
              of this retreat
                                      are<br> dedicated to guru yoga sadhanas of Gampopa, 
              Milarepa and Marpa
                                      (which<br> require abishekas). These are followed by three 
              months of silent
                                      group<br> retreat in which we practice mahamudra 
              investigations, using the
                                      text<br> by the 9 th Karmapa, Pointing Out the 
              Dharmakaya, and a commentary
                                      by<br> Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche. This retreat is a 
              rare and
                                      powerful<br> opportunity to discover and practice vipashyana 
              mahamudra.</p>
              <p>2. Konchok Chidu retreat: Konchok Chidu, 
              meaning “Embodiment of
                                      the<br> Three Jewels”, is a sadhana of Guru Rinpoche, 
              with a commentary
                                      by<br> Jamgon Kontrol Lodro Thaye. It includes an 
              outer, inner, secret
                                      and<br> long-life practice as well as an amending fire 
              offering and
                                      feast<br> practice. His Holiness Dingo Khyentse Rinpoche 
              bestowed this
                                      abisheka<br> for our community in 1987.</p>
              <p>3. Inner Vajrayogini retreat: This retreat is
               an excellent
                                      bridge<br> between Vajrayogini practice and the Six 
              Dharmas. It uses the
                                      same<br> sadhana text as in our previous practice, but 
              the commentary we
                                      follow<br> is by Pawo Tsug-lak Trengwa, which offers a 
              series of five
                                      recitations<br> that progressively train in chandali and 
              mahamudra. It
                                      includes<br> drupchen and fire offering practices.</p>
              <p>4. Chakrasamvara retreat: The sadhana text 
              used in this practice
                                      is<br> the same as the one used by other practitioners 
              in our sangha, but
                                      the<br> visualizations are different. We follow a 
              commentary written by
                                      Karma<br> Chagme, a ten chapter practice manual for the 
              outer, inner, secret
                                      and<br> very secret practice, which includes a drupchen 
              and fire
                                      offering.<br> Many people who completed the Chakrasamvara 
              practice before
                                      coming<br> into this retreat found this new commentary 
              extremely beneficial.
                                      The<br> retreat is also open to those who have received 
              the abisheka but
                                      have<br> not done the practice.</p>
              <p>5. Six Dharmas of Naropa retreat: The six 
              dharmas are the
                                      practices of<br> chandali, illusory form, dream, luminosity, 
              bardo and powa.
                                      Together<br> they represent the completion stage of
                                      Vajrayogini-Chakrasamvara<br> practice and are methods for transforming all 
              states of mind into
                                      the<br> wisdom of mahamudra. At Sopa Choling we have an 
              ideal facility
                                      for<br> these practices, with guided instructions for 
              group and
                                      individual<br> training. In particular each retreat has 
              included older
                                      practitioners,<br> many in their sixties, who have found this 
              retreat most workable
                                      and<br> beneficial.</p>
              <p>6. Jinasagara retreat:</p>
              <p>Jinasagara (Tib: Gyalwa Gyatso), red 
              Avaloketishvara with
                                      consort, is<br> a very important yidam practice in the Kagyu 
              lineage, and
                                      like<br> Guyasamaja, it is of the father lineage—an 
              emphasis on the upaya
                                      of<br> compassion, completely transforming aggression.</p>
              <p>The lineage comes from Rechungpa who received
               it from two
                                      sources.<br> First he was asked by Marpa to go to India and 
              receive these
                                      teachings<br> on the nine dharmas of the formless dakinis from
               Tiphupa.</p>
              <p>Padmasambhava also gave instructions on 
              Jinasagara to King
                                      Trisong<br> Detsen and Yeshe Tsopgyal. They were concealed 
              as a terma that
                                      was<br> later transmitted to Rechungpa by the terton 
              Nyan Rolpa.
                                      Rechungpa’s<br> lineage was transmitted to the second Karmapa, 
              Karma Pakshi and
                                      the<br> practice of Jinasagara remains a heart practice 
              of the
                                      Karmapas.</p>
              <p>The practice in retreat is similar to 
              Chakrasamvara in that it
                                      has<br> outer, inner, secret, very secret aspects and a 
              drupchen and fire
                                      puja<br> are included.</p>
              <p>7. Krishnachola drupchen: The lineage of 
              instruction for the
                                      wisdom<br> protector Krishnachola (Tib: Pernakchen) and his
               consort
                                      Mahakali<br> comes from Guru Rinpoche who taught it to 
              Trisong Detesen’s
                                      brother<br> who was a ngakpa. The instructions were passed 
              down through
                                      thirteen<br> generations to Karma Pakshi, who then 
              promulgated the
                                      practice.<br> Throughout retreat, a group daily practice to 
              Vajra Krishnachola
                                      is<br> done, and this culminates in a two month 
              drupchen at the conclusion
                                      of<br> the retreat.</p>

               day, since all

              <p>The week following the Monastery Opening, 
              (January 16th-22nd
                                      2010) there will be a retreat held at the 
              monastery.  The
                                      retreat topic has still not been fully decided 
              upon. Additionally,
                                      who exactly will be teaching the retreat has not
               been fully
                                      finalized. Due to the number of high lama’s and 
              Rinpoches which are
                                      believed may be in attendance of the monastery 
              inauguration, this
                                      week of retreat following the opening ceremonies
               could provide an

                                      from<br> weapons as blue balls of light, each enclosed by<br> a sphere of violet light. While reciting the

                                      has a<br> special vow to bring whomever prays to him to 
              the pureland.</p>
              <p>Dedicating the merit:<br> Conclude the session by dedicating the merit to 
              all sentient beings
                                      wandering<br> in samsara, enduring sufferings of all kinds. 
              May each and every
                                      one be free<br> of wrongdoings and illusions; following the path
               to supreme
                                      liberation, may<br> they become filled with boundless joy, 
              happiness, and wisdom.</p>
              <p>Recite:<br> May the hail of lava, fiery stones, and weapons<br> Henceforth become a rain of blossoms.<br> May those whose hell it is to fight and wound<br> Be turned to lovers offering their flowers.<br> May forests where the leaves are blades and 
              swords<br> Become sweet groves and pleasant woodland 
              glades.<br> On every side and in all the ten directions,<br> May groves of wish-fulfilling trees abound,<br> Resounding with the sweetness of the Teachings,<br> Spoken by the buddhas and their bodhisattva 
              children.<br> Bodhicaryavatara, Shantideva</p>
              <p>Cultivate bodhicitta in all daily activities 
              and interactions
                                      with<br> others with unwavering<br> aspirations for an end to aggression and 
              confusion on all
                                      levels.</p>
              <p>This practice from  8th Drugu Choegyal 
              Rinpoche is based
                                      upon oral<br> teaching instructions of Vajradhara 8th Khamtul 
              Rinpoche and
                                      of<br> Vajradhara Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche. It is 
              according to the
                                      Rinchen<br> Terdzod Gridul, the AKSHOBHYA SUTRA, and the 
              Zungsnatsog of
                                      Jamgon<br> Mipham Rinpoche.</p>
              <p>This prayer to Tsonchei Mijigpai Gyalpo was 
              taught by
                                      Padmasambhava<br> for the beings of this dark age whom he 
              prophesied would
                                      suffer<br> intensely upon dying in wars and in accidents. 
              The terma was
                                      revealed<br> by Lhodrak Drubchen Lekyi Dorje and is preserved
               in the Rinchen
                                      Terdzod<br> in volume Ni, known as Gridul.</p>
              <p>In this teaching, Padmasambhava said that 
              unless we help to free
                                      these<br> bardo beings from the fears arising from the 
              violent circumstances
                                      of their<br> death, their mindstreams will become trapped in 
              recurring cycles of
                                      longlasting,<br> terrifying, fearful illusions and they will be 
              unable to establish
                                      and<br> stabilize clarity of mind.</p>
              <p>The AKSHOBHYA mantra has been added to the 
              practice for
                                      destroying<br> karmic effects and this special Vajrapani mantra
               for giving
                                      protection and<br> fearlessness to the living and to these bardo 
              beings.</p>
              <p>May this teaching spread around the whole 
              world so that in these
                                      times<br> of war the mindstreams of the dead will become 
              free from fearful
                                      illusions.<br> By the merit of this teaching and practice, may 
              the loving
                                      and<br> compassionate quality of their minds arise with 
              clarity so that
                                      they will be<br> reborn in a peaceful world, in heaven, or in 
              Buddha fields.</p>

              <h1>126 day 108 Springs Chod Retreat In Scotland</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p>During the summer of 2008, Ven. Paula Chichester and Ven. Roger
                                      Munro trekked the Scottish Highlands completing 
              an extensive Chöd
                                      Retreat. They discuss the inspiration they 
              received from
                                      Tsongkhapa’s ear-whispered lineage of which Chöd
               is a part, and
                                      also their direct experience with the powerful 
              effects of the
                                      practice on the environment and its inhabitants.
               When Geshe Khenrab
                                      told them it was so powerful for developing 
              compassion to do it, he
                                      was right it really does. Gelugpas had to do it 
              in secret. It
                                      wasn’t something they were allowed to do in the 
              monasteries.<br> <br> The actual practice lineage includes all the 
              practices that Lama
                                      Tsongkhapa received from Manjushri directly on 
              how to become
                                      enlightened in one lifetime in these degenerate 
              times. When Lama
                                      Tsongkhapa was first practicing Dharma in Tibet,
               when he had
                                      learned everything, he looked around and he 
              didn’t think it was
                                      possible to still become enlightened 
              particularly because the
                                      emptiness teachings had become slightly unclear.
               And also the
                                      morality was changing at the time. He was 
              skeptical and when he
                                      finally got to talk to Manjushri directly, he 
              asked if it’s still
                                      possible to attain enlightenment in one lifetime
               like we hear in
                                      the great texts. Lama Manjushri said, “Yes.” And
               Lama Tsongkhapa
                                      asked, “How is that?”<br> <br> Lama Manjushri outlined a whole series of 
              teachings of which the
                                      Lama Chöpa practice is the embodiment of all. It
               contains them all.
                                      But it also includes the three deities, 
              extensive sadhana practice,
                                      Chöd practice, ngöndro practices – this is 
              really what you call
                                      Lama Tsongkhapa’s practice lineage. It was 
              originally called the
                                      Ganden Kagyu lineage, meaning this is the Ganden
               practice lineage.
                                      Kirti Tsenshab Rinpoche explained that some of 
              the lineages that
                                      Lama Tsongkhapa incorporated into his practice 
              lineage came through
                                      the Kagyu lineages, but not all of them. They 
              also came from the
                                      Sakya and even from the Nyingma. It’s called the
               Ganden Kagyu
                                      lineage because it’s the Ganden practice lineage<br> <br> After doing Heruka retreat, I decided to take 
              the “Dedicating the
                                      Illusory Body” Chöd text, and make it into a 
              chantable English
                                      version. I’d already received permission from 
              Lama Zopa Rinpoche to
                                      do that. It’s the common Ganden Chöd lineage. 
              The one we practiced
                                      in the retreat we just finished is the uncommon 
              Ganden Chöd
                                      lineage. The sadhanas are different and the 
              initiations you receive
                                      and the deities you practice while you do them 
              are a little
                                      different in the uncommon lineage.I didn’t know 
              about the uncommon
                                      lineage at the first Dharma Celebration because 
              Song Rinpoche
                                      taught us about the common lineage. Just after 
              we finished the
                                      Great Retreat, we serendipitously encountered 
              David Molk who was
                                      willing to translate the common text for us into
               a chantable
                                      version.<br> <br> David encouraged us to come to Toronto for 
              teachings from Khalkha
                                      Jetsun Dampa Rinpoche, who is said to be like 
              the Dalai Lama of
                                      Mongolia. He was in Toronto at Zasep Tulku 
              Rinpoche’s center giving
                                      the initiations and transmissions for the 
              uncommon Ganden Chöd,
                                      which is the 108 Springs retreat. As the title 
              implies, that
                                      involves going to one hundred and eight 
              different springs
                                      consecutively and performing the Chöd practice 
              at those sites. You
                                      have to be in a different place every night 
              without interruption.
                                      Preferably it’s a spring, but it can also be a 
              river, a lake or an
                                      ocean – somewhere there is water around.<br> <br> The empowerment that enables one to do this 
              retreat takes seven
                                      days of teachings and seven nights of going to 
              scary places.
                                      Khalkha Jetsun Dampa Rinpoche would give 
              initiations and teachings
                                      all day long, and then at night he would send us
               off to a different
                                      graveyard where we were supposed to do the Chöd 
              practice every
                                      night. Because it was twenty degrees below zero 
              in Toronto winter,
                                      we went instead to a different student’s house 
              every night and did
                                      Chöd as a group all night. That’s the 
              prerequisite and commitment
                                      to 108 Springs Retreat.<br> <br> It was a very intense seven-day long retreat. 
              There were exactly
                                      thirty-eight people, like in Vajrayogini’s body 
              mandala (thirty
                                      seven, plus the teacher in this case). We were 
              given teachings and
                                      initiations all morning. At sunset we would do 
              the practice
                                      together, and from the time we left him until we
               saw him the next
                                      morning, we couldn’t speak. We traveled with 
              David and Minoshi
                                      Gould. We did the practice four times in the 
              night, the last time
                                      just before dawn. We would drive back to the 
              center in the morning
                                      after sleeping an hour or so, and then go back 
              to receive
                                      teachings. We slept a little in the middle of 
              the night, but not
                                      much. We moved to Land of Medicine Buddha where 
              we met Ribur
                                      Rinpoche, who asked us to do a Yamantaka Great 
              Retreat to benefit
                                      the FPMT. That took eight years from the time he
               asked us to do it
                                      until the time we finished.<br> <br> In 2005, I went to Scotland to visit my friend 
              Ven. Angie Muir who
                                      introduced me to Thubten Dechen there, who was 
              six at the time. We
                                      took a walk across Leckmelm Farm on Loch Broom 
              and came across a
                                      ruin of a house which I had no idea was a 
              clearance1 house. I
                                      didn’t know what the clearances were.Out of the 
              blue I said to
                                      Thubten Dechen, “What’s the wind telling you?” 
              What the wind told
                                      me was, “Come back and do the 108 Springs 
              retreat.”<br> I had the opportunity to speak with Lama Zopa 
              Rinpoche who did a mo
                                      that came out “excellent” to live, teach and 
              retreat in
                                      Scotland.<br> <br> We found out that you can camp anywhere in 
              Scotland. There is a
                                      “right of access” law on the books that allows 
              you to put up a tent
                                      pretty much anywhere in Scotland. You can’t 
              drive a car anywhere,
                                      but you can walk and camp in most places. That’s
               one of the reasons
                                      we picked Scotland: we had access almost 
              everywhere. There are tons
                                      of creeks and springs – lots of water. Scotland 
              has a very powerful
                                      spiritual tradition from the Celts. As much as 
              some people tried to
                                      beat it out of the place, it’s still there. I 
              feel called to do
                                      spiritual practice when I am in Scotland. Last 
              year I went to Tibet
                                      for two weeks, thanks to Ven. Robina. Afterwards
               I came back and
                                      went to Scotland, and I felt more inclined to do
               retreat there than
                                      in Tibet. Part of that might be my DNA 
              connection with Scotland,
                                      but it’s also an extraordinary place. Physically
               and energetically,
                                      it’s beautiful. Despite the bad weather, I loved
               it. Roger has a
                                      strong connection too his family is from there. 
              Basically, when I
                                      was at a clearance the first time, I could feel 
              sadness there. You
                                      can also see deserted houses and hear personal 
              stories from people
                                      about the clearances. The stories are basically 
              about ghosts!<br> <br> The practice has several parts to it. The main 
              things you’re
                                      dealing with are gods and ghosts – the local 
              gods and ghosts of the
                                      place, land and country. There’s a whole 
              hierarchy in those realms
                                      – the realms of the hungry ghosts, the gods, the
               types of ghosts.
                                      There are different levels of health and wealth 
              and well-being.
                                      Some of them are suffering quite a bit, and they
               are the ones that
                                      usually hang around scary places. They are in 
              terrible states of
                                      suffering and don’t know they don’t have to be 
              there.<br> <br> The particular 108 Spring practices involves 
              three different
                                      practices a day: you take possession of the 
              ground in the name of
                                      Prajñaparamita, then you do the practices, then 
              you satiate them by
                                      making extensive offerings to them based on your
               own body and the
                                      Dharma, which pacifies their delusions. With 
              this particular
                                      retreat, every place you go, you have a certain 
              amount of boundary
                                      stones you use for protection during the 
              practice that you bless.
                                      When the practice is over you gather them up and
               request Mother
                                      Prajñaparamita to come and stay in that place in
               order to continue
                                      to teach and care for the gods and spirits in 
              that place.<br> <br> We got positive feedback from people wherever we
               went. Whenever
                                      anyone with any level of clairvoyance came 
              around, they said they
                                      could see or feel what we were doing as we were 
              doing it. We did
                                      the practice in a very famous castle near Loch 
              Ness, and something
                                      definitely happened in the water. Our dear 
              friend Victoria who came
                                      with us said she could see the naga spirits 
              coming to us at that
                                      offering. I couldn’t see anything, but I could 
              see a big upwelling
                                      in the place she was talking about. You can 
              expect things like that
                                      to happen, but the most important thing is how 
              our minds
                                      felt.<br> <br> It’s called 108 Springs, but the whole retreat 
              was 126 days. We
                                      spent seven days at the first spring, seven at 
              the 54th spring, and
                                      seven at the last spring. We started April 1 at 
              Shambhala Retreat
                                      Center. It was still snowing and sleeting there.
               The first seven
                                      days were in the yard of the center.From there 
              we moved around
                                      during the day to springs all around and we had 
              to stay inside at
                                      night. It was just too cold at night. Tibet is 
              even lower latitude
                                      than Scotland. Scotland is way up there, and the
               sun went down at
                                      11 pm during the summer and came up at 3 in the 
              morning. It was
                                      like dusk all night because it never really got 
              dark. The opposite
                                      is true in the winter, where they have long, 
              dark nights. What
                                      happened in Scotland was even more brutal than 
              what happened in
                                      Tibet. One hundred fifty years later and they’re
               still reeling. You
                                      can just feel it in the people. It has a very 
              high suicide rate and
                                      alcoholism, and it has to do with the country’s 
              trauma.<br> <br> Post script from Ven. Paula: I’ve noticed now 
              that I’ve been back
                                      awhile that the main impact of the Chöd retreat 
              is that I have no
                                      desire for anything. It’s pretty interesting. I 
              usually have little
                                      desire for stuff, but now it is really no desire
               for anything. In
                                      the Chöd, you spend a lot of time satisfying all
               beings of all
                                      their desires by offering your body and 
              transforming it into total
                                      bliss that satisfies all beings’ wishes – and 
              then, you offer them
                                      Dharma, which they can hear because they are 
              satisfied. You can see
                                      then that the result would be that the 
              practitioner becomes totally
                                      satisfied. So easy and so profound.I spoke to 
              Roger the other day
                                      on the phone while he was out winter food 
              shopping and he said he
                                      is feeling the same way. No desire, but plenty 
              of bliss and void a
                                      very good retreat!<br> <br> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mandalamagazine.org/2009/july/chod_retreat.asp">http://www.mandalamagazine.org/2009/july/chod_retreat.asp</a></p>

Then on top of your <br>head appears the Nirmanakaya form of Amitabha. You then say:<br><br>OM ARYA TARA SA PA RI WA RA ARGHAM PAR TI ZA SO HA<br>OM ARYA TARA SA PA RI WA RA PADAM PAR TI ZA SO HA<br>OM ARYA TARA SA PA RI WA RA PUBEI PAR TI ZA SO HA<br>OM ARYA TARA SA PA RI WA RA DUBEI PAR TI ZA SO HA<br>OM ARYA TARA SA PA RI WA RA ALOKE PAR TI ZA SO HA<br>OM ARYA TARA SA PA RI WA RA GANDE PAR TI ZA SO HA<br>OM ARYA TARA SA PA RI WA RA NEVIDIYA PAR TI ZA SO HA <br>OM ARYA TARA SA PA RI WA RA SHAPDA PAR TI ZA SO HA<br><br><br>In one’s heart, on the moon seat, there is a green letter TAM<br>surrounded by the syllables:<br><br>OM TA RE TU TA RE TU RE SO HA.<br><br>From these syllables rays of light are extended and make <br>offerings to the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas and which become <br>useful for the benefit of all sentient beings. All the <br>powers, blessings and compassion of all the Buddhas and <br>Bodhisattvas manifest in the form of rays of light which <br>absorb into the rosary of seed syllables. Then one recites <br>the mantra,<br><br>OM TARE TUTARE TURE SO HA<br><br>at least 108 times or as much as is possible. At the end, <br>one makes the request:<br><br>Please bestow all the common and supreme siddhis,powers to all<br>sentient beings and to myself.From one’s heart, light is extended<br>and reflects from the moon seat upon which one sits. This causes <br>the seaat to absorb into oneself. Then one concludes by sharing<br>merits by reciting thus:<br><br>GYAY NAM DRU CHING SOL WA TAB PAY TU<br>DA SOK KANG DU NAY BAY SA CHOK SU<br>NAY DUN OO PONG TAP TSO SHI WA TANG<br>CHO TANG TRA SHI PEL WA ZA DU SOL<br>Through our praises and supplicating to you<br>May sickness, poverty and warfare<br>Subside wherever we may be and<br>May Dharma and good omens increase.<br><br>***<br><br>Namo Guru Ratnavardhaya!<br>I and others, all beings equal to space, from this time forth until the heart of<br>enlightenment is reached;To the holy Root Guru and Lineage, essence of all body, <br>speech, mind, qualities and activities of all tathagatas of the ten directions <br>and three times; Source of the eighty-four thousand articles of Dharma and master<br>of all the noble Sangha;<br><br>In the collection of glorious root and lineage Gurus, through the three doors with<br>great devotion, I go for refuge:In the Buddha, teacher, having completely abandoned<br>and realized, through the three doors; In the holy Dharma, essence of the teaching<br>of scripture and realization, through the three doors; In the Sangha, the Conqueror’s <br>sons, holders of the teaching, through the three doors.<br>(recite as much as possible.)<br><br>May you bless the three, body, speech and mind of myself and all beings;<br>bless my mind to approach the Dharma;<br>To accept the holy Dharma path;<br>To pacify errors on the path;<br>That mistaken appearances arise as space;<br>That discursive non-Dharma thoughts are stopped;<br>That love and compassion arise;<br>To quickly obtain omniscience.<br>For the benefit of all beings, once mothers, equal to space,<br>I must obtain the highest enlightenment.<br>For that purpose I practice the profound yoga, the path of all buddhas.<br>(recite three times)<br><br>OM SVABHAVA SHUDDHA SARVA DHARMA SVABHAVA SHUDDHO ‘HAM.<br><br>From the great sphere of reality, limitless and free, bestowing various wishes, is a<br>jewelled throne; unsullied by faults of samsara, a lotus seat; naturally luminous,<br>a moon mandala; above, I arise as the nature of all buddhas, Avalokiteshvara, in<br>colour, like stainless conch and crystal; very resplendent, smiling, peaceful and<br>radiant. With four arms the first are folded at the heart; the lower hold a crystal<br>mala and jewelled lotus; two beautiful feet seated in vajra posture; adorned with<br>many attractive silks and jewels; beautified with dark blue hair in tufts [some]<br>loose.<br><br>On the crown of the head, the wisdom of all buddhas, is the Lord, source of all<br>refuge gathered as one, in essence the Guru, in the aspect of Amitabha, in the<br>manner of the Lord of the Family, seated happily; I, in the form of the deity, like<br>the reflection in a mirror, the union of appearance-emptiness, the dance of illusion;<br>like an excellent dancer with many beautiful adornments.

Pacified, mind itself is completely free from<br>extremes. <br>(Remain in a relaxed state free of mental activity).<br><br>In the middle of the heart on a lotus and moon is the letter HRIH, surrounded<br>by the six-syllable mantra. Rays of light invoke the compassion of<br>the conquerors, blessing myself, accomplishing the benefit of beings of the<br>six-realms.<br><br>OM MANI PADME HUM<br>(recite five hundred, etc.)<br><br>(In conclusion; the throne etc. in the aspect of light rays <br>dissolve into oneself.)

At all times <br>think that the home is the field of Sukhavati. Think <br>that oneself, in the pride of Avalokiteshvara,acts as <br>the servant of Guru Amitabha. With the doors of body, <br>speech and mind not free of carrying the three etc. <br>teach the accomplishment of great love for the benefit <br>of beings.<br><br>***<br><br>The meditation on Vajrasattva is, according to the Tantric tradition, <br>very beneficial for the confession and purification of sins. In order<br>to pacify all the obscurations accumulated since beginningless times,<br>and in order to restore broken pledges1, one should practice this <br>meditation regularly.<br><br>The most appropriate time to practice this meditation is at night, <br>before going to sleep. One should then recall and confess all the <br>sins accumulated during the day, through body, speech and mind, <br>the faults one is aware of, and all the faults accumulated <br>unconsciously, through ignorance.<br><br>There are two traditions, concerning this meditation. In one case, <br>a single Vajrasattva is visualized; this meditation is common to <br>all the Tantras. In the other, Shri Heruka (Vajrasattva and his <br>consort Vajragarvi) is visualized. Shri Heruka’s name is then <br>substituted for Vajrasattva’s name in the 100-syllable<br>mantra. This meditation is mentioned in the Mahayoga Tantras, <br>the special Mother Tantra. It is also practiced in the Hevajra Tantras.<br><br>Here is contained an explanation on the meditation of Vajrasattva.<br><br>Main Meditation<br>Before the main meditation, as before all meditations, one should <br>take refuge and awaken the Bodhisattva’s mind of great compassion:<br><br>SANG YE CHO TANG TS’OK KYI CHOK NAM LA<br>JANG CHUB BARDU DAK NI KYAB SU CHI<br>DAK KI JIN SOK GYI PEI SONAM KYI<br>DRO LA P’EN CHIR SANGYE DRUP PAR SHOK<br><br>In the Enlightened One, His Teachings and Exalted Assembly,<br>I take refuge until Enlightenment is won.<br>Through the merit of giving and other good deeds,<br>May I attain Enlightenment for the sake of all beings.<br>(3x or more)<br><br>One then thinks of oneself as having regular physical appearance.<br>On the top of one’s head one imagines a lotus flower on which rests<br>a moon cushion - the lotus flower represents purity and the moon cushion,<br>emptiness. On the moon cushion stands a five-pointed gold vajra. In <br>the center of the gold vajra there is a white letter HUM  which stands <br>on a small moon cushion. This letter HUM represents the Dharmakaya of <br>Vajrasattva, the nature of all the Buddhas.<br><br>From the letter HUM, with the sound HUM, the Dharmakaya form is <br>transformed into the Sambhogakaya form: Vajrasattva appears. <br>His body is white, he has one face, and two arms. His right hand <br>is holding a gold vajra and his left hand, a silver bell. He is <br>adorned with the six jewel ornaments, and sitting in vajra asana <br>position (full lotus).<br><br>On top of Vajrasattva’s head, on a lotus flower and moon cushion, <br>sits the Master of the Family, Akshobhya Vajrasattva. The top of <br>his head is adorned with the top half of a gold vajra.<br><br>In Vajrasattva’s heart, there is a gold vajra on a moon cushion. <br>In its center, on a small moon cushion, there is a white letter <br>HUM. Imagine this letter as having three dimensions; it can be <br>seen from any side.<br><br>From the letter HUM, white light comes out and spreads throughout <br>the ten directions. With this light, Vajrasattva emanates thousands <br>of goddesses who bring offerings to all the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.<br>The light touches all natural elements  oceans, mountains, medicine, <br>trees and reaches all sentient beings, purifying all their defilements<br>and transforming them into Buddhas. The light then comes back, and all<br>the offering goddesses return with all the energies of the natural <br>elements, and with the blessings of all the Buddhas. This light <br>sinks into the letter HUM which then becomes very powerful, vibrant <br>with pure energy. This light circulation is repeated many times.<br><br>We then request Bhagawan Vajrasattva:<br>“O Blessed One, cleanse and purify, I pray, all the accumulations<br>Of sins, obscurations, faults, failings and impurities which I and<br>All beings have collected throughout beginningless times.”<br>(One then recalls all the sins gathered during the day and before.)<br><br>From the letter HUM, nectar comes out. It entirely fills up Vajrasattva’s<br>body and drips down the moon cushion and lotus flower seat. It flows <br>outside and inside one’s body, like the most pleasant shower.<br><br>The nectar washes out all physical diseases and sicknesses. It clears <br>away all mental obscurations and defilements. If one feels bothered by <br>evil spirits, one can imagine the nectar clearing them away. All these <br>come out through one’s feet and lower apertures of the body as dirty <br>liquid which then disappears in the Dharmadhatu. All physical and mental <br>problems are thus purified.With this visualization and while keeping <br>in mind the thought of the four powers8, one respectfully chants the <br>100-syllable mantra of Vajrasattva, at least 21 times.<br><br>OM VAJRASATTVA SAMAYA MANUPALAYA <br>VAJRASATTVA TENOPA TISHTHA <br>DRIDHO ME BHAVA <br>SUTOSHYO ME BHAVA <br>SUPOSHYO ME BHAVA <br>ANURAKTO ME BHAVA <br>SARVA SIDDHI ME PRAYACCHA <br>SARVA KARMA SUCH ME <br>CITTAM SHREYANG KURU HUM <br>HA HA HA HA HOH BHAGAVAN <br>SARVA TATHAGATA VAJRA MA ME MUNCA <br>VAJRI BHAVA MAHA SAMAYASATTVA AH.<br><br>OM. Over the vow of adamantine being keep guard:<br>do thou, Vajrasattva, stay nearby, steady me. Gladden me,<br>enrich me, be loving toward me.<br>Bestow upon me all perfections and, in<br>all deeds also, make virtuous my mind.<br>HUM! Ha Ha Ha Ha Hoh!<br>Blessed Ones, Thus Gone Ones,<br>do not abandon me!<br>Make me adamantine,<br>Thou Being of the Great Vow!<br>AH.<br><br>Completion Meditation<br>One more time, one asks Vajrasattva to purify all one’s obscurations:<br>DAK NI MI SHAY MONG PA TAY. TAM TSHIK LAY NI GAL<br>ZHING NYAM. LAMA GONPO KYAB DZOD CHIK, TSOWO<br>DORJAY DZIN PA TAY. THUK JAY CHEM PO’I DAK NYID CHEN,<br>DROWA’I TSO LA DAK KYAB CHI.

DIK PA TANG, DRIB PA NYE PA TANG, TUNG WA THI<br>MA’I TSHOK THAM CHED, CHANG ZHING TAK PAR DZED DU<br>SOL<br>I, deluded by ignorance, have broken and spoiled the vows; <br>Guru and Protector, be my refuge.To the highest Vajradhara, <br>possessed of the essence of great compassion,the chief of <br>all beings, I go for refuge.<br><br>I confess all my transgressions of the root and branch vows <br>of body, speech and mind.Cleanse and purify, I pray, all <br>the accumulations of sins, obscurations,faults, failings <br>and impurities.<br><br>Vajrasattva then says: “My child, I purify all your external <br>and internal obscurations. You should now rejoice and feel <br>happy.” One thus feels encouraged and comforted.<br><br>Vajrasattva melts from the top of the Master of the Family down, <br>from the lotus flower stem up. The light concentrates around his <br>heart. This light is very powerful; it is the essence of all the <br>energies and powers of all the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.<br><br>The light slowly sinks down in our body. We are now identical to <br>Vajrasattva.We cannot be separated from him. Our body becomes <br>rainbow, free from all conceptions. We keep this feeling, joyful, <br>natural, peaceful. We cannot separate the joyfulness from emptiness. <br>It is a non-dual situation. We make sure our mind is stable, and <br>we keep this state as long as possible.<br><br>Dedication Meditation<br><br>GAY WA DI YI NYUR TU DAK. <br>DORJAY SEMPA DRUB GYUR NAY. <br>DRO WA CHIK KYANG MA LU PA. <br>TAY YI SA LA GOAD PAR SHO. <br>GAY WA DI YI GYE WO GUEUN. <br>SONAM YESHE TSOK TSOK NAY. <br>SONAM YESHE LAY DJOUNG WAY. <br>TAM PA NYI PO TOB PAR SHOK<br><br>By this virtue, may I quickly attain the state of Vajrasattva <br>and place upon his stage all living beings, without exception.<br>By this virtue, may they all accumulate merits and achieve wisdom.<br>May they all obtain the two kinds of benefits, for oneself and <br>for others.<br><br>***<br>SANG YE MENGYILA BINDURYA ‘OD KI GYALPO<br><br>Refuge &amp; Bodhicitta<br>I take refuge in the venerable Root Guru and in the <br>holy masters of the lineage;<br><br>Take refuge in the Blessed Accomplished Buddhas;<br>Take refuge in the Holy Teaching;<br>Take refuge in the Noble Assemblies.
