              <p>Thusness addressed the question of first cause years ago to me,
                                              and I wrote this then based on what he said:</p>
              <p><em>Actually we don't have an original nature, we have an empty
                                              nature, that has no beginning nor ending. To visualise a purest
                                              state from the start is a dualistic view. Emptiness is not a void,
                                              not absence of suffering, emptiness is the nature of suffering and
                                              all phenomena. Getting 'lost' and becoming dualistic is natural
                                              when we develop those conditions that make us 'lost', for example
                                              being attached to our luminosity is one of the factor. When
                                              condition is there, samsara (dualistic vision) simply
                                              manifests...<br> <br> The assumption that there is a purest state and we will not
                                              becoming dualistic is itself a dualistic view. There is no purest
                                              state, when condition is there, delusion manifests, every states
                                              are dependently originated and are empty, and being empty all
                                              states are equally pure. Suffering too is empty and pure. Even the
                                              state of delusion is empty and pure but we just don't recognize it
                                              due to our karmic obscurations (or deep conditionings, karmic
                                              propensities of falsely projecting 'self' and 'inherency') that
                                              blinds us from seeing.<br> <br> And no, realising the luminosity aspect alone can't lead to
                                              liberation. As I said... other religions talk about that aspect as
                                              well and not just Buddhism, but when its empty nature is not known,
                                              it becomes a metaphysical essence, and all phenomena becomes like
                                              dust on the mirror. And then there is a mirror reflecting external
                                              conditions. That becomes dualistic and 'inherent'. The cause of
                                              samsara is still not uprooted, and one of the fundamental causes as
                                              Thrangu Rinpoche* stated is the attachment to luminosity due to not
                                              perceiving its empty nature. If you read <a rel="nofollow" href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">my friend's experience</a> you see that there must
                                              be further insights into the anatta and sunyata nature of
                                              awareness.<br> <br> But emptiness is also not just empty, so you must realise the union
                                              and inseparability of luminosity and emptiness. Having conviction
                                              in our luminous nature as everpresent, never lost, is important,
                                              but having glimpses of that pure luminosity is just the beginning
                                              and we are still far from perceiving its nature.</em></p>

                                              all-pervading, brilliant union of luminosity and emptiness,
                                              ungraspable, how is it that it could be obscured, even for a
                                              moment, let alone lifetime after lifetime?</a></p>

              <p>Next, realization is permanent. But realization does not remove *all* defilements at once, at least usually not - there are rare exceptional cases. Usually it is like emptying the jug of its contents - the odour still can remain. It takes further practice and insights to remove the remainder residue of defilements.</p>

              <p>Hi Dharmasharer, I do not know what answer you are expecting, abhidharmic version or down-to-earth version. I share the down-to-earth version.</p>
              <p>We are all pure because there is no karmic formations when we were born, (unless you are talking about Karma from previous life). Then we start to have attachments, greed, etc. We do not understand the true nature, thus we are deluded, start to have karmic formations. (refer to: The Four Noble Truths. Dukha is the result of attachments)</p>
              <p>If we follow the path (Eightfold path), we can end the samsaric cycles, but there are many stages to it. Each stage forward does not mean we will not fall back because we are still very human. Only when we completely rid ourselves off all attachments (the ten fetters), then we return to our original nature. But do note that it is not easy.</p>

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Here is part of an article titled <strong>‘Freedom From Buddha Nature’</strong> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">by Thanissaro Bhikkhu. This would be from the point of view of a Theravadin.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">No Innate Nature</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">.......the Buddha never advocated attributing an innate nature of any kind to the mind — good, bad, or Buddha. The idea of innate natures slipped into the Buddhist tradition in later centuries, when the principle of freedom was forgotten. Past bad kamma was seen as so totally deterministic that there seemed no way around it unless you assumed either an innate Buddha in the mind that could overpower it, or an external Buddha who would save you from it. But when you understand the principle of freedom — that past kamma doesn't totally shape the present, and that present kamma can always be free to choose the skillful alternative — you realize that the idea of innate natures is unnecessary: excess baggage on the path.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">And it bogs you down. If you assume that the mind is basically bad, you won't feel capable of following the path, and will tend to look for outside help to do the work for you. If you assume that the mind is basically good, you'll feel capable but will easily get complacent. This stands in the way of the heedfulness needed to get you on the path, and to keep you there when the path creates states of relative peace and ease that seem so trustworthy and real. If you assume a Buddha nature, you not only risk complacency but you also entangle yourself in metaphysical thorn patches: If something with an awakened nature can suffer, what good is it? How could something innately awakened become defiled? If your original Buddha nature became deluded, what's to prevent it from becoming deluded after it's re-awakened?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">These points become especially important as you reach the subtle levels of fabrication on the more advanced stages of the path. If you're primed to look for innate natures, you'll tend to see innate natures, especially when you reach the luminous, non-dual stages of concentration called themeless, emptiness, and undirected. You'll get stuck on whichever stage matches your assumptions about what your awakened nature is. But if you're primed to look for the process of fabrication, you'll see these stages as forms of fabrication, and this will enable you to deconstruct them, to pacify them, until you encounter the peace that's not fabricated at all.</span></p>

                      not understand the true nature, thus we are deluded, start to have
                      karmic formations. (refer to: The Four Noble Truths. Dukha is the
                      result of attachments)</p>
              <p>If we follow the path (Eightfold path), we can end the samsaric
                      cycles, but there are many stages to it. Each stage forward does
                      not mean we will not fall back because we are still very human.
                      Only when we completely rid ourselves off all attachments (the ten
                      fetters), then we return to our original nature. But do note that
                      it is not easy.</p>

              <p>Again, it depends on, to what level our discussion goes. We have Buddha Nature because there is still good in us. Whether we nurture it, or ignore it, it will have profound outcome on our life. If there is no Buddha Nature, we will not be able to see the path that Our Great Teacher showed us. Like an animal running around, maybe one in a million, trillion will walk the path.</p>
              <p>At the point of conception, that is, when the sperm meets the egg, what dukkha can we talk about? Even if there is, not much to have any impact. But,.. therafter, the discomfort of being in the womb, etc. Dukkha overcomes us, then we start to have ideas, leading to delusion.</p>
              <p>Buddhist philosophies not easy to discuss. But Buddhist Attitude and Cultivation, easier to convey. Most of the time, cannot get an accurate translation of ideas, unless we communicate in Pali. For example, we all know that Dukkha is not Suffering, but we always use Suffering to mean Dukkha. Anywhere that I err, please forgive, and correct. Thanks. (PS. my Pali also half container of water only)</p>

              <p>Hi Strive On,</p>
              <p>I agree with AEN... Karmic formation goes way before '<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px;">sperm meets the egg'. The fundamental ignorance is passed on life after life. In fact, it is not even occuring only at the conscious level. The erroneous as well as karmic imprints are 'stored/retained' life after life as 'potentialities.'</span></p>
              <p>There are certain 'esoteric' understandings ....that i do not wish to talk about in a forum as it only confuses people even more.</p>

              <p>Just want to say that, actually I also agree with AEN,.. and you. Its a matter of to what level the discussion goes. Like what you said, "life after life", but in Buddhist philosophies, there is no life after life, only consciousness.</p>
              <p>Our Great Teacher, before he gives a sermon, he assess the intellectual level of his audience first. Only if permitting, he will give an esoteric sermon. For the same reason, when we discuss, it has to be understood whether we are discussing at the absolute level, or relative level.</p>
              <p>In the cyber world, we do not know who our audiences are, that's why I ask for forgiveness and corrections.</p>
