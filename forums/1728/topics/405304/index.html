              <div>Following the taking of Sojong Vows, the assembly, led by Umdze Sonam Paljor from Rumtek Monastery assisted by Lama Tashi Dhondup of Karma Tekchen Zabsal Ling in Toronto, recited from the Kagyu Mönlam Prayer Book sections of prayers selected for the event by His Holiness himself. Portions of the Twenty-Branch Mönlam and the entire King of Aspiration Prayers filled the morning, which was accented by a teaching (appropriately given during the seven-branch mönlam’s teaching section) by Thrangu Rinpoche.<br></div>
              <p> </p>
              <div>“This is a time of great development in the world, “ Rinpoche said, “and a time when Dharma has spread throughout the world… but it also is a time of many disasters in the world … harm [coming to beings] from water, fire, earthquake, weapons, and warfare… We might wonder, ‘what can we do to help?’</div>
              <p> </p>
              <div>“…by reciting prayers to the Three Jewels, we of the yellow-robed ordained sangha and the white-robed lay sangha can bring benefit to the world…this is what we can do.”</div>
              <div>
              <div>Dusum Khyenpa, who perfected the practices of Kagyu forefathers Naropa, Marpa, and Milarepa, lived to a ripe old age, and was able, in his 70s, to establish the three seats of the Karmapas in Tibet – one seat each for the Body, Speech, and Mind of awakening.<br></div>
              <br>
              <div>Karma Pakshi was known for his miracles, which were crucial in taming the war-making activities of the Mongolian emperor of old. Karma Pakshi performed miracles for the emperor, such as sitting in meditation and “straightening” a crooked Buddha statue by moving his own body to mimic the bend of the statue and then remove its bend. With these, Karma Pakshi gained the faith of the emperor and protected many beings from harm.<br></div>
              <br>
              <div>After the delicious organic vegetarian lunch cooked by A-Ping Feng and her crew of 10 assistants, the afternoon session began with a brief pre-recorded speech by His Holiness Karmapa. In his remarks, His Holiness said that the making of aspirations is “indispensible” in our dharma practice because when we attain Buddhahood, we will have the power to carry out all the aspirations we made when we were practitioners. He encouraged us to practice well, and said he hoped he would see us very soon.<br></div>
              <br>
              <div>Following this, the assembly recited the King of Aspirations seven times and then a number of other prayers, including a Green Tara Praise. Amid the recitation of the prayer “Joy and Comfort for Beings,” where the line reads,<br></div>
              <br>
              <div>“I pray that beings’ joy be increased by beautiful clouds flashing</div>
              <div>with garlands of lightning in the sky...”</div>
              <br><br>
              <div>The sky opened up with rain.</div>

              <div>Evoking the image of His Holiness the 17th Karmapa under the Bodhi Tree in Bodhgaya (site of the first modern Kagyu Mönlam), Thrangu Rinpoche said participants at KTD were following an auspicious tradition that would benefit not just their own practice, but the entire world.Then Thrangu Rinpoche spoke of the deeds of the Karmapas as his main teaching. Today he spoke of the activities of Dusum Khyenpa, the First Karmapa, and Karma Pakshi, the Second Karmapa.</div>
