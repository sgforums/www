So get cracking and start thinking what you think the Differences are. There is another thread on similarities.<br><br>Only mature people who are sure about their own faiths invited. There is no hurry. Take your time.<br><br>I hope the mods will delete the posts made by monkeys but please do it with a light touch and not be trigger happy.<br><br>Contributors please go one point at a time and do not write long posts, keep it to less than 100 words per post.
