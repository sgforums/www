Rituals have its purpose - for example chanting sutras are a way of remembering the Buddha's words. But the most important is we practise what the Buddha taught, and the Buddha never taught, but instead, denounced the importance of rituals. Nevertheless things like offerings also has its significance and importance.<br><br>However, there is a saying from the sutras, 'gong yang san shi zhu fo bu ru gong yang wu xin dao ren'. How come 'wu xin dao ren' is placed so highly? Wu xin is someone who is liberated, and it is much better to offer a liberated and enlightened person in person rather than to the buddhas of the past in image and form.</div>

Ehi-passiko. Or read Kalama Sutta. Faith is also an essential part in Buddhism, read Alavaka Sutta. Faith is impt in religion, in freinds and even in the medicine we take!<br><br>Sure sometimes the respect people have for the Buddha may became twisted into seeing him as a omnipotent supernatural being that can grant you things. But for me, it has never been this way. Being brought up in the Therevadan way, I have always view thre Buddha as ateacher who guides and teaches us the way. Whatever result we want to achieve, only we ourselves can do so...<br><br>The Buddha said so already in the Dhammapda:<br><br>By ourselves is evil done<br>by ourselves we pain endure<br>by ourselves become we pure<br>no one can and no one may<br>Buddha merely show the way....<br></div></blockquote>I understand faith to be "religious faith" and "everyday faith." So I was talking about "religious faith;" the kind that opens your eyes to a new world that you almost never really knew existed.</div>

To some, they would rather believe in a faith that will promise a good life in heaven after death, no matter what they have done in this lifetime.  Ajahn Brahm once said, if he doesn't believes in reincarnation, he will the in next life.</div>
