The core of this problem is in <strong>dualism</strong>.<br><br><blockquote>The buddha-dharma is called the middle way because it rejects any extreme view, what the Buddha called "frozen views." These are views that attempt to wrap Reality into nice, neat packages.<br><br>We're strongly inclined to hold tight to certain views since they give us a sense of solidity under our feet. Unfortunately, they simply can't hold Reality, and thus they always leaves us susceptible to doubt and confusion - duhkha. Most of the views we hold might not seem extreme to us at first glance, but the more closely we examine them, the more extreme (and absurd) they become.<br><br>All the views we hold (and hold dear) appear in sets of two or more. more often, they appear as pairs of opposites: pro and con, Western and eastern, liberal and conservative, dualistic and non-dualistic. For example, "People are basically good" posits an ultimate quality of goodness, then attributes this quality to every member of our species. As soon as it's offered, however, it immediately invites a counter view: "People are basically evil." This is essentially the same view, but leaning in the opposite direction.<br><br>Can you <span style="font-style: italic;">see</span>, based on your immediate experience alone that neither of these views point to Reality? They are both concepts - attempts to freeze Reality into something hard, fast, solid and packaged.<br><br>Review your own experience. Do you find a specific thing called Goodness that provides the primary motivation for everyone you've met? What about Evil? Do you find that Evil exists as a specific thing, and that it serves as the biggest motivation in every human being's life?<br><br>Inherent Goodness and inherent Evil are both frozen views - notions, concepts. They don't refer to anything in actual experience. This is not to say that people don't act in ways that can be called good or evil, but only that inherent Goodness and inherent Evil are conceptual inventions - philosophical objects of our own creation. Both of these views fail to point to Reality. Reality is far more fluid than either of these extreme views is capable of indicating. Indeed, any such frozen views is, by definition, extreme - and, therefore, incapable of reflecting Reality.<br><br>What we generally fail to appreciate is that it's simply by holding onto a specific view - believing in it, relying on it, clinging to it - that it becomes frozen and extreme.<br><br>The Buddha repudiated all such views. Because they are by nature conceptual, they attempt to freeze the world into solid, separate entities, whether those entities are Goodness, Evil, selves, non-selves, books, light , enlightenment, Buddhism, or any thing or thought whatsoever. Of course, all such attempts fail. The world of experience simply isn't frozen. Reality won't be condensed into concepts. Our immediate, direct experience bears this out.</blockquote></div>
