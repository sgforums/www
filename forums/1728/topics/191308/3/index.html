But for someone on the verge on liberation, that's different. Its just like saying - you cannot possibly propel your raft even onto the land. For example if you practise meditation, eventually you will reach the state of non-meditation. If you practise a Koan, eventually the Koan, the Question, the Method will dissolve altogether, and what is left is your luminous Buddha Nature shining clearly.<br><br><a href="http://www.purifymind.com/ThoughtFree.htm" rel="nofollow">Thought-Free Wakefulness</a> (a website on meditation based on Vajrayana)<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">....Having perfected one taste through the levels of the lesser, medium and higher stages, the fourth yoga is nonmeditation. This is the point at which every type of conviction and the fixing of the attention on something completely dissolves. All convictions and habitual tendencies have dissolved and are left behind. One has captured the dharmakaya throne of nonmeditation.<br>In the beginning one needs to be convinced about how reality is: one needs to have confidence in the view. Ultimately, however, any form of conviction is still a subtle obscuration, still a hindrance. At the final stage of nonmeditation, all types of habitual tendencies and convictions need to be dissolved, left behind. There is nothing more to cultivate, nothing more to reach. One has arrived at the end of the path. All that needs to be purified has been purified. Karma, disturbing emotions and the habitual tendencies have all been cleared up, so that nothing is left.<br>The path is necessary as long as we have not arrived. The moment we arrive, however, the need for the road to get there has fallen away. As long as we are not at our destination, then it is also necessary to have the concept of path in order to get there. But once the destination has been reached, once whatever needs to be cultivated has been cultivated and whatever needs to be abandoned has been left behind, the whole need for path is over. That is what is meant by nonmeditation, literally non-cultivation. This is the dharmakaya [the formless body of ultimate reality, one of the three bodies (kayas) of Buddha] throne of nonmeditation. In Dzogchen, the exhaustion of all concepts and phenomena is the ultimate level of experience. This is the state of complete enlightenment. Both these levels of realization are equal to that of all buddhas...</span></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by casino_king:</div><div class="quote_body">Sounds very true. What is your take?</div></blockquote>Very simple. Imagine you are stuck in a desert for many days, and you have ran out of water. One man comes to you and say 'follow me, I give you 1.5 litres of water for your journey home.' The other man says 'follow me. I will bring you straight home.'<br><br>Who will you follow? Help yourself, or be helped? Is suffering the primary reality in life? Or is salvation the primary reality?<br><br>Many people suffer in this life. But some do not.<br><br>But <strong>ALL </strong>people die, and needs salvation.<br><br>You decide which reality you want. (actually there is only one true reality, see if what you have chosen is indeed the one.)</div>

It is the concept of absolute truth. Either he really is, or he really isn't. If Christ had said 'You can choose to believe me or not. It doesn't matter lah!' Do you think this kind of God is worth worshipping?<br><br>The same way I can say that the concept of karma is also a fear tactic.
