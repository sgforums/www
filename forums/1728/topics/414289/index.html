Tsikey Chokling Rinpoche and Kyabgön Phakchok Rinpoche will begin a series of teachings on the Nine Yanas in Nepal. This retreat will begin with the Shravakayana, the vehicle of listeners and hearers.<br><br>Why practice the nine yanas? Phakchok Rinpoche explains:<br><br>“By practicing the nine yanas, one will have a better understanding and knowledge of how to practice the different teachings the Buddha taught. One will learn how to study, reflect, and meditate in stages like the levels of a staircase. The Buddha said that the meaning of all vehicles agrees at one point and that all the different paths arrive at the same point. In actuality there is one vehicle, and all the vehicles are one, so if you are not able to understand all the different paths then how will you understand the one point that they all arrive at? Each of the nine yanas has their own different view, conduct, meditation, and fruition, but they are not completely divorced from each other; each one is able to clarify the meaning of the previous one, and also the next.”<br><br>Phakchok Rinpoche’s teachings on the Shravakayana will follow a book containing a collection of texts he has compiled specifically for this purpose. This collection includes texts by Indian panditas, texts by Tibetan mahasiddhas, and words of the Buddha himself. The retreat will open with an empowerment by H.E. Chokling Rinpoche. The schedule of the retreat will be a combination of teachings, discussion groups, and meditation sessions with the Rinpoches and other students.<br><br>What is also unique about this particular series of 9 Yana retreats is that there will be a specific sadhana for each yana with a specific mantra, a specific tangka, and so on. These sadhanas are called the Rigsum Nyingtik in Tibetan (the Heart Essence of the Three Enlightened Families), and are a branch teaching of the Three Sections of the Great Perfection, a very famous text revealed by the supreme treasure revealer Chokgyur Lingpa. The three protectors—all of the buddhas’ compassion manifest in the form of Avalokiteshvara, all of the buddhas’ wisdom manifest in the form of Manjushri, and all of the buddhas’ enlightened power manifest in the form of Vajrapani—are the main deities in these nine yanas sadhanas and their form changes in each of the yanas. For example, in the shravakayana, the three protectors are in the form of arhats.<br><br>The cost of this week-long retreat will be USD 550, which will include all accommodation, meals, the necessary practice texts and materials (i.e. the Shravakayana book, practice text, tangka photo, and statue, stupa, and shrine text as specified in the Rigsum Nyingtik itself). For more information and to register, please email events@cglf.org.<br><br>Event : Phowa Retreat<br>Venue : Puteri Pacific Hotel, Jalan Abdullah Ibrahim, 80000 Johor Bahru, Malaysia   <br>Website : http://cglf.org/news-a-events/foundation-events.html<br>Poster : http://cglf.org/images/pdf/2011phowaenglish_latest.pdf<br><br>We are extremely pleased and honoured to announce that H.E. 4th Tsikey Chokling Rinpoche, the second son of the late Great Perfection teacher, Kyabje Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche, will transmit a special practice for the Transference of Consciousness to Amitabha Buddha’s Pure Land, renowned in Tibetan as Phowa. This is only the second time that Chokling Rinpoche will be giving this teaching in a large gathering. In the first ever large-scale Phowa retreat in December 2009, due to the blessings of Guru Rinpoche, Chenrezig, Amitayus and all the compassionate lineage masters, all 148 participants from 7 countries displayed the external sign of accomplishment of this profound practice.</p></div>
