              <h3 style="color: #000066; font-size: 17px; font-style: italic; margin-top: 2em;">Michael Everson</h3>
              <em>This paper, written originally in 1988, was an excursion into 
                                  theology -- or perhaps “noetology”. It was an attempt at commentary 
                                  proper, rather than at disinterested analysis</em>.<br> 
              <hr>
              It is a basic tenet of Buddhism that suffering arises from false notions
                                   of self. Individuals perceive themselves as separate entities, 
                                  autonomous yet dependent on their world, experiencing change and 
                                  continuity. The uniqueness of each moment of existence is distorted by 
                                  the filter of a self which categorizes and interprets those moments, 
                                  judging them good or bad and fighting a useless battle to keep the good 
                                  and shun the bad. The nexus for the introduction of false notions of 
                                  self into experience is the point at which experience is conceptualized.
                                   Enlightened consciousness results when these false notions are no 
                                  longer imposed upon the perceptual process.<br>
              <div style="font-family: Arial, Geneva, sans-serif;">It cannot be said that the Buddhist description of conceptualization is 
                                  without its difficulties. Indeed, a Buddhist description of<em>anything</em> is
                                   much entangled in relationships: just as any event in the world depends
                                   on a nigh infinite series of causes, and engenders a nigh infinite 
                                  series of effects, so does a light shone on any facet of Buddhist 
                                  epistemology shine and reflect off of each other facet. It is difficult 
                                  to pluck one string of the sitar without causing the sympathetic strings
                                   into resonance as well. Still, conceptualization, and its relation to 
                                  conditioned and enlightened consciousness, is central to Buddhism -- 
                                  both to its taxonomy of the problem of existence and to its soteriology.
                                   An investigation of that relation will suggest a reëvaluation of 
                                  notions of action and being.</div>
              <div style="font-family: Arial, Geneva, sans-serif;">Buddhism might be described as a kind of cure to the disease of <em>dukkha</em>, of ‘suffering’ or ‘unsatisfactoriness’. Existence (<em>bhava</em>) is an ongoing process of becoming, manifest in its constituents (<em>aá¹…ga</em>). The natural (or ideal) condition for the mind is a calm flow (<em>bhavaá¹…ga-sota</em>),
                                   through which (around which, in which) the constituents of becoming 
                                  interact harmoniously in an “experiential stream” of what is <em>as</em> it is. Nyanatiloka remarks that <em>bhavá¹£aá¹…ga-sota</em> is explained in the Abhidhamma commentaries as the foundation or condition (<em>kaá¹�raá¹‡a</em>) of existence (<em>bhava</em>), as the <em>sine qua non</em> of life, having the nature of a process, lit. a flux or stream (<em>sota</em>). [Nyanatiloka 1980:38]</div>
              <div style="font-family: Arial, Geneva, sans-serif;">Conceptualization impedes the harmonious flow of <em>bhavaá¹…ga-sota.</em> It is a process for ordering stimuli to consciousness, convenient for interaction with the world, but, apparently, not <em>essential</em> once
                                   the world has been investigated. Bondage to concepts is considered to 
                                  be an inevitable consequence of the process of conceptualization because
                                   of the fiction of the <em>self</em>, and that bondage to concepts leads to expectation and denial, the causes of <em>dukkha</em>. A review of the process leading up to conceptualization will be helpful here.</div>
              <div style="font-family: Arial, Geneva, sans-serif;">The immediate precursors to conceptualization have been classified as a purely impersonal, causal process. In the <em>Madhupiá¹‡á¸�ika-sutta</em>, the venerable Kaccaá¹�na sums up his understanding of the Buddha’s teaching:</div>
              <ul>

                                  sañjÄ�nÄ�ti taá¹� vitakketi, yaá¹� vitakketi taá¹� papañceti, yaá¹� papañceti

                                  atÄ«tÄ�nÄ�gatapaccuppanesu manoviññeyyesu dhammesu. [<em>Majjhima-nikÄ�ya</em> 18 (<em>Madhupiá¹‡á¸�ika-sutta</em>) (1888: I:112)]<br><br>‘And,
                                   brothers, the mind and mental objects are the cause for the arising of 
                                  mental consciousness. The meeting of the three is sense contact; 
                                  feelings are the result of that contact; what one feels one perceives; 
                                  what one perceives one reasons about; what one reasons about one 
                                  differentiates; what one differentiates is the origin of the sign of 
                                  perceptions and obstructions which assail a man with regard to mental 
                                  objects to be comprehended by the mind, in the past, the future, and the
                                   present.’ 
              </ul>
              <div style="font-family: Arial, Geneva, sans-serif;">Interaction between one of the sense-bases (the five senses and the 
                                  mind) and an object gives rise to the attentive faculty of 
                                  consciousness, that is, of awareness of objects. The meeting of the 
                                  three is contact (<em>phassa</em>); from this contact arises sensation or feeling (<em>vedanÄ�</em>).
                                   The living being with functioning sense organs must interact with 
                                  objects, become conscious of them through contact, and feel or sense 
                                  them. When the ego intrudes and makes the connection “I experience this 
                                  object”, the process loses its impersonality, and becomes first a kind 
                                  of deliberate and conscious, then a subconscious and automatic activity,
                                   conditioned by karmic predisposition. KaccÄ�na’s description points to 
                                  this shift from impersonal to personal in his movement from a simple 
                                  ablative construction to the inflected personal verb: <em>“PhassapaccayÄ� vedanÄ�, yaá¹� vedeti taá¹� sañjÄ�nÄ�ti”</em> ‘From the condition of contact [arises] feeling; what one feels, one perceives’. Suddenly it is an individual person (<em>puggala</em>) who experiences sensation; and when he does, he perceives, knows, or recognizes (compare <em>sañjÄ�nÄ�ti</em> with Latin <em>cÅ�gnÅ�scit)</em>. A person has arisen here out of nonperson: <em>attÄ�</em> out of<em>anattÄ�</em>.
                                   That ego, once established with its faculties of memory and volition, 
                                  will evaluate its sensations in terms of itself; it will judge, and 
                                  desire. That ego is a confluence of material and mental processes, and, 
                                  apart from them, has no real existence.</div>
              <div style="font-family: Arial, Geneva, sans-serif;">Conceptualization arises from perception. <em>“Yaá¹� sañjÄ�nÄ�ti taá¹� vitakketi”</em> ‘What
                                   one perceives, one reflects on’. This is indicative of the insidious 
                                  nature of the ego to take the original subjective experience and 
                                  “objectivize” it. Though each object, contact, and sensation be unique, 
                                  the ego takes them only in relation to itself and its past, present, and
                                   future experience and needs. The concepts (<em>vitakkÄ�</em>) which arise 
                                  through perception tend toward proliferation, for the ego becomes 
                                  attached to them. Conceptions become preconceptions, and the whole 
                                  scheme is filled with error.</div>
              <div style="font-family: Arial, Geneva, sans-serif;">The Buddha was concerned about the detrimental nature of attachment to 
                                  speculative views of existence and of the Transcendent. The problem is 
                                  not whether or not the views themselves have validity, for it is clear 
                                  that they do, depending on, and with respect to, the particular point of
                                   view. “The fact that existence is a relative concept is often 
                                  overlooked by the worldling.” [ÑÄ�á¹‡ananda 1974:20] It is axiomatic that 
                                  the frog knows what the tadpole cannot; but the question here is whether
                                   or not the tadpole’s point of view is wise, and the Buddhist approach 
                                  would be to say that <em>no</em> point of view is worthwhile unless it is a view which encompasses reality as it is. That view is impersonal. From the <em>Sutta-nipÄ�ta:</em></div>
              <ul>
              “MÅ«laá¹� papañcasaá¹�khÄ�yÄ�” ti BhagavÄ�<br>“‘mantÄ� asmÄ« ’ti sabbam uparundhe,<br>yÄ� kÄ�ci taá¹‡hÄ� ajjhattaá¹�,<br>tÄ�saá¹� vinayÄ� sadÄ� sato sikkhe.” [916 (1913:179)]<br><br>‘“He should”, said the Lord, “break up the root of these signs of obstruction,<a style="color: #333333;" href="http://www.evertype.com/misc/vitakka.html#fn1">[1]</a><a name="1" href="https://www.blogger.com/null"></a> the
                                   notion ‘I am the thinker’. Whatever his subjective desires, he trains 
                                  himself to give them up, always mindful in his discipline.”’ 
              </ul>
              <br> It should be noted that both E. M. Hare [<em>Sutta-nipÄ�ta</em> 1944:134] and Hammalava Saddhatissa [<em>Sutta-nipÄ�ta</em> 1985:107] have mistranslated <em>mantÄ� asmi</em> as ‘all the thoughts “I am”’ and ‘all thought of “I am”’ respectively. A better reading would have <em>mantÄ�</em> &lt;<em>mantar</em> ‘thinker’ (&lt; Sanskrit <em>*mantá¹›)</em> and take the deictic <em>’ti</em> as setting off the phrase <em>mantÄ� asmi</em> as translated above. (<em>Cf.</em> Neumann’s translation “<em>Ich bin’s, der denkt</em>”, ‘I am the one who thinks’. [<em>Sutta-nipÄ�ta</em> 1911:299]) The Commentary to the <em>Sutta-nipÄ�ta</em>, however, explains this phrase by <em>mantÄ�ya:</em><br> <br> 
              <ul>

                                  knowledge, his “I am” is no more, his “This I exists” is no more, his “I

              <br> Yet there is no suggestion that a universal (albeit VedÄ�ntist) ontological interpretation of <em>aham asmi</em> ‘I
                                   am’ would be rejected, though such a rejection could be inferred, I 
                                  think, in the readings of Hare and Saddhatissa. J. G. Jennings has 
                                  remarked that “[t]he <em>an-atta</em>doctrine so strongly emphasized by 
                                  [Gotama] declares the transience of individuality, yet insists upon an 
                                  ultimate or fundamental unity”. [1974:571] While the PÄ�li commentarial 
                                  tradition would doubtless reject a VedÄ�ntist claim of an essential unity
                                   to Reality, I see no reason to think that a radically non-attached, 
                                  Liberated notion of “I am” is instrinsically inconsistent with Buddhist 
                                  teachings. Pure being is neither conceived nor attached, It just Is, and
                                   if there is for “me” only “being”, then, it seems, “I am”.<a style="color: #333333;" href="http://www.evertype.com/misc/vitakka.html#fn3">[3]</a><a name="3" href="https://www.blogger.com/null"></a> The conceptual attachment of agent <em>to</em> action results from an initial (erroneous) separation of agent <em>from</em> action.<br>
              <div style="font-family: Arial, Geneva, sans-serif;">The source of the delusion standing in the way of Liberation (<em>papañcasaá¹�khÄ�</em>) is the personal notion “I am a thinker” (<em>mantÄ� asmi</em>). Mindfulness is the method by which one learns the process of letting go (<em>vinaya</em>);
                                   that process begins with the elimination of attachment to the things 
                                  perceived (pleasure, pain, desire, dislike) and culminates in the 
                                  elimination of attachment to the identification with the notion that 
                                  there is in fact a perceiver apart from the perception. This process of 
                                  detachment from ego is admittedly difficult to describe, and it may be 
                                  fruitless to attempt to do so. What may be more fruitful is to 
                                  investigate the effects precipitated by that process. By and large, they
                                   derive from a fundamental revision of the process leading up to 
                                  conceptualization, and from the removal of the causes leading to 
                                  conceptual proliferation and egoistic “ownership” of experience. The <em>Sutta-nipÄ�ta</em>describes the one who has managed this:</div>
              <ul>
              <em>“Sa sabbadhammesu visenibhÅ«to,<br>yaá¹� kiñci diá¹­á¹­haá¹� va sutaá¹� mutaá¹� vÄ�,<br>sa pannabhÄ�ro muni vippayutto<br>na kappiyo nÅ«parato na patthiyo” ti BhagavÄ� ti. </em>[914 (1913:178)]<br><br>‘“He
                                   who has discarded all theories about anything seen or heard or 
                                  conceived is a monk who is enlightened and liberated; there is no rule, 
                                  no abstention, no desire for himself”, said the Lord.’ 
              </ul>
              He is ‘disarmed’ (<em>visenibhÅ«ta</em>) with respect to all views based on what has been seen, heard, or conceived; he is liberated, has laid down his burden (<em>pannabhÄ�ro</em>, having, perhaps, “enlightened” his load!), and is without desire. There is no self to be concerned for.<br>
              <div style="font-family: Arial, Geneva, sans-serif;">What is the character of the impersonal viewpoint? In the <em>KÄ�lakÄ�rÄ�ma-sutta</em>, transcendent experience is characterized quite comprehensively:</div>

              </ul>
              Bhikkhu ÑÄ�á¹‡ananda’s translation of this passage proves problematic. 
                                  [1974:9-11] For the sake of brevity and simplicity, I will make a 
                                  neutral reconstruction of this passage using just the verb<em> karoti</em> ‘to do’ as an example, since it is first the construction which is in question. <em>“Iti kho bhikkhave katvÄ� kÄ�tabbaá¹� kataá¹� na maññati akataá¹� na maññati kÄ�tabbaá¹� na maññati kattaraá¹� na maññati.”</em>ÑÄ�á¹‡ananda
                                   would translate this so: “A TathÄ�gata does not conceive of a thing to 
                                  be done as apart from doing; he does not conceive of ‘an undone’; he 
                                  does not conceive of a ‘thing-worth-doing’, he does not conceive about a
                                   doer.” This “thing to be done apart from doing” is offered by ÑÄ�á¹‡ananda
                                   as an alternative to the sense given in Buddhaghosa’s Commentary to 
                                  the <em>Aá¹…guttara-nikÄ�ya</em>, which, according to ÑÄ�á¹‡ananda, takes the words<br> <br> 
              <ul>
              ‘[<em>katvÄ� kÄ�tabbaá¹�</em>]’ in the text to mean ‘having [done], should be [done]’, and explains the following words ‘[<em>kataá¹�</em>] <em>na maññati</em>’
                                   as a separate phrase meaning that the TathÄ�gata does not entertain any 
                                  cravings, conceits, or views, thinking: ‘I am [doing] that which has 
                                  been [done] by the people’. It applies the same mode of explanation 
                                  throughout. [1974:10 n.1] 
              </ul>
              (Buddhaghosa’s original reads<br> <br> 
              <ul>
              <em>Daá¹­á¹­hÄ� daá¹­á¹­habban</em> ti <em>disvÄ� daá¹­á¹­habbaá¹�.<br>Diá¹­á¹­haá¹� na maññatÄ«</em> ti taá¹� <em>diá¹­á¹­haá¹� rÅ«pÄ�yatanaá¹� ahaá¹� mahÄ�janena diá¹­á¹­ham eva passÄ�mÄ« ti taá¹‡hÄ�mÄ�nadiá¹­á¹­hÄ«hi na maññati</em>. [IV.iii.4 (1936: III:39)]<br><br><em>‘Daá¹­á¹­hÄ� daá¹­á¹­habbaá¹�</em> means “having seen what is to be seen”.<br><em>Diá¹­á¹­haá¹� na maññati</em> means
                                   “I see the thing seen which is even seen by the people”; one does not 
                                  conceive {of it} by desires or conceits or opinions’ [i.e., he does not 
                                  conceptualize about it].) 
              </ul>
              ÑÄ�á¹‡ananda prefers to treat the formally ambiguous <em>daá¹­á¹­hÄ�/diá¹­á¹­hÄ�</em> as ablative of the past participle (so <em>katÄ�</em> from <em>kata</em>) “giving the sense: ‘as apart from [doing]’; and, ‘[<em>kÄ�tabbaá¹� kataá¹�</em>]’ taken together, would mean ‘a [do-able] thing’.” He suggests that the absolutive forms <em>sutvÄ�, mutvÄ�</em>, and <em>viññÄ�tvÄ�</em> are “probably a re-correction following the commentarial explanation”, and that the ablatives <em>suttÄ�, mutÄ�</em>, and <em>viññÄ�tÄ�</em> evince
                                   the most correct reading. [ÑÄ�á¹‡ananda 1974:10 n.1] I am not certain that
                                   his revision is necessary. F. L. Woodward’s translation seems to follow
                                   Buddhaghosa with respect to the verbs <em>suá¹‡Ä�ti, maññati</em>, and <em>vijÄ�nÄ�ti:</em> “[Doing]
                                   what is to be [done], he has no conceit of what has been [done] or not 
                                  [done] or is to be [done], he has no conceit of the [doer]”; but he 
                                  reads<em>daá¹­á¹­hÄ�</em> as the <em>nomen agentis:</em> “[A] TathÄ�gata is a seer
                                   of what is seen, but he has no conceit of what is seen”. [1933:27] 
                                  Following Buddhaghosa, I would suggest that <em>“TathÄ�gato katvÄ� kÄ�tabbaá¹� kataá¹� na maññati”</em> etc. should read ‘Having done what is to be done, the <em>TathÄ�gata does not conceive of</em> what
                                   is done; he does not conceive of the undone; he does not conceive of 
                                  that which must yet be done; he does not conceive of a doer’. ‘Conceive’
                                   (<em>maññati</em>) here means ‘to make a concept of’. Important too is the translation here of <em>kÄ�tabbaá¹�.</em> There
                                   is really no reason to suggest that Buddhaghosa would have the 
                                  gerundive be taken in an obligatory sense ‘should be done’, or the <em>valued</em> (read <em>judged!</em>)
                                   sense of ‘a thing-worth-doing’, as ÑÄ�á¹‡ananda has taken it. [1974:10-11,
                                   10 n.1] The context does not require that the form be understood as a <em>participium necessitatis</em>,
                                   but only as a future passive participle. According to Manfred 
                                  Mayrhofer, the meaning of the future passive participle “ist die des ‘in
                                   Zukunft getan werden müssenden’<em>”</em>, ‘is that of “that which must 
                                  yet be done”’. [1951:174] ÑÄ�á¹‡ananda’s obligatory “should” is 
                                  unnecessary, for the deed which “is to be done” comes about through the 
                                  exigencies of causality. That the TathÄ�gata is beyond causality is not 
                                  taken into consideration by the forms of PÄ�li grammar, but he is 
                                  nonetheless certainly free from obligation and evaluation. The deeds of 
                                  most individuals are causally effected, and the point of the text is 
                                  that once a deed is done, the TathÄ�gata is no longer concerned with it, 
                                  or with the deed undone, or the deed yet to do, or the doer. He is 
                                  concerned only with the doing, and only in the moment in which it is 
                                  done. It is fairly easy to see that ÑÄ�á¹‡ananda’s “thing to be done as 
                                  apart from doing” is an attempt at just such an understanding, though I 
                                  think the textual revision of absolutive to ablative is unnecessary.<br>
              <div style="font-family: Arial, Geneva, sans-serif;">What is there, then? Just seeing, hearing, feeling, or understanding. 
                                  There is no agent, no patient, no recipient, no locus: only the verb, 
                                  the process, or rather, the <em>proceeding.</em> To be enlightened is not to be or to do any <em>thing:</em> it
                                   is only being, or doing. This is admittedly circular, and it is 
                                  proverbial to any student of mysticism--and certainly recognized by the 
                                  Buddhist tradition itself--that little can be<em>said</em> which can give 
                                  any real sense of what goes on in transformed consciousness. Buddhism 
                                  offers nonetheless its own kind of description, always tending toward 
                                  the practical, toward the causes which will bring about the Liberation 
                                  itself: that is, toward the empiric. The path to Liberation is twofold: 
                                  moving away from deluded action, and moving toward wise action.<br> <br> It is all the more significant for its corollary that the entire process
                                   [of cause and effect] could be made to cease progressively by applying 
                                  the proper means. Negatively put, the spiritual endeavor to end all 
                                  suffering, is a process of ‘starving’ the conditions of their respective
                                   ‘nutriments’ (<em>Ä�hÄ�rÄ�</em>), as indicated by the latter half of the 
                                  formula of Dependent Arising. However, there are enough instances in the
                                   PÄ�li Canon to show that it is quite legitimate to conceive this 
                                  receding process too, positively as a progress in terms of wholesome 
                                  mental states. [ÑÄ�á¹‡ananda 1974:46-47]</div>
              <div style="font-family: Arial, Geneva, sans-serif;">The eradication of conceptualization and the cultivation of a 
                                  dispassionate, impersonal observation is the key to Liberation. 
                                  “Ever-becoming and ever-ceasing-to-be are endless action.... Ceaseless 
                                  action is the Universe.” [Merrell-Wolff 1973:247] Since the being 
                                  embodied must be a part of such action, his hope must be to loose 
                                  himself from the bounds of <em>causal</em> action: he must seek Liberation. Perhaps it is not so ironic that in order to do so, he must realize that there is nothing <em>but</em> action; for then he is, so says the Buddha, free.</div>

              <a name="fn1" href="https://www.blogger.com/null">[1]</a> I prefer here the reading of <em>papañca</em> as ‘obstruction’ or ‘hinderance’ to the commonly met with ‘obsession’. Here I follow Rhys Davies’ suggestion that <em>papañca</em> is at least semantically related to *<em>papadya</em> ‘what is in front of the feet’, where he compares Latin<em>impedimentum</em> (though Sanskrit <em>prapadya</em> should give PÄ�li <em>papajja</em>). [Rhys Davies 1979:412] An obsession is an obstruction, but not all obstructions are obsessions. <em>Cf.</em> also above, in the passage taken from the <em>Madhupiá¹‡á¸�ika-sutta</em>, where <em>papañceti</em> is taken in its sense as derived from Sanskrit <em>prapañcayati</em> ‘to describe at length’, from <em>prapañca</em> ‘diversity’. <a style="color: #333333;" href="http://www.evertype.com/misc/vitakka.html#2">Back to text.</a><br>
              <div style="font-family: Arial, Geneva, sans-serif;"><a name="fn2" href="https://www.blogger.com/null">[2]</a> Robert Buswell has pointed out to me that Bhikkhu ÑÄ�á¹‡ananda has arrived at the same conclusion. [ÑÄ�á¹‡ananda 1971:31] <a style="color: #333333;" href="http://www.evertype.com/misc/vitakka.html#3">Back to text.</a></div>
              <div style="font-family: Arial, Geneva, sans-serif;"><a name="fn3" href="https://www.blogger.com/null">[3]</a> Without really
                                   trying to second-guess the TathÄ�gata, the argument here is simply that 
                                  he might recognize a distinction in the semantics of <em>aham asmi</em> with
                                   respect to his own description of the Enlightenment, and that of the 
                                  VedÄ�ntists. (He would almost certainly reject the use of such metaphor 
                                  for paedagogical purposes, however.) Jennings is right to point out that
                                   the VedÄ�ntist schools and their concepts of, for example, <em>mÄ�yÄ�</em>, 
                                  contributed to the Buddha’s own teachings. [Jennings 1974:cix-cx] 
                                  Certainly, it can be said that useful comparison can be made between the
                                   Buddhist and VedÄ�ntist traditions if such semantic differences are 
                                  reconciled. Fundamental unities are realized in the Buddhist tradition 
                                  at least insofar as the alienation of <em>attÄ�</em>and <em>anattÄ�</em> are concerned (<em>Cf.</em> the remarks on<em> bhavaá¹…ga-sota</em> above.). <a style="color: #333333;" href="http://www.evertype.com/misc/vitakka.html#4">Back to text.</a></div>
