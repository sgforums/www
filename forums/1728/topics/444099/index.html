              <p>Ted Biringer:</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">[To research] this truth of 
              moment-by-moment utter entrustment, we must research the mind. In the 
              mountain-still state of such research, we discern and understand that 
              ten thousand efforts are [each] the mind being evident, and the triple 
              world is just that which is greatly removed from the mind. This 
              discernment and understanding, while also of the myriad real dharmas, 
              activate the homeland of the self. They make immediate and concrete the 
              vigorous state of the human being in question.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Shobogenzo, Gyobutsu-yuigi,</span> Gudo Nishijima &amp; Mike Cross</span><br><br>In
               Dogen’s writings (and Buddhist literature generally) we frequently 
              encounter phrases that are “self-declarative.” Of these, there two basic
               types; first are those expressions that refer directly to themselves, 
              for example, many sutras contain passages like, “Those who keep and 
              guard this sutra shall experience such and such…” The second type are 
              expressions that describe subjects as objects of subjects and objects as
               the subject of objects; the most common kind of these expressions are 
              statements that attribute the thoughts, words, or deeds (objects) of a 
              particular subject as being directed or applied to that same subject, 
              such as, “self sees self…”, “from the mind to the mind…”, “the self 
              itself…”, and “Buddha actualizes Buddha…” <br><br>If our experience of 
              language has been limited to communications expressed from the common 
              dualistic perspective, such phrasing sounds awkward when we first hear 
              it. Once we become familiar with the nondual perspective, however, such 
              expressions not only sound natural, they come to mind naturally in our 
              own thinking and speaking. From the nondual view of Buddhism, of course,
               such expressions are perfectly normal. After all, if the (true) self is
               all-inclusive, as Buddhism contends, it is only normal to use 
              self-declarative expressions – for then all expressions must ultimately 
              be self-declarative. <br><br>For this reason, when we study sutras or 
              participate in koan training we can only benefit from remembering that 
              they are all self-declarative expressions, even if such is not 
              explicitly apparent in the structure of the phrase. For example, when a 
              Zen masters says, “we must research the mind” her meaning will be 
              clearer and more intimately understood if we remember that “we,” “the 
              mind,” and the activity of “research” are not three different things – 
              how much more intimate when we remember that “we,” the “Zen master,” and
               “the expression itself” are all nondual. As our sutra or koan study 
              advances along this course we gradually become more aware of the 
              “self-declarative” (nondual) nature of all our experiences – thus, our 
              experience of nondual intimacy with all things gradually expands and 
              becomes increasingly inclusive of the myriad things we encounter in our 
              everyday lives. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">It is your 
              mutually encountering your true Master within the Buddha Hall. It is 
              just like saying, “When seeing one person reflected in two facing 
              mirrors, there are three figures.”<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Shobogenzo, Sanjushichihon Bodai Bumpo</span>, Hubert Nearman</span><br><br>Thus
               it is, from the Buddhist perspective that every aspect and moment of 
              our experience is an experience of the self experienced by the self – I 
              see a flower, a flower sees me, the flower sees itself, I see myself, 
              the self sees itself, seeing sees seeing, etc. Also, since in Buddhism 
              “existence” (places, things, locations, here, etc.) and “time” 
              (durations, moments, past, future, now) are nondual, every aspect and 
              moment of our experience is a manifest instance of the (true) self – an 
              actual instance of the totality of “existence-time” (uji). Therefore, my
               seeing a flower “here” is my seeing all other myriad dharmas “there”, 
              Mahakashyapa seeing a flower “then” is Mahakashyapa seeing this flower 
              “now.” Thus, when the Zen masters say things like, “Huang drinks wine 
              and Chang gets drunk,” or “Children in Korea clap their hands and 
              children in China dance,” they are not being mysterious or even 
              ambiguous but clear and straightforward. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">“The
               great round mirror” is just a virtue of “the buddhas.” Saying that this
               mirror “has no blurs on the inside or the outside” neither describes an
               inside that depends on an outside, nor an outside blurred by an inside.
               There being no face or back, “two individuals are able to see the 
              same.” Minds, and eyes, are alike. “Likeness” describes “a human being” 
              meeting “a human being.” In regard to images within, they have mind and 
              eyes, and they are able to see the same. In regard to images without, 
              they have mind and eyes, and they are able to see the same. Object and 
              subject which are manifest before us now are like each other within and 
              like each other without—they are neither I nor anyone else. Such is the 
              meeting of “two human beings,” and the likeness of “two human beings.” 
              That person is called “I,” and I am that person. “  …Taking up his 
              principle, we should experience in practice the faces of buddhas and the
               faces of patriarchs in the great round mirror, which is akin to the 
              eternal mirror.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Shobogenzo, Kokyo</span>, Gudo Nishijima &amp; Mike Cross</span><br><br>To
               clarify this, consider Dogen’s statement in Shobogenzo, Genjokoan, 
              “When one side is illumined, the other side is dark.” The fact that the 
              “other side” is dark, rather than absent, stresses the nondual truth 
              that the aspect of “existence-time” that is dark (all the myriad things 
              of “existence-time” that are not here/now being illumined) informs and 
              exerts its “presence” in what is illumined – his here/now 
              (existence-time) is nondual (not two, not separate from) her there/then;
               his “here” is her “there,” Bodhidharma’s “now” is Huineng’s “then.”<br><br>In
               light of this, “where” (existence) are you “now” (time), and “when” 
              (time) did the morning star appear (existence) to Shakyamuni? Right 
              here, right now – look, look! How old are you? While an exact number 
              cannot be given, it would be accurate to say, “The same age as the 
              universe.” Listen, listen – is that the wind in the trees? Yes. Is it 
              the sound of cars passing by on the road? Yes. What else? Listen, this 
              sound here/now contains and is contained by all sounds there/then – can 
              you hear the Buddhas first sermon? Listen, Dogen is singing out through 
              all existence-time:<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">How joyful it
               is! From kalpa to kalpa is the Flower of Dharma, and from noon to night
               is the Flower of Dharma. Because the Flower of Dharma is from kalpa to 
              kalpa, and because the Flower of Dharma is from noon to night, even 
              though our own body and mind grows strong and grows weak, it is just the
               Flower of Dharma itself. The reality that exists “as it is” is “a 
              treasure,” is “brightness,” is “a seat of truth,” is “wide, great, 
              profound, and eternal,” is “profound, great, and everlasting,” is “mind 
              in delusion, the Flower of Dharma turning,” and is “mind in realization,
               turning the Flower of Dharma,” which is really just the Flower of 
              Dharma turning the Flower of Dharma.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Shobogenzo, Hokke-ten-hokke</span>, Gudo Nishijima &amp; Mike Cross</span><br><br>If
               the subject was experienced as an object the self would be seen (thus 
              treated) as “other,” and if an object was experienced as the subject the
               other would be treated as “self.” Thus, from the Buddhist perspective, 
              treating the other as self and self as other is normal – and doing 
              otherwise is abnormal. As “other” does not only refer to people but to 
              all that is “other than self,” the practical implications of verifying 
              the Buddhist teaching would be profound indeed. Immediately, greed and 
              fear would be vastly diminished; what would we covet in a realm where 
              everything was already our true self? What could we fear but our self? 
              While we would certainly be liberated from much anguish, the even 
              greater result would be the opening of an enormously expanded and 
              enhanced dimension of experience. To verify the truth of the universe 
              proclaimed by the Buddhist masters would be to find ourselves in a realm
               inhabited by an infinite number of beings, all capable, even desirous, 
              of intimate fellowship. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">In meeting Buddha, we meet ourselves as buddha and others as buddha, and we meet great buddhas and small buddhas.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Shobogenzo, Kenbutsu</span>, Gudo Nishijima &amp; Mike Cross</span><br><br>Peace,<br>Ted</p>

              <p>Zen Patriarch Bodhidharma:</p>
              <p><br>With the condition of the eye, forms are seen, With the condition of
               ears, sounds are heard, With the condition of nose, smells are smelled,
               With the condition of tongue, tastes are tasted, every movement or 
              states are all one's Mind.<br><br>Thusness/Passerby's comments:<br><br>Here
               there are 2 important points to take note. First is that Buddha Nature 
              is the transience. Second it is more of 'åº”'. Means with the condition of
               the eye, forms arise. With ears, sound arises.<br><br>Awareness is not 
              like a mirror reflecting but rather a manifestation. Luminosity is an 
              arising luminous manifestation rather than a mirror reflecting. The 
              center here is being replaced with Dependent Origination, the experience
               however is non-dual.<br><br>One must learn how to see Appearances as 
              Awareness and all others as conditions. Example, sound is awareness. The
               person, the stick, the bell, hitting, air, ears...are conditions. One 
              should learn to see in this way. All problems arise because we cannot 
              experience Awareness this way.<br><br>Conventionally we experience in 
              the form of subject and object interaction taking place in a space-time 
              continuum. This is just an assumption. Experientially it is not so. One 
              should learn to experience awareness as the manifestation. There is no 
              subject, there is only and always manifestation, all else are conditions
               of arising. All these are just provisional explanations for one to 
              understand.<br><br>Further comments:<br><br>What's seen is Awareness. 
              What's heard is Awareness. All experiences are non-dual in nature. 
              However this non-dual luminosity cannot be understood apart from the 
              ‘causes and conditions’ of arising. Therefore do not see ‘yin’ as 
              Awareness interacting with external conditions. If you see it as so, 
              then it still falls in the category of mirror-reflecting. Rather see it 
              as an instantaneous manifestation where nothing excluded. As if the 
              universe is giving its very best for this moment to arise. A moment is 
              complete and non-dual. Vividly manifest and thoroughly gone leaving no 
              traces.<br><br><br>Other comments:<br><br>Phrase like “everything arises
               from Emptiness and subsides back to Emptiness” is equally misleading. 
              By doing so, we have made ‘Emptiness’ into a metaphysical essence; 
              similarly not to make the same mistake for “causes and conditions”, not 
              to objectify it into a metaphysical essence. All are provision terms to 
              point to our insubstantial, essence-less and interdependent nature.</p>

              <p>As David Loy stated:</p>
              <p><em>"...the hierarchy that causality constructs must collapse
                                                      into an interpenetration in which each event is equally conditioned
                                                      by the whole and manifests that whole as the only thing in the
                                                      universe.<br> "...we find ourselves in a universe of sunya-events, none of which
                                                      can be said to occur for the sake of any other. Each nondual event
                                                      -- every leaf-flutter, wandering thought, and piece of litter -- is
                                                      whole and complete in itself, because although conditioned by
                                                      everything else in the universe and thus a manifestation of it, for
                                                      precisely that reason it is not subordinated to anything else but
                                                      becomes an unconditioned end-in-itself..."</em></p>
              <p><em>"...the hierarchy that causality constructs must collapse
                                                      into an interpenetration in which each event is equally conditioned
                                                      by the whole and manifests that whole as the only thing in the

              <p> </p>
              <p>I say:</p>
              <p>Dependent origination should not be understood as a mirror-awareness reflecting the external world (as if reflection arise when mirror meets external conditions). In this case there is a hierarchy: the mirror, and the objects of the mirror, and this is duality.</p>
              <p>Rather, dependent origination should be seen as everything coming together, manifesting as JUST this complete manifestation - just the sound, completely inseparable from all conditions, and completely independent of all conditions (no duality or interaction between subject and object) because it is a complete and whole and non-dual manifestation. If this is fully realized, then to call this true self or no-self is equally ok - but if this is not realized, whatever said will be distorted.</p>

              <p>Another analogy:</p>
              <p>We usually think dependent origination works this way:</p>
              <p>My eyes in here, is looking over at that stuff 'out there', and due to this contact, sense perception arises, and this sense perception inside me is dependent on my seeing of something outside. Many people think dependent origination means the interaction of subject and object, inside and outside, as Dogen warned to be the false perception of<strong><em> an inside that depends on an outside, nor an outside blurred by an inside</em></strong></p>
              <p>this is not true!</p>
              <p>There is really only in seeing JUST the sight! There is no inside or outside at all, what is conventionally known to be inside and outside all comes together and manifest as just one complete nondual manifestation. Because of this, seeing is at once independent of a eye-seeing-seen relationship and at the same time completely dependent on eye and object of sight in one single moment of manifestation - that means in seeing JUST the scenery, and the experience of scenery already contains the eye, the scenery, the contact, your mother, your father, the Buddha, the whole universe</p>
              <p>So that experience of sight 'contains' or is completely inseparable from all the conditions - eye, visual object, contact, everything coming together manifesting as a non-dual, complete, whole manifestation which is completely independent of all conditions yet inclusive of all manifestation in this Existence-Time and just this is our true self, the true self inclusive of self and not-self. Not 'THE true self', but one particular instance of true self containing the whole universe... GONE</p>
              <p>The fish swimming in the pacific ocean is the whole pacific ocean swimming the fish, or the whole pacific ocean in the swimming of fish, or a pacific-ocean-swimming-fish... I drink gin, you get drunk</p>

              <p>Just feel gratitude at every moment...</p>
              <p>Your life is sustained by your mother, your father, by the cows,
                      the farmers, by all the living organisms, the grass, the sun, the
                      wind.... the entire universe is sustaining your life!</p>
              <p>There is this practice in Buddhism to feel gratitude for all sentient beings
                      when you eat your meal. Its the same as Christian prayers before meal but in Buddhism, we don't thank god but all the causes and conditions throughout the whole universe supporting this moment of life! In this way, gratitude and compassion
                      grows</p>
              <p>You see, if you believe in God, you only thank God when you eat
                      your meal. But when you know Dependent Origination, you thank the
                      whole universe for your meal!  Just to realize Dependent Origination you start feeling immense gratitude...</p>

              <p>Hi Dharmadhatu,</p>
              <p>There are layers of obscurations preventing the actual dynamics of consciousness from being known.</p>
              <p>Once you come to this stage, you will naturally understood what is it about.</p>
              <p>Currently, the 'I', conventional way of understanding reality, conceptual thoughts, sense of solidity are blocking the experience as described.</p>
              <p>In actuality, everything is happening at-one, in-sync with the entire 'universe'. When you eat, the whole universe vibrates (in the action of eating). This, i believe, is how a Buddha can be omniscent... able to know things that he wants as and when. ..for in actuality everything is interconnected in a holographic way.</p>

              <p>Wow, going have to take a while to fully digest this one, but I'd like to ask two quick questions:</p>
              <p>In The Flatbed Sutra of Louie Wing there was a simile mentioned about ash and firewood:</p>
              <p><em>"Firewood becomes ash; it can never go back to being firewood. Nevertheless, you should not take the view that ash is its future and firewood is its past. Remember that firewood abides in the dharma position of firewood. It has a past and it has a future. Although it has a past and a future, the past and the future are cut off. Ash exists in the dharma position of ash. It has a past and it has a future. The firewood, after becoming ash, does not again become firewood."</em></p>
              <p>This is the same thing, is it?</p>
              <p><span class="l"><em></em></span></p>
              <p>And, this would also explain the diagram the thai monk drew about the arising of the mind right? Not sure where the diagram can be found, but it's the one with overlapping circles being how we see it and "free" circles being the correct view.</p>

              <p>Yes. Genjokoan already summarized Dogen's thought in one short and essential article.</p>
              <p>Do know that the disjoint unsupported is not the same as D.O. realization. The disjoint unsupported is 1st anatta stanza. But with anatta as basis, only then, can D.O. be understood... otherwise it becomes dualistic or understood wrongly.</p>

              <p>There are actually 2 significant events:</p>
              <p>1. In the 1980s when i was a teenager, i sat down to meditate for the first time. I experienced great bliss. In this meditation, i experienced 'no ultimate right or wrong' aka non-judgemental and is soaked in a vast ocean of bliss for a few days. Haha... i thought i was enlightened. On hindsight now, i know that i was not. That is why now when people write about non-dual to meant 'no right/wrong' I know which stage they are at.</p>
              <p>2.  In the 1990s, i join a meditation class that held sessions every Sunday at a Buddhist temple. I was learning one-point meditation. One afternoon when i was meditating at home, all the sensory impressions stopped including thoughts. I was in a state of 'No-thoughts'. One may think that when there are no thoughts, one must be unconscious. No there is no unconsciousness. Instead what was being experienced was pure Presence/awareness. However due to not understanding the nature of consciousness and reality, this awareness was experienced as an Eternal Witness/Observer. This is the pure experience of I AM presence.</p>
