              <p>1. In the 1980s when i was a teenager, i sat down to meditate
              for the first time. I experienced great bliss. In this meditation,
              i experienced 'no ultimate right or wrong' aka non-judgemental and
              is soaked in a vast ocean of bliss for a few days. Haha... i
              thought i was enlightened. On hindsight now, i know that i was not.

              <p>2.  In the 1990s, i join a meditation class that held
              sessions every Sunday at a Buddhist temple. I was learning
              one-point meditation. One afternoon when i was meditating at home,
              all the sensory impressions stopped including thoughts. I was in a
              state of 'No-thoughts'. One may think that when there are no
              thoughts, one must be unconscious. No there is no unconsciousness.
              Instead what was being experienced was pure Presence/awareness.
              However due to not understanding the nature of consciousness and
              reality, this awareness was experienced as an Eternal
              Witness/Observer. This is the pure experience of I AM presence.</p>

              <p>Yes, I do still experience duality. But the times when thinking are not required (like walking and eating), the mind will often automatically goes 'non-dual and non-conceptual'. It is automatic as any willing will be from sense of self.</p>
              <p>I can say that the times when suffering is still experienced, they are all in 'duality' mode. There are still tough karmic constant habits that will take great awareness to resolve.. and will take time. I am also aware that from this stage onwards, the speed of progress is largely dependent on conditions... that is it is dependent on karmic and merit dynamics.</p>

              <p>It depends. I know of people who meditate the entire life and still never reach I AM.</p>
              <p>If you can bypass I AM phase and realise no-self (straight) is the best.. dun need to waste time like i did.</p>
              <p>To help a bit, when you meditate by focusing on the breathe at the tip of the nose, do not think that you are meditating. How do i explain it... dun think that there is a person (you) meditating. Also, just be aware of the breathe.. don't breath deliberately.</p>
              <p>Also, the posture is very important, the spine should not be supported by a wall. A straight spine and neck posture will help. Perhap use a support to lift the buttock above the ground abit so that the buttock position is higher that the cross legs.</p>
              <p>'I AM' will be experienced when the mind is not thinking about the past or the future or is having any kind of dreaming... but is abiding in the Present. Focusing on the breathe is a method to align the mind to the immediate Present moment.</p>
              <p>There can be many ways to experience the I AM presence as long as the method can cut off grasping on the thoughts/content. When mind is detached from thoughts content, the only activities that is left is the automatic breathing action.  </p>
              <p>You can experience I AM while not meditating and with eyes open too. Simply look straight ahead into open space and relax. An open space or field will be more conducive to experiencing it under such condition.</p>

              <p>Some excerpts:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Eternal Watcher- The True Identity<br>In one ‘awakening’ meditation, I came to a state of no thoughts. Such<br>experiences are very hard to describe. This is because the explanation<br>process itself, is within the medium of thoughts and concepts. It is<br>impossible to describe a state of no thoughts using thoughts! Anyway, in<br>the void of no thoughts, one naturally assume that everything must be<br>an unconscious blank. However, that was not the case! What came next<br>was quite a revelation to me. In the void of no thought, I perceived<br>myself to be a Presence... Here's how I will describe myself.<br>"The Presence is all pervasive, yet un-intrusive. He seems to be in all<br>things and observes with utter passiveness. He exists beyond concepts,<br>beliefs and do not need any form. Therefore, I understand him as<br>eternal.<br>He also seems to be the subtler state of myself. I also got the feeling<br>that he existed in all my lifetimes or even more. If I were to name him, I<br>will describe him as The Eternal Watcher.”</p>
              <p>You can say that I was completely blown away by the experience. The<br>‘discovery’ of the Eternal Watcher was a very important event that<br>completely changed the way I understood consciousness. It also made<br>me contemplated very deeply and seriously about the possible existence<br>of the Divine. These spurred me on an ardent search to understand and<br>make sense of it all. I corresponded with whoever I think can help me<br>unlock the mystery. These people included clairvoyants, other<br>meditators, people on spiritual paths and new-agers.<br>From these investigations, it was discovered that others have had similar<br>experiences as well. Based on the consistency and plurality of the<br>descriptions by others, something becomes very certain to me. That is, a<br>human being is much more than a body that can talk and think. The<br>Human Personality, which is our character, is only an outer consciousness<br>of the human. With regard to our identity, our personality is merely the<br>tip of the iceberg. Within the human being’s psyche lie much subtler and<br>often-obscured levels of consciousness. I believe these inner<br>consciousnesses could be the different depths of the Soul or levels of<br>being-ness even more profound than that.</p>
              <p>About the Eternal Watcher, he is ever present. You didn’t see him doesn’t<br>means he is not there. Because the Presence is so close to the mind, it is<br>not easily perceived.<br>Perceiving the Eternal Watcher was achieved through the relaxed<br>observation of my own breath. The ultra-relaxed observation eventually<br>becomes a purely passive allowance for thoughts to pass through my<br>consciousness. This, in turn, led to a gradual shutting down of the mental<br>processes of my physical brain cumulating into a state of ‘no-thoughts’.<br>Beyond the transitional phase of ‘no-thoughts’, I became the Eternal<br>Watcher. Experiencing the Eternal Watcher is not an exercise that I can<br>easily brush off as inconsequential. It is not possible for me to assume<br>that my perception of existence and life can be the same as before.<br>Doing so will be blatantly self-deceiving.<br>To me, the most profound experiences where not from doing<br>something. They came from doing nothing.</p>

              <p>Simpo, </p>
              <p>Have you thought about writing a small booklet or blog or
              website about your experiences from your particular point of
              view... i think you have a unique point of view based on your new
              age and buddhism understanding right? It may be a guide for others
              with similar background.</p>

              <p>It depends. I know of people who meditate the entire life and
              still never reach I AM.</p>
              <p>If you can bypass I AM phase and realise no-self (straight) is
              the best.. dun need to waste time like i did.</p>
              <p>To help a bit, when you meditate by focusing on the breathe at
              the tip of the nose, do not think that you are meditating. How do i
              explain it... dun think that there is a person (you) meditating.
              Also, just be aware of the breathe.. don't breath deliberately.</p>
              <p>Also, the posture is very important, the spine should not be
              supported by a wall. A straight spine and neck posture will help.
              Perhap use a support to lift the buttock above the ground abit so
              that the buttock position is higher that the cross legs.</p>
              <p>'I AM' will be experienced when the mind is not thinking about
              the past or the future or is having any kind of dreaming... but is
              abiding in the Present. Focusing on the breathe is a method to
              align the mind to the immediate Present moment.</p>
              <p>There can be many ways to experience the I AM presence as long
              as the method can cut off grasping on the thoughts/content. When
              mind is detached from thoughts content, the only activities that is
              left is the automatic breathing action.  </p>
              <p>You can experience I AM while not meditating and with eyes open
              too. Simply look straight ahead into open space and relax. An open
              space or field will be more conducive to experiencing it under such
              condition.</p>
              <p>May you experience pure awareness soon !</p>
