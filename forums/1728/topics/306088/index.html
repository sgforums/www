              <p>The above is a Thai monk who rescues abandoned orphans and teaches them Muay Thai.</p>
              <p>This was taken from Sunday Times, 27 January - 7th instalment of New Asian Heroes, an eight-part series on Asians who lead inspiring lives. The article was penned by reporter Mr Wong Kim Hoh in Chiang Rai, Thailand.</p>
              <p>_______________________________________________________</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Excerpts from the article:</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">1. Before he became a monk, Phra Kru Ba Neua Chai, 45, was a lethal muay thai fighter who lost only three fights in a 15 year professional boxing career. He also studied law at Ramkhamkheng University in Bangkok, and was married to a petty trader who bore him two children.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">His son, 21 is a soldier and national boxer. His daughter, 19, also a muay thai exponent, is an undergraduate at an agricultural university in Chiang Rai</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">2. For the last 17 years, the charismatic man has devoted his life to spreading the Dharma. He's turned what was once dry, uninhabited forest land into a conservation with paddocks and pens for scores of Thai horses and magnificent fighting cocks.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It has also become a home for many young boys from various hill tribes who have been orphaned, abandoned or made homeless by ruthless drug guerillas who traffic heroin, opium and methamphetamines in the area, known to the outside world as The Golden Triangle.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">In the monastery, these boys are ordained as novice monks and learn how to read and write. The abbott also teaches them Buddhist scriptures, horse-riding and muay thai.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">3. He smiles when asked if cock fighting is a cruel sport. "They're born warriors. They were born to fight and will fight regardless. "Like these creatures, we all have to fight - for freedom, independence, to be who we want to be. They are the best boxing masters one could have. They have no toolos, you learn a lot just by observing how they move."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">4. Although there were no major upheavals in his life, he was dogged by questions on human suffering. "Maybe it's predestined that I study law so  that I can compare the laws of man and the laws of karma," he says.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">A visit to the university's forensic department made him reflect on his life. "If I had 40 years left, I'd spend 20 years sleeping and another 10 working, eating and socialising. If I'm lucky, I'd live out the rest of my life right. If not, my life would have been a total waste."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">5. At 29, he told his wife of eight years he wanted to get ordained. He left for Chiang Rai, where he sat on a rock in the forest and meditated for 15 days. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">To show he has been reborn to devote his life to the Buddha, several monks spent four days and nights tattooing his body with scripture signifying that he'll never give up his vows.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">He told his wife that he has found peace and detachment from earthly desires, and that both of them should start life anew.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">6. There are now more than 100 horses in the temple. He teaches his novice monks how to care for the animals and in the process, imparts values such as responsibility and loyalty. Yet other devotees offered money to build big temples.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">"Monks have no need for money, we also cannot have debt," he says. He offered them alternatives: "Why not give to build schools so that they can have an education? Why not use it for salaries for teachers to teach these children?"</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">7. His work earned him the backing of the Thai army. It also won the approval of a revered chief monk in Bangkok who encourage him to help the hill tribes. The war between various drug lords has left in its wake a host of problems such as drug addiction, kidnapping and prostitution.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">8. Many of the people who come to see him want to seek peace and happiness. He smiles and say gently: "Everyone wants to look for peace and happiness. Maybe they should first try to achieve some understanding."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">"It's impossible for the whole world to understand one person. Why don't we try to understand the whole world instead, starting with ourselves?"</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">________________________________________________________</span></p>
              <p>I wonder if we can protect the dharma like him.</p>

              Why protect the Dharma?
              How many per cent of living beings is interested in the Dharma?
              What is true Dharma? ( there are many corrupt Dharma)eg.those advertise in newspaper,fo kuang hung,etc.
              It is also very very diffcult to meet the Dharma,especially now,the power of money.(blind in the eyes by many)
              You need fate,good merit,good karma to meet the Dharma.It is a very personal thing.If deep inside you,you really need it badly,you will go searching for it.
              If not,when it appears infront of you,you are not interested and take it for nothing.
              Dharma is a way,a method,a map to show you out of suffering.

              Dont worry.With this photo very soon people will start praying to it.Seeking for fortune,wealth,safety,etc.Maybe already in one of the shop at Fu Lu Shou.
              Look at Thai Buddhism,how many per cent is correct Buddhism.They are very good at Buddha amulet.

              <p>Do good and refrain from evil , that is still the core teachings.The money from amulets sales n donations hav got on to build schools ,roads ,bridges,temples...that is definitely good n it gives layman a chance to give.</p>
              <p>The teachings is there for those who r ready to learn,different people take to different teachings.Only when people come in contact with Buddhism (even if it may be to pray for things at first) will they hav the chance to understand what its all about.Even if they dun attain englightenment in this lifetime but at least the seeds are planted.</p>

              <p>Yeah I must say quite a lot of corruption of dharma exist in Thai Buddhism, as well as others Buddhisms.</p>
              <p>Though, their Thai Forest Tradition is quite good...</p>
              <p>p.s. though we do not know about this Thai monk, it is best not to comment. How do you know of his practices?</p>

              <p>Many people say 'do good, avoid evil' is Buddhism. But if you <span>è¯¸æ�¶èŽ«å�š,ä¼—å–„å¥‰è¡Œ (avoid all evil, do all good) but

                                          different from other religions.</span></p>
              <p><span class="MsgBodyText"><br>Please note that Not every religion/teaching that teaches "Do good, avoid evil" is considered
                      Buddhism. In Buddhism other than "do good, avoid evil", what is
                      essential is "purify our mind". <br> <br> Do good, avoid evil, is merely prevent bad karma and make good karma,
                      the highest is rebirth in heaven, but not liberation nor enlightenment.</span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Of course not people are like that though. Atheism is not that popular, and it does not have those amulets or protective stuff, so there is little chance of money making. welcome to atheism.</p>

              <p>Just because a chestbox is full of dust and dirt on the outside, doesn't mean it didnt have any real gold to offer inside.</p>
              <p>So my suggestion is, do not judge a book by it's cover. It can be misleading. (i.e. corruptions of Buddhism that only happens in certain places but NOT all, giving false appearances) </p>
              <p>Learn the Buddhist teachings and see yourself.</p>

              <p>This world always has bad people and those people who claimed themselves to be buddhist yet doing unwholesome deeds, if because of that we stop spreading dharma, then we can only spread dharma in pureland already, which is very wrong.</p>
              <p>As for if we can protect the dharma like him, protecting the dharma is the responsibilities of all buddhist, bu it is not practical for everyone to do the same way as him as we all have different karmic affinity. We should based on our own unique situation to apply our wisdom and compassion into action. Some people good in talking, whereby some very are more creative, resourceful, wider network. We should cherish our current moment and make good use of it.</p>

              <p>Hmm, I see your point. The purpose of my post is not to tell people to follow EXACTLY what this monk has been doing. Like you have said, we all have different karmic affinity and we should consider our own unique situation first with wisdom and compassion before taking any concrete action.</p>
              <p>The main point of this post is to consider the good point or deeds of others, to develop the right intentions for any good deed. Whether to follow or how to follow is really up to the individual and the unique circumstances at a particular point of time.</p>
