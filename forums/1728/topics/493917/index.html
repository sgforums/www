              tricycle</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">A
              new vision and scale of values are necessary measures for safeguarding our
              world.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It’s
              hardly a secret that human recklessness is reaching a critical mass,
              threatening not only our collective sanity but even our long-term survival.
              Ever more powerful and impersonal weaponry, endless warfare, super-quick
              changes in technology, a volatile global economy, the widening gap between the
              ultrarich and everyone else, climate disasters, species extinction, and
              ecological devastation: these crises are escalating out of control, and even
              what was once the most idyllic South Pacific island offers no escape. We’ve got
              to find ways to put our house in order, and we’ve got to do so fast; otherwise
              the rapid descent of our civilization towards collapse seems unavoidable. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              critical problems that loom over us—economic, political, and ecological—can be
              dealt with in either of two ways. One is the symptomatic approach favored by
              policy wonks and conventional liberal politicians, who view each problem as
              distinct and propose tackling them through more finely tuned policies. The
              other approach is holistic. It looks at these problems as interwoven and
              mutually reinforcing, seeing them as objectifications of our subjective
              propensities mirroring back to us the distorted ways we relate to ourselves,
              other people, and the natural world. From this angle, any effective solution
              requires that we make fundamental changes in ourselves—in our views, attitudes,
              and intentions. These can then ripple out, coalesce, and inspire transformative
              action.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I
              suggest that it is the task of religion—understood broadly as comprising forms
              of spirituality that don’t necessarily constitute an organized faith—to offer
              us guidance in making those redemptive changes. In trying to implement them we
              can expect to meet hardened resistance both from mainstream culture and our own
              entrenched habits. To understand the necessity of change, we must consider not
              only our short-term personal advantage but also the long-range impact our
              choices have on others we will never know or see: on people living in remote
              lands, on generations as yet unborn, and on the other species that share our
              planet.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">What
              is required of us is to adopt a panoramic ethical point of view that takes us
              far beyond the bounds of mere expediency. By connecting us to the deepest
              sources of ethics, religious consciousness can play a pivotal role in promoting
              the inner transformations needed to ward off collapse. But for religion to
              guide us through the approaching storms, the scope of religious consciousness
              must itself be extended and deepened. We have to draw out from classical
              spiritual teachings fresh implications and applications seen against the
              cultural and intellectual horizons of our time.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I
              have found that by balancing fidelity to tradition with relevance to the
              present, the classical teachings of Buddhism can be newly formulated to meet
              the challenges of the historical moment. Classical Buddhism at its core is a
              path of personal liberation, but its rich array of principles and practices
              offer powerful tools for accelerating the type of inner growth that can promote
              outer transformation. Specifically, Buddhism offers us two complementary
              perspectives that can guide us in our engagement with the world. One pertains
              to our way of understanding ourselves, the other to our relationship with other
              living beings. These two perspectives are, respectively, the wisdom of
              selflessness and universal compassion. Though distinct, the two are closely
              bound, and in their unity they provide a potent antidote to our current perilous
              drift.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              wisdom of selflessness, according to the Buddha’s teaching, is the necessary
              remedy for the false sense of personal identity that normally hovers in the
              background of our minds. This misplaced sense of personal identity has harmful ramifications
              on at least three fronts: in relation to material things, in relation to
              ourselves, and in relation to other people. In relation to things, it gives
              rise to inordinate greed and acquisitiveness. In relation to ourselves, it
              leads to attempts to enhance our self-image by acquiring wealth and status. In
              relation to other people, it engenders envy, competitiveness, and lust for
              power.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              Buddha says that these compulsions, the causes of our suffering, originate
              because we implicitly take ourselves to possess a truly existent self. The
              wisdom of selflessness is designed to dispel the delusion of self and thereby
              free us from suffering. To develop this wisdom, we closely examine the factors
              around which the idea of self congeals, the “five aggregates” of bodily form,
              feeling, perception, volitional activities, and consciousness. By mindfully
              attending to them, we see that all the aggregates—the factors of our being—are
              impermanent, composite, and ever changing. Each lacks the persistency essential
              to selfhood and thus turns out to be selfless. Insight into the selfless nature
              of the five aggregates breaks the bondage of craving, enabling us to realize
              transcendent liberation, nirvana.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">While
              classical Buddhism proposes insight into the selfless nature of personal
              identity as the key to liberation, this same insight can be given an extended
              application to purge us of the greed, lust for domination, and complacency
              responsible for our current predicament. To extend the wisdom of selflessness,
              we shift its focus from an analysis of the composite nature of personal
              identity to an exploration of the wide web of conditionality. If things lack
              substantial existence because they are impermanent and composite, they also
              lack substantial existence because they arise and persist in dependence on an
              intricate network of conditions. Insight into the interdependency of phenomena
              reveals that the very being of things is a system of relations. Things exist
              not as self-sufficient entities but as temporary nodules in a fluid current of
              energies.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Reflection
              on conditionality begins with oneself. We consider how our own body is
              constituted of the food we eat, which depends on soil, water, and sunshine; on
              the labor of those who grow the food and the transport that brings it to
              market. Our body depends on air, water, and heat. We wear clothes made from
              cotton and wool and synthetics. The cotton depends on cotton fields, and on
              those who work the fields, and those who weave it into threads and turn the
              threads into fabric and the fabric into clothes. Our own bodies are the end
              product of an evolutionary chain that goes back to the Big Bang, to the stars,
              galaxies, and stardust. This body encapsulates every stage in the long march of
              evolution, from the first cells that appeared billions of years ago in the
              ancient oceans. Every organ, tissue, and cell records in its DNA the entire
              history of life. Our culture is the end product of human civilization, from the
              first groups of hunter-gatherers to the first settled agrarian communities to
              the mighty empires of the ancient world, all the way up through the science,
              art, and technology of the 21st century. All the inhabitants of this planet are
              intertwined, from corporate CEOs in the skyscrapers of Manhattan to factory
              workers in China to farmers in Iowa to meatpackers in Wisconsin to the techno-
              wizards of Bangalore to the armed kids in the Congo to the indigenous peoples
              of Brazil and Borneo.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">From
              the human realm we can move outward in widening circles until our insight
              encompasses all forms of sentient and nonsentient life. Seeing how all living
              beings are bound together in the most intricate symbiotic relationships, we
              respect all forms of life. Seeing how all living beings are engaged in a
              continuous exchange of materials with their surroundings, we regard the
              environment as sacrosanct—precious for its instrumental value, as the sphere in
              which life unfolds, and precious for its intrinsic value, as a domain of
              mysterious intelligence, beauty, and wonder.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">This
              is not abstract theory but the groundwork for a transformative discipline. To
              see into the interconnectedness of all living things is to see how all living
              things are part of a unified field that contains all, and at the same time to
              see that this entire field is embodied by each being, constituted of its cells,
              organs, nervous system, and consciousness. Correct cognition entails
              appropriate action. It issues in an ethic that bids us consider the long-term
              effects our deeds exert on other people, on all beings endowed with sentience,
              and on the entire biosphere.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              minimal terms, this means that we cannot tolerate behavior that endangers vast
              sections of the world’s population. We cannot use the earth’s resources in ways
              that result in the mass extinction of species, with unpredictable results. We
              cannot spend billions on the fratricidal activity of war, while a billion
              people suffer from hunger, sleep on the streets, and die from easily curable
              illnesses. We cannot burn fuels that irreversibly alter the climate, or
              discharge toxic substances into our water and air, without initiating chain
              reactions that will eventually poison ourselves.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">For
              the spiritual life to unleash its full potential as a fountainhead of grace and
              blessings, the wisdom of selflessness on its own is not sufficient. Wisdom has
              to be joined with another force that can galvanize the will to act. The force
              needed to empower wisdom is compassion. Both wisdom and compassion shift our
              sense of identity away from ourselves toward the wider human, biotic, and
              cosmic community to which we belong. But where wisdom involves a cognitive
              grasp of this fact, compassion operates viscerally.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              systematic development of compassion begins with the cultivation of
              lovingkindness. Lovingkindness is said to be the basis for compassion because,
              in order to sympathize with those in pain, we first must empathize with them
              and desire their welfare. The feeling of love for beings—ourselves
              included—makes us care about their happiness and well-being. Then, when they
              meet suffering, our hearts are stirred and we reach out to help them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Compassion
              evolves from lovingkindness by narrowing the focus from beings in a generic
              sense to those afflicted by suffering. To develop compassion systematically,
              one brings to mind people in pain and distress, generating the wish “May they
              be free from suffering.” Perhaps the most suitable type of people with which to
              begin the practice are children. They should be real people, not imaginary, and
              one should choose specific individuals. If you don’t personally know such
              children, choose a few you may have read about in the news: the girl in Sri
              Lanka who lost her parents in the 2004 tsunami; the boy in the Congo forced to
              fight in armed conflict; the young woman in Cambodia sold into the sex trade;
              the neighbor’s son who is beset by an incurable illness. Feel each child as
              your own, and inwardly share their plight.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">To
              expand the feeling of compassion, we next bring to mind a few mature people
              undergoing different forms of suffering. Again, these can be people one knows
              personally or has read about in the news. But we should avoid individuals whose
              misfortune will arouse indignation and those whose suffering is likely to cause
              worry and dejection. Having selected four or five people, we identify deeply
              with each, sincerely wishing that they be free from suffering. We repeat this
              process again and again, taking each person in turn, until compassion
              spontaneously swells up in our hearts. Then, in graded steps, we extend
              compassion over the whole earth and finally to afflicted beings in all realms
              of existence.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Traditional
              Buddhism describes boundless love and compassion as liberations of the heart
              (Pali, cetovimutti) that free us from ill will, cruelty, and indifference. They
              are called divine dwellings (brahmaviharas) because those who practice them
              radiate holy wishes for the welfare, happiness, and security of all beings.
              Given, however, the gravity of the crisis that confronts us today, it is
              questionable whether the merely inward cultivation of such virtues is sufficient.
              If love and compassion don’t find expression in concrete action, they could
              remain purely subjective states, lofty and sublime but inert, unable to exert
              any beneficial influence on others. While able to lift us to the heights, they
              might bind us there, limiting our ability to descend and pour out their
              blessing power into the troubled, anxious world in which we live. In my
              understanding, the crisis of our age requires that wisdom and compassion
              jointly acquire an immanent, transformative function that can give a new
              direction to our collective life. The key to this transformation is what I call
              “conscientious compassion.” This is a compassion that does not confine itself
              to passively wishing good for others but courageously takes the steps necessary
              to help them: to remove their suffering and bring them real happiness. This is
              a compassion informed by the voice of conscience, which continually reminds us
              that too many of our fellow beings, human and animal alike, are unjustly
              condemned to lives of misery. Conscientious compassion boldly enters the fray
              of action, not afraid to engage with politics, economics, and programs of
              social uplift. It tells us that we need to treat people as ends rather than as
              means, ensuring that they are protected against exploitation and injustice. It
              is at once a compassion that acts and a sense of conscience that remains ever
              open to the pain of the world.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              spur to conscientious compassion is</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial",sans-serif;'>ï¿¼</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"> a keen
              recognition of our own responsibility for transfiguring life on earth. When we
              feel, deep inside, that others are not essentially different from us, our lives
              will undergo a sea change. Convinced that we can make a difference, we will
              actually exert ourselves to make that difference. We will then live, not for
              our narrow ends rooted in egocentric grasping, but for the welfare and
              happiness of the whole. While pursuing the transcendent good, we won’t neglect
              the ethical and cosmic good. Inspired by a wide and profound vision of our
              ultimate potential, we will work unflinchingly within this conditioned realm to
              build a global community committed to social justice, pledged to peace, and
              respectful of other forms of sentient life.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">To
              shift gears from contemplative compassion to conscientious compassion, we have
              to find a personal calling, a task that enables us to change the world for the
              better. Each of us has some task, some way to practice conscientious
              compassion. The question is: How do we find that task? To find it, a specific
              method can be prescribed (for which I am indebted to my friend Andrew Harvey).
              At the outset, practice the usual meditation on compassion, perhaps for 20 or
              30 minutes. Then focus your attention on several of the formidable problems
              that loom before humanity today: futile and self-destructive wars, rampant
              military spending, global warming, violations of human rights, poverty and
              global hunger, the exploitation of women, our treatment of animals, the abuse
              of the environment, or any other concern that comes to mind. Reflect briefly on
              these problems, one by one, aware of how you respond to them. You can repeat
              this procedure for several days, even daily for a week. At some point, you will
              start to recognize that one of these problems, more than the others, tugs at
              the strings of your heart. These inner pangs suggest that this is the
              particular issue to which you should dedicate your time and energy.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">But
              don’t be hasty in drawing this conclusion. Rather, continue to explore the
              issue cautiously and carefully, asking yourself: “Does this issue break my
              heart open and cause a downpour of compassion? Does this urge gnaw at my vital
              organs? Does it point the finger to the door and tell me to do something?” If
              your answer to these questions is “Yes,” that is your vocation, that is your
              sacred calling, that’s where you should put conscientious compassion into
              action. This doesn’t mean you neglect other issues. You remain open and
              responsive to other concerns, but you focus on the issue that tugs at your
              heart and bids you to act.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">This
              enlargement of mission, I believe, may well mark the next decisive step in the
              evolution of Buddhism and of human spirituality in its wider dimensions. I see
              this as a shared endeavor that transcends specific faiths and provides a broad
              canopy under which different religions and spiritual movements (including
              secular humanism) can gather in harmony. In my thinking, for human spirituality
              to evolve to the next level it must resolve the sharp dualisms that prevail in
              older spiritual traditions: between worldly life and world-transcendence, outer
              activity and inner peace, cosmos and eternity, creation and God. Instead of
              devaluing one in favor of the other, the progression to a more complete stage
              of spirituality—one corresponding to our present understanding of life and the
              universe—calls for integration rather than separation. Our need is to embody
              the realization of enlightened truth securely within the horizons of humanity’s
              historical and cosmic adventure. Our mission is to enact enlightened truth in a
              way that contributes to the human and universal good.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              making such a statement, I am aware that I am going beyond the boundary posts
              of traditional Buddhist doctrine, whether Theravada or Mahayana. However, I
              believe that any religion, including Buddhism, best preserves its vitality through
              an organic process of growth, and I don’t see such growth as necessarily
              entailing a fall from a primal state of perfection. While remaining faithful to
              its seminal intuitions, a spiritual tradition can absorb, digest, and
              assimilate new insights supplied by its intellectual and cultural milieu and by
              the advancing edge of knowledge. These influences can draw forth potentials
              implicit in the older teaching that could not emerge until the appropriate
              cultural transformations evoked them and allowed them to flower.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              a world torn by violence, oppressed too long by projects aimed at domination, I
              believe that a conscientious compassion guided by wisdom is the most urgent
              need of the hour. In adopting this integral approach to spirituality, however,
              I see our task as involving more than merely avoiding environmental
              devastation, providing others with enough food to eat, and paving the way to
              respect for human rights. In my understanding, our larger task is to give birth
              to a new vision and scale of values that replaces division with integration,
              exploitation with cooperation, and domination with mutually respectful
              partnership. The overcoming of clinging through the wisdom of selflessness, the
              development of empathic love, and the expression of both in conscientious
              compassion have today become imperatives. They are no longer mere spiritual
              options, but necessary measures for safeguarding the world and for allowing
              humankind’s finest potentials to flourish.</span></p>
