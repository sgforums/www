              </p><p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';">EMPTINESS <br> Unborn emptiness has let go ofthe extremes ofbeing and non-being. Thus it is 
                both the center itself and the central path. Emptiness is the track on which 
                the centered person moves.<br> -Tsongkhapa<br> PICK UP A ballpoint pen. Take off the cap and ask: "Is this still a ballpoint 
                pen?" Yes, of course-albeit one without a cap. Unscrew the top part of 
                the casing, remove the ink refill, and screw the top on again. Is that a ballpoint 
                pen? Well, yes, just about. Is the refill a ballpoint pen? No, it's just the 
                refill-but at least it can function as a pen, unlike the empty casing. Take 
                the two halves of the casing apart. Is either of them a ballpoint pen? No, definitely 
                not. No way. <br> What happens to the thing as you dismantle it? When do the components cease 
                (or start) to become a pen? When does the banana you are eating stop being a 
                banana? When does the lump of clay on the wheel start being a pot? Names and 
                concepts suggest there are objects in the world every bit as definite as themselves. 
                Pens, bananas, and pots are self-evident, instantly recognizable things. But 
                subject them to a little scrutiny, and that certainty begins to waver. Things 
                are not as clear-cut as they seem. They are neither circumscribed nor separated 
                from each other by' lines. Lines are drawn in the mind. There are no lines in 
                nature.<br> Sit on a chair, close your eyes, and listen attentively to the rain falling 
                outside. Where does the sound of the rain stop and your hearing of it begin? 
                Where, for that matter, does your bottom end and the seat of the chair begin? 
                While conceptually the sound of rain is as different from my hearing as my bottom 
                is from the chair, experientially it is impossible to distinguish between them. 
                Rainfall blurs into hearing; bottom blurs into chair.<br> Consider the bulb of a daffodil buried in the ground all winter. As the weather 
                gets warmer, it begins to sprout. If it rains sufficiently, there is no frost, 
                and no one treads on it, one morning you will exclaim: ~LookI. The daffodils 
                are out." But did the sprout suddenly cease to be a sprout and in its place 
                a daffodil appear? The same problem: while a sprout is no more a daffodil than 
                a daffodil is a sprout, somehow the sprout becomes a daffodil. The dividing 
                line between sprout and daffodil is a convenient conceptual and linguistic distinction 
                that cannot be found in nature.<br> In this sense, ballpoint pens, bananas, pots, rainfall, hearmg, chairs, bottoms, 
                sprouts, and daffodils have no beginning and no end. They neither start nor 
                do they stop. They neither are born nor do they die They emerge from a matrix 
                of conditions and ~n turn become part of another matrix of conditions from which 
                something else emerges.<br> IN EVERYDAY EXPERIENCE, one thing leads to the next. I become irritated by something 
                S said to me and end up wanting to hit him. I imagine I see a snake in the pottery 
                shed and freeze in terror. Everything that happens emerges out of what preceded 
                it. Everything we do now becomes a condition for what is possible later.<br> We may speak of conditions and consequences as though they were things, but 
                if we look more closely they turn out to be processes with no independent reality. 
                The harshness of a barbed remark that haunts us for days is no more than a brief 
                instance isolated from a torrent of events. Yet it stands out in the mind's 
                eye as something intrinsically real and apart. This habit of isolating things 
                leads us to inhabit a world in which the gaps between them become absolute. 
                The snake in the shed is really there, as sharply differentiated from the frightened 
                person who beholds it as from the shards of discarded pottery on which it is 
                coiled.<br> Clutching at ourselves and the world in this way is a precondition for anguish. 
                By regarding things as absolutely separate and as desirable or fearful in themselves, 
                we set ourselves the task of possessing something we can never have or of eradicating 
                something that was never there in the first place. Noticing how things emerge 
                from and fade back into an unbroken flow of conditions begins to free us a little. 
                We recognize how things are relatively, not absolutely, desirable or fearful. 
                They interconnect and interact, each contingent on the others, no one of them 
                intrinsically separate from the rest.<br> Whatever emerges in this way is devoid of an intrinsic identity: in other words, 
                things are empty. They are not as opaque and solid as they seem: they are transparent 
                and fluid. They are not as singular and straightforward as they seem: they are 
                complex and ambiguous. They are not only defined by Philosophy, science, and 
                religion: they are evoked through the play of allusions, paradoxes, and jokes. 
                They cannot be pinned down with certainty: they trigger Perplexity, amaze~ ment, 
                and doubt.<br> THE SAME IS true for each one ofus. Just as a potter fornis a pot on the wheel, 
                so I configure my Personality from the spinning clay of my existence. The pot 
                does not exist in its own right: it emerges from the interactions of the potter, 
                the wheel, the clay, its shape, its function (each of which in turn emerges 
                from the interactions of its causes and components ad infinitum). There is no 
                essential pot to which its attributes adhere~just as there is no essential daffodil 
                to which stalk, leaves, petals, and stamen adhere. Pots and daffodils are configurati0~5 
                of causes, conditions, parts, functions, language, images. They are devoid of 
                an identity stamped like a serial number in the core of their being.<br> And so is each of us. As a human being I am more complex than a pot or a daffodil, 
                but I have also emerged from causes and am composed of diverse, changing features 
                and traits. There is no essential me that exists apart from this unique configurati0~ 
                of biological and cultural processes. Even if intellectually I agree with this, 
                intuitively it may not be how I feel about myself In any event, dharma practice 
                is concerned not with proving or disproving theories of self but with understanding 
                and easing the grip of self~centeredness that constricts body, feelings, and 
                emotions into a tight nugget of anguish.<br> Imagine you are at a crowded exhibition of Ming porcelain. A voice calls out: 
                "Hey Thief. StO~!" Everyone in the room turns to look at you. Although 
                you haven't stolen anything, the glare of accusation and disapproval provokes 
                intense self-consciousness. You stand as exposed as though you were naked. You 
                or rather the tight nugget of anguish-blurts out: "It wasn't me! Honest."<br> It is as though this self-which is a mere configuration of past and present 
                contingencies-has been fired in the kiln of anxiety to emerge as something fixed. 
                Fixed but also brittle. The more precious it becomes to me, the more I must 
                guard it against attack. The circumstances in which I feel at ease become ever 
                narrower and more circumscribed.<br> SELF-CONCIOUSNESS IS AT once the most obvious and central fact ofmy life and 
                the most elusive. If I search for my self in meditation, I find it is like trying 
                to catch my own shadow. I reach for it, but there's nothing there. Then it reappears 
                elsewhere. I glimpse it from the corner of my mind's eye, turn to face it, and 
                it's gone. Each time I think I've pinned it down, it turns out to be something 
                else: a bodily sensation, a mood, a perception, an impulse, or simply aware-ness 
                itself.<br> I cannot find the self by pointing my finger at any physical or mental trait 
                and saying: "Yes, that's me." For such traits come and go, whereas 
                the sense of "I" remains constant. But neither can I put my finger 
                on something other than these traits that-however ephemeral and contingent they 
                may be-nonetheless define me.<br> The self may not be something, but neither is it nothing. It is simply ungraspable, 
                unfindable. I am who I am not because of an essential self hidden away in the 
                core of my being but because of the unprecedented and unrepeatable matrix of 
                conditions that have formed me. The more I delve into this mystery of who I 
                am (or what anything is), the more I just keep going. There is no end to it, 
                only an infinite trajectory that avoids falling into the extremes of being and 
                nonbeing.<br> This trajectory is not only the center, which is free from this duality, but 
                the central path itself.<br> "EMPTINESS" SAID THE Tibetan philosopher Tsongkhapa, in 1397, ~is 
                the track on which the centered person moves." The word he uses for track 
                is shul. This term is defined as "an impression": a mark that remains 
                after that which made it has passed by-a footprint, for example. In other contexts, 
                shul is used to describe the scarred hollow in the ground where a house OflCE 
                stood, the channel worn through rock where a river runs in flood, the indentation 
                in the grass where an animal slept last night. All these are shul: the impression 
                of something that used to be there.<br> A path is a shul because it is an impression in the ground left by' the regular 
                tread of feet, which has kept it clear of obstructions and maintained it for 
                the use ofothers. As ashul, emptiness can be compared to the impression of something 
                that used to be there. In this case, such an impression is formed by the indentations, 
                hollows, marks, and scars left by the turbulence of selfish craving. When the 
                turmoil subsides, we experience tranquillity, relief, and freedom.<br> To know emptiness is not just to understand the concept. It is more like stumbling 
                into a clearing in the forest, where suddenly' you can move freely and see clearly. 
                To experience emptiness is to experience the shocking absence of what normally 
                determines the sense of who you are and the kind of reality you inhabit. It 
                may last only a moment before the habits of a lifetime reassert themselves and 
                close in once more. But for that moment, we witness ourselves and the world 
                as open and vulnerable.<br> This calm, free, open, and sensitive space is the very center of dharma practice. 
                It is immediate, imminent, and dynamic. It is a path, a track. It grants an 
                intimation of the invisible point to which the ~ines of our life converge. It 
                allows unob; structed movement. And it assures us that we are not alone: it 
                1inplies indebtedness to those who have trodden this path before and responsibility 
                to those who will follow.<br> "EMPTINESS" IS A confusing term. Although used as an abstract noun, 
                it does not in any way denote an abstract thing or state. ~t is not something 
                we "realize" in a moment of mystical insight that "breaks through" 
                to a transcendent reabty concealed behind yet mysteriously underpinning the 
                empirical world. Nor do things "arise" from emptiness and "dissolve" 
                back into it as though it were some kind of form-less, cosmic stuff. These are 
                just some of the ways emptiness has been appropriated as a metaphor of metaphysical 
                and tdigious consolation.<br> '.Emptiness" is a starkly unappetizing term used to undercut yearnings 
                for such consolation. Yet ironically it has been called into the service of 
                such longings. shunyata (emptiness) is rendered into English as "the Void" 
                by translators who overlook the fact that the term is neither prefixed by a 
                definite article ("the") nor exalted with a capital ~etter, both of 
                which are absent in classical Asian languages. From here it is only a hop, skip, 
                and a jump to equating emptiness ~itb such metaphysical notions as "the 
                Absolute," '~the Truth," or even "God." The notion of emptiness 
                falls prey to the very habit of mind it was intended to undermine.<br> EMPTINESS IS AS devoid of intrinsic being as a pot, a banana, or a daffodil. 
                And if there Were DO pots, bananas, or daffodils, there would be no emptiness 
                either. Emptiness does not deny that such things exist; it merely describes 
                how they are devoid of an intrinsic, separate being. Emptiness is not apart 
                from the world of everyday experience; it only makes sense in the context of 
                making pots, eating bananas, and growing daffodils. A life centered in awareness 
                of empti ness is simply an appropriate way of being in this changing, shocking, 
                painful, joyous, frustrating, awesome, stubborn, and ambiguous reality. Emptiness 
                is the central path that leads not beyond this reaTity but right into its heart. 
                It is the track on which the centered person moves.<br> And we too are impressions left by something that used to be here. We have been 
                created, molded, formed by a bewildering matrix of contingencies that have preceded 
                us. From the patterning of the DNA derived from our parents to the firing of 
                the hundred bilTion neurons in our brains to the cultural and historical conditioning 
                of the twentieth century to the education and upbringing given us to all the 
                experiences we have ever had and choices we have ever made: these have conspired 
                to configure the unique trajectory that culminates in this present moment. What 
                is here now is the unrepeatable impression left by all of this, which we call 
                '~me." Yet so vivid and startling is this image that we confuse what is 
                a mere impression for something that exists independently of what formed it.<br> So what are we but the story we keep repeating, editing, censoring, and embellishing 
                in our heads? The self is not like the hero of a B-movie, who remains unaffected 
                by the storms of passion and intrigue that swirl around him from the opening 
                credits to the end. The self is more akin to the complex and ambiguous characters 
                who emerge, develop, and suffer across the pages of a novel. There is nothing 
                thinglike about me at all. I am more like an unfolding narrative.<br> As we become aware of all this, we can begin to assume greater responsibility 
                for the course of our lives. Instead of clinging to habitual behavior and. routines 
                as a means to secure this sense of s~f, we realize the freedom to create who 
                we are. Instead of being bewitched by impressions, we start to create them. 
                Instead of taking ourselves so seriously, we discover the playful irony of a 
                story that has never been told in quite this way before.</span></p>
