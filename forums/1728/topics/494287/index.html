              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Jun.16.2017 Corey S. Powell
                                  MACH</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Some
                                  of the world's most renowned scientists are questioning whether the cosmos has
                                  an inner life similar to our own.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">For
                                  centuries, modern science has been shrinking the gap between humans and the
                                  rest of the universe, from Isaac Newton showing that one set of laws applies
                                  equally to falling apples and orbiting moons to Carl Sagan intoning that “we
                                  are made of star stuff” — that the atoms of our bodies were literally forged in
                                  the nuclear furnaces of other stars.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Even
                                  in that context, Gregory Matloff’s ideas are shocking. The veteran physicist at
                                  New York City College of Technology recently published a paper arguing that
                                  humans may be like the rest of the universe in substance and in spirit. A
                                  “proto-consciousness field” could extend through all of space, he argues. Stars
                                  may be thinking entities that deliberately control their paths. Put more
                                  bluntly, the entire cosmos may be self-aware.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
                                  notion of a conscious universe sounds more like the stuff of late night TV than
                                  academic journals. Called by its formal academic name, though, “panpsychism”
                                  turns out to have prominent supporters in a variety of fields. New York
                                  University philosopher and cognitive scientist David Chalmers is a proponent.
                                  So too, in different ways, are neuroscientist Christof Koch of the Allen
                                  Institute for Brain Science, and British physicist Sir Roger Penrose, renowned
                                  for his work on gravity and black holes. The bottom line, Matloff argues, is
                                  that panpsychism is too important to ignore.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“It’s
                                  all very speculative, but it’s something we can check and either validate or
                                  falsify,” he says.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Three
                                  decades ago, Penrose introduced a key element of panpsychism with his theory
                                  that consciousness is rooted in the statistical rules of quantum physics as
                                  they apply in the microscopic spaces between neurons in the brain.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
                                  2006, German physicist Bernard Haisch, known both for his studies of active
                                  stars and his openness to unorthodox science, took Penrose’s idea a big step
                                  further. Haisch proposed that the quantum fields that permeate all of empty
                                  space (the so-called "quantum vacuum") produce and transmit
                                  consciousness, which then emerges in any sufficiently complex system with
                                  energy flowing through it. And not just a brain, but potentially any physical
                                  structure. Intrigued, Matloff wondered if there was a way to take these squishy
                                  arguments and put them to an observational test.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">One
                                  of the hallmarks of life is its ability to adjust its behavior in response to
                                  stimulus. Matloff began searching for astronomical objects that unexpectedly
                                  exhibit this behavior. Recently, he zeroed in on a little-studied anomaly in
                                  stellar motion known as Paranego’s Discontinuity. On average, cooler stars
                                  orbit our galaxy more quickly than do hotter ones. Most astronomers attribute
                                  the effect to interactions between stars and gas clouds throughout the galaxy.
                                  Matloff considered a different explanation. He noted that the anomaly appears
                                  in stars that are cool enough to have molecules in their atmospheres, which
                                  greatly increases their chemical complexity.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Matloff
                                  noted further that some stars appear to emit jets that point in only one
                                  direction, an unbalanced process that could cause a star to alter its motion.
                                  He wondered: Could this actually be a willful process? Is there any way to
                                  tell?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">If
                                  Paranego’s Discontinuity is caused by specific conditions within the galaxy, it
                                  should vary from location to location. But if it is something intrinsic to the
                                  stars — as consciousness would be — it should be the same everywhere. Data from
                                  existing stellar catalogs seems to support the latter view, Matloff claims.
                                  Detailed results from the Gaia star-mapping space telescope, due in 2018, will
                                  provide a more stringent test.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Matloff
                                  is under no illusion that his colleagues will be convinced, but he remains
                                  upbeat: “Shouldn’t we at least be checking? Maybe we can move panpsychism from
                                  philosophy to observational astrophysics.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">"In
                                  principle, some purely physical systems that are not biological or organic may
                                  also be conscious.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Mind Out of Matter</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">While
                                  Matloff looks out to the stars to verify panpsychism, Christof Koch looks at
                                  humans. In his view, the existence of widespread, ubiquitous consciousness is
                                  strongly tied to scientists’ current understanding of the neurological origins
                                  of the mind.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“The
                                  only dominant theory we have of consciousness says that it is associated with
                                  complexity — with a system’s ability to act upon its own state and determine
                                  its own fate,” Koch says. “Theory states that it could go down to very simple
                                  systems. In principle, some purely physical systems that are not biological or
                                  organic may also be conscious.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Koch
                                  is inspired by integrated information theory, a hot topic among modern
                                  neuroscientists, which holds that consciousness is defined by the ability of a
                                  system to be influenced by its previous state and to influence its next state.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
                                  human brain is just an extreme example of that process, Koch explains: “We are
                                  more complex, we have more self-awareness — well, some of us do — but other
                                  systems have awareness, too. We may share this property of experience, and that
                                  is what consciousness is: the ability to experience anything, from the most
                                  mundane to the most refined religious experience.”</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Like
                                  Matloff, Koch and his colleagues are actively engaged in experimental tests of
                                  these ideas. One approach is to study brain-impaired patients to see if their
                                  information responses align with biological measures of their consciousness.
                                  Another approach, further off, is to wire the brains of two mice together and
                                  see how the integrated consciousness of the animals changes as the amount of
                                  information flowing between them is increased. At some point, according to
                                  integrated information theory, the two should merge into a single, larger
                                  information system. Eventually, it should be possible to run such experiments
                                  with humans, wiring their brains together to see if a new type of consciousness
                                  emerges.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Despite
                                  their seeming similarities, Koch is dubious of Matloff’s volitional stars. What
                                  is distinctive about living things, according to his theory, is not that they
                                  are alive but that they are complex. Although the sun is vastly bigger than a
                                  bacterium, from a mathematical perspective it is also vastly simpler. Koch
                                  allows that a star may have an internal life that allows it to “feel,” but
                                  whatever that feeling is, it is much less than the feeling of being an E. coli.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">On
                                  the other hand, “even systems that we don’t consider animate could have a
                                  little bit of consciousness,” Koch says. “It is part and parcel of the
                                  physical.” From this perspective, the universe may not exactly be thinking, but
                                  it still has an internal experience intimately tied to our own.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“The
                                  only dominant theory we have of consciousness says that it is associated with
                                  complexity — with a system’s ability to act upon its own state and determine
                                  its own fate.”</span></p>

                                  brings us to Roger Penrose and his theories linking consciousness and quantum
                                  mechanics. He does not overtly identify himself as a panpsychist, but his
                                  argument that self-awareness and free will begin with quantum events in the
                                  brain inevitably links our minds with the cosmos. Penrose sums up this
                                  connection beautifully in his opus "The Road to Reality":</span></p>

                                  laws of physics produce complex systems, and these complex systems lead to
                                  consciousness, which then produces mathematics, which can then encode in a
                                  succinct and inspiring way the very underlying laws of physics that gave rise
                                  to it.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Despite
                                  his towering stature as a physicist, Penrose has encountered resistance to his
                                  theory of consciousness. Oddly, his colleagues have been more accepting of the
                                  exotic, cosmic-consciousness implications of quantum mechanics. Ever since the
                                  1920s, physicists have puzzled over the strangely privileged role of the
                                  observer in quantum theory. A particle exists in a fuzzy state of
                                  uncertainty…but only until it is observed. As soon as someone looks at it and
                                  takes its measurements, the particle seems to collapse into a definite
                                  location.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
                                  late physicist John Wheeler concluded that the apparent oddity of quantum
                                  mechanics was built on an even grander and odder truth: that the universe as a
                                  whole festers in a state of uncertainty and snaps into clear, actual being when
                                  observed by a conscious being — that is, us.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“We
                                  are participators in bringing into being not only the near and here but the far
                                  away and long ago,” Wheeler said in 2006. He calls his interpretation the
                                  “participatory anthropic principle.” If he is correct, the universe is
                                  conscious, but in almost the opposite of the way that Matloff pictures it: Only
                                  through the acts of conscious minds does it truly exist at all.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It
                                  is hard to imagine how a scientist could put the participatory anthropic
                                  principle to an empirical test. There are no stars to monitor, and no brains to
                                  measure, to understand whether reality depends on the presence of
                                  consciousness. Even if it cannot be proven, the participatory anthropic
                                  principle extends the unifying agenda of modern science, powerfully evoking the
                                  sense of connectedness that Albert Einstein called the cosmic religious
                                  feeling.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“In
                                  my view, it is the most important function of art and science to awaken this
                                  feeling and keep it alive in those who are receptive to it,” Einstein wrote in
                                  a 1930 New York Times editorial. Explorers like Matloff are routinely dismissed
                                  as fringe thinkers, but it is hard to think of any greater expression of that
                                  feeling than continuing the quest to find out if our human minds are just tiny
                                  components of a much greater cosmic brain.</span></p>
