            <div class='col-md body'>I have heard of many people who have memories of past lives, especially in Buddhism. There are many monks/teachers/Masters who are able to do that. There are stories that I would rather not mention here.<br><br>In my IRC channel and in this forum alone, there are 2 people who were Tibetan Lamas in previous lives (they are not monks currently... just lay practitioners)... both of them has reached certain level of realisations. (One of them is Longchen in this forum). The other has never posted in this forum before. Other than these two who visits my channel and this forum, I believe there are others who visits my channel who may have certain memories but have not mentioned about it.<br><br>If you meditate deeply enough... you may be able to recall your previous lives especially in Samadhi. It is something that we can see for ourselves if we put an effort in our practise.<br><br>Plenty of people who have gone to meditation retreats, for days or a week, have received memories of previous lives. Think about it: these people went for a week retreat, how about monks and nuns who practise hard... often meditates throughout their life? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>This is from the other guy.. not longchen -<br><br>This chat conversation was recorded more than a year ago. He comes to the IRC channel sometimes. Some of us have met him before. His nickname as been replaced with <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">A</span></strong> to protect his privacy.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi All,<br><br>This is from my experience only ( a very tiny glimpse that I had).<br><br>There is, in fact, no past lives. All the so-called past-lives are still existing in the Eternal Now.<br><br>This is very hard to explain because time is a expereince/construction of our mind. Time in actuality, do not exist.<br><br>All the past lifes and future potential lives are memories in the 'Eternal Now/No Time' . All the past and future lives are in constant interaction with this present 'self/life'.<br><br>When a karma is dissolve in this life, all the past lives also have the piece of karma resolved.<br><br>Past life and reincarnation is more subtle than what is 'stated' within traditional religious texts.<br><br>Because there is no past life, there is also no reincarnation.</div>
