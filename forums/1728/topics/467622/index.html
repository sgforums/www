              </p><p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';">The teachings on emptyness (Sanskrit sunyata or shunyata) 
                find their most articulate development in the Kadampa branch of Mahayana Buddhism 
                (Madhyamika Prasangika). To the Kadampa Buddhist nothing exists 'inherently' 
                or 'from its own side'. All phenomena exist in dependence on three things -</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';">(i) their causes,<br> (ii) their parts, and <br> (iii) their imputation by the mind of a sentient being. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';">And the sentient mind is NOT a physical construct 
                or epiphenomenon of matter . The mind is clear and formless and has the power 
                to know phenomena in a qualitative way [KELSANG GYATSO 1992], and hence give 
                meaning to them.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';">To Kadampa Buddhists all things are totally empty 
                of any defining essence. Consequently all things have no fixed identity ('inherent 
                existence') and are are in a state of impermanence - change and flux - constantly 
                becoming and decaying. Not only are all things constantly changing, but if we 
                analyse any phenomenon in enough detail we come to the conclusion that it is 
                ultimately unfindable, and exists purely by definitions in terms of other things 
                - and one of those other things is always the mind which generates those definitions.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';">Kadampa Buddhism regards the persistent delusion 
                of 'inherent existence' as a major obstacle to spiritual development, and the 
                root of many other damaging delusions. One of these delusions is the materialist 
                belief in an objective reality existing independently of mind. By asserting 
                that the universe exists inherently as a brute fact, materialism denies that 
                subjective experience has any relevance to or influence on the universe, or 
                indeed any existence at all.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';">The delusion of inherent existence is deeply ingrained 
                our our culture. It was embedded into western philosophy by the Greek philosopher 
                Plato, who was born about sixty years after Buddha's death. <br> Plato's view of reality is that for any class of objects there is a defining 
                ideal form which is fixed, permanent and unchanging. All physical instances 
                of objects tend to be imperfect. For example the wilting, mildewed roses in 
                my garden are imperfect instances of an ideal rose which exists in a perfect 
                realm of eternal forms. It is only by reference to this authoritative 'specification' 
                that my mind is able to identify and name the transient physical phenomena, 
                which 'participate' in the ideal form's attributes.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';">Buddha died in 483 BC. Plato was born in 428 BC. 
                Yet it is most unlikely that Plato was aware of his predecessor's teachings. 
                In those days there was little contact between Greek and Indian philosophy. 
                This had to await the eastward advance of Alexander the Great around 328 BC. 
                The first recorded contact between Greek civilisation and Buddhism is the conversation 
                between the Greek King Milinda of Bactria, and Nagasena, a Buddhist chariot 
                dismantler [CONZE 1959].<br> Empty vehicles<br> King Milinda was a Greek and an experienced soldier who thought he knew a chariot 
                when he saw one. But Nagasena demonstrated that if Milinda's chariot were gradually 
                dismantled - knock a spoke out of a wheel here, a plank off there, then a bit 
                of the frame and so on - there was no way for Milinda to decide at exactly what 
                step in the procedure he should stop imputing 'vehicle' and start imputing 'heap 
                of firewood'.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';">Nagasena said this was because the chariot had no 
                power to define itself from its own side. Nor was there any ideal chariot form 
                'in the sky' which engaged and disengaged with the timber at definite stages 
                of assembly and disassembly.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';">Milinda's mind was the only thing that could make 
                the distinction between vehicle and firewood. And there were no logical rules, 
                stepwise procedures or decision trees for Milinda to decide when to cease imputing 
                one thing and impute another.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';">As with chariots, so with cars. Everyone knows what 
                a car is. A car is an assembly of parts. But what makes those parts into a car 
                is surprisingly difficult to pin down. At what stage on the production line 
                do the components finally become a car?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';">Does it temporarily cease to be a car when it's in 
                for repairs and the gearbox is several yards away from the rest of the vehicle? 
                Is my car still a car when I wake up one morning to find it supported on bricks 
                with the wheels missing?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';">Or, could I say that the essential feature of a car 
                is that it performs the functions of a car? So does it cease to be a car when 
                it won't start? And does it return to the state of being a car when I cure the 
                problem by spraying the electrics with moisture repellent? Does the true essence 
                of being a car therefore reside in an aerosol can?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';"><br> Emptiness of natural things.<br> Maybe we can rescue Plato's ideas of the inherent existence of perfect forms 
                if we assume there is a strict demarcation between man-made and natural objects, 
                with the former existing in dependence upon the 'judgement' of the observer, 
                but the latter existing 'from their own side'. For having come to accept that 
                man-made things such as chariots and cars owe some of their existence to dependence 
                on our mind, we may suspect that this is somehow because they are originally 
                products of the human mind - as first conceived by the designer.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';">We find it more difficult to accept the natural things 
                in the world, such as flowers and trees are dependent upon our minds. A rose 
                would smell as sweet by any other name. A rose bush is a rose bush is a rose 
                bush, and is different in its inherent nature from a plum or a cherry tree. 
                There is no continuum between these three species and thus no necessity for 
                our mind to make a judgment of the borderline. But is this really the case?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';"><br> Leaving aside nightmare genetic engineering scenarios of octophants, elepuses 
                and all stages in between, we may consider that there is (or was) a continuum 
                of form between all living things. If we were to examine the fossil records 
                of the ancestors of cherry trees and plum trees we would find that they diverged 
                from one common ancestor. Looking back through the fossils we would seen a continuous 
                gradation of characteristics from the ancestors of the cherry to to the ancestors 
                of the plum, leading back to a time when they were indistinguishable. But the 
                decision as to where ancestor ended and plum or cherry began would be totally 
                arbitrary. And if we were to trace the common ancestor of the cherry and plum 
                we would find convergence with the ancestors of the rose, strawberry, raspberry 
                etc. What Darwin did for creationism he also did for biological Platonism - 
                the biological species concept does not encapsulate any underlying truth [BROOKES 
                1999], and each individual species is unfindable</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';"><br> The ultimate unfindability of the real nature of all phenomena - their lack 
                inherent existence, is usually referred to by English-speaking Buddhists as 
                'emptiness', which is a translation of the Sanskrit word shunyata (sometimes 
                spelled Sunyata). According to David Loy the English word emptiness has a more 
                nihilistic connotation than the original Sanskrit. The Sanskrit root su also 
                conveys the concept of being swollen with possibility [LOY 1996]. It is therefore 
                most important not to confuse emptiness with total nothingness. Emptiness implies 
                the potential for existence and change. The mathematical analogy of emptiness 
                is not zero, but the empty set.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';">The conclusion that all things are empty of inherent 
                existence and appear only in dependence on our minds is not an obvious truth. 
                So deeply ingrained is the idea of inherent existence and authority in Western 
                culture that even when we have analysed all things as dependent on causes, and 
                dependent on parts, we still hold back from the most subtle truth of dependence 
                on mind. We think there ought to be 'something out there', or someone 'authoritative' 
                who prevents the real world from being so much dependent upon our judgement. 
                On first meeting teachings on emptiness the western mind often suspects it is 
                the victim logical trickery or mere playing with words. Fortunately it is possible 
                to demonstrate the true and all-pervasive nature of emptiness by examining the 
                mode of existence of fundamental particles, the building blocks of all things 
                in the material universe.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';">The participation of the observer.<br> According to the Kadampa school of Buddhist philosophy all phenomena exist by 
                dependence on other phenomena, which are themselves dependently related to other 
                phenomena and so on. No matter how deeply or far back we search, no phenomenon 
                can ever be found which is fundamental or a 'thing-in-itself'. Neither the observer 
                nor any observed phenomenon exist independently, but are inextricably intertwined. 
                This viewpoint is known as dependent relationship.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';">Geshe Kelsang Gyatso [KELSANG GYATSO 1995] states 
                that there are three levels of dependent relationship:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';">(1) Gross dependent relationship - causality - the 
                dependence of phenomena on their causes.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';">(2) Subtle dependent relationship - structure - the 
                dependence of phenomena on their perceived parts (including aspects, divisions 
                and directions).</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';">(3) Very subtle dependent relationship - the dependence 
                of phenomena on imputation by mind.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';">All functioning things exist in these three ways. 
                The very subtle dependent relationship - existence by the mind's imputation 
                - is the most difficult one to understand, especially since for most ordinary 
                phenomena this view of existence is masked by the two grosser levels of existence. 
                This subtle mode of existence is always present, but only becomes apparent in 
                those circumstances where the grosser levels do not dominate.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';">If we have problems with the terminology of gross 
                and subtle, we may think of this as the degree of apparent objectivity of dependent 
                relationship . The most gross is the most objective and the very subtle is the 
                most subjective (or participatory) type of dependent relationship.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';">The existence of a thing in dependence of its causes 
                (except in the special case where we were involved in making it ) appears totally 
                objective and does not require our participation. The causes of a car are the 
                geological processes which produced coal, iron and copper ores. Then the miners, 
                metalworkers, designers, component manufacturers and assembly line workers who 
                transformed the raw material into the finished product. Unless we happen to 
                work in one of these industries, the causal mode of existence does not depend 
                on our participation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';">Existence in dependence on parts is more subjective. 
                We may view a car as composed of a chassis, an engine and four wheels. Or we 
                may take a more detailed view with the engine being seen as pistons, cylinder-head, 
                carburettor etc. These too can be analysed into subcomponents, all the way down 
                through atoms of iron and carbon, to the fundamental particles such as protons, 
                electrons and the photons which shine from the headlamps.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';">Our perception of dependence upon parts is very much 
                determined by how we choose to subdivide the whole. The mind has to participate 
                by applying analytical effort to generate the view of existence in dependence 
                upon parts.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';">It's when we get to the final stage of perception 
                of dependence in terms of the fundamental building blocks of matter that we 
                come up against the very subtle (most participatory) level of dependent relationship 
                of imputation by mind. Experiments in quantum physics seem to demonstrate the 
                need for an observer to make potentialities become real.<br> Quantum shunyata<br> Now, fundamental particles such as electrons and photons do not have any obvious 
                causes. Either they always have been there or else they come into existence 
                as the result of random quantum events. Neither do they have anything in the 
                way of observable parts (otherwise they wouldn't be fundamental). So when we 
                examine an electron or photon, we are looking at a phenomenon in which the two 
                grosser ways of existing are relatively inapparent. As the two grosser levels 
                are not clamouring for our attention, Kadampa metaphysics would predict that 
                the very subtle level of dependent relationship (in dependence of imputation 
                by mind) should manifest itself.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';">It is important to emphasise that the mathematical 
                equations of quantum physics do not describe actual existence - they describe 
                potential for existence. Working out the equations of quantum mechanics for 
                a system composed of fundamental particles produces a range of potential locations, 
                values and attributes of the particles which evolve and change with time. But 
                for any system only one of these potential states can become real, and - this 
                is the revolutionary finding of quantum physics - what forces the range of the 
                potentials to assume one value is the act of observation. Matter and energy 
                are not in themselves phenomena, and do not become phenomena until they interact 
                with the mind. <br> REFS.</span></p>
