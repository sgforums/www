Whether there are exceptional cases I'm not sure, I heard some Vajrayana masters say its possible to go beyond 49 days in bardo.

However, passionate souls with strong desires or those responsible for evil acts in their most recent life are said to reincarnate almost immediately. In some cases, the individual can stay in the bardo state for long periods, and be drawn into its currents awaiting rebirth.<br><br>If the individual does not reincarnate in the physical world, he or she will go to one of the other five worlds of rebirth. These are the heaven worlds, the hell worlds, the world of hungry ghosts, the asura (demigod) worlds, and the animal worlds. Each of these is believed to be limited and inferior to obtaining another body in the material world. This is because they exist mostly to receive good or bad karma (the results of previous actions), and are not considered places to create new karma. </blockquote>/\<br></div>
