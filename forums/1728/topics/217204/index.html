I find this book very helpful: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Death-Fear-Thich-Nhat-Hanh/dp/1573223336" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Death-Fear-Thich-Nhat-Hanh/dp/1573223336</a>. Can be found in major bookstores like Kinokuniya and also library (availability: <a href="http://vistaweb.nlb.gov.sg" rel="nofollow">http://vistaweb.nlb.gov.sg</a> - search 'Thich Nhat Hanh')<br><br><blockquote><strong>Amazon.com</strong><br><br>Thich Nhat Hanh always invites us to look deeply, and he does so once again in No Death, No Fear. Recognizing interconnections, Nhat Hanh brings us to beginnings, how they depend on endings, and how they are but temporary manifestations. Everything endures, he says, but in different forms. And this isn't just a palliative to make us feel better for a while--Nhat Hanh's philosophy of Interbeing takes the long view, challenging us to open our eyes to subtle transformations. He shows how extraordinary things happen when we are fully present with others and at peace with ourselves, both of which require openness and deep looking. In his bestselling style of easy prose, compelling anecdotes, and pragmatic advice, Nhat Hanh gradually drains the force out of grief and fear, transforming them into happiness and insightful living. Death doesn't have to be a roadblock, and in No Death, No Fear Thich Nhat Hanh shows us the way around. --Brian Bruya --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title. </blockquote>And it's not just fearing for your own death but also very much on how to deal with the death of your loved ones.. by realising their deathless nature.<br><br>There's a video by Thich Nhat Hanh that can be viewed online for free: <a href="http://buddha-inside.us/" rel="nofollow">http://buddha-inside.us/</a> - go down to the Thich Naht Hanh video - Birth and Death are Just a Game of Hide and Seek</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think prepararation have to be done as soon as possible. Buddhist's teaching help us to be mentally prepare for such things even before it happen. they sure to happen to a person. after it happen then cure, a bit difficult. it's the same as illness. prevention is the best cure for illness.<br><br>/\<br></div>
