              <p><strong>A female humpback whale had become entangled in a spider web of crab traps  and lines. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>She was weighted down by hundreds of pounds of traps that caused her to struggle to stay afloat.  </strong></p>
              <p><strong>She also had hundreds of yards of line rope wrapped around her body, her tail, her torso, a  <br>line  tugging in her mouth. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>A fisherman spotted her just east of the  Faralon Islands  (outside the  Golden Gate- California  ) and radioed  <br>for help. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Within a few hours, the rescue team arrived and determined that she was so badly off, the only  <br>way to save her was to dive in and untangle her  --  a very dangerous proposition.  One slap of  <br>the tail could kill a rescuer.  </strong></p>
              <p><a style="display: inline;" href="http://blog.tsemtulku.com/.a/6a01310f7b9b6a970c0133f22427a8970b-pi"><img class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a01310f7b9b6a970c0133f22427a8970b " src="http://blog.tsemtulku.com/.a/6a01310f7b9b6a970c0133f22427a8970b-500wi" alt="Dolphin1"></a></p>
              <p><strong>They worked for hours with curved knives and eventually freed her.  </strong></p>
              <p><strong>When she was free, the divers say she swam in what seemed like joyous circles.  </strong></p>
              <p><strong>She then came back to each and every diver, one at a time, nudged them, and  pushed gently,  <br>thanking them. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Some said it was the most incredibly beautiful experience of their lives.  </strong></p>
              <p><a style="display: inline;" href="http://blog.tsemtulku.com/.a/6a01310f7b9b6a970c0133f2242819970b-pi"><img class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a01310f7b9b6a970c0133f2242819970b " src="http://blog.tsemtulku.com/.a/6a01310f7b9b6a970c0133f2242819970b-500wi" alt="Dolphin2"></a></p>
              <p><strong>The guy who cut the rope out of her mouth says her eye was  following him the whole time, and he will never be the same.  </strong></p>
              <p><strong>May you, and all those you love,  be so fortunate ... <br>To be surrounded by people  who will help you get untangled  from the things that are binding you. <br>And, may you always know the joy of giving and receiving gratitude. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>I pass this on to you, my friend, in the same spirit </strong></p>

              <p>The sea is stained in red and it is not because of the climate effects of<br>nature. It's because of the cruelty of the human beings (civilised human)<br>who kill hundreds of the famous and intelligent Calderon dolphins.</p>
              <p>This happens every year in Feroe Island in Denmark . In this slaughter the<br>main participants are young teens.<br>WHY?<br>A celebration, to show that they are adults and mature!</p>
              <p><img src="http://blog.tsemtulku.com/.a/6a01310f7b9b6a970c0133f21dad54970b-pi" alt="" width="466" height="305"></p>

              <p>In this big celebration, nothing is missing for the fun. Everyone is<br>participating in one way or the other, killing or looking at the cruelty<br>supporting like a spectator</p>
              <p>  <br>Is it necessary to mention that the dolphin Calderon, like all the other<br>species of dolphins, it's near extinction and they get near men to play and<br>interact.<br>In a way of PURE friendship</p>
              <p>  <br>They don't die instantly; they are cut 1, 2 or 3 times with thick hooks. And<br>at that time the dolphins produce a grim cry like that of a new born child.</p>
              <p>But he suffers and there's no compassion while this magnificent creature<br>slowly dies in its own blood.</p>

              <p>For more info, read the below:<br>Whales are sensitive, social animals with highly developed nervous systems. They have a profound capacity to suffer distress, terror and pain. Each year, the Faroese kill pilot whales and other small cetaceans.</p>
              <p><img src="http://blog.tsemtulku.com/.a/6a01310f7b9b6a970c0133f21db25b970b-pi" alt="" width="493" height="305"><br>Islanders in motorboats first drive the whales into a bay. The chase may be lengthy. The exhausted, terrified and confused whales are eventually driven into the shallows. Here the bloodbath begins. The islanders repeatedly hammer 2.2 kg metal gaffs into the living flesh of each whale until the hooks hold. A 15 cm knife is then used to slash through the blubber and flesh to the spinal column. Next the main blood vessels are severed. The blood-stained bay is soon filled with horribly mutilated and dying whales.</p>
              <p><img src="http://blog.tsemtulku.com/.a/6a01310f7b9b6a970c013485433620970c-pi" alt="" width="553" height="305"><br>The Faroese celebrate the butchery of their victims in a carnival atmosphere of entertainment. Indoctrinated from an early age, children are often given a day off school to watch the fun. They run down to the bay and clamber over the carcasses of slaughtered whales.</p>
              <p><br>Every year around 2,000 whales are driven ashore and cruelly slaughtered in the Faroe Islands, mid-way between the Shetland Islands and Iceland. For centuries the Faroe Islanders have hunted pilot whales, driving entire schools into killing bays, where they are speared or gaffed from boats, dragged ashore and butchered with knives. Although the Islands are a protectorate of Denmark, they have their own Government and regulations governing the pilot whale hunt or "grind" as it is known.<br>Aside from the fact that the number of North Atlantic long-finned pilot whales is unknown and they are listed as 'strictly protected' by the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats, this is an act of barbarism and pointlessness. By slaughtering 100 whales at a time, the Faroese are wiping out entire pods and family groups. They are removing building blocks from the gene pool of the species and damaging the web of life in the North Atlantic and the North Sea.<br>The drive hunt is a practice abandoned elsewhere many decades ago, and now outlawed by other European states. The inhabitants of the Faroe Islands have no subsistence need for whale meat, and much of the flesh is left to rot and be dumped; it cannot be exported, as it is polluted with heavy metals and other toxins and therefore cannot meet EU heath standards for human food.</p>
              <p><br>According to Faroese legislation it is also permitted to hunt certain species of small cetaceans other than pilot whales. These include: Bottlenose dolphin; Atlantic white-beaked dolphin; Atlantic white-sided dolphin; and Harbour porpoise (There are also specific regulations for the hunting of harbour porpoise. Harbour porpoises are killed with shotguns).</p>

              <p>I wonder why these people have no feelings when hearing these sea animals cried in pain. Dolphins are very smart animals.</p>
              <p>I had just watched a documentary show on Okto last week about dolphins. They are very smart sea animals. In the show, there was a female dolphin who lost her baby dolphin, she was so sad that she refused to leave the spot where she lost her baby and she went back to the same spot to look for her baby for 7 days. See, they have feelings just like humans.</p>
