A famous kōan is, "Two hands clap and there is a sound; what is the sound of one hand?" (oral tradition, attributed to Hakuin Ekaku, 1686-1769, considered a reviver of the kōan tradition in Japan).<br><br>Contents [hide]<br>1 In brief<br>2 Examples<br>3 Roles of the kōan in Zen practice<br>4 Etymology and the evolving meaning of kōan<br>5 The role of kōans in the Soto, Rinzai, and other sects<br>6 Interpretation of kōans<br>6.1 The sound of one hand<br>6.2 The Gateless Gate<br>6.2.1 Case 1: Zhaozhou's dog<br>6.2.2 Case 2: Pai-chang and a fox<br>6.2.3 Case 6: Buddha holds out a flower<br>6.2.4 Case 7: Zhaozhou washes the bowl<br>6.2.5 Case 8: Keichu's wheel<br>6.2.6 Case 29: Huineng's flag<br>6.2.7 Case 37: Zhaozhou's cypress<br>6.3 Other traditional kōans<br>6.3.1 What is the Buddha?<br>6.3.2 Killing the Buddha<br>6.4 Contemporary kōans<br>7 See also<br>8 Notes<br>9 External links<br><br>[edit] In brief<br>Kōans originate in the sayings and doings of sages and legendary figures, usually those authorized to teach in a lineage that regards Bodhidharma (c. 5th-6th century) as its ancestor. Kōans are said to reflect the enlightened or awakened state of such persons, and sometimes said to confound the habit of discursive thought or shock the mind into awareness. Zen teachers often recite and comment on kōans, and some Zen practitioners concentrate on kōans during meditation. Teachers may probe such students about their kōan practice using "checking questions" to validate an experience of insight (kensho) or awakening. Responses by students have included actions or gestures, "capping phrases" (jakugo), and verses inspired by the kōan.<br><br>As used by teachers, monks, and students in training, kōan can refer to a story selected from sutras and historical records, a perplexing element of the story, a concise but critical word or phrase (話頭 huÃ -tÃ³u) extracted from the story, or to the story appended by poetry and commentary authored by later Zen teachers, sometimes layering commentary upon commentary. Less formally, the term kōan sometimes refers to any experience that accompanies awakening or spiritual insight.<br><br>English-speaking non-Zen practitioners sometimes use kōan to refer to an unanswerable question or a meaningless statement. However, in Zen practice, a kōan is not meaningless, and teachers often do expect students to present an appropriate response when asked about a kōan. Even so, a kōan is not a riddle or a puzzle.[1] Appropriate responses to a kōan may vary according to circumstances; different teachers may demand different responses to a given kōan, and a fixed answer cannot be correct in every circumstance. One of the most common recorded comments by a teacher on a disciple's answer is, "Even though that is true, if you do not know it yourself it does you no good." The master is looking, not for an answer in a specific form, but for evidence that the disciple has grasped the practical use of the kōan in daily life, or in other words, has actually given up some previous attachment.<br><br>The word kōan corresponds to the Chinese characters 公案 which can be rendered in various ways: gōng'Ã n (Chinese pinyin); kung-an (Chinese Wade-Giles); gong'an (Korean); cÃ´ng-Ã¡n (Vietnamese); kōan (Japanese Hepburn); often transliterated kōan). Of these, "kōan" is the most common in English. Just as Japanese Zen, Chinese Ch'an, Korean Son, and Vietnamese Thien, and Western Zen all share many features in common, likewise kōans play similar roles in each, although significant cultural differences exist<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koan</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by AndrewPKYap:</div><div class="quote_body">A Koan hor, is not for learning...</div></blockquote>That's right. A Koan is a method and not something that can be learnt or known. It is also <strong>NOT</strong> a riddle! It is not something we can 'figure out' by thinking. The whole point of a koan is that it is utterly beyond what our rational thinking and conceptuality can ever grasp or understand, for the Truth can only be realised through the intuitive mind as Lankavatara Sutra says.<br><br>As my Master (Master Shen Kai) said:<br><br><img src="http://img259.imageshack.us/img259/946/koanub5.gif"><br><br>Here's a good article:<br><br><strong>We have said in part I that Zen functions in non-duality, The process of thought, of reasoning, of conceptualizing takes place in the field of duality. It follows that no thinking process will achieve Zen. Thought in itself can go a very long way; the seeker can by reason intellectually understand the concept of the ONE, the abstract concept of the VOID, think that mentally he understands what awareness is... But still all these concepts even the most abstract intellectual ones are still made in the world of reasoning and duality...So, Zen philosophy is to discard all kind of concepts and challenge the mind and intellect of the seeker by Zen KOANS which are not easily cracked...<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is a Koan? Essentially a koan is a paradox, i.e., that is 'beyond' thinking which transcends the logical or conceptual. Thus, since it cannot be solved by reason, a koan is not a riddle. Solving a koan requires a leap to another level of comprehension. Since the koan eludes solution by means of discursive understanding, it makes clear to the student the limitations of thought and eventually forces him to transcend it in an intuitive leap, which takes him into a world beyond logical contradictions and dualistic modes of thought.</span><br><br>For Zen masters, WORDS are sounds or marks of agreed meaning in terms of ideas, thoughts or feelings. They are symbols, when therefore, a master wishes to transmit to another some spiritual experience, he must descend to the level of thought and present the discovery in words that will touch the feelings of his student. On his turn the seeker unwraps the words and their symbolic meaning, extracting and resonating whatever he can understand from his master's Koan... or symbolic Words...</strong><br><br>Bhante Gunaratana also says:<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The second Zen approach used in the Rinzai school is that of tricking the mind out of conscious thought and into pure awareness. This is done by giving the student an unsolvable riddle which he must solve anyway, and by placing him in a horrendous training situation. Since he cannot flee from the pain of the situation, he must flee into a pure experience of the moment. There is nowhere else to go. Zen is tough. It is effective for many people, but it is really tough.</span></strong></div>
