              <div class="postbody">Chod as a tantric practice consists of the following essential ingredients:<br><br>A. The Blessing of the Lineage<br><br>In
              Tantric Buddhism lineage, meaning an unbroken line of proper
              transmissions of the teachings, is essential to practice and
              realization. This is because what is transmitted is not just the words
              but something spiritual and special. Through proper transmissions the
              blessings of all the generations of teachers are bestowed on the
              disciples. Without such blessings no one can even enter the invisible
              gate of Tantra. Tantric practices without the blessing of lineage may
              be likened to automobiles out of gas.<br><br>In Tantric Buddhism
              lineage is always emphasized and the teachers are revered as the root
              of blessings. In Sutra-yanas the importance of lineage is often
              overlooked by scholars who lack interest in practice and ordinary
              Buddhist followers. This is probably the main reason why in Tantric
              Buddhism blessings can often be directly sensed by practitioners while
              in Sutra-yanas such experiences are less frequently encountered.<br><br>All
              tantric practices derive their special effectiveness from the blessing
              that is transmitted through the lineage. In the case of Chod, the
              blessing from Machig Labdron is the source of such blessings. All other
              teachers that form the various lineages of Chod are also indispensable
              to the continuation of these lineages; without their accomplishments
              and devoted services to the Dharma, the teachings would not be still
              available today. Therefore, we should remember their grace and always
              hold them in reverence.<br><br>To a practitioner who is fortunate
              enough to have received the blessings of a lineage, the meaning of
              lineage becomes his devotion, with all his heart and soul, to carry on,
              to preserve and transmit the teachings for all generations (of
              disciples, the real beneficiaries,) to come.<br><br>B. The Wisdom of Recognition and Transformation<br><br>Self-clinging
              is the fundamental hindrance to Enlightenment and the fundamental cause
              of transmigration in samsara. Although it is the main obstacle for a
              Buddhist practitioner to eradicate, its subtle nature and elusive ways
              are beyond easy comprehension. Even the very attempt to attack or
              reduce self-clinging might very well be indeed an expression of
              egocentrism, if the motive is limited to self-interest. Facing the
              dilemma of an invisible enemy who is possibly lurking behind one's
              every move, it amounts to an almost impossible task! Thanks to the
              wisdom insight of Machig Labdron, the root of self-clinging has been
              singled out to be the body. Once this is made clear, and the body being
              a concrete object, the remaining task is much simpler, though not
              easier.<br><br>According to the wisdom insight of Machig Labdron, the
              real demons are everything that hinders the attainment of liberation.
              Keeping this wisdom insight in mind, on one hand, all judgments based
              on personal preferences and interests should be given up, and on the
              other hand, all obstacles and adversaries could be transformed by one's
              efforts into helping hands on the path toward liberation. For example,
              a gain could be a hindrance to liberation if one is attached to it,
              while an injury could be a help to liberation if one uses it to
              practice tolerance, forgiveness and compassion.<br><br>Applying this
              wisdom insight to the root of self-clinging, the body, Machig Labdron
              formulated the visualization of Chod, and thereby transformed the root
              of hindrance into the tool for attaining compassion and liberation.<br><br>C. Impermanence and Complete Renunciation<br><br>The
              body is the very foundation of our physical existence. Even after it
              has been recognized to be the root of self-clinging, it is still very
              difficult to see how to treat it to bring about spiritual transcendence
              and liberation. Destroying the body would certainly end the possibility
              of further spiritual advancement in this life but not necessarily the
              self-clinging. The fact that beings are transmigrating from life to
              life attests to this. Ascetic practices may temporarily check the grip
              of physical desires over spiritual clarity and purity, but
              transcendence depending on physical abuse can hardly be accepted as
              genuine liberation. The Buddha had clearly taught that the right path
              is the middle one away from the extremes of asceticism and hedonism.<br><br>A
              fundamental and common approach of Buddhist teachings is to remind
              everyone of the fact of Impermanence. All things are in constant
              changes, even though some changes are not readily recognizable. The
              change from being alive to dead could occur at any moment and could
              happen in just an instant. Keeping impermanence in mind, one can
              clearly see that all our attachments to the body are based primarily on
              wishful thinking. To be ready for and able to transcend the events of
              life and death one needs to see in advance that all worldly
              possessions, including the body, will be lost sooner or later. Hence, a
              determination to renounce all worldly possessions is the first step
              toward spiritual awakening and liberation. Chod as a Buddhist practice
              is also based on such awareness of impermanence and complete
              renunciation. In fact, many Chodpas adopt not just the ritual practice
              but also a way of life that exemplifies such awakening. Many Chodpas
              are devout beggars or wondering yogis who stay only in cemeteries or
              desolate places and do not stay in one place for more than seven
              consecutive days.<br><br>The offering of the body through visualization
              in a Chod ritual is an ingenious way to counter our usual attitude
              toward the body; instead of possession, attachment, and tender, loving
              care, the ritual offers new perspectives as to what could happen to the
              body as a physical object and thereby reduces the practitioners'
              fixation with the body, enlarge their perspectives, and help them to
              appreciate the position of the body on the cosmic scale. Chodpas would
              fully realize that the body is also impermanent, become free from
              attachment to it, and ready to renounce it when the time comes. When
              one is ready to renounce even the body, the rest of the worldly
              possessions and affairs are no longer of vital concern, only then can
              one make steadfast advancement on the quest for Enlightenment.<br><br>D. Bodhicitta<br><br>Machig
              Labdron emphasizes that the offering of the body in Chod practice is an
              act of great compassion for all beings, especially toward the
              practitioner's creditors and enemies. Great compassion knows no
              partiality, hence the distinction of friends and foes, or relatives and
              strangers does not apply. Great compassion transcends all attachments
              to the self, hence all one's possessions, including the body, may be
              offered to benefit others. In every act of visualized offering of the
              bodily parts, the practitioner is converting an unquestioned attachment
              into an awaken determination to sacrifice the self for the benefit of
              all. In short, this is the ultimate exercise in contemplating complete
              self-sacrifice for achieving an altruistic goal.<br><br>Chod is a
              practice that kills two birds with one stone. On one hand, the
              attachment to the body and self would be reduced through the visualized
              activity of dismemberment; on the other hand, the visualized practice
              of satisfying all beings, especially one's creditors and enemies,
              through the ultimate and complete sacrifice of one's body would nurture
              one's great compassion. When the attachment is weakened, the wisdom of
              non-self would gradually reveal itself. Consequently, Chod develops
              wisdom and compassion simultaneously in one practice; or to put it in
              another way, Chod is a practice that nurtures the unification of wisdom
              and compassion.<br><br>In Buddhism Bodhicitta refers to the ultimate
              unification of wisdom and compassion, the Enlightenment, and to the
              aspiration of achieving it. Therefore, we may say that Chod stems from
              the Bodhicitta of Machig Labdron, guides practitioners who are with
              Bodhicitta through the enactment of Bodhicitta, and would mature them
              for the attainment of Bodhicitta.<br><br>Only when one is completely
              devoted to the service of all sentient beings can one gain complete
              liberation from self-centeredness. Just as a headlong plunge takes a
              diver off the board, complete devotion to Dharma and complete
              attainment of liberation happens simultaneously. Only when
              considerations involving oneself is eradicated, will an act in the name
              of the Dharma become indeed an act of Bodhicitta, of Enlightenment.
              Developing Bodhicitta in place of self-centeredness is the effective
              and indispensable approach to liberation from self, and Chod is the
              epitome of this approach.<br><br>E. Meditation Stability and Visualization<br><br>The
              visualization practice of Chod is not an act of imagination. Were it
              just imagining things in one's mind, there is no guarantee that such
              practice would not drive one insane. To practice Chod properly one
              should have some attainment of meditation stability so that the
              visualizations are focused and not mixed with delusive and scattered
              thoughts or mental images. Indeed, Chod should be practiced as akin to
              meditation in action.<br><br>To be free from attachments to the body,
              we have seen above that destroying or abusing it would not do. It is
              the great ingenuity of Machig Labdron to recognize that attachments
              being mental tendencies can be properly corrected by mental
              adjustments. Visualizations performed by practitioners with meditation
              stability could have the same or even stronger effects as real
              occurrences. Furthermore, visualizations can be repeated over and over
              again to gradually overcome propensities until their extinction.<br><br>Using
              visualization in Chod practices the body remains intact and serves as a
              good foundation for the practitioner's advancement on the path to
              Enlightenment, while the attachment to the body and all attachments
              stemming from it are being chopped down piece by piece.<br><br>Visualizations
              performed in meditation stability is a valid way of communication with
              the consciousness of beings who are without corporeal existence. Hence
              Chod visualizations as performed by adepts are real encounters of the
              supernatural kind. They could yield miraculous results such as healing
              of certain ailments or mental disorders that are caused by ghosts or
              evil spirits, and exorcism that restores peace to a haunted place.<br><br>The
              five essential ingredients as stated and explained above constitute the
              key to the formulation of Chod as a Buddhist tantric practice. A
              thorough understanding of the significance of these essentials is both
              a prerequisite to and a fruit of successful Chod practices.<br><br>3. The Benefits of Chod Practice<br><br>Enlightenment
              is of course the ultimate goal of Chod practice. Machig Labdron
              revealed her vast spiritual experiences by indicating signs of various
              stages of realization in Chod. These teachings are still well preserved
              in Chod traditions. Through the References listed at the end of this
              work serious readers may find some of these teachings.<br><br>In
              addition to the fruits of realization as indicated above and the
              application of spiritual power to healing and exorcism as mentioned
              earlier, there are other benefits that may be derived from Chod
              practice. Chod practice can help booster the courage and determination
              to devote one's whole being to practice, beyond considerations of
              physical well-being and life, thereby achieving complete renunciation
              and significant realization. Chod practice could help total removal of
              subconscious hindrances that are most difficult to become aware of
              because these would surface only when challenged by grave situations
              like dismemberment.<br><br>In a dream state I sensed the relaxing
              effect of Chod; those joints of my body that were tense became relaxed
              when a curved knife cut through them. The tension in our mind is
              enhanced by our underlying concept of the body. By removing the mental
              image of the body through Chod the tension is reduced. The natural
              state of one's body exists before the arising of concepts, and hence,
              to return to it one needs to transcend the grip of conceptuality.<br><br>Many
              kinds of death are horrible to normal thinking; through practicing Chod
              it is possible to go beyond attachment to physical existence, and have
              enough spiritual experiences to understand that whatever the manner of
              death may be they are just different ways to exit from the physical
              existence. Such a broad perspective would enable one to remain serene
              in facing unthinkable tragedies. Such an understanding would make it
              easier to tolerate, forgive and forgo vengeance.</div>
