            <div class='col-md body'>I posted this in a still quite recent topic: <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=279838" rel="nofollow">may i know</a><br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by hanbyul88:<br>may i know is doing oral XXX and anal XXX consider (Xie yin) in wu jie?.</blockquote>Yes. 'Sexual misconduct' refers to (according to Abhidharmakosha)...<br><br>Wrong partner-- a married person, a minor, someone in a relationship, an incompetent.<br><br>Wrong time -- day time<br><br>Wrong place -- in public, in shrine, etc.<br><br>Wrong orifice -- oral, anal.<br><br><blockquote>Also is homo or bisexual a sin?<br><br>I have read some forum it says no while says say yes? There is one buddhism who says no too in therveda or what ??? anyone verify?<br><br>Thanks you</blockquote>This is something that many people have different opinions. But generally speaking, don't think that it is limited to any particular tradition, we do not encourage homosexuality.<br><br>We don't actually believe in 'sin'. In accordance with my dharma teacher (I'm from Mahayana anyway), in Buddhism, in the sense that there is no absolute evil person. Everyone is a human, but they are conditioned by their way of thinking... so if their way of thinking can be transformed, the person can be transformed. We should not condemn homosexuals or bisexuals but if possible provide them with counselling/guidance and encouragement.<br><br>I recall my dharma teacher speak about how homosexuality is a misidentification of our gender, and advised us to remain as what our gender is... that is not to engage in homosexuality, male shldnt seek male and female seek female and so on.<br><br>And no matter what we cannot run away from the fact of our gender.. even if we become transexual. That is, maybe you can change your sexual organs, but the fact is you still can't give birth to children, etc. But some people say "I don't need that'... even so, not everything can be changed, such as a male's adam's apple will remain. And such. So the fact of his real gender remain.. These transexuals will also face social difficulties, such as if you go and apply a job the boss will look at your face, and think that you do not look like a guy, and neither do you look like a girl, and your social opportunies and even career will be affected. Transexuals generally have a very very difficult lives for them... and would usually tell you not to walk that path unless you can tolerate a lot a lot of pain.<br><br>Another thing that my taiwanese teacher mentioned during his 2003 talk was that homosexuals generally have short lifespan.. because his personality and thinking become leaned towards feminity, or towards masculinity, and as a result the hormones are affected and becomes 'shi1 tiao2'... I didn't knew that was true, but when I searched the internet there are actually quite many research that supports this statement that homosexuals usually have shorter lifespan. Some people say isn't homosexuality a 'freedom of love'... but we should understand that freedom have responsibilites and we shouldn't destroy ourselves and the body that our parents gave us...<br><br>That said, unlike some other religions, we do not label and discriminate gays as 'sinful people' or such. We do not hold a sense of prejudice against them. But if it is possible we should try to encourage them to transform (but never never condemn them)</div>
