              <p>According to Tibetan calendar, the Tibetan Losar (New Year) falls on 5th March. The first month of the Tibetan calendar is known as "the multiplying of the blessings month."  During the life of Shakyamuni, many people asked him to perform miracles to prove his enlightenment. He ignored their requests and moved from town to town giving teachings. Finally, when he taught in Shravasti, the people beseeched the King to order Shakyamuni to hold a contest of spiritual or miraculous feats to prove his greatness. The Buddha agreed and as it so happened the first day he began these demonstrations was the first day of Losar (which is the Tibetan New Year) till the last day, which falls on the full moon.<br>This auspicious period is also known as Chotrul Duchen. Whatever good deeds one performs or merits one accumulates during this period, those actions will be multiplied by 100,000 times.<br>During this period, we have arranged the accumulation of Guru Rinpoche Seven Lines Prayer Program from 13th to 19th March 2011. We will like to strongly encourage you to join us in this wholesome activity and helps to achieve 100,000 Guru Rinpoche Seven Prayer.</p>
              <p>The objectives of this program are to pray for:</p>
              <p>1 Swift rebirth for H.H. Penor Rinpoche.<br>2 The longevity of all great masters of Buddhism &amp; ever-flourishing of Buddha Dharma.<br>3 Warfare, famines and sickness to be eliminated</p>

              <p>The practice of Chod entitled "The Laughter of Dakinis" according to Longchen Nyingthig by the master Jigme Lingpa. Chod refers to cutting through the grasping at a self and its attendant emotional afflictions by visualising offering of one's body to malevolent spirits and karmic creditors.</p>
              <p>It is a powerful ceremony in Tibetan Buddhist Tradition and is intended to dispel negative forces whose presence are indicted by incurable diseases, mental illness, depressions, sickness that are caused by spirits of the eight classes, non-humans and karmic creditors, the practice is best done in the evening, whereby participants who are not feeling well are encourage to sit or lie in front of the master when they are performing the practice.</p>
              <p><br>Event :  Guru Padma Woe Bar Empowerment by ZogNam Rinpoche <br>Date : March 27<br>Time : 10.00am</p>
              <p><br>Tulku Zog Nam Rinpoche will be conferring the Guru Padma Woe Bar Empowerment on 27th March. Guru Padma Woe Bar (Guru Rinpoche Long Life Iron Peak) is one of the manifestations of Guru Rinpoche.<br>When Guru Rinpoche was at Maratika Cave, he requested the Lord of Long Life to grant him the empowerment of long life and bless him with it. Guru Rinpoche then went to Tibet to conceal this practice together with other treasures. Thereafter this practice was revealed by Terton Rinzin Gyaltsol Nyingpo.<br>If one receives this empowerment, it will help one to avoid untimely death, pacify any obscurations, bless one with long life and wisdom. The blessing of this practice is particularly powerful in this degeneration time.</p>
