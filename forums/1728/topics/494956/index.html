              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Respected Bro Shi’an, all these years, I’d been attending many of your courses, which strongly heightened the progress of my cultivation toward the path to liberation. Very often, when I’d completed each course, I developed a positive energy that purifies my tainted mind, feeling joyful and increase in my faith to be born in Amituofo’s Pure Land. May Bro Shi’an live long and healthy in Samsara, to benefit all sentient beings. Many thanks with gratefulness. Amituofo. Warmest regards,<strong> </strong><strong>Geok Choo</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Looking forward to more of your courses. True Dharma teachers are hard to find nowadays, especially one who teaches in English. Thank you for sharing the true Dharma… Not many Dharma teachers will share such true Pure Land teachings. Of course, only those who are sincere, knowledgeable and willing to help sentient beings do. Again, thank you. Amituofo, <strong>Sally</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Thank you for being a good teacher, sharing your abundant knowledge about Buddhism with the students. This is the first time I am attending a Buddhist class, so it was an eye-opener for me… Many thanks for your time.

Shen, I am the one who sought your advice when the stray dog I was feeding passed away about 10 years ago. Many thanks for your good advice then and your very interesting classes on Tuesdays.

Continue with your good work to help directionless sentient beings suffering in this samsara. With metta, <strong>Boon</strong><strong><br></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Hi Shi’an, thank you for the wonderful run of the Amituofo course once again. This is probably the 3rd time I’m doing this, but I must say each round is a good revision for me, to motivate and remind myself to practice diligently. And there is always something new to learn. Thank you so much. Amituofo. <strong>– Huan Ghee</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I feel blessed to have attended your class. <strong>– Mandy</strong></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Dear Bro Shi’an, I want to express my sincere thanks for your great and enlightening teaching. I felt full of hope since attending the Pure Land class as I saw the direction of my future. I used to be depressive about my future direction even though I am a Buddhist for many years. After your lessons, my depression seems to have vanished into the thin air!… I have benefited immensely from your course. Once again, thank you very much! <strong>– Jon</strong><br><br>Thank you, Bro. Shen for your engaging lessons and advice… Thank you very much for your great efforts in sharing your Dharma knowledge on Amituofo with us. Really deeply appreciate it… The last lesson provides learners with a very succinct and concise knowledge on the sutra… I personally appreciate the part where you clarified on ‘å–„æ ¹ç¦�å¾·’… Thanks so much for the clarification. Also appreciate the part on why there is a repetition of the Buddhas’ praise of the six directions… Thank you for the beginning part of the course when you emphasised the hard facts that we can pass away at any moment. This part establishes a real purpose for us to learn Nianfo (and not to put it off any further). Once again, thank you for being such a great Dharma teacher. Amituofo, <strong>Aihua</strong></p>
              <div style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px;" dir="ltr">Hi Shi’an, really appreciate the lessons you have taught me. I will definitely try and put these teachings into my daily life practice, especially being such a young Buddhist myself. Thank you also for always guiding and helping my Mom when she has any queries about Buddhism. This has really helped us be more compassionate and humble in our own way. Once again, thank you for all the teachings and may Amituofo guide and protect you wherever you may be. Stay safe too! Amituofo, <strong>Hayley</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px;">Hi Bro Shi’an, you are a dedicated and knowledgeable Buddhist trainer… Hope to see you again soon. <strong>– Patrick</strong></p>

Before attending this course, I felt that I was lacking in faith, probably because there was no å–„çŸ¥è¯† [good-knowing spiritual friend] around me to è¡¨æ³• [express the Dharma]. So I decided to sign up for a Dharma course, hoping to deepen my understanding of the Buddha’s teachings. Best regards, <strong>Candy</strong></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I enjoyed the course tremendously and it has helped me in clearing some of my doubts, to appreciate and understand Buddhism. Thanks to Bro Shi’an for his time and efforts. Thanks, <strong>Doreen</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Dear Teacher Shi’an, thank you for your time and patience in teaching us… I’m a newbie Buddhist. I consider myself fortunate that the course allowed me to start off on the right foot, as there are many confusing and false teachings in our age. I was able to understand and appreciate the Dharma more deeply due to the real life examples used during the lessons. As such, my faith strengthened. I’m looking forward to join the 48 Vows of Amitabha course. Thank you. Sincerely, <strong>Teddy</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Thank you for the course. I have enjoyed it very much and have learnt a lot… Thank you very much for the time and dedication you have for the class. Your passion is infectious! I look forward to taking more courses with you. <strong>– Patricia</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Hi Shi’an, I just wanted to say thank you for the lessons over the last 10 weeks. I have learnt so much from you about Pure Land. I am glad I took the plunge and attended this course. Your rock solid, unwavering faith continues to inspire me and makes me vow even more to be reborn in Pure Land. I especially enjoyed the sutra lesson today. Your lessons are always interesting and inspirational, never with a dull moment. You teach with humour, examples and analogies that are current which makes it easy to relate to everyday life.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I appreciate all the effort you have put into the course preparation. After having done this 12 times before, I imagine that one with less faith and conviction could feel bored or worse, complacent teaching similar materials over the years. In this case, I feel that as you grew spiritually over the years. Your faith has strengthened continually and your passion to teach the Dharma is incredible! You are truly a wonderful, motivational and inspirational teacher. Lastly, in a nutshell, you have taught me more in the last 10 weeks than “where I used to go to weekly” in the last 40+ years. Therefore, I thank you and I salute you. I look forward to attending more of your future courses. (P/S: Notice how many times I use the word ‘inspirational’? ;)p Amituofo,<strong> P.H.<br></strong><br>Highly recommended! <strong>– Jac</strong></p>

Thank you very much for your dedication and for putting so much thought in your lessons to help us learn the Dharma in such a simple, interesting and inspiring way. I am really glad to have this opportunity to learn from you and hope to be able to attend more of your classes. Amituofo! <strong>– Hvi Chun</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Highly recommended. Shi’an è€�å¸ˆ is one of the best English Dharma teachers. <strong>– Kok Meng</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Thank you for giving the interesting lectures on the Amitabha Sutra. Thank you for conducting the Amituofo class in English. It really benefits those who do not know Mandarin like me. After attending your class, I understand Buddhism much better. Anyway, I will be attending your next Heart Sutra class. Thank you once again for all your hard work in translating and explaining the sutras in English for us. <strong>– Judy</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Hi Shi’an Laoshi, we enjoyed the course very much and will sign up for the “Destination Pureland” and “48 Vows of Amituofo” course… We really appreciate your effort in sharing the å‡€åœŸæ³•é—¨ and have gained a lot of knowledge from you! Thank you! – <strong>Chor Leng &amp; Sock Har</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Hi Bro. Shi’an, a big Thank You to you. I had benefitted a lot from attending your courses since June 2014, and I felt that it was Amituofo who guided me to attend these courses. Before I attended these lessons, things seemed to go downhill (but I did not tell any colleague about them)… Then came a day, a colleague asked me whether I had attended any Dharma lessons out of the blue, and few days later, another colleague asked whether I wanted to attend a Buddhist talk… After these two incidents, I really sat down to look for Dharma classes… Things are much better now. I will continue to Nianfo. Thank you. – Regards, <strong>Mary</strong></p>

Not only did I learn more about é˜¿å½Œé™€ä½›, it had given me more understanding and faith to continue Nianfo. It is through understanding that one will have faith and strike for a breakthrough… I will continue to Nianfo and had urge my family members to do so as well. é˜¿å½Œé™€ä½›. – <strong>Teng KL</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I enjoy your class very much… Thank you for your detailed reply and explanation. They have certainly cleared much of my doubts. Looking forward to learn and understand more from your coming sessions… Thank you for sharing your knowledge in Pure Land teachings with us so generously. Overall, I find the course beneficial and interesting. I can now appreciate the meaning of Nianfo better. I also appreciate the fact that while Nianfo is one of the “simplest” ways to practise [the Dharma], the benefits and the power of Nianfo are enormous! In fact, there was a night when I was having a nightmare. I could feel that I was terrified in my dream, with some demonic creature shadowing me everywhere I went. I tried to shake it off but to no avail. I knew it was a dream, but it felt very real and there were no way to run away. I started chanting Amituofo’s name… As I kept chanting, I literally watched the creature “melt” away and disappear in the dream. Amituofo. <strong>– Jason</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Dear Teacher Shi’an, I certainly have benefited very much from the course on ‘Understanding Amituofo’. Yes, I followed your instructions by reciting “Amituofo” when I get up and before I sleep, when I travel in trains and buses, while walking and whenever I have the opportunity. I chose this Dharma Door and aspire for birth in Amituofo’s Pure Land… Thank you very much for your great valuable teachings and I deeply appreciate all your dedicated effort and hard work in guiding sentient beings to the Pure Land path. Your teachings are very clear and materials used are very good. I rejoice in all your merits. With clasped palms, <strong>Patricia Choo</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Thank you for conducting the “Project Rebirth” and “Understanding Amituofo” course. Indeed, it opened up my mind and I am looking forward to completing the courses and retaking them again in your next run as I believe new questions will always arise in our minds. I also look forward to your Heart Sutra course and course on Dashishi Pusa’s teachings {‘The Mindfulness Factor’)… Thank you for all the teaching and sharing imparted throughout the classes. I truly enjoyed them and learnt a lot from the classes. – <strong>Soon Kiat</strong></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The ‘Understanding Amituofo’ course has been immensely interesting. Shi’an has a knack of breaking down difficult concepts into accessible information, which we can easily relate to in our everyday lives. This course will be useful even for Pure Land practitioners who already know something about the teachings. Shi’an always explores new perspectives that surprises us. His humorous approach to teaching and the use of clear, simple language is a major plus. There was never a dull moment. I enjoyed the classes tremendously! Amituofo, <strong>Wei </strong><strong>Peng</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Thank you for teaching us about Amituofo in such a simple way yet with so much for us to take away. I really appreciate your kindness and sincerity in conducting this course. I am inspired… I am already looking forward to your next courses, ‘The Faith Factor’ and ‘The Heart Of The Heart Sutra’. I must say that I always just feel happy going for the Saturday classes. Thank you for your time sharing your knowledge with us. Amituofo, <strong>Weena</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Dear Shi’an teacher, thank you very much for sharing so much about Amitabha Buddha.

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Dear Shi’an, I am glad we did not missed last Saturday’s class. The lessons are getting interesting and inspiring… Thank for sharing the wonderful Living Dharma… Thank you very much for illustrating your lessons for us with your real life experience on death. We truly enjoyed your last Saturday session… Thank you &amp; best regards. Amituofo, <strong>Susan, Linda &amp; Ricky</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Bro. Shen Shi’an shares his personal experiences and anecdotes in his lessons which make the class interesting.

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Nianfo (mindfulness of Amituofo) is one of the best life skills, or also ‘death skill’ that one should learn! Why? Knowing where one will go after death gives me peace of mind. And when unhappy thoughts arise, nianfo switches the state of mind to something neutral for me. When I get very angry, in some instances, I will get gastric pains. Once, I went to a corner to nianfo quickly, and within one minute, my state of mind changed and I was no longer angry. [Note: Nianfo can lead to experience of spiritually blissful well-being too.] <strong>– Adeline</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I’m very encouraged by your knowledge and your enthusiasm. Despite overrun of time, you still pursued to complete the last lesson with passion… Thank again for dedicating your life for teaching Buddhism. We need more people like you… I’m looking forward to your (future) talks… You do a great job in influencing another person with Buddhism. Thanks, and have a great day! – Amituofo, <strong>Doreen</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I attended your Amituofo class and found it to be informative and encouraging. Indeed I’m impressed by your relentless efforts and your meticulous attitude in explaining the sutra. Thanks. – <strong>Mdm Shen</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Dear Bro. Shi’an, thank you to you, who made this course possible for the benefit of English educated brothers and sisters. A round of applause to you!! Sadhu 3x. – <strong>Susan</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Dear Bro Shi’an, thank you for conducting this course, without which I wouldn’t have the privilege of learning about Amituofo and the Pureland practice. Also, your ‘unconventional’ way of teaching enables us to just relax and listen in class knowing that the notes (with lots of helpful links) will be sent to us via email later. Thanks to your good effort, I had definitely learnt and gained a lot. May you be well and happy! With Metta, <strong>Audrey</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">As my exposure was more to Theravada teachings, I did not know much about Pure Land but intrinsically I know that Amituofo and Pure Land exist and rebirth in Pure Land is achievable. I am glad I made the effort to attend this class because the knowledge that I gained strengthened my faith in Amituofo and dispels the doubt and misinformation that I was exposed to. I urge everyone to come with an open heart and mind to learn about Amituofo. It is the best gift for yourself! With deep appreciation, Amituofo, <strong>Karuna</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">“Dharma Teacher Shi’an is very sincere and earnest in delivery of his courses. Always filled with many interesting and creative analogies or metaphors to let us have a better idea and understanding. The various creative media used and implementation of the element of humour brings the Dharma classes alive without boredom, very often allowing me to feel inspired and invigorated with renewed energy after the lessons. Really appreciate the amount of effort Teacher Shi’an put into preparing his classes. Hope that the work of Teacher Shi’an will continue and benefit more of us!” <strong>– Ricky</strong></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">“Hi Shi’an, appreciate very much for your teaching. The lessons are really valuable. The materials are well prepared and carefully written. They are very useful for recap. Initially I was quite hesitant to register for the course. I thought I would probably drop out mid way because it was on Saturday – a day when my work schedules are tight, and the location [Kong Meng San for 10th Run] is quite inconvenient for me.. but your lessons were really so knowledgeable and interesting, that I wouldn’t want to miss them. In fact, I had been looking forward to them. Among all, I found that the topic about the interruption between each life [due to death]… to somewhat have an awakening effect on me. Since then, I have started to nianfo everyday, and it has been consistently carried out for 3 weeks! I hope I have all the time to continue the practice and be mindful of Buddha every moment. I will recommend your teachings to my friends and family members.” – Thanks &amp; Regards, <strong>Mee Nah</strong></p>

I have enjoyed every session of the course. I had supposed it to be a serious and dull subject. However, you had made it interesting and fun through your jokes and excellent illustrations. Unfortunately, I missed the last session due to a family commitment. The course structure flowed very well and is very suitable for a layperson to understand Pure Land Buddhism in a progressive manner. Your constant encouragement to get us to clarify our doubts through email [and in person] was very useful. Now, I have a much better understanding of Pure Land practice. I look forward to furthering my understanding and practice on Pure Land Buddhism. Thank you once again.” – Amituofo, <strong>Lar Kee</strong></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">‘Dear Teacher Shen, thank you for your teachings… Thank you for all the knowledge put in simple, digestable words in a light-hearted mood. The lessons are well pacedand after each lesson, the faith in me grows a little bit more. I’m glad my hubby signed me up for the course as I didn’t see the need to attend since I could access to the sutra and notes of the previous round he attended. After the end of last week’s 8th class and Bro. Steven’s sharing, I walked out of… feeling very happy despite the drizzle… Once on the bus, [using another way to practise mindfulness of Amituofo], I quickly whipped out my handphone to text ‘Amituofo, Amituofo… [in Chinese]’ and almost filled the length of 12 messages during the 17-minute ride. Once home, our 89 cm tall son fell down from a dining chair, where he was standing to drinkcereal. He landed sideways, unhurt and with no crying or words of discomfort. He had spilt half of his drink, and was still holding the cup. Both hubby and myself were 2-3 arm lengths away. We witnessed this and was speechless. It was as if our son was ‘lifted’ and merely placed on the floor [to break his fall]. We’re not sure if this is the blessing of Amituofo’s protection, but we are sure that nianfo [being mindful of Amitabha Buddha] is wonderful and great! May you have a great Amituofo day!’ <strong>– Emily</strong></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">“Hi Shi’an, I want to thank you for giving me better insights of the sutra, as well as instilling in me more faith. I am very thankful that I have the opportunity to attend your class. It is very difficult to find good English Buddhist classes and interesting teachers. I hope you can conduct more classes so we English educated ones would not miss the opportunity to understand and appreciate the Buddhist teaching and to reach Pure Land. Your class is super, never one moment boring and time just flies. I wish it never ends. Every moment is motivating, interesting, soft-selling but never forcing, well presented and delivered. Very good visual and presentation material. I believe that only those with faith and passion like you could conduct such classes. Academics would present and speak without conviction, but your easy style and passion makes the class alive, interesting and motivating. Shi’an good job!! Please don’t stop, we need your guidance. Thank you again.” <strong>– Amituofo, Pauline</strong></p>
