            <div class='col-md body'>(Translated by A.F. Price &amp; Wong Mou-Lam)<br><br><strong>Section XXVI. The Body of Truth has no Marks</strong><br><br>Subhuti, what do you think? May the Tathagata be perceived by the thirty-two marks [of a great man]?<br><br>Subhuti answered: No, the Tathagata may not be perceived thereby.<br><br>Then Buddha said: Subhuti, if the Tathagata may be perceived by such marks, any great imperial ruler is the same as the Tathagata.<br><br>Subhuti then said to Buddha: World-honored One, as I understand the meaning of Buddha's words, the Tathagata may not be perceived by the thirty-two marks.<br><br>Whereupon the World-honored One uttered this verse:<br><br>Who sees Me by form,<br><br>Who seeks Me in sound,<br><br>Perverted are his footsteps upon the Way,<br><br>For he cannot perceive the Tathagata.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Section XXVII. It is Erroneous to Affirm that All Things are Ever Extinguished</strong><br><br>Subhuti, if you should conceive the idea that the Tathagata attained the Consummation of Incomparable Enlightenment by reason of His perfect form, do not countenance such thoughts. The Tathagata's attainment was not by reason of His perfect form. [On the other hand] Subhuti, if you should conceive the idea that anyone in whom dawns the Consummation of Incomparable Enlightenment declares that all manifest standards are ended and extinguished, do not countenance such thoughts. Wherefore? Because the man in whom the Consummation of Incomparable Enlightenment dawns does not affirm concerning any formula that it is finally extinguished.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Section XXVIII. Attachment to Rewards of Merit</strong><br><br>Subhuti, if one Bodhisattva bestows in charity sufficient of the seven treasures to fill as many worlds as there are sand-grains in the river Ganges, and another, realizing that all things are egoless, attains perfection through patient forbearance, the merit of the latter will far exceed that of the former. Why is this, Subhuti? It is because all Bodhisattvas are insentient as to the rewards of merit.<br><br>Then Subhuti said to Buddha: What is this saying, World-honored One, that Bodhisattvas are insentient as to rewards of merit?<br><br>[And Buddha answered]: Subhuti, Bodhisattvas who achieve merit should not be fettered with desire for rewards. Thus it is said that the rewards of merit are not received<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Section XXIX. Perfect Tranquility</strong><br><br>Subhuti, if anyone should say that the Tathagata comes or goes or sits or reclines, he fails to understand my teaching. Why? Because Tathagata has neither whence nor whither, therefore is He called "Tathagata".<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Section XXX. The Integral Principle</strong><br><br>Subhuti, if a good man or a good woman ground an infinite number of galaxies of worlds to dust, would the resulting minute particles be many?<br><br>Subhuti replied: Many indeed, World-honored One! Wherefore? Because if such were really minute particles Buddha would not have spoken of them as minute particles. For as to this, Buddha has declared that they are not really such. "Minute particles" is just the name given to them. Also, World-honored One, when the Tathagata speaks of galaxies of worlds, these are not worlds; for if reality could be predicated of a world it would be a self-existent cosmos and the Tathagata teaches that there is really no such thing. "Cosmos" is merely a figure of speech.<br><br>[Then Buddha said]: Subhuti, words cannot explain the real nature of a cosmos. Only common people fettered with desire make use of this arbitrary method.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Section XXXI. Conventional Truth Should be Cut Off</strong><br><br>Subhuti, if anyone should say that Buddha declares any conception of egoity do you consider he would understand my teaching correctly?<br><br>No, World-honored One, such a man would not have any sound understanding of the Tathagata's teaching, because the World-honored One declares that notions of selfhood, personality, entity and separate individuality, as really existing, are erroneous - these terms are merely figures of speech.<br><br>[Thereupon Buddha said]: Subhuti, those who aspire to the Consummation of Incomparable Enlightenment should recognize and understand all varieties of things in the same way and cut off the arising of [views which are mere] aspects. Subhuti, as regards aspects, the Tathagata declares that in reality they are not such. They are called "aspects".<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Section XXXII. The Delusion of Appearances</strong><br><br>Subhuti, someone might fill innumerable worlds with the seven treasures and give all away in gifts of alms, but if any good man or any good woman awakens the thought of Enlightenment and takes even only four lines from this Discourse, reciting, using, receiving, retaining and spreading them abroad and explaining them for the benefit of others, it will be far more meritorious.
