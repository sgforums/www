If so, you are just in for the crowd and nothing more.  But sad to say, that's what I see in most people who professed a religion or faith or belief.

This way, at least you can be objective.  Don't be afraid to be different and to be sceptical.  Don't confuse scepticism with cynicism.  Search and research, and do not take anything at face value the very first time you come across a concept, thought, saying, etc. Give it more thought, verify and validate before you 'blindly' accept.

I am a Buddhist or am studying Buddhist teachings not because I want to follow the crowd. If that's the case, I think I should be a Christian instead. Cos like I've said in my introduction, almost 99% of my friends are Christians of different denominations (but still my knowledge of Christianity is very primitive or limited). It has been hard to have to constantly tell my Christian friends that I'm ok with not going to church when they invite me to every now and then.<br><br>One primary reason I finally decided to become a Buddhist after many years of being half Taoist, half Buddhist, is because I find it more comfortable to believe in 'Cause and Effect' than an omnipresent spiritual authority that totally exists outside of the laws of creation of life and awareness, and yet be able to create life and awareness at the same time. An absolute being who is unquestionable in the ways of rewards and punishments for wrongdoings restricted to mainly humans, is not something I can accept readily as my guiding faith. But I accord respect to all religions and teachings that impart core wholesome values such as universal love and respect for all living things. That is my core value.<br><br>One of those secondary reasons would be that I can now formally tell people that I'm a Buddhist not just because I like Buddhism, it's about taking a further step to commit myself to learning and practising the Buddhist teachings in real life.  I usually elaborate further by saying I intend to continue learning about my faith, and it should have no adverse effects at all on how I shall conduct my relationships with my friends and family. In fact, my relationships with people should be getting better as I understand and practise more of what I have learnt in Buddhism.<br><br>Thanks for your advice, GoodEarth. I too have the same thoughts on learning to be open minded and objective throughout my discovery process in life's journey. I can almost say this is what I am trying to be that leads me to choose Buddhism as my faith.<br><br>I will keep your words in mind.<br><br></div>
