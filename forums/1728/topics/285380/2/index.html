We ourselves have not have the wisdom and experience and can only share what limited knowledge we know, and other articles etc.<br><br>Therefore, it is important to find an enlightened teacher (ming2 shi1) and practise dharma under his/her guidance. In this way you will be able to progress fast in your practise and on your way to enlightenment.</div>

Whoever sees his nature is a Buddha. If you donÂ’t see your nature, invoking Buddhas, reciting sutras, making offerings, and keeping precepts are all useless. Invoking Buddhas results in good karma, reciting sutras results in a good memory; keeping precepts results in a good rebirth, and making offerings results in future blessings-but no buddha. If you donÂ’t understand by yourself, youÂ’ll have to find a teacher to get to the bottom of life and death. But unless he sees his nature, such a person isnÂ’t a tea6er. Even if he can recite the Twelvefold Canon he canÂ’t escape the Wheel of Birth and Death. He suffers in the three realms without hope of release. Long ago, the monk Good Star 21 was able to recite the entire Canon. But he didnÂ’t escape the Wheel, because he didnÂ’t see his nature. If this was the case with Good Star, then people nowadays who recite a few sutras or shastras and think itÂ’s the Dharma are fools. Unless you see your mind, reciting so much prose is useless.<br><br>To find a Buddha all you have to do is see your nature. Your nature is the Buddha. And the Buddha is the person whoÂ’s free: free of plans, free of cares. If you donÂ’t see your nature and run around all day looking somewhere else, youÂ’ll never find a buddha. The truth is thereÂ’s nothing to find. But to reach such an understanding you need a teacher and you need to struggle to make yourself understand. Life and death are important. DonÂ’t suffer them in vain...<br><br>~ 1st Zen Patriarch, Bodhidharma</div>
