            <div class='col-md body'>The teachings of the Buddha revolves around this central tenant known as the <strong>"Four Noble Truths"</strong>. The Four Noble Truths form the central foundation of Buddhism. <span style="font-style: italic;">So, what are the Four Noble Truths?</span><br><br>The <strong>First Noble Truth </strong>states that <strong>"Life is Dukka". </strong>"Dukka" is very often translated as "sufferings", but I feel it's a very inadequate translation. A much better translation is <strong>"Unsatisfactoriness". </strong>Basically, the First Noble Truth states that life is unsatisfactory and imperfect. How so? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">All of us are subject to pain and sufferings. All of us cannot avoid disease, old age and death. We are subject to impermanence and uncertainty.</span> Very often, we have to associate with things that are unpleasant and disassociate with things that are pleasant. All these are unsatisfactory.<br><br>Buddha saw that the world was a place of <strong>suffering or 'unsatisfactoriness'</strong>. Whatever happiness could be attained <span style="text-decoration: underline;">could not withstand the inevitable onslaught of old age, sickness and death.</span> Suffering or dukkha is the first noble truth that in his search for enlightenment the Buddha came to see very clearly. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">As human beings, suffering is part of our lives, whether physical, mental or emotional. More fundamentally, there is a sense within us that life cannot bring lasting satisfaction.</span> Life is <strong>impermanent and ever-changing,</strong> and <strong>any happiness </strong>that we enjoy is <strong>unstable</strong>.<br><br>In certain countries we see a great deal of poverty and disease: these are sufferings of the first category. Everybody realizes that these are suffering conditions to be eliminated and improved upon. In many Western countries, poverty may not be that much of a problem, but where there is a high degree of material development there are different kinds of problems. At first we may be happy having overcome the problems that our predecessors faced, <strong>but as soon as we have solved certain problems, new ones arise</strong>. We have plenty of money, plenty of food and nice housing, but by exaggerating the value of these things we render them ultimately worthless. This sort of experience is the suffering of change.<br><br>A very poor, underprivileged person might think that it would be wonderful to have a car or a television set and, should he acquire them, would at first feel very happy and satisfied. Now, if such happiness were permanent, as long as he had the car and the TV set he would remain happy. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">But he does not; his happiness goes away. After a few months he wants another kind of car; if he has the money, he will buy a better television set. The old things, the same objects that once gave him much satisfaction, now cause dissatisfaction. That is the nature of change; that is the problem of the suffering of change.</span><br><br><strong>But why is this so?</strong> Why is it so no matter how much we get/have we will never be satified or happy?<br><br>This answer lie in the <strong>Second Noble Truth</strong>-<span style="text-decoration: underline;">the cause of suffering</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Buddha had observed that life is suffering. Before He could find a solution to the problem of suffering in life, he had to first look for the cause of suffering. The Buddha was just like a good doctor who first observes a patientÂ’s symptoms and identifies the cause of the illness before prescribing a cure. Generally, the <strong>ultimate cause is the mind</strong>.The Buddha discovered that the mind is influenced by negative thoughts which are <strong>desire</strong> or <strong>craving</strong>, and <strong>ignorance</strong>. <strong>This is the truth of the cause of suffering, which is the Second Noble Truth. </strong><br><br><strong>Craving</strong> is the deep-seated desire that all living beings have for the pleasures of the senses and for life itself. For instance, people always seek to enjoy good food, entertainment and pleasant company. Yet none of these can give them complete and lasting satisfaction. After the fine meal has been eaten, the beautiful music heard and the pleasant company shared, one is still not content. One would like to enjoy these pleasures again and again, and for as long as possible<br><br>People who desire to own many things <span style="text-decoration: underline;">can never be fully satisfied too</span>. <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Like children in a toy shop, they crave for all the attractive things they see around them. But like children too, they soon become dissatisfied with what they already have and desire for more. Sometimes, they can hardly eat or sleep until they get what they want. Yet when they succeeded in getting what they want, they may still find their happiness short-lived. Many will be too worried for the safety and condition of their new possessions to enjoy it. Then when the object they possess eventually breaks into pieces and has to be thrown away, they will suffer its loss even more.</strong></span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">When we have obtained something that we desire, we may want more and more of it and so greed arises</span>. Because of desire and greed, people will lie, cheat and steal to get what they want. Uncontrolled desires can also lead to addiction, for example, smoking, drinking and overeating all lead to suffering and cause mental and physical harm.<br><br>If one is prevented by another person from getting what one desires, one may feel anger with that person. Desire when obstructed can lead to ill will and anger. This in turn can lead to harsh words, violent quarrels and even fights or killings. All this is suffering.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Craving or desire is like a great tree having many branches. There are branches of greed, of ill will and of anger. The fruit of this tree is suffering, but how does the tree of craving arise? Where does it grow? The answer is that the tree of craving is rooted in <strong>ignorance</strong>. It grows out of ignorance. <strong>Ignorance is the inability to see the truth of things, to see things as they really are.</strong> There are many truths about the world which people are ignorant of because of the limitations of their understanding.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Science has shown, for instance, that there are sounds that people are unable to hear and waves of light, which they are unable to see. People would be totally unaware of radio waves, or ultra-violet light rays if special instruments had not been developed to enable them to observe these things. So long as people remain ignorant of things about the world in which they live, they suffer from all kinds of misunderstandings and delusions</strong>.</span><br><br>This brings us to the <strong>disturbing negative minds</strong>, the delusions, which are mental factors. There are many different ways of presenting the discussion of the mind, but, in general, the mind itself is something that is mere clarity and awareness. When we speak of disturbing attitudes such as anger and attachment, we have to see how they are able to affect and pollute the mind; what, in fact, is their nature? This, then, is the discussion of the cause of suffering.<br><br>If we ask how <strong>attachment and anger arise</strong>, the answer is that they are undoubtedly<strong> assisted by our grasping at things to be true and inherently real.</strong> When, for instance, we are angry with something, we feel that the object is out there, solid, true and unimputed, and that we ourselves are likewise something solid and findable. Before we get angry, the object appears ordinary, but when our mind is influenced by anger, the object looks ugly, completely repulsive, nauseating; something we want to get rid of immediatelyÂ—it appears really to exist in that way: solid, independent and very unattractive. This appearance of Â“truly uglyÂ” fuels our anger. Yet when we see the same object the next day, when our anger has subsided, it seems more beautiful than it did the day before; itÂ’s the same object but it doesnÂ’t seem as bad. <strong>This shows how anger and attachment are influenced by our grasping at things as being true and unimputed. </strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>The root of all the disturbing negative minds is grasping at true existence; that this assists them and brings them about; that the closed-minded ignorance that grasps at things as being inherently, truly real is the basic source of all our suffering. Based on this grasping at true existence we develop all kinds of disturbing negative minds</strong></span><br><br><strong>Attachment</strong> to the <strong>self</strong>, which is then followed by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">grasping at things and becoming attached to them as Â“<strong>mine</strong>.Â”</span> At first there is a very solid, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">independent I that is very bigÂ—bigger than anything else</span>; this is the basis. From this gradually comes Â“this is mine; this is mine; this is mine.Â” Then Â“we, we, we.Â” Then, because of our taking this side, come Â“others, our enemies.Â” Towards I and mine, <strong>attachment arises</strong>. Towards him, her and them, we feel distance and anger; then jealousy and all such competitive feelings arise. Thus ultimately, the problem is this feeling of Â“IÂ”Â—not the mere I but the I with which <strong>we become obsessed</strong>. This gives rise to anger and irritation, along with harsh words and all the physical expressions of aversion and hatred.<br><br>The first stage is solely mental, the disturbing negative minds; in the second stage these negative minds express themselves in actions, karma. Immediately, the atmosphere is disturbed. With anger, for example, the atmosphere becomes tense, people feel uneasy. If somebody gets furious, gentle people try to avoid that person. Later on, the person who got angry also feels embarrassed and ashamed for having said all sorts of absurd things, whatever came into his or her mind. <strong>When you get angry, thereÂ’s no room for logic or reason; you become literally mad. Later, when your mind has returned to normal, you feel ashamed. </strong>ThereÂ’s <strong>nothing good </strong>about <strong>anger</strong> and <strong>attachment</strong>; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nothing good can result from them. </span>They may be difficult to control, but everybody can realize that there is nothing good about them. This, then, is the second noble truth. Now the question arises whether or not these kinds of negative mind can be eliminated.<br><br>The answer lie in the third Noble truth-<strong>The truth of the cessation of suffering </strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The main Teaching of the Buddha <strong>focuses NOT ON philosophical speculations about a Creator God or the origin of the universe, nor on a heaven world ever after.</strong> The Teaching, instead, is <span style="color: darkred;">centred on the down-to- earth reality of human suffering and the urgent need to find lasting relief from all forms of discontent.</span> The Buddha gave the simile of a man shot by a poison-tipped arrow who, before he would call a doctor to treat him, demanded to know first who shot the arrow and where the arrow was made and of what and by whom and when and where ... this foolish man would surely die before his questions could be well answered. In the same way, the Buddha said, the urgent need of our existence is to find lasting relief from recurrent suffering which robs us of happiness and leaves us in strife.<br><br>Philosophical speculations are of secondary importance and, anyway, they are best left until after one has well trained the mind in meditation to the stage where one has the ability to examine the matter clearly and find the Truth for oneself.<br><br>Thus, the central Teaching of the Buddha, around which all other teachings revolve is the <span style="color: darkred;">Four Noble Truths</span>:<br><br>1. That all forms of being, human and otherwise, are <span style="color: darkred;">afflicted with suffering</span>.<br><br>2. That the cause of this suffering is Craving, born of the <span style="color: darkred;">illusion of a soul </span><br><br>3. That this suffering has a lasting end in the Experience of Enlightenment (Nibbana) which is the <span style="color: darkred;">complete letting go of the illusion of soul and all consequent desire and aversion</span>.<br><br>4. That this peaceful and blissful Enlightenment is achieved through a gradual training, a Path which is called the <span style="color: darkred;">Middle Way or the Eightfold Path</span>.<br><br>It would be mistaken to label this Teaching as 'pessimistic' on the grounds that it begins by centring on suffering. Rather, Buddhism is 'realistic' in that it unflinchingly faces up to the truth of life's many sufferings and it is 'optimistic' in that it shows a final end of the problem of suffering - Nibbana,<br><br>Enlightenment in this very life! Those who have achieved this ultimate peace are the inspiring examples who demonstrate once and for all that Buddhism is far from pessimistic, but it is a <span style="color: darkred;">Path to true Happiness</span>.<br><br></div>
