              Two men were by a tree. One was on the top of tree plucking mangoes and enjoying it and and at the same time dropping some for the other man underneath the tree. After a lapse of some time, the one on the top of the three shouted to the one at bottom of the tree that there is a bullock cart approaching and that he could see it. The one below shouted back and told him that he is lying and that he does see any â€¦.. After awhile, the one on the top told him I cannot force u to see what I see, if u are not willing to climb up and see and yet partake of what I am experiencing. Jesus, Krishna, Mohd, Buddha and m an y others were beckoning those masses to make the ascend and that of course entails dropping â€¦.. so as to make the climb easier. Dropping here means dropping all that weighs one down (psychological baggage, psychological hangovers and knowledge).
              
              Many simply adopt the stance of being defensive when the possibility of knowing that one is simply stuck and stunting oneâ€™s spiritual growth is overlooked. One has to grapple with this â€“ one either grows up or grows old. The former can be likened to spiritual growth (knwoing/spiritual). The latter is that of growing old (knowlege/psychological).
               This seems to be the predicament of MOST who simply believe without going beyond the beliefs. There is no transcedental experiencing at all. Religion (organised) is symbolized by the man underneath the tree. Spirituality is symbolised by the man on the top of the tree.
               It only makes sense and resonates with one who is sincere and self-honest and that entails asking oneself m i being self-honest about my growth and even than the question of whether it is spiritual or psychological will sooner or later (even when denied) manifest itself

              <p>Hi Dharmadhatu,</p>
              <p>I don't think i am really qualified to talk about
              self-liberation. I am really at the very early stage of it.</p>
              <p>From my limited experience, all i can say is that thoughts will
              be clearly seen...  When there is no-self and there is
              clarity, thoughts are not followed.  This allows the thoughts
              to be clearly seen and dissolve. .  At times, thoughts may
              even cease. That mean, when the last thought dissolve there is a
              temporary space where no thought arise.</p>
              <p>So, I will not classify no-self as any particular state. It can
              have thoughts as well as being without thoughts. In the clarity,
              these thoughts are very vivid and their dissolving is also very
              vivd.</p>
              <p>Normally, with a sense of self... thoughts are fuzzy....
              thoughts form a continunous chain.</p>

              <p>Hi Simpo_, thanks for your explanation.  </p>
              <p>At this point, I am trying not to read too much so avoid building up too many conceptual models of what things should be.  I find that mind is beginning to rely on these models too much, rather than actually simply seeing what there is.</p>

              <p>I have read that Tulku Urgyen said that in rigpa, there is no
                                      definitely conceptual thoughts.  I have been thinking about
                                      this on and off for a long time too.  Maybe it has something
                                      to do with instantaneous self-liberation of thought when it arises
                                      due to recognition of its nature directly.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Just now I went to the bookstore, Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche described non-dual presence but still in terms of inherent view, he said something like thoughts arise from you, returns to you, you are the source and everything is the expression of that source. This is the source-view of substantial non-dualism.</p>
              <p>Reminded me of what Thusness told me in 2009:</p>
              <p>(7:53 PM) Thusness:    Tulku Urgyen makes a good statement but that is before understanding stage 5 and 6.<br>(7:53 PM) Thusness:    that is without the source, nothing happens<br>(7:55 PM) Thusness:    However in Buddhism, insight is to see, penetrate and investigate and become thoroughly clear that the idea of a source, an essence is unnecessary.  Once you experience and arise the insight of anatta, u begin open to happening without source, without the need of an essence.<br>(7:56 PM) Thusness:    This is then the beginning of Buddhism.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then I saw one of his students' book... It went something like "The essence of what thinks is dharmakaya. The thinking itself is <strong>not </strong>dharmakaya, but the <em>Identity </em>of that which thinks is dharmakaya. Thinking is thought. Thinking is not the thought-free state. It is the identity of that which thinks which is thought-free."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is very Advaita view... no different from the Brahman of Upanishads:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em style="font-size: 1em;">“Not that which the eye sees, but that 
                                      whereby the eye can see, know that alone to be Eternal and not what 
                                      people here adore. Not that which the ear hears but that whereby the ear
                                       can hear, know that alone to be Eternal and not what people here adore.
                                       Not that which the mind thinks but that whereby the mind can think, 
                                      know that alone to be Eternal, and not what people here adore.”</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That is why Thusness also told me days ago regarding some others though it applies here as well,</p>
              <p><em>I understand what he meant and but the way it is taught is misleading.  It<br>is 
              simply non-dual experience and experiencing both presence in the<br>foreground 
              and background and in the 3 states.  That is not realizing our<br>true empty 
              nature but our luminous essence (However Dzogchen uses the term<br>nature and 
              essence different from how I used them).  If you hold steadfastly<br>this 
              non-dual luminous state, it helps in lucid dreaming and remember what I<br>told 
              u to tell ur teacher chen?  Nevertheless, that is not that important<br>but 
              understand the difference between luminosity and empty nature.<br><br>Very 
              often, ppl rely on the experience and not true realization of the view.<br>The 
              right view is like a neutralizer that neutralizes dualistic and 
              inherent<br>views; by itself, there is nothing to hold. So realize what right 
              view is<br>pointing and all experiences will come naturally.  The right 
              enlightenment<br>experience is like what dogen described, not merely a non-dual 
              state where<br>experiencer and what experienced collapses into a non-dual stream 
              of<br>experience.  This I have told u clearly.<br><br>Ur current understanding 
              and experience is able to discern the difference<br>and should be should be 
              quite clear now.  What lacks is the total exertion<br>as I told u.  Just focus 
              on that.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>True depth of insight is rare... even among famous masters... an unfortunate fact. I prefer what Dakpo Tashi Namgyal says:</p>
              <p><br> <strong>http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2008/11/few-excerpts-from-clarifying-natural.html</strong></p>
              <p><strong><br> "When you look into a thought's identity, without having to dissolve the
                                   thought and without having to force it out by meditation, the vividness
                                   of the thought is itself the indescribable and naked state of aware 
                                  emptiness. We call this <em>seeing the natural face of innate thought</em> or <em>thought dawns as dharmakaya</em>.</strong></p>

              <p>Thanks for all the references... they are very clear and I think Dakpo Namgyal's way of investigating is quite useful.</p>

              <p>Quote from AEN : </p>
              <p>An advise I often give which in my experience is a highly effective method for realizing no-self: "spend quality hours (or however much time you can afford) everyday practicing being naked in awareness (whether in sitting meditation or in movement), which is to say hear the sounds as clear as can be in its pristine clarity and vividness… observe/experience the minutest details of sensations in its crystal clarity and aliveness, the sights, smells, taste, touch. Then contemplate and notice the fact that “there is no experiencer behind experience, just the experience” or “in seeing just the shapes, colours, forms, no seer”... this can eventually lead to non dual experience and insight.”</p>

              <p>"No matter which of the conceptual thoughts of the five poisons may arise --<br>the afflictions that move toward their mental objects--<br>do not engage in any mental artifice, either anticipating them or following after them.<br>Instead, allowing the mental fluctuations to settle into their own state, one is liberated into the Dharma body."<br><br>This implies that stillness can occur during the fluctuations.

              <p>"Do not see the various disturbances of awareness that occur during the son's path<br>as either faults or virtues. Instead meet them head-on, and incorporate them into the path."</p>
              <p>And also:</p>
              <p>"By concentrating on the meaning of the letter HUM<br>my mind enters into the great space of reality; and from that state<br>awareness suddenly arises on its own in a single instant."</p>
              <p>This is telling us that fluctuations exist while the mind is still.  Therefore, within the present context. it seems to me a contradiction to accept on the one hand that conceptual thoughts are the Dharma body and to accept on the other that it is impossible for there to be stillness while there are mental fluctuations.  But this should be examined in greater detail.</p>
              <p>This position (that a still mind can be subject to fluctuations and vice versa) is not unique to the Nyingthig tradition, for the Clear Expanse states:</p>
              <p>"The mind that grasps at things dualistically<br>arises from the six objects of clear gnosis."</p>
              <p>So fluctuations can exist while there is stillness. Once again, Longchenpa states:  </p>
              <p>"No matter how the mind fluctuates, settle naturally into the natural state.<br>The meaning of reality becomes clear within the very movement and scattering of thought."</p>
              <p><br>So there can be mental stillness even while one is experiencing fluctuations.</p>

              <p>Yes, in this case the stillness means not doing anything or attaching to the very movement of mind itself. It does not however mean that movement of mind cannot arise. This means resting into the natural state (the empty-vividness of that very thought itself), self-arising and self-liberating. Then in the midst of thought itself, there is no movement at all. There is no subject and object, no thinker apart from thought, and therefore no movement (as transience experienced non-dualistically is always simply a complete-in-itself non-dual happening and self-releasing without movement). However the moment we conceive of a subject and an object, we also automatically conceive of movement, which is delusional. There is in truth no thinker, no thought, no movement... just the suchness of primordially pure and unborn appearance.</p>
              <p>If one does not rest naturally, but instead becomes very agitated or attached to the mind movements, rather than resting in the natural state of the thought, there is instead a seeking after the contents of thoughts as if they were real, and to do so is to cause a chain of deluded thinking without any stillness. This is the meaning of 'getting carried away' or 'distraction'. This is akin to being in a dream and taking the dream to be real, so one chases after the objects in the dream. In actuality the dream is simply a movement of mind, completely vivid yet unreal. If you are lucid dreaming and you know the tiger is your own projection, will you get agitated? No. This means 'stillness in the midst of thought'. And if you discover a state of complete stillness, there is no need to get elated about it too, since that stillness is just as 'empty and aware' as the thought of a tiger. In both cases their identity is just an intangible awareness. All states are primordially pure, and all states are nothing to be grasped!</p>

              <p>Tarthang Tulku:</p>
              <p><br>"It's possible to make thought itself meditation... How do we go    
                                   into that state? The moment you try to separate 
              yourself from                         thought, you are dealing with a 
              duality, a subject-object                         relationship. You lose
               the state of awareness because you reject                         your 
              experience and become separate from it.... But if our                   
                    awareness is in the center of thought, the thought itself         
                              dissolves... At the very beginning... stay in the 
              thoughts. Just be                         there... You become the center
               of the thought. But there is not                         really any 
              center -- the center becomes balance. There's no                        
               'being,' no 'subject-object relationships': none of these              
                         categories exist. Yet at the same time, there is... complete 
                                      openness... So we kind of crack each thought, 
              like cracking nuts.                         If we can do this, any 
              thought becomes meditation... Any moment,                         
              wherever you are, driving a car, sitting around, working, talking,      
                                 any activities you have -- even if you are very 
              disturbed                         emotionally, very passionate, or even 
              if your mind has become very                         strong, raging, 
              overcome with the worst possible things and you                         
              cannot control yourself, or you feel depressed... if you really go      
                                 into it, there's nothing there. Whatever comes up 
              becomes your                         meditation. Even if you become 
              extremely tense, if you go into your                         thought and
               your awareness comes alive, that moment can be more                    
                   powerful than working a long time in meditation practice. (pp.
