            <div class='col-md body'><p>Khenpo Tsultrim Rinpoche's book is good. But in my experience, the Prasangika Madhyamika view is higher than the Shentong view since the Shentong still establishes a true existence of clear light, a fault present in non-Buddhist traditions as well. Loppon Namdrol once debated with Khenpo Tsultrim Rinpoche on Shentong, and Khenpo Tsultrim Rinpoche had to admit that the view of Shentong is no different from Advaita Vedanta except for the former's emphasis on Buddhahood.<br>                    <br>However, Madhyamika view is intellectually derived, so one must have direct realization of Clear Light, then realize anatta and emptiness to further deconstruct the view of inherent existence to realize the inseparability of luminosity and emptiness (not emptiness of other).<br>                                            <br>Chogyal Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche said that the Dzogchen view is philosophically the same as Prasangika Madhyamika, only that the former is from direct experience while the latter from intellectual inference.<br>                                        <br>Khenpo Tsultrim Rinpoche has certain insight into emptiness (the illusory, dream-like nature of what dependently originates) as well as non-dual luminosity, but I don't see the experiential description of anatta. But what Tsultrim Rinpoche has described for example, cannot be found in texts of Zen Master Dogen, and what Zen Master Dogen described cannot be found in what is described by Tsultrim Rinpoche. Both are important. As Thusness said, there needs to be a balance.<br>                            <br>Actually I have been reflecting and noticing that very few practitioners and masters have direct realization of luminosity and realizes its emptiness... vast majority falls into substantial non-dualism (the other day I was telling Thusness that I had trouble finding modern Chinese Mahayana masters who described anatta as I wanted to let my mom read since almost all of them are about One Mind, which he agrees). Those who realize anatta I can count by my fingers... As for Shentong, it is not just purely Advaita view or purely substantial non-dualism since it does factor in dependent origination and emptiness, however it is still unable to factor in anatta to dissolve the view of true existence of the Clear Light as absolute reality in the way Alex Weith does: <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2011/10/zen-exploration-of-bahiya-sutta.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2011/10/zen-exploration-of-bahiya-sutta.html</a>.<br>        <br>Actually I was thinking Simpo_'s deepening of the insight of anatta only came after his insight into D.O./emptiness... in other words when he realized D.O./emptiness, he was still at substantial non-dual phase. May he correct me if I'm wrong. So my point is Thusness Stage 6 may not come only after Stage 5, the steps aren't linear. For Simpo and others, it is from 1 to 4, then skip to 6 before visiting 5 to dissolve that last trace.</p></div>

              <p>Yep, AEN is correct.</p>
              <p>In my case, the stabilise realisation of No-self (anatta) came after the early/initial insight of emptiness.</p>
              <p>Before the stablisation of no-self, there was still substantial efforting in getting into the 'view'.</p>
              <p>The irony is that once the no-self experience is stabilised, one will wonder why did one not see it in the first place. This is because it is so direct. It is as if one is beating around the bush for years just to see the most obvious and direct. However, on hindsight, all the years of practice is really just clearing enough obscurations (habit as well as conceptual conditionings).</p>
              <p>My feeling is that the next stage is actually about the stabilisation of emptiness.</p>
              <p>In my experience, the initial insights will come first. Then there will be followed by cycles that will revisit these insights until a stabilisation of each insight occurs.</p>

              of insight unfolds for people. Some experience/realize I AM after non-dual,
              some before. Like Joan Tollifson puts it... rather than a linear stage
              progression, sometimes it is more like a spiral going back and forth, though
              that is also just a relative perspective of things. The spiralling continues
              until one sees with utter conviction that all phenomena shares the same taste,
              that everything in its primordial purity is Dharmakaya itself.</span></div>

              <p>Yep, AEN is correct.</p>
              <p>In my case, the stabilise realisation of No-self (anatta) came
              after the early/initial insight of emptiness.</p>
              <p>Before the stablisation of no-self, there was still substantial

              <p>The irony is that once the no-self experience is stabilised, one
              will wonder why did one not see it in the first place. This is
              because it is so direct. It is as if one is beating around the bush
              for years just to see the most obvious and direct. However, on
              hindsight, all the years of practice is really just clearing enough
              obscurations (habit as well as conceptual conditionings).</p>
              <p>My feeling is that the next stage is actually about the

              <p>In my experience, the initial insights will come first. Then
              there will be followed by cycles that will revisit these insights

              <p>I am referring to the 'view' of no-self. Actually, the word view can be misleading but there is no way to describe it.</p>
              <p>Put it another way, before the stabilisation of no-self... it is hard to see how the 'sense of self' is muddled in the contents/thoughts. One will have a tendency to apply effort to get into a particular preferred state. With the stabilisation of no-self, this effort is correctly understood as 'sense of self' efforting. Every effort that is being applied causes the arising of the sense of self. It is like a dog trying to bite its own tail... going around in loop.</p>
              <p><em>Also, what triggered off the insight into emptiness in the first
                              place?</em></p>
              <p>There is no way to really trigger an insight into emptiness apart from deconstructing. But then deconstruction can also lead to other experiences... Also when the insight comes it will be when least expected.</p>
              <p>Prior to insight into emptiness, there may be a strong luminosity experience... but one must not get attached to it and let it go. This may allow the other characteristics (eg emptiness) to shine through.</p>
              <p>There is a distinction between experience and realisation. In the realisation, there is a knowing. In an experience, there is a misinterpretation. For example, these experiences can be quite similar to Kundalini arising... The main difference is that an experience can be a misinterpretation of what actually happened.</p>
              <p>A misinterpretation of what actually happened will prevent further and deeper experiences.</p>
              <p>For example, if one has an I AM experience and believe that there is an eternal witness/observer. ... he/she will not be able to have a non-dual experience. Thus the opportunity to directly understand/realise non-duality is severed by the misinterpretation caused by the I AM experience. This same thing applies to the realisation of emptiness and no-self.</p>
              <p>Actually...all experiences are already no-self and empty... It is because this is so that liberation is possible.</p>

              <p>Yes, imo, thoughts can be awareness as well. Otherwise no-self will be a thoughtless state... and one will not be able to function. But it is not.</p>
              <p>Additionally, there is also a distinction between 'awareness distracted' and 'awareness undistracted.' IMO, the former is unaware of the characteristic(nature/essence) of an experience.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p><em>Hi Simpo, what is the 'view' that you were efforting to get
              into at that point? </em></p>
              <p>I am referring to the 'view' of no-self. Actually, the word view
              can be misleading but there is no way to describe it.</p>
              <p>Put it another way, before the stabilisation of no-self... it is
              hard to see how the 'sense of self' is muddled in the
              contents/thoughts. One will have a tendency to apply effort to get
              into a particular preferred state. With the stabilisation of
              no-self, this effort is correctly understood as 'sense of self'
              efforting. Every effort that is being applied causes the arising of
              the sense of self. It is like a dog trying to bite its own tail...
              going around in loop.</p>
              <p><em>Also, what triggered off the insight into emptiness in the
              first place?</em></p>
              <p>There is no way to really trigger an insight into emptiness
              apart from deconstructing. But then deconstruction can also lead to
              other experiences... Also when the insight comes it will be when
              least expected.</p>
              <p>Prior to insight into emptiness, there may be a strong
              luminosity experience... but one must not get attached to it and
              let it go. This may allow the other characteristics (eg emptiness)
              to shine through.</p>
              <p>There is a distinction between experience and realisation. In
              the realisation, there is a knowing. In an experience, there is a
              misinterpretation. For example, these experiences can be quite
              similar to Kundalini arising... The main difference is that an
              experience can be a misinterpretation of what actually
              happened.</p>
              <p>A misinterpretation of what actually happened will prevent
              further and deeper experiences.</p>
              <p>For example, if one has an I AM experience and believe that
              there is an eternal witness/observer. ... he/she will not be able
              to have a non-dual experience. Thus the opportunity to directly
              understand/realise non-duality is severed by the misinterpretation
              caused by the I AM experience. This same thing applies to the
              realisation of emptiness and no-self.</p>
              <p>Actually...all experiences are already no-self and empty... It
              is because this is so that liberation is possible.</p>

              <p>Yes, imo, thoughts can be awareness as well. Otherwise no-self

              <p>I have read that Tulku Urgyen said that in rigpa, there is no definitely conceptual thoughts.  I have been thinking about this on and off for a long time too.  Maybe it has something to do with instantaneous self-liberation of thought when it arises due to recognition of its nature directly.</p>

Try to imagine that, imagine space. Can you imagine space? You can imagine it is empty, but that is a thought. Does that thought help anything? To meditate on a thing means bringing that to mind, but can you bring space to mind? Okay, space is empty. To keep that in mind is another thought. But without thinking anything, meditate on space. Can you? Isn’t it better to leave it unimagined? Unmeditated? That is why it is said: The supreme meditation is to not meditate. The supreme training is to keep nothing in mind. While resting free of anything to imagine, like space, do not be distracted for even one instant. The one who trains like that can truly be called a ‘space yogi’. A yogi is an individual who connects with that which is naturally so. Space means that which always is. Remain without imagining anything at all, not meditating on anything. Once you start to meditate on space, it becomes an imitation. Simply allow the space to not wander. Remain undistracted. There is no impetus for any thoughts to reoccur. A thought is a mental way of formulating something — in other words, our attention formulates a thought. The thought doesn’t come from anywhere else. If we don’t think, where would a thought come from? In the basic space that is unimaginable, remain undistractedly. Let your indescribable awareness remain undistracted in the naked state of basic space. It doesn’t have to be imagined, because this basic space that is utterly naked is our own nature already. You don’t have to imagine that this is so.” -Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche</span></p>

There is a way to promptly rid yourself of birth-and-death. It is by grasping the reason for the eternal immutability of the 'mind-nature.' The gist of it is this: although once the body is born it proceeds inevitably to death, the mind-nature never perishes. Once you can realize that the mind-nature, which does not transmigrate in birth-and-death, exists in your own body, you make it your fundamental nature. Hence the body, being only a temporary form, dies here and is reborn there without end, yet the mind is immutable, unchanging throughout past, present, and future. To know this is to be free from birth-and-death. By realizing this truth, you put a final end to the transmigratory cycle in which you have been turning. When your body dies, you enter the ocean of the original nature. When you return to your origin in this ocean, you become endowed with the wondrous virtue of the Buddha-patriarchs. But even if you are able to grasp this in your present life, because your present physical existence embodies erroneous karma from prior lives, you are not the same as the sages.<br><br>"Those who fail to grasp this truth are destined to turn forever in the cycle of birth-and-death. What is necessary, then, is simply to know without delay the meaning of the mind-nature's immutability. What can you expect to gain from idling your entire life away in purposeless sitting?"<br><br>What do you think of this statement? Is it essentially in accord with the Way of the Buddhas and patriarchs?<br><br><br><br>Answer 10:<br><br>You have just expounded the view of the Senika heresy. It is certainly not the Buddha Dharma.<br><br>According to this heresy, there is in the body a spiritual intelligence. As occasions arise this intelligence readily discriminates likes and dislikes and pros and cons, feels pain and irritation, and experiences suffering and pleasure - it is all owing to this spiritual intelligence. But when the body perishes, this spiritual intelligence separates from the body and is reborn in another place. While it seems to perish here, it has life elsewhere, and thus is immutable and imperishable. Such is the standpoint of the Senika heresy.<br><br>But to learn this view and try to pass it off as the Buddha Dharma is more foolish than clutching a piece of broken roof tile supposing it to be a golden jewel. Nothing could compare with such a foolish, lamentable delusion. Hui-chung of the T'ang dynasty warned strongly against it. Is it not senseless to take this false view - that the mind abides and the form perishes - and equate it to the wondrous Dharma of the Buddhas; to think, while thus creating the fundamental cause of birth-and-death, that you are freed from birth-and-death? How deplorable! Just know it for a false, non-Buddhist view, and do not lend a ear to it.<br><br>I am compelled by the nature of the matter, and more by a sense of compassion, to try to deliver you from this false view. You must know that the Buddha Dharma preaches as a matter of course that body and mind are one and the same, that the essence and the form are not two. This is understood both in India and in China, so there can be no doubt about it. Need I add that the Buddhist doctrine of immutability teaches that all things are immutable, without any differentiation between body and mind. The Buddhist teaching of mutability states that all things are mutable, without any differentiation between essence and form. In view of this, how can anyone state that the body perishes and the mind abides? It would be contrary to the true Dharma.<br><br>Beyond this, you must also come to fully realize that birth-and-death is in and of itself nirvana. Buddhism never speaks of nirvana apart from birth-and-death. Indeed, when someone thinks that the mind, apart from the body, is immutable, not only does he mistake it for Buddha-wisdom, which is free from birth-and-death, but the very mind that makes such a discrimination is not immutable, is in fact even then turning in birth-and-death. A hopeless situation, is it not?<br><br>You should ponder this deeply: since the Buddha Dharma has always maintained the oneness of body and mind, why, if the body is born and perishes, would the mind alone, separated from the body, not be born and die as well? If at one time body and mind were one, and at another time not one, the preaching of the Buddha would be empty and untrue. Moreover, in thinking that birth-and-death is something we should turn from, you make the mistake of rejecting the Buddha Dharma itself. You must guard against such thinking.<br><br>Understand that what Buddhists call the Buddhist doctrine of the mind-nature, the great and universal aspect encompassing all phenomena, embraces the entire universe, without differentiating between essence and form, or concerning itself with birth or death. There is nothing - enlightenment and nirvana included - that is not the mind-nature. All dharmas, the "myriad forms dense and close" of the universe - are alike in being this one Mind. All are included without exception. All those dharmas, which serves as "gates" or entrances to the Way, are the same as one Mind. For a Buddhist to preach that there is no disparity between these dharma-gates indicates that he understands the mind-nature.<br><br>In this one Dharma [one Mind], how could there be any differentiate between body and mind, any separation of birth-and-death and nirvana? We are all originally children of the Buddha, we should not listen to madmen who spout non-Buddhist views.<br><br>..................<br><br>Chinese translation:<br><br>é�“å…ƒç¦…å¸ˆã€ŠåŠžé�“è¯�ã€‹-æ´ªæ–‡äº®è€�å¸ˆ(æ—¥ä¸­)ç¿»è¯‘ (12/11/2009)<br>é—®ï¼šæœ‰äººè¯´ä¸�è¦�æ€•ç”Ÿæ­»ï¼Œå› ä¸ºæœ‰ä¸€ç§�å¾ˆå¿«å�¯ä»¥å‡ºç¦»ç”Ÿæ­»çš„æ–¹æ³•ã€‚è¿™å°±æ˜¯è¯´å�ªè¦�çŸ¥é�“å¿ƒæ€§å¸¸ä½�å°±å¯¹äº†ã€‚æ­¤èº«æœ‰ç”Ÿæœ‰ç�­ï¼Œå�¯æ˜¯å¿ƒæ€§å�´ä¸�ç�­ã€‚å�‡å¦‚çŸ¥é�“ä¸�ç”Ÿä¸�ç�­çš„å¿ƒæ€§åœ¨æˆ‘ä»¬çš„èº«ä¸­ï¼Œå°±æ˜¯æˆ‘ä»¬æœ¬æ€§ï¼Œè€Œèº«ä½“æ˜¯ä¸€ä¸ªå�‡ç›¸ï¼Œæ­»æ­¤ç”Ÿå½¼ä¸�å®šï¼Œå¿ƒå�´å¸¸ä½�åœ¨è¿‡åŽ»çŽ°åœ¨æœªæ�¥è€Œä¸�å�˜ï¼Œå¦‚èƒ½è¿™æ ·äº†è§£ä¾¿æ°¸è¿œè§£è„±ç”Ÿæ­»ã€‚æ­¤ç”Ÿæ­»æ—¶ï¼Œå�³å…¥æ€§æµ·ï¼Œå…¥æ€§æµ·è‡ªç„¶å°±æœ‰è¯¸ä½›å¦‚æ�¥çš„å¦™å¾·ï¼ŒçŽ°åœ¨è™½ç„¶å·²ç»�æ˜Žç™½è¿™ä¸ªé�“ç�†ï¼Œå› ä¸ºè¢«å‰�ä¸–çš„å¦„ä¸šæ‰€æˆ�çš„èº«ä½“è¿˜åœ¨ï¼Œæ‰€ä»¥è¿˜ä¸�èƒ½å’Œè¯¸åœ£ä¸€æ ·ã€‚å¦‚æžœè¿˜ä¸�çŸ¥é�“æ­¤ç�†ï¼Œé‚£å°±æ°¸è¿œä¼šåœ¨ç”Ÿæ­»æµ·ä¸­å¤´å‡ºå¤´æ²¡ã€‚å› æ­¤ä¹‹æ•…ï¼Œå�ªè¦�ä½ èµ¶å¿«æ˜Žäº†å¿ƒæ€§çš„å¸¸ä½�ï¼Œä½•å¿…é—²å��ç©ºè¿‡ä¸€ç”Ÿï¼Œç­‰å¾…ç©ºèŠ±ç»“æžœï¼Ÿè¿™æ ·çš„è¯´æ³•ï¼Œæ˜¯è¯¸ä½›è¯¸ç¥–æ­£ä¼ çš„æ³•å�—ï¼Ÿ<br><br>ç­”ï¼šçŽ°åœ¨ä½ æ‰€è¯´çš„å®Œå…¨ä¸�æ˜¯ä½›æ³•ï¼Œæ˜¯ä»™å°¼å¤–é�“ä¹‹è§�ã€‚è¿™ä¸ªå¤–é�“ä¹‹è§�æ˜¯è¯´ï¼Œæˆ‘ä»¬èº«ä½“é‡Œæœ‰ä¸ªç�µçŸ¥ï¼Œè¿™ä¸ªçŸ¥ï¼Œé�‡ç¼˜å°±èƒ½åˆ†åˆ«å–„æ�¶æ˜¯é�žã€�ç—›ç—’è‹¦ä¹�ã€‚è€Œæ­¤ç�µæ€§å½“æ­¤ç”Ÿç�­æ—¶ï¼Œç¦»æ­¤ç”Ÿå½¼ï¼Œçœ‹æ�¥ä¼¼ä¹Žæ­¤ç�­å½¼ç”Ÿï¼Œæ‰€ä»¥è®¤ä¸ºå¸¸ä½�ä¸�ç�­ï¼Œè¿™æ˜¯å¤–é�“ä¹‹è§�ã€‚ä»–ä»¬ä»¥ä¸ºè¿™æ˜¯ä½›æ³•ï¼Œç®€ç›´æ˜¯æŠŠç“¦ç ¾å½“é‡‘å®�ï¼Œè¿™ç§�ç—´è¿·çœŸå�¯ç¾žï¼Œæ— ä»¥ä¸ºå–»ã€‚å¤§å”�å›½çš„æ…§å¿ å›½å¸ˆæ·±è¯«è¿™ä¸ªè¯´æ³•ï¼Œè®¡è‘—å¿ƒå¸¸ç›¸ç�­çš„é‚ªè§�ï¼Œä»¥ä¸ºæ˜¯è¯¸ä½›çš„å¦™æ³•ï¼Œèµ·ç”Ÿæ­»çš„æœ¬å› ï¼Œè€Œä»¥ä¸ºèƒ½ç¦»ç”Ÿæ­»ï¼Œé�žæ„šä¸ºä½•ï¼Ÿå�¯å�¹å�¯ä¼¶ï¼�è¦�çŸ¥é�“è¿™æ˜¯å¤–é�“çš„é‚ªè§�ï¼Œä¸�å�¯å�¬ï¼�äº‹åˆ°å¦‚ä»Šä¸�å¾—å·²ï¼Œä¸ºäº†ä¼¶æ‚¯è¿™äº›äººï¼Œæ•‘æ•‘æ­¤é‚ªè§�ï¼Œæˆ‘å†�æ�¥ç”³è¯´ä¸€ç•ªã€‚<br><br>ä½›æ³•æœ¬æ�¥è¯´æ˜Žèº«å¿ƒä¸€å¦‚ã€�æ€§ç›¸ä¸�äºŒï¼Œå�°åº¦ä¸­å›½éƒ½çŸ¥é�“è¿™ä¸ªé�“ç�†ï¼Œå“ªèƒ½è¿�èƒŒï¼Ÿä½•å†µè‹¥è¦�è¯´å¸¸ä½�ï¼Œä¸‡æ³•éƒ½æ˜¯å¸¸ä½�ï¼Œä¸�åˆ†èº«ä¸Žå¿ƒï¼›è¦�è¯´å¯‚ç�­ï¼Œè¯¸æ³•éƒ½æ˜¯å¯‚ç�­ï¼Œè¿˜è¦�åˆ†å¿ƒä¸Žç›¸å�—ï¼Ÿè¯´èº«ç�­å¿ƒå¸¸ï¼Œä¸�æ˜¯è¿�èƒŒæ­£ç�†å�—ï¼Ÿä¸�å�ªè¿™æ ·ï¼Œåº”è¯¥è¦�äº†è§£ç”Ÿæ­»å°±æ˜¯æ¶…æ§ƒï¼Œä¸�å�¯ä»¥åœ¨ç”Ÿæ­»ä¹‹å¤–è¯´æ¶…æ§ƒã€‚å†�è¯´ï¼Œä»¥ä¸ºå¿ƒç¦»å¼€èº«ä½“è€Œå¸¸ä½�ï¼Œä»¥è¿™æ ·çš„äº†è§£ï¼Œå¦„è®¡ä¸ºè§£è„±ç”Ÿæ­»çš„ä½›æ™ºï¼Œè¦�çŸ¥é�“è¿™ä¸ªäº†è§£çŸ¥è§‰ä¹‹å¿ƒï¼Œè¿˜ä¸�æ˜¯åœ¨ç”Ÿç�­ä¸­è€Œä¸�å¸¸ä½�å�—ï¼Ÿè¿™ä¸ªè§�è§£ä¾¿ä¸�æ”»è‡ªç ´ã€‚ä»”ç»†ä½“ä¼šèº«å¿ƒä¸€å¦‚æ˜¯ä½›æ³•çš„è¦�æ—¨ï¼Œæ€Žä¹ˆè¯´æ­¤èº«ç”Ÿç�­æ—¶ï¼Œå”¯ç‹¬æ­¤å¿ƒç¦»èº«è€Œä¸�ç”Ÿç�­ï¼�å�‡å¦‚æœ‰æ—¶ä¸€å¦‚ï¼Œæœ‰æ—¶é�žä¸€å¦‚çš„è¯�ï¼Œä½›æ‰€è¯´çš„è‡ªç„¶éƒ½æ˜¯è™šå¦„ä¸�å�¯ä¿¡ã€‚å�ˆè®¤ä¸ºç”Ÿæ­»å¿…é¡»è¦�åŽŒç¦»ï¼Œéš¾å…�å°±çŠ¯äº†è°¤ä½›ä¹‹ç½ªï¼Œå�¯ä¸�æ…Žå“‰ï¼Ÿè¦�çŸ¥é�“ä½›æ³•æœ‰å¿ƒæ€§å¤§æ€»ç›¸æ³•é—¨ï¼ŒåŒ…æ‹¬ä¸€å¤§æ³•ç•Œï¼Œä¸�åˆ†æ€§ç›¸ï¼Œä¸�è¯´ç”Ÿç�­ï¼Œè�©æ��æ¶…æ§ƒä¹Ÿéƒ½æ˜¯å¿ƒæ€§ã€‚ä¸€åˆ‡è¯¸æ³•ä¸‡è±¡æ£®ç½—éƒ½æ˜¯ä¸€å¿ƒï¼Œè¿™äº›è¯¸æ³•çš†å¹³ç­‰ä¸€å¿ƒï¼Œæ¯«æ— å·®åˆ«ï¼Œè¿™æ˜¯ä½›å®¶æ‰€è¯´çš„å¿ƒæ€§ã€‚å�¯ä»¥åœ¨ä¸€æ³•ä¸Šåˆ†èº«å¿ƒï¼Œåˆ†ç”Ÿæ­»æ¶…æ§ƒå�—ï¼Ÿæ—¢ç„¶æˆ‘ä»¬éƒ½æ˜¯ä½›çš„å­¦ç”Ÿï¼Œä¸�è¦�åŽ»å�¬ç‹‚äººèƒ¡è¨€ä¹±è¯­ã€�è¿™äº›å¤–é�“ä¹‹è§�ã€‚</p>

              <p>Hi Dharmadhatu,</p>
              <p>I don't think i am really qualified to talk about self-liberation. I am really at the very early stage of it.</p>
              <p>From my limited experience, all i can say is that thoughts will be clearly seen...  When there is no-self and there is clarity, thoughts are not followed.  This allows the thoughts to be clearly seen and dissolve. .  At times, thoughts may even cease. That mean, when the last thought dissolve there is a temporary space where no thought arise.</p>
              <p>So, I will not classify no-self as any particular state. It can have thoughts as well as being without thoughts. In the clarity, these thoughts are very vivid and their dissolving is also very vivd.</p>
              <p>Normally, with a sense of self... thoughts are fuzzy.... thoughts form a continunous chain.</p>
