              <h4>Q: You have said that according to Buddhist philosophy there is no Creator, no God of creation,
                  and this may initially put off many people who believe in a divine principle. Can you explain
                  the difference between the Vajrayana Primordial Buddha and a Creator God?</h4>
              <p><strong>A: </strong>I understand the Primordial Buddha, also known as Buddha Samantabhadra, to be the ultimate
                  reality, the realm of the Dharmakaya-- the space of emptiness--where all phenomena, pure and
                  impure, are dissolved. This is the explanation taught by the Sutras and Tantras. However, in the
                  context of your question, the tantric tradition is the only one which explains the Dharmakaya
                  in terms of Inherent clear light, the essential nature of the mind; this would seem imply that
                  all phenomena, samsara and nirvana, arise from this clear and luminous source. Even the New
                  School of Translation came to the conclusion that the "state of rest" of a practitioner of the
                  Great Yoga--Great Yoga implies here the state of the practitioner who has reached a stage in
                  meditation where the most subtle experience of clear light has been realized--that for as long
                  as the practitioner remains in this ultimate sphere he or she remains totally free of any sort of
                  veil obscuring the mind, and is immersed in a state of great bliss.</p>
              <p>We can say, therefore, that this ultimate source, clear light, is close to the notion of a Creator,
                  since all phenomena, whether they belong to samsara or nirvana, originate therein. But we must
                  be careful in speaking of this source, we must not be led into error. I do not mean chat there
                  exists somewhere, there, a sort of collective clear light, analogous to the non-Buddhist concept
                  of Brahma as a substratum. We must not be inclined to deify this luminous space. We must
                  understand that when we speak of ultimate or inherent clear light, we are speaking on an
                  individual level.</p>
              <p>Likewise, when we speak of karma as the cause of the universe we eliminate the notion of a
                  unique entity called karma existing totally independently. Rather, collective karmic
                  impressions, accumulated individually, are at the origin of the creation of a world. When, in the
                  tantric context, we say that all worlds appear out of clear light, we do not visualize this source
                  as a unique entity, but as the ultimate clear light of each being. We can also, on the basis of its
                  pure essence, understand this clear light to be the Primordial Buddha. All the stages which make
                  up the life of each living being--death, the intermediate state, and rebirth--represent nothing
                  more than the various manifestations of the potential of clear light. It is both the most subtle
                  consciousness and energy. The more clear light loses its subtlety, the more your experiences
                  take shape.</p>
              <p>In this way, death and the intermediate state are moments where the gross manifestations
                  emanating from clear light are reabsorbed. At death we return to that original source, and from
                  there a slightly more gross state emerges to form the intermediate state preceding rebirth. At the
                  stage of rebirth, clear light is apparent in a physical incarnation. At death we return to this
                  source. And so on. The ability to recognize subtle clear light, also called the Primordial Buddha,
                  is equivalent to realizing nirvana, whereas ignorance of the nature of clear light leaves us to
                  wander in the different realms of samsaric existence.</p>
              <p>This is how I understand the concept of the Primordial Buddha. It would be a grave error to
                  conceive of it as an independent and autonomous existence from beginningless time. If we had
                  to accept the idea of an independent creator, the explanations given in the <em>Pramanavartika, </em>the
                  "Compendium of Valid Knowledge" written by Dharmakirti, and in the ninth chapter of the text
                  by Shantideva, which completely refutes the existence per se of all phenomena, would be
                  negated. This, in turn, would refute the notion of the Primordial Buddha. The Buddhist point
                  of view does not accept the validity of affirmations which do not stand up to logical
                  examination. If a sutra describes the Primordial Buddha as an autonomous entity, we must be
                  able to interpret this assertion without taking it literally. We call this type of sutra an
                  "interpretable" sutra.</p>

              <h4>Q: Interest im the discoveries of modern astrophysics and the "Big bang"  theory reveal both a
                  great fascination in the cosmos and a probing interrogation by members of our generation into
                  their origins, their destiny and the meaning of their existence. The "Big bang"  theory has had
                  a significant impact on our way of looking at matter and nature; it has introduced considerable
                  conceptual innovations. The formation of the structures of the universe, which function in
                  interdependence, and which new research continues to reveal, is a seemingly endless source
                  of wonder. Like all spiritual traditions, Buddhism conveys a cosmogonic myth. And yet
                  Buddhism rejects the idea of creation. Why?</h4>
              <h4>Most Western scientists think that life and consciousness are a magnificent result of the
                  universe's material evolution, and yet they know neither how nor why matter emerged in such
                  a way as to fulfill the conditions necessary to engender life and consciousness. What they do
                  know is that these conditions are very strict, yet have nevertheless been fulfilled in our universe
                  in an astonishing way. You have a very different point of view on this subject. Would you
                  therefore speak to us about consciousness in its relation to matter and the universe?</h4>
              <p><strong>A: </strong>Why is there no creation possible in Buddhism? It has been said that one cannot find living
                  beings at the becoming of the universe for the essential reason that causes have no beginning.
                  If there were a beginning to the universe, there would also have to be a beginning to
                  consciousness. If we accepted a beginning to consciousness, we would also have to accept that
                  its cause has a beginning, a sudden cause which would have instantly produced consciousness;
                  this would lead to a great many other questions. If consciousness had arisen without cause, or
                  from a permanent cause, that cause would have to exist on. a permanent basis, always, or not
                  exist at all, ever. The fact that a phenomenon exists intermittently proves that it depends on
                  causes and conditions. When all the conditions are met, the phenomenon is produced. When
                  those conditions are absent or incomplete, the phenomenon does not appear. As causes have no
                  beginning and stretch back to infinity, the same thing must apply for living beings. Creation is
                  therefore not possible.</p>
              <p>Let us now consider a particular phenomenon, a glacier for example: it does indeed have a
                  beginning. How was it created? The outside world appears as a result of the acts of sentient
                  beings who use this world, These acts, or karmas, in turn originate in the intentions and
                  motivations of those beings who have not yet taken control of their minds.</p>
              <p>The "creator of the world,"  basically, is the mind. In the Sutras, the mind is described as an
                  agent. It is said that consciousness has no beginning, but we must distinguish here between
                  gross consciousness and subtle consciousness. Many gross consciousnesses appear as
                  dependents of the physical aggregates, of the body. This is evident when you consider the
                  different neurons and the functioning of the brain, but just because physical conditions are met
                  does not mean that this is enough to produce a perception. In order for a perception which will
                  have the faculty to reflect and know an object to arise, it must have a consubstantial cause. The
                  fundamental consubstantial cause, of the same substance as its result, will in this case be the
                  subtle consciousness. It is this same consciousness or subtle mind which penetrates the parental
                  cells at the moment of conception. The subtle mind can have no beginning. If it had one, the
                  mind would have to be born of something that is not the mind. According to the Kalacakra
                  Tantra, one would have to return to the particles of space to find the fundamental consubstantial
                  causes of the external physical world as well as of the bodies of sentient beings.</p>
              <p>Buddhist cosmology establishes the cycle of a universe in the following way: first there is a
                  period of formation, then a period where the universe endures, then another during which it is
                  destroyed, followed by a period of void before the formation of a new universe. During this
                  void, the particles of space subsist, and from these particles the new universe will be formed.
                  It is in these particles of space that we find the fundamental consubstantial cause of the entire
                  physical world. If we wish to describe the formation of the universe and the physical bodies of
                  beings, all we need do is analyse and comprehend the way in which the natural potential of
                  different chemical and other elements constituting that universe was able to take shape from
                  these space particles. It is on the basis of the specific potential of those particles that the
                  structure of this universe and of the bodies of the beings present therein have come about. But
                  from the moment the elements making up the world begin to set off different experiences of
                  suffering and happiness among sentient beings, we must introduce the notion of karma -- that
                  is, positive and negative acts committed and accumulated in the past. It is difficult to determine
                  where the natural expression of the potential of physical elements ends and the effect of karma
                  -- in other words, the result of our past acts -- begins. If you wonder what the relation might
                  be between karma and this external environment formed by natural laws, it is time to explain
                  what karma is.</p>
              <p>Karma means, first of all, action. We distinguish one type of karma which is of a mental nature,
                  a mental factor of volition or intention. There also exist physical and oral karmas. To
                  understand the connection between these physical, oral, or mental karmas and the material
                  world, we must refer to the tantric texts. The Kalacakra Tantra in particular explains that in our
                  bodies there are to be found, at gross, subtle, and extremely subtle levels, the five elements
                  which make up the substance of the external world. It is therefore in this context, I believe, that
                  we must envision the connection between our physical, oral, and mental karmas, and the
                  external elements.</p>

              <p>Dalai Lama: <em>...We can say, therefore, that this ultimate source, clear light,
                                      is close to the notion of a Creator, since all phenomena, whether
                                      they belong to samsara or nirvana, originate therein....</em></p>

                                      each living being--death, the intermediate state, and
                                      rebirth--represent nothing more than the various manifestations of
                                      the potential of clear light...</em></p>

              <p>Jesus Christ, from the <a href="http://users.misericordia.edu//davies/thomas/Trans.htm">Gospel of Thomas</a>:</p>
              <p><em> 77   Jesus said, "I am the light that is over all things.  I am
              all:  from me all came forth, and to me all attained. </em></p>

              <p><em><br></em></p>
              <p><em> 50   Jesus said,</em></p>
              <p><em> "If they say to you, 'Where have you come
              from?' say to them, 'We have come from the light, from the place
              where the light came into being by itself, established [itself],
              and appeared in their image.' </em></p>
              <p><em> If they say to you, 'Is it you?'

              <p>The dark space is the infinite, borderless and all-pervading
                          quality of Dharmakaya. The luminosity is.. well... the 'brightness'
                          aspect of Dharmakaya. I have experienced both aspects.... perhaps
                          different situation will create a different emphasis.</p>
              <p>As for Kabbalah, i am not an expert on it. Bob, is the real
                          expert... but he doesn't come up to my forum nowadays.</p>

              <p>Also, the brightness aspect can differ in intensity and 'expansiveness' right?</p>
              <p>It reminds me of a quote from Zen Master Han Shan:</p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica; color: #222222; font-size: normal;">57.	The clearer the body, the brighter one’s Buddha Nature shines. In the beginning, we still need
                          the body. It’s like a lamp. The Buddha Nature is this flame. But we may still be conscious of
                          shadows. As we progress we feel that the body is the universe itself and that our Buddha Self
                          shines throughout it like the sun. </span></strong></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>This also reminds me of something by Thusness many years back, he said something like, Clarity is the inverse proportion of Self. (i.e. identification with body/mind)</p>

              <p>Immediately as I become so present and aware, the image of the room and the monster disappears and there was just this bright white light.

              <p>I have a feeling that this might be what happens when death comes, except more intense. The dream is almost like a form of bardo state.</p>

              <p>I remember I was asking Longchen the other day I met him, I asked something like... does an enlightened person feel fear when watching horror movies? His answer was something like, that if you do not believe in the story, the conceptual fear can subside.</p>

              <p>The lucidity allows one to see the illusion. The dream monster disapears means that the spell is broken at that time. This will translate into the waking hours. We will see how conceptual thinking (narrative of the mind) can bind us into a spell-like state.</p>

              <p>I see... thanks for the sharing. "Spell-like state" is the word. When I first had this lucidity and recognised that all that was the projection of my mind, the tendency to project was still there. I understood that I could either remain in present awareness and then all will subside or if I lose mindfulness I would fall back into the dream. I just stayed in present, naked non-reactive awareness and refuse to 'give in' to the illusions.</p>
              <p>The same case goes for waking hours... I have to practice being in thoughtfree awakeness to be liberated from all spell-like states</p>
              <p>p.s. what kind of karmic habit? lol</p>
