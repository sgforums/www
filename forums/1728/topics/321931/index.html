                            generally means actions, referring to the deeds committed by human beings 
                            through their body, speech and mind. It encompasses all aspects of our 
                            conduct, virtuous and evil, essential and trivial. It could be karma 
                            committed in our past lives or the present life. The karma committed 
                            by an individual is called "individual", while that committed collectively 
                            by a group is called "common karma".<br> </span><br> </li>

                            to their karmic forces. A person who does not commit evil deeds through 
                            his body, speech and mind, and instead performs good deeds, shall be 
                            able to be reborn as a human being again in the next life. The wealthy 
                            people must have been charitable in their previous life. Those who are 
                            dignified in their looks must have had practiced endurance, kindness, 
                            humility and courtesy towards others, or they had offered fresh flowers 
                            to Buddha. People who are seldom sick, are healthy, and live a long 
                            life, must have had abstained from killing and hurting other sentient 
                            beings in their previous lives. A person who has done a lot of good 
                            deeds and accumulated a lot of merits, shall be able to enjoy heavenly 
                            blessings in the deva realm. If one has done a lot of good deeds, but 
                            he is hot-tempered and quarrelsome then he shall be reborn to the asura 
                            realm. These three <strong style="color: black; background-color: #a0ffff;">realms</strong>, namely, the humanity, deva and asura <strong style="color: black; background-color: #a0ffff;">realms</strong> are called the three virtuous <strong style="color: black; background-color: #a0ffff;">realms</strong>. <br> If a person is always committing evil deeds through his body, speech 
                            and mind, then his next life would be in the animal, hungry ghost or 
                            the hell realm to suffer his dues. Therefore, it is not a certainty 
                            that a person will become a ghost after he dies, but depending on his 
                            conduct whilst he was alive, there is always a possibility that he could 
                            become one. <br></span></li>

              <p>BTW, rebirth does not happen to everyone.</p>
              <p>Those that have attained enlightenment and are liberated from ignorance and afflictions do not have to be reborn again, they have transcended the cycle of rebirth and sufferings, and achieves Nirvana. And many people have attained enlightenment.</p>
              <p>This is what we aim for, not merely avoidance of bad rebirths or to do good and aim for a better rebirth.</p>
              <p>To attain nirvana, we have to awaken wisdom to the true nature of reality, and as a result purify our minds of all ignorance and defilements. It is like the layer of clouds obscuring the sun (i.e. our true nature) is removed to reveal our true nature as luminosity [clarity] and emptiness inseparable.</p>

              <p>No. Unlike Christians, we do not believe in eternal hell nor heaven. All conditioned phenomena are impermanent. Therefore, rebirth in heaven is not 'safe', because eventually you will fall back.</p>
              <p>But the 'lifespan' in hell and heaven are generally longer (and depends on which 'level' of heaven or hell and also one's karma) than life on earth.</p>

              <p>And there are many understandings heaven. Most Christians understanding
                  is some kind of physical place far far from us, but if it is a physical
                  incarnation, in Buddhist understanding it cannot be 'eternal' as some
                  of them have claimed.</p>
              <p>However the Christian mystics (which is a rare minority) have a different understanding and took what Jesus said seriously when he said that the kingdom of God cannot be pointed as here or there, but rather is within and all around us. Actually Jesus himself is one of the greatest mystic in the world, but most do not understand his teachings, and many of his teachings are disorted. For the mystics, they take the true heaven to be the deathless realm only when the nature of God is realised, and that God is no longer seen as some entity separate from oneself but as inseparable from one's being. <a href="http://frimmin.com/faith/mysticismintro.php"><em>I no longer live, but Christ lives in me!</em> (<cite>Gal.</cite> 2.20)</a></p>
              <p>But that is the mystic's understanding. They are closer to Buddhism in some ways, but not exactly same...</p>

              <p>Karma is a natural law, karma means actions, and in the scientific world we know that every action gets a reaction. Karma, volition, forms imprints which gets 'stored' in our 8th consciousness and ripen much later.</p>
              <p>When we sleep, the things we experience in life recorded in 8th consciousness as imprints and seeds turn into a realm of symbolic experience.</p>
              <p>In time of death, when we enter the bardo, it is very similar to the situation we experience in dreams. In fact the dream state is a kind of bardo itself. The Tibetan Book of the Dead is quite interesting in this regard as it details the process of death. And btw, all those near death experiences are also very similar to what is being described there.</p>
              <p>And when we experience these kind of symbolic experiences, sometimes seeing deities, Buddhas, or demons, alot of these things... and if he is a Christian lets say, he may not see Buddha but Jesus instead, due to the seeds in his 8th consciousness...</p>
              <p>And what we experience at that time may be a kind of fruition of karma... if we get attached to these things, it can propel our rebirth. Hence karma WILL influence our rebirth... have to be careful.</p>
              <p>Our karma are imprints and 'seeds' of 8th consciousness... when imprints (cause) + conditions are met, karmic effect ripens.</p>

              <p>Something by longchen recently:</p>
              <p><strong>The grips and control of unconscious and subconscious karmic
                                          pattern is extremely strong and incredibly numerous. Without
                                          meditation, this tendencies are almost 100% controlling the
                                          behaviour of a person. It is that strong.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Also, the events that happen in your life are 'controlled' by
                                          the subconscious impulses that are 'held' very deeply into the
                                          consciousness. You can call this the karma effects.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>That is why dreams can be used to foretell events that are about
                                          to happen. In the dream state, the physical 'realm' is momentarily
                                          suspended to allow for a different type of conditions to arise...
                                          in this case the dream state. The dream state is a symbolic
                                          representation of the karmic and intention imprints and tendencies
                                          that are held within the deepest subsconscious. This deepest
                                          subconscious should be the same as the alaya consciousness.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>What happen is that the dream plays a story with all the karmic
                                          influences symbolically represented. These karmic influences are
                                          actually about to surface and manifest soon... that is why they
                                          manifest as dreams first. Next, within a few weeks or months, the
                                          karma consequence manifest in the 'physical realm'.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>From my understanding and experience, the deepest subconscious
                                          (alaya consciousness?) is not accessible without meditation. In the
                                          deepest subconscious is 'held' the original state of the 'imprints'
                                          and 'intentions'. The deepest subconscious with its pure imprints
                                          can actually be very different from the manifested personality. The
                                          'reasons' for the rebirth are also felt in that realm.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>just my opinion only.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>PS: when i use the word 'realm' please understand that it is not
                                          any place elsewhere. It is mainly for easy explanation.</strong></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>...The <em>Bardo Thodol</em> differentiates the intermediate state between lives into three bardos:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>The <em>chikhai bardo</em> or "bardo of the moment of death", which
              features the experience of the "clear light of reality", or at least
              the nearest approximation of which one is spiritually capable.</li>
              <li>The <em>chonyid bardo</em> or "bardo of the experiencing of reality", which features the experience of visions of various <a title="Buddhahood" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhahood">Buddha</a> forms (or, again, the nearest approximations of which one is capable).</li>
              <li>The <em>sidpa bardo</em> or "bardo of rebirth", which features
              karmically impelled hallucinations which eventually result in rebirth.
              (Typically imagery of men and women passionately entwined.)</li>
              </ol>
              <p>The <em>Bardo Thodol</em> also mentions three other bardos: those of
              "life" (or ordinary waking consciousness), of "dhyana" (meditation),
              and of "dream" (the dream state during normal sleep)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Together these "six bardos" form a classification of <a class="mw-redirect" title="State of consciousness" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_consciousness">states of consciousness</a> into six broad types. Any state of consciousness can form a type of
              "intermediate state", intermediate between other states of
              consciousness. Indeed, one can consider any momentary state of
              consciousness a bardo, since it lies between our past and future
              existences; it provides us with the opportunity to experience reality,
              which is always present but obscured by the projections and confusions
              that are due to our previous unskillful actions...</p>

                  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553370901/ref=nosim/neardeathexpe-20">Tibetan Book of the
                  Dead</a>, whose actual title is "<a href="http://www.kheper.net/topics/bardo/tibetan.html">The Great Liberation upon Hearing in the Intermediate State</a>"
                  or "Bardo Thodol", is traditionally believed to be the work of the legendary Padma Sambhava in the 8th century A.D.
                  The book acts as a guide for the dead during the state that intervenes death and the next rebirth.
                  He is considered to be one of the first persons to bring Buddhism to Tibet.
                  The Bardo Thodol is a guide that is
                  read aloud to the dead while they are in the state between death and
                  reincarnation in order for them to recognize the nature of
                  their mind and attain liberation from the cycle of rebirth.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: normal;">The Bardo Thodol teaches that once
                  awareness is freed from the body, it creates its own reality as one would
                  experience in a dream. This dream occurs in various phases  (<a href="http://www.diamondway.org/bt/bt9tsechu.htm">bardos</a>)
                  in ways both wonderful and terrifying. Overwhelming peaceful and wrathful visions
                  and deities appear. Since the deceased's awareness is in confusion of no longer being
                  connected to a physical body, it needs help and guidance in order that enlightenment
                  and liberation occurs. The Bardo Thodol teaches how we can attain Nirvana by recognizing the
                  heavenly realms instead of entering into the lower realms where the cycle
                  of birth and rebirth continue.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: normal;">The following is a description of the bardo
                  realms that one travels through after death.</span></p>
                  <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: medium;">The First 
                  Bardo</span></strong></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">The <a href="http://www.lycaeum.org/books/books/psychedelic_experience/tib21.html"> first bardo</a> comes at the very moment of death, when there dawns the
                  <a href="http://hhdl.dharmakara.net/hhdlquotes22.html"> Clear Light of the Ultimate
                  Reality</a>. This is the very content and substance of the state of liberation, if only the soul can recognize it
                  and act in a way to remain in that state. The instructions intended to be read at the moment of the
                  person's death are designed to help him do this.  He is told, first of all, to embrace this supreme
                  experience not in a selfish and egoistic way but rather with love and compassion for all sentient beings.
                  This will aid him in the second step, which is to realize that his own mind and self is identical with the
                  Clear Light, implying that he himself IS the Ultimate Reality, "the All-good Buddha", transcending time,
                  eternity, and all creation. If he can recognize this while in this supreme state at the moment of death, he
                  will attain liberation - that is, he will remain in the Clear Light forever. This condition is called the
                  "<a href="http://www.selfknowledge.com/109716.htm">Dharmakaya</a>", the highest spiritual body of the Buddha.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">Most souls, however, will fail to do this. They will be pulled down by the weight of their karma into the
                  second stage of the first bardo, called the <a href="http://www.geocities.com/sunnytees/afterlife22.html"> Secondary Clear Light</a> seen immediately after death. At this
                  point, there are separate instructions to be read according to the spiritual condition of the person while
                  in life. For an individual advanced in meditation and other spiritual practices, there is repeated over and
                  over the same instructions as at the moment of death, enjoining him to recognize himself as the
                  Dharmakaya. For a person who was still at a student-level on the spiritual path, there is the injunction for
                  him to meditate on his "tutelary deity", that is, the particular god for whom he performed devotional
                  practices while alive.  Finally, "if the deceased be of the common folk", unpracticed in any spiritual
                  disciplines, the instruction is to "meditate upon the Great Compassionate Lord", which is to say an
                  "Avatar" worshipped by the multitude, equivalent to Jesus as conceived by the average Christian.<br> <br> </span><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: medium;">The Second 
                  Bardo</span></strong></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">If the soul is still not liberated at this stage, it will descend into the
                  <a href="http://www.lycaeum.org/books/books/psychedelic_experience/tib22.html"> second bardo</a>, which is said to last for
                  two weeks. The second bardo is also divided into two parts; in the first, the soul of the deceased
                  encounters what are referred to as "the Peaceful Deities." On each of the seven days, a particular
                  Buddha-being will appear in radiance and glory, with a bevy of angelic attendants. At the same time, on
                  each day in turn there will shine a light from one of the six worlds of the Buddhist universe,
                  called "Lokas"  (the basic meaning is "place"; our English words "location" and  "locale" are derived
                  from the same Sanskrit root).</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">On the first day of the second bardo, there appears to the soul the divine Father-Mother - that is, the
                  supreme deity of the universe, transcending all dualities, including the division into sexes. The next step
                  in the destiny of the soul is determined by his reaction to this God. If his life on
                  earth  was well lived, he
                  will now be in a state of purity and grace, and he will enter into the joy of the God and attain liberation. If
                  on the other hand he has lived an ignoble and impious life, the effects of his bad karma will cause the
                  intense radiant presence of the God to strike fear and terror in his heart, and he will be drawn instead to
                  the softer light of the Deva-Loka, which has dawned along with this deity. This is still a fairly attractive
                  fate, for the Devas are the Gods  (or angels), and their Loka is equivalent to the Christian
                  heaven;
                  however, the Buddhist teaching is that even heaven is not the highest spiritual objective, because it is
                  still only a temporary state in the manifest universe.  Liberation is believed to be the only final and
                  permanent resting-place for the soul, an un-manifest state beyond all existence.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">On the second day, there appears the
                  <a href="http://kkeys.home.texas.net/%7Ekkeys/spirit/buddhism/bardo/2ndday.html"> second-highest God</a> in the Buddhist pantheon - in fact, he is
                  actually the Second Person in the literal Buddhist Holy Trinity. At the same time, there dawns a smoky
                  light from hell; and here we note that, just as the Buddhist heaven is not a permanent, eternal state,
                  neither is its hell.  Even the most wretched souls will eventually work their way out of even the deepest
                  pit of hell, just as even the highest and purest souls will eventually lose their footing in
                  heaven and
                  descend again into the cycle of death and rebirth. Liberation is the only way out.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">Once again, if the soul responds to the "dazzling white light" of the second God with the joy of a pure
                  heart, he will be liberated thereby;  but if he specifically reacts with ANGER from having indulged in this
                  vice on earth, he will recoil from the light in fear and be drawn into
                  hell.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">The
                  pattern is repeated on the third day; this time it is the
                  fault if egotism that will cause the soul to react to the God with
                  fear, and he will be drawn to the human world, where his next
                  incarnation will
                  thereby take place. On the fourth day dawns the <a href="http://kkeys.home.texas.net/%7Ekkeys/spirit/buddhism/bardo/4thday.html"> God of Eternal
                  Life</a>; if the soul has a negative reaction
                  to him because of miserliness and attachment, he will be drawn toward rebirth in
                  the <a href="http://www.deliriumsrealm.com/delirium/mythology/pretas.asp">Preta-Loka</a>, a world of "hungry ghosts" who have huge stomachs and throats the size of pinholes, and so they wander
                  about in a constant state of unsatisfied ravenous desire.  On the fifth day comes God in the form of an
                  <a href="http://kkeys.home.texas.net/%7Ekkeys/spirit/buddhism/bardo/5thday.html"> Almighty Conqueror</a>;  this time it's jealousy that will unseat the soul, and he will be born into
                  the <a href="http://uwacadweb.uwyo.edu/religionet/er/buddhism/BGLOSSRY.HTM">Asura-Loka</a>, a world of fierce
                  warrior-deities (or demons).  On the sixth day all the deities return and
                  dawn together, along with the lights from all <a href="http://kkeys.home.texas.net/%7Ekkeys/spirit/buddhism/bardo/6thday.html"> six
                  Lokas</a>. On the seventh day there appear the <a href="http://kkeys.home.texas.net/%7Ekkeys/spirit/buddhism/bardo/7thday.html"> Knowledge-Holding Deities</a>, who are more fierce and demonic-looking than those that have previously
                  dawned; and in fact they are sort of a transitional element to the next stage of the second bardo, where
                  the soul encounters the wrathful deities.  Meanwhile, if because of
                  stupidity the soul cannot face the Knowledge-Holding Deities, he is drawn toward
                  the <a href="http://www.ramalila.net/Adventures/DeathDyingRebirth/PeterJOnDeath.html">Brute-Loka</a> - that is, he will be reborn on
                  earth as
                  an animal.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">In the second week of the second bardo, the soul meets seven legions of
                  <a href="http://www.ramalila.net/Adventures/DeathDyingRebirth/RogerOnDeath.html"> Wrathful
                  Deities</a>:  hideous,
                  terrifying demons who advance upon him with flame and sword, drinking blood from human skulls,
                  threatening to wreak unmerciful torture upon him, to maim, disembowel, decapitate and slay him. The
                  natural tendency, of course, is for the soul to attempt to flee from these beings in stark, screaming,
                  blood-curdled terror; but if he does, all is lost.  The instructions at this stage of the Bardo are for the soul
                  to have no fear, but rather to recognize that the Wrathful Deities are really the Peaceful Deities in
                  disguise, their dark side manifesting as a result of his own evil karma.  The soul is told to calmly face
                  each demon in turn and visualize it as the deity it truly is, or else as his own tutelary deity; if he can do
                  this, he will merge with the being and attain the second degree of Liberation, that lesser aspect of it
                  which is now the best he can hope for here in the second bardo.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">Furthermore, he is told to awaken to
                  the fact that all these fearsome creatures are not real, but are merely illusions emanating from his own
                  mind. If he can recognize this, they will vanish and he will be liberated. If he can't, he eventually wanders
                  down to the third bardo.<br> <br> </span><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; font-size: medium;">The Third 
                  Bardo</span></strong></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">In the <a href="http://www.lycaeum.org/books/books/psychedelic_experience/tib23.html"> third bardo</a> the soul encounters the
                  <a href="http://www.exoticindiaart.com/product/TH57/"> Lord of Death</a>, a fearsome demonic deity who appears in
                  smoke and fire, and subjects the soul to a Judgment.  If the dead person protests that he has done no
                  evil, the Lord of Death holds up before him the <a href="http://www.aljardim.com.br/english/bardo.htm"> Mirror of
                  Karma</a>, "wherein every good and evil act is
                  vividly reflected." Now demons approach and begin to inflict torments and punishments upon the soul
                  for his evil deeds. The instructions in the Bardo Thodol are for him to attempt to recognize the
                  Voidness of all these beings, including the Lord of Death himself; the dead person is told that this entire
                  scene unfolding around him is a projection from his own mind. Even here he can attain liberation by
                  recognizing this.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">The soul who is still not liberated after the Judgment will now be drawn remorselessly toward rebirth. </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">The lights
                  of the six Lokas will dawn again; into one of these worlds the soul
                  must be born, and the light
                  of the one he is destined for will shine more brightly than the
                  others. The soul is still experiencing the frightening apparitions and
                  sufferings of the third bardo, and he feels
                  that he will do anything to escape from this condition. He will seek
                  shelter in what appear to be caves or
                  hiding-places, but which are actually the entrances to wombs. He is
                  warned of this by the text of the
                  Bardo Thodol, and urged not to enter them, but to meditate upon the
                  Clear Light instead; for it is still
                  possible for him to achieve the third degree of liberation and avoid
                  rebirth.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">Finally there comes a point where it is no longer possible to attain liberation, and after this the soul is
                  given instructions on how to choose the best womb for a favorable incarnation. The basic method is
                  non-attachment: to try to rise above both attraction to worldly pleasures and repulsion from worldly ills.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">The final words of the Bardo
                  Thodol are: "Let virtue and goodness be perfected in every way."</span></p>

              <p>p.s. there's a forummer here who encountered Yama (Lord of Death) in his meditation some years back... but I don't want to say who. Prior to that experience, he did not even know who is Yama! After his meditation he went to search for info about 'Yama', and only then he realised he is known as the Lord of Death.</p>
              <p>But the forummer too says it is a mind illusion (a projection from his alaya)... perhaps serving a reminder that at that time he has not attained liberation, has not overcome death. Maybe not to be overly excited of his spiritual achievement yet? Just a guess...</p>
              <p>I can't remember the exact conversation already, but (if I recall correctly), Yama was going like oh so that's the guy who has not overcome death?</p>

              <p>And there are many understandings heaven. Most Christians
              understanding is some kind of physical place far far from us, but
              if it is a physical incarnation, in Buddhist understanding it
              cannot be 'eternal' as some of them have claimed.</p>
              <p>However the Christian mystics (which is a rare minority) have a
              different understanding and took what Jesus said seriously when he
              said that the kingdom of God cannot be pointed as here or there,
              but rather is within and all around us. Actually Jesus himself is
              one of the greatest mystic in the world, but most do not understand
              his teachings, and many of his teachings are disorted. For the
              mystics, they take the true heaven to be the deathless realm only
              when the nature of God is realised, and that God is no longer seen
              as some entity separate from oneself but as inseparable from one's
              being. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://frimmin.com/faith/mysticismintro.php"><em>I no longer live, but Christ lives in me!</em> (<cite>Gal.</cite> 2.20)</a></p>
              <p>But that is the mystic's understanding. They are closer to
              Buddhism in some ways, but not exactly same...</p>

              <p>what does 'mystic' mean?</p>
              <p>Christians believe that you either go to heaven or hell.  Hell = eternal suffering.  And thing is, they do not need good deeds to go to heaven, you just need to believe and live the Christian way. </p>
              <p>For Buddhism, does it mean that we donate $1000 to the poor, then we will be better off than the other person that donated $10 to the poor with a good heart?</p>
              <p>And also, does it mean that say a person killed someone and they can still 'erase' that by doing other good things like helping someone?</p>

              <p>This is a Buddhist forum, but for the sake of sharing knowledge I hope this is ok with others... to share certain articles on what Christian mysticism and Christian teachings point to. I'm however, not implying that Buddhism and Christianity are the same paths, because they are not really the same path. Christianity and all monotheistic religions are paths of submission to the divine, while Buddhism emphasizes the aspect of insight.</p>
              <p>There is a serious lack of understanding of what mysticism is about, and probably most Christians you encounter will never even have heard of the word. Mysticism is at the heart of Christianity since its very beginning, many great Christians in history has been great mystics. Wherever there is Christianity, there are mystics/contemplatives.</p>
              <p>And 'mystic' has nothing to do with occulticism, supernatural, or the weird weird stuff. Nothing of that sort. Read on, and you'll know.</p>

              <h3>What is Mysticism?</h3>
              <p><img class="floatright" src="http://www.frimmin.com/images/goldsea.jpg" alt="The '12 apostles'" width="60%"></p>
              <p>To
                                              many modern Christians, words like "meditation," "mystic," and
                                              "mysticism" bring to mind Eastern religions, not Christianity.
                                              Certainly Eastern religions are known for their mysticism; however,
                                              mysticism is not only a vital part of the Christian heritage as well,
                                              but it is actually the <em>core</em> of Christian spirituality. Mysticism simply means the <strong>spirituality of the direct experience of God.</strong> It is the adventure of "the wild things of God."</p>
              <p>The direct experience of God is a kind of knowing, which goes beyond intellectual understanding. <a href="http://www.frimmin.com/faith/belief.html">It is not a matter of "belief."</a> It is  marked by love and joy, but it is not "emotional experience." In many ways, it is better <a href="http://www.frimmin.com/faith/mysticalheart.html">described by what it is not</a>.
                                              To describe what it is, we must use metaphors—the marriage of the soul
                                              to Christ, the death of the "old man" and birth of the "new man," being
                                              the "body of Christ."</p>
              <p>Jesus proclaimed "<strong>I and the Father are one,</strong>" (<cite>Jn. 10.30</cite>) showing the world what the union of God and man can be. <strong>Christian mysticism is about nothing else but this transforming union.</strong></p>
              <p>Christ is the sole end of Christian mysticism. Whereas all
                                              Christians have Christ, call on Christ, and can (or should) know
                                              Christ, the goal for the Christian mystic is to become Christ—to become
                                              as fully permeated with God as Christ is, thus becoming like him, fully
                                              human, and by the grace of God, also fully divine. In Christian
                                              teaching this doctrine is known by various names—theosis, divinization,
                                              deification, and transforming union.</p>
              <p>A common misconception about mysticism is that it's about "mystical
                                              experiences," and there are many volumes on such experiences in
                                              religious literature. But true mysticism is not focussed on
                                              "experiences" (which come and go) but with the lasting experience of
                                              God, leading to the transformation of the believer into union with God.</p>
              <h3>A very, very, very short mystical apologetic.</h3>
              <p>To know God directly shows that mysticism is different from any passive or legalistic kind of Christianity. It means:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>That while we honor the Scriptures, we want to know God directly, not just through Scripture.</li>
              <li>While we respect our heritage of teachings about God, we want to know God directly, not through doctrines and teachings.</li>
              <li>While we gather in communal worship, we want to know God directly, not just through the Church.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Some readers may find this unsettling. Maybe you believe it doesn't
                                              apply to you, because you "know" that your church is purer and more
                                              correct than others. Even if that were true, is it a substitute for
                                              knowing God directly? Or, you might also feel that trusting the Bible
                                              alone gives you knowledge of God directly from the Source. But it was
                                              written by mystics, listening to God speaking his Word in their hearts.
                                              Is it possible for you to read it directly, without the conceptions of
                                              your language, time, culture, and personal history? Are you sure you
                                              wouldn't understand it very differently if you were reading it, say, in
                                              third-century Damascus?</p>
              <p>The religion we call "Christianity" changes, but God is eternal.
                                              Mystical faith wants to know this unchanging God to whom Christianity
                                              leads us, the One behind the beliefs and the words, the One whom
                                              beliefs and words cannot describe. We want to follow Jesus' example
                                              more closely, and go beyond the religion <strong>about</strong> Jesus, and take the religion <strong>of</strong> Jesus: the knowledge of the Father and unconditional love  he had, and urged us to have.</p>

              <p><strong>I believe that everyone who wants to love <em>unconditionally</em> is a mystic. </strong>All
                                              children are born mystics, and if you were once a child, you were once
                                              a mystic. Christian mysticism is following the example of Christ as he
                                              followed the Father. And mysticism is not by any means restricted to
                                              Christianity: the Bible says, “everyone who loves is begotten of God,
                                              and knows God.” (<cite>1 Jn.</cite> 4.7) God speaks in various ways, in
                                              every time and every place to "whosoever will." Other pages on this
                                              site treat non-Christian mysticism.</p>
              <p>Mystics range the gamut of walks of life, from intellectual priests
                                              such as Frs. Pierre Teilhard de Chardin and Matthew Fox, to laywomen
                                              like Bernadette Roberts and Katherine Nelson. The mystic way is old,
                                              but timeless—it is alive, and ever-new for each one who chooses it. It
                                              may be inviting you to begin this adventure of divine transformation
                                              and discovery.</p>
              <h3>A very, very, very short history of mysticism</h3>
              <p>The term mysticism derives from <cite><a href="http://www.frimmin.com/faith/mysticalheart.html">The Mystical Theology</a></cite>,
                                              a tiny treatise written by the greatest Christian writer of the sixth
                                              century, Dionysius the Areopagite, a.k.a. Pseudo-Dionysius or St. Denys
                                              [the Areopagite]. But Dionysius is in no way the "founder" of Christian
                                              mysticism. That honor belongs to none but Jesus the Christ himself. But
                                              there was mysticism long before Jesus was born. God "strolled in the
                                              Garden" with man (Heb. <em>'adam</em>). Jacob saw heaven
                                              opened. God spoke to Joseph through dreams. Moses communed with God on
                                              Sinai. David lost himself in dancing for the Lord.</p>
              <p>But when Jesus declared "I and the Father are one," (<cite>Jn.</cite> 10.30) he proclaimed in himself the union of God and humankind, and he
                                              offers it to all who follow him (he gave the power to become sons of
                                              God to all who believe. (<cite>Jn</cite>. 1.12).</p>
              <p>From there, the mystic heart is seen in the letters of the apostles: Paul reached the divinized state of losing his "self": <em>I no longer live, but Christ lives in me!</em> (<cite>Gal.</cite> 2.20) James wrote that every good and perfect gift comes from the
                                              Father of Lights, in whom there is no variation nor shadow of turning. (<cite>Jas. </cite>1.17) Peter proclaimed that Christ even descended to hell to liberate imprisoned souls, (<cite>1 Pet.</cite> 3.19) and John understood the most sublime truth of God's essence: God is Love! (<cite>1 Jn.</cite> 4.8,16). This is only the beginning. Every century has been influenced
                                              by Christian mystics—from apostles and martyrs, Church Fathers and
                                              Desert Mothers, to monks and nuns of religious orders, to the lay
                                              mystics—men and women and boys and girls in every century, in every
                                              denomination, in every walk of life.</p>

              <p>This is a Buddhist forum, but for the sake of sharing knowledge
              I hope this is ok with others... to share certain articles on what
              Christian mysticism and Christian teachings point to. I'm however,
              not implying that Buddhism and Christianity are the same paths,
              because they are not really the same path. Christianity and all
              monotheistic religions are paths of submission to the divine, while
              Buddhism emphasizes the aspect of insight.</p>
              <p>There is a serious lack of understanding of what mysticism is
              about, and probably most Christians you encounter will never even
              have heard of the word. Mysticism is at the heart of Christianity
              since its very beginning, many great Christians in history has been
              great mystics. Wherever there is Christianity, there are
              mystics.</p>
              <p>And 'mystic' has nothing to do with occulticism, supernatural,
              or the weird weird stuff. Nothing of that sort. Read on, and you'll

              <h3>What is Mysticism?</h3>
              <p><img src="http://www.frimmin.com/images/goldsea.jpg" alt="The '12 apostles'" width="60%"></p>
              <p>To many modern Christians, words like "meditation," "mystic,"
              and "mysticism" bring to mind Eastern religions, not Christianity.
              Certainly Eastern religions are known for their mysticism; however,
              mysticism is not only a vital part of the Christian heritage as
              well, but it is actually the <em>core</em> of Christian
              spirituality. Mysticism simply means the <strong>spirituality of
              the direct experience of God.</strong> It is the adventure of "the
              wild things of God."</p>
              <p>The direct experience of God is a kind of knowing, which goes
              beyond intellectual understanding. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.frimmin.com/faith/belief.html">It is not
              a matter of "belief."</a> It is marked by love and joy, but it is
              not "emotional experience." In many ways, it is better <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.frimmin.com/faith/mysticalheart.html">described by what it is not</a>. To describe what it is,
              we must use metaphors—the marriage of the soul to Christ, the death
              of the "old man" and birth of the "new man," being the "body of
              Christ."</p>
              <p>Jesus proclaimed "<strong>I and the Father are one,</strong>"
              (<cite>Jn. 10.30</cite>) showing the world what the union of God
              and man can be. <strong>Christian mysticism is about nothing else
              but this transforming union.</strong></p>
              <p>Christ is the sole end of Christian mysticism. Whereas all
              Christians have Christ, call on Christ, and can (or should) know
              Christ, the goal for the Christian mystic is to become Christ—to
              become as fully permeated with God as Christ is, thus becoming like
              him, fully human, and by the grace of God, also fully divine. In
              Christian teaching this doctrine is known by various names—theosis,
              divinization, deification, and transforming union.</p>
              <p>A common misconception about mysticism is that it's about
              "mystical experiences," and there are many volumes on such
              experiences in religious literature. But true mysticism is not
              focussed on "experiences" (which come and go) but with the lasting
              experience of God, leading to the transformation of the believer
              into union with God.</p>
              <h3>A very, very, very short mystical apologetic.</h3>
              <p>To know God directly shows that mysticism is different from any
              passive or legalistic kind of Christianity. It means:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>That while we honor the Scriptures, we want to know God
              directly, not just through Scripture.</li>
              <li>While we respect our heritage of teachings about God, we want
              to know God directly, not through doctrines and teachings.</li>
              <li>While we gather in communal worship, we want to know God
              directly, not just through the Church.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Some readers may find this unsettling. Maybe you believe it
              doesn't apply to you, because you "know" that your church is purer
              and more correct than others. Even if that were true, is it a
              substitute for knowing God directly? Or, you might also feel that
              trusting the Bible alone gives you knowledge of God directly from
              the Source. But it was written by mystics, listening to God
              speaking his Word in their hearts. Is it possible for you to read
              it directly, without the conceptions of your language, time,
              culture, and personal history? Are you sure you wouldn't understand
              it very differently if you were reading it, say, in third-century
              Damascus?</p>
              <p>The religion we call "Christianity" changes, but God is eternal.
              Mystical faith wants to know this unchanging God to whom
              Christianity leads us, the One behind the beliefs and the words,
              the One whom beliefs and words cannot describe. We want to follow
              Jesus' example more closely, and go beyond the religion
              <strong>about</strong> Jesus, and take the religion
              <strong>of</strong> Jesus: the knowledge of the Father and
              unconditional love he had, and urged us to have.</p>
              <h3>What is a mystic?</h3>
              <p><strong>I believe that everyone who wants to love
              <em>unconditionally</em> is a mystic.</strong> All children are
              born mystics, and if you were once a child, you were once a mystic.
              Christian mysticism is following the example of Christ as he
              followed the Father. And mysticism is not by any means restricted
              to Christianity: the Bible says, “everyone who loves is begotten of
              God, and knows God.” (<cite>1 Jn.</cite> 4.7) God speaks in various
              ways, in every time and every place to "whosoever will." Other
              pages on this site treat non-Christian mysticism.</p>
              <p>Mystics range the gamut of walks of life, from intellectual
              priests such as Frs. Pierre Teilhard de Chardin and Matthew Fox, to
              laywomen like Bernadette Roberts and Katherine Nelson. The mystic
              way is old, but timeless—it is alive, and ever-new for each one who
              chooses it. It may be inviting you to begin this adventure of
              divine transformation and discovery.</p>
              <h3>A very, very, very short history of mysticism</h3>
              <p>The term mysticism derives from <cite><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.frimmin.com/faith/mysticalheart.html">The Mystical Theology</a></cite>, a tiny treatise
              written by the greatest Christian writer of the sixth century,
              Dionysius the Areopagite, a.k.a. Pseudo-Dionysius or St. Denys [the
              Areopagite]. But Dionysius is in no way the "founder" of Christian
              mysticism. That honor belongs to none but Jesus the Christ himself.
              But there was mysticism long before Jesus was born. God "strolled
              in the Garden" with man (Heb. <em lang="hb">'adam</em>). Jacob saw heaven opened. God spoke to Joseph
              through dreams. Moses communed with God on Sinai. David lost
              himself in dancing for the Lord.</p>
              <p>But when Jesus declared "I and the Father are one,"
              (<cite>Jn.</cite> 10.30) he proclaimed in himself the union of God
              and humankind, and he offers it to all who follow him (he gave the
              power to become sons of God to all who believe. (<cite>Jn</cite>.
              1.12).</p>
              <p>From there, the mystic heart is seen in the letters of the
              apostles: Paul reached the divinized state of losing his "self":
              <em>I no longer live, but Christ lives in me!</em> (<cite>Gal.</cite> 2.20) James wrote that every good and perfect
              gift comes from the Father of Lights, in whom there is no variation
              nor shadow of turning. (<cite>Jas.</cite> 1.17) Peter proclaimed
              that Christ even descended to hell to liberate imprisoned souls,
              (<cite>1 Pet.</cite> 3.19) and John understood the most sublime
              truth of God's essence: God is Love! (<cite>1 Jn.</cite> 4.8,16).
              This is only the beginning. Every century has been influenced by
              Christian mystics—from apostles and martyrs, Church Fathers and
              Desert Mothers, to monks and nuns of religious orders, to the lay
              mystics—men and women and boys and girls in every century, in every
              denomination, in every walk of life.</p>

              <p>Here's an old post by someone who posted 2 years ago, from his
              own personal transcendental experiences.</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/1728/topics/196664">Is god a
              thing?</a></p>
              <p>GOD is Spirit according to the Bible. What is spirit, you might
              say? I can only speak based on my own relationship with God and I
              tell you that I have no wish to define God for you or anybody
              because as far as I am concern, GOD is beyond's any man's
              comprehension and you only communicate and have a relationship / be
              aware of God in your own life.<br> <br> How a man ends up being aware and have a relationship with God is
              by being "born of the spirit." I certainly know that I was born
              again. When you are born again, "angels" and "heaven" and your
              whole being rejoices.<br> <br> It is not much different then when a baby is born, except that this
              is personal. You are the one that rejoices with the "heavenly
              beings."<br> <br> I put them all in " " because you might have a different
              understanding of those words in " " that I used.<br> <br> Many Christians here cannot accept what I say, even though it was
              Jesus who said, "You must be Born Again" and "You must be born of
              the Spirit" and insists that it is simply "believe, have faith" and
              not a "new birth" in you (the other school hope that as long as you
              believe you then assume you have new birth <img title="Rolling Eyes" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes"> ) As if you need to hope and not know
              something so obvious as a new birth in yourself.<br> <br> I believe that Enlightenment has the same effect. If you are
              Enlightened please tell me what it is like.</p>

              <div class="quote_body" style="display: none;">
              <p>QN: I suddenly have this thinking today and would like you all
              to comment on this.</p>
              <p>Whats your purpose of doing merits.</p>
              <p>From day one, you are trying to accumulate merits to cultivate
              your widsom, compassion etc.</p>
              <p>You always strive to do more good merits.</p>
              <p>What if one day lets say your doing of good for like 1 year is
              gone(Is it possible that your merits will be gone?)</p>
              <p>Then suddenly you feel whats the objective of doing merits.</p>
              <p>The only thing that I can think of is that I have made the
              difference by doing good in this physical world and I can cultivate
              my good roots within(Anyone can add in more?)</p>
              <p>Sometimes I feel that when I am doing good, i suddenly feel a
              certain emptiness. Its like emptiness. Then I jump straight back to
              reality.</p>
              <p>What do you all think. Please give me your advise/comments so I
              could be enlightened.</p>
              <p><br> Can anyone point me to websites regarding the doing of merits. Like
              donating to temple, helping out etc etc. The purpose.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks</p>

              </div>
              <p>There are two types of blessings... there is leaking blessing
              and non-leaking blessing (leaking blessing = you lou fu,
              non-leaking blessing = wu lou fu)</p>
              <p>True merits is 'non leaking'... it does not leak away and is
              like a small seed that produces a tree with an abundance of fruits.
              We must cultivate this kind of blessings.</p>
              <p>If for example we give without attachment to the notion of
              giver, gift, and recipient -- we do not attach to any thoughts at
              all, then that act of giving produces immense blessings and merits.
              It is like the (true) story of the great Arhat Mogallana (or
              Mahakasyapa?) who took pity of a beggar and asked the beggar to
              give him some alms (to let him cultivate blessings). The beggar did
              not know what to give, and because Mogallana had compassion for the
              beggar, he pointed at the bowl of 3 drops of gruel... the beggar
              was very happy and joyfully gave the 3 drops of gruel to Mogallana.
              As a result, he died 7 days later and was born in the heaven of 33
              gods for 90+ kalpas.</p>
              <p>But if we give for the purpose of our own benefits, or we
              perform certain things like charity for the purpose of promoting
              our own fame, that is not true merits. We must be sincere and not
              attached.</p>
              <p>It does not matter how much money you give, just try to help out
              (in the promotion of dharma or helping out in a monastery) or give
              whatever you can in your best ability, most importantly must be
              sincere and not attached in the doing and not attached to anything
              that happens. It is like 'selfless service' and this is true
              cultivation. In doing, we practice the dharma.</p>
              <p>In the midst of doing or giving or anything -- we are already
              cultivating true compassion and wisdom. You do not 'accumulate
              merits' so that you can one day cultivate compassion and
              wisdom.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #008040;">Real
              merits</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000a0;"><strong>Merits are consequences of
              the non-orignation and non-cessation of the mind. During the Tang
              Dynasty in ancient China, Emperor Liang Wu-Ti asked the patriarch
              Bodhidharma, "Venerable One, I have built many monasteries for the
              well being of the Sangha and I have also performed many virtuous
              deeds. What merits have I accumulated? Bodhidharma answered, "You
              have no merits." Why is that so? It is because when Emperor Liang
              Wu-Ti performed those acts of giving, he was attached to them.
              Thus, even though he had performed many virtuous deeds, because he
              had not cultivated the purity of his mind, he did not attain
              "non-origination and non-cessation". Therefore, his actions can
              only be considered as cultivation of blessings, not merits. Without
              liberation there are no merits. On the other hand, when there is
              liberation, all virtuous deeds will reap
              merits.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Not so easy. However, people who have killed others, and
              practice dharma sincerely, and repenting their deeds, can lighten
              their karma. They can even attain Arhatship/liberation/nirvana,
              like Angulimala.</p>
              <p>It has a very interesting story (his encounter with Buddha after
              killing almost a thousand men, Buddha used his psychic power to
              create an illusion on him, eventually converted him. He later
              attain enlightenment, arhatship, nirvana) and I highly recommend

              <p>I have the book before. Read a bit here and there... not thorough at all.</p>
              <p>Just my opinion...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My belief is that immediately upon the death of the physical body and when the physical-based senses have fully shut down, for a brief moment, one will experience the all-pervading Presence of Dharmakaya. Whether it will be expereinced as dark space or bright luminosity or both, I am not too sure... it may depends.</p>
              <p>However, not recognising it, due to inexperience, never experiencing it before, etc, the subconscious dream-like imageries should appear after that. I strongly believe that whatever that appears in this stage are just symbolic representations of our own karmic patterns and beliefs.</p>
              <p>My belief is that physical body is only just one aspect of the 'being', the other aspects (such as emotional and mental aspects) do not dissolve with physical death and are thus vividly experienced when the limits imposed by the physical form is gone. The remaining aspects, being unpurified, produces the reactions to the resulting imageries and thus propelling the 'being' towards future rebirths.</p>
              <p>It has been said that very highly enlightened persons have very few dreams. My take is that this is because their subconscious mind is highly purified of karmic patterns and beliefs... so much so that there is little or no karmic representations as dream symbols... therefore very few dreams.</p>
              <p>Just my opinion only though... don't talk it literally.</p>

                  thorough at all.</p>
              <p>Just my opinion...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My belief is that immediately upon the death of the physical
                  body and when the physical-based senses have fully shut down, for a
                  brief moment, one will experience the all-pervading Presence of
                  Dharmakaya. Whether it will be expereinced as dark space or bright
                  luminosity or both, I am not too sure... it may depends.</p>
              <p>However, not recognising it, due to inexperience, never
                  experiencing it before, etc, the subconscious dream-like imageries
                  should appear after that. I strongly believe that whatever that
                  appears in this stage are just symbolic representations of our own
                  karmic patterns and beliefs.</p>
              <p>My belief is that physical body is only just one aspect of the
                  'being', the other aspects (such as emotional and mental aspects)
                  do not dissolve with physical death and are thus vividly
                  experienced when the limits imposed by the physical form is gone.
                  The remaining aspects, being unpurified, produces the reactions to
                  the resulting imageries and thus propelling the 'being' towards
                  future rebirths.</p>
              <p>It has been said that very highly enlightened persons have very
                  few dreams. My take is that this is because their subconscious mind
                  is highly purified of karmic patterns and beliefs... so much so
                  that there is little or no karmic representations as dream
                  symbols... therefore very few dreams.</p>
              <p>Just my opinion only though... don't talk it literally.</p>

              <p>Thanks for your sharing.. yes I do think so regarding Bodhisattvas... it's said they will have little or no dreams, and the dreams that occur are related to their Bodhisattva path... aka 'bodhisattva dreams'.</p>
              <p>As for what occurs at death, both the bardo thogal and my master suggests that at the time of death it is possible to recognise the Clear Light. My master use the pure land term å¯‚å…‰. It is of infinite brightness.</p>
              <p>BTW what is the difference between 'Presence of Dark Space' and 'Presence of Bright Luminosity'...</p>
              <p>I was just reading that in mystical Judaist tradition of Kabbalah, they seem to suggest different levels of experience of Presence or God, and creation... the top is the purest, the 'absolut-test'. What do you think.</p>
              <p>The 'rays of creation' (highest-to-lowest classification):</p>
              <p><br>1. The Limitless Light<br>2. The Limitless and Boundless<br>3. The vacuum of pure spirit<br>4. The Boundless World of Divine Names begins<br>5. Self-Awareness ("I Am")<br>6. Wisdom, essence of being (Jehovah)</p>
              <p>7. Understanding, Jehovah-Elohim, which means "God of Gods"<br>8. El, which means God the creator (so clearly Jehovah is not
                  the Creator deity. El, in fact, was an ancient god worshipped in
                  cultures prior to the ancient Jews)<br>9. Elohim Giboor, "severity" or God the Potent - this is basically karma<br>10.
                  Eloah Vadaath, "beauty" which means God The Strong - this certainly
                  reminds me of "The Great Perfection." This "beauty" occurs in the
                  center of the Kabballistic classification scheme and indicates BALANCE
                  and HARMONY.<br>11. Jehovah Tzaboath means "Victory" or "God of Hosts"
                  - this is saying that with the backing force of balance, strength and
                  karma, everything is put in its proper place. <br>12. Elohim Tzaboath,
                  means "Glory" or "Lord God of Hosts" - this is the reflection of
                  BALANCE and HARMONY beginning to take form in mental awareness. So the
                  Beauty of the infinite nondual experience begins to become appreciated
                  as a Glorious perception.<br>13. the first Foundation - "omnipotent" which is given the name Shaddai El Chai<br>14. the first Kingdom - Adonai Melekh which means "God" and actually refers to the Earth and physical existence.</p>

              <p>Just my opinion only...</p>
              <p>The dark space is the infinite, borderless and all-pervading quality of Dharmakaya. The luminosity is.. well... the 'brightness' aspect of Dharmakaya. I have experienced both aspects.... perhaps different situation will create a different emphasis.</p>
              <p>As for Kabbalah, i am not an expert on it. Bob, is the real expert... but he doesn't come up to my forum nowadays.</p>
