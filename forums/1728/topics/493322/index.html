              life skill</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">MARISHA KARWA |1 Jan 2017,
              DNA</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Learn
              to forgive. Given how deeply it is connected to our well being, it's a pity
              that this virtue isn't inculcated and emphasised upon as much as it ought to.
              So whether you believe in resolutions or not, make 2017 the year in which you
              learn to let it go, says Marisha Karwa</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>It
              was an extraordinary act of magnanimity.</strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Eight
              years after she had been pulled off her bicycle, punched and beaten in the
              chest before being raped, Katja Rosenberg went to meet the person, who, then
              just a teenager, had violated her. "I walked over, shook his hand and
              introduced myself. I wanted to show him it had not affected my life and that I
              had understood and forgiven him. I wanted to free the past. It was positive for
              me and positive for him," Rosenberg said of her 2014 meeting with the
              person serving a 14-year sentence in a UK prison.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Closer
              home and a decade earlier, Gladys Staines had demonstrated an astonishing
              amount of benevolence, saying she held no bitterness against the bloodthirsty
              mob that had torched to death her missionary husband and their two sons as they
              slept in their car in Odisha's Manoharpur village. "I have forgiven the
              killers and have no bitterness because forgiveness brings healing and our land
              needs healing from hatred and violence...," Staines had said in a
              statement after the killers had been sentenced in 2003.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It
              may seem counter intuitive, but forgiveness is not for the faint-hearted.
              "The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the
              strong," said the Mahatma. Tibetan spiritual leader His Holiness the 14th
              Dalai Lama and South African activist and bishop Desmond Tutu — both Nobel
              Peace Prize winners — are on the Mahatma's side. As have been religious
              preachers and saints from centuries ago. Not only do the Bhagwad Gita, Bible,
              Quran and the Guru Granth Sahib emphasise letting go, it is on the subject of
              forgiveness that organised religion can be friends with modern science. And
              yet, forgiveness is a virtue that is the least glorified, mostly overlooked and
              taught prescriptively.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">So what exactly is forgiveness?</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Forgiveness
              is that when you stop feeling angry or resentful towards a person for an
              offence, flaw or mistake. "It is a process," says Dr Jyotsna Agrawal,
              assistant professor of psychology at Bangalore's National Institute of Mental
              Health and Neurosciences (Nimhans). "It doesn't happen overnight. It's a
              conscious decision and it takes time to let go of negative emotions."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">To
              comprehend forgiveness better, researchers and psychologists suggest
              understanding what it is not: It does not mean accepting what is wrong, or
              condoning an injustice or excusing the wrongdoer. Rather, "forgiveness is
              a way of being in this world when you get disagreed with, when people do things
              that you think are wrong, when you get harmed, when someone takes your most
              cherished idea of how the world should be, and spits on it," says Dr Fred
              Luskin, director of Stanford University Forgiveness Projects, in a talk on the
              psychology of forgiveness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">When
              someone, especially a family or friend, tramples on your worldview, it can lead
              to caustic breakdowns, as Rama Ramanan found out. For nearly two years, Rama
              swung from meteoric temper to utter despair after her eight-year marriage
              started to unravel in 2014. "I was immensely angry and I blamed him for
              everything," she says, referring to her ex-husband. "I had an image
              about myself — that I was patient, kind and forgiving... I'd accept him if he
              did things my way and not if he did them his way. "</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">To
              make the marriage work, Rama wrote letters to him, in vain. Embittered, she
              sought counselling from Oneness University's spiritual teacher, Balagopal
              Ramachandran. Attending the Song of Oneness Gita classes, maintaining a diary
              in which she penned her most explosive emotions and sitting in contemplation
              daily helped.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Over
              time, Rama learnt to be at ease with her emotions, be it hatred or anger. About
              a-year-and-a-half later, the now 36-year-old media professional had a
              breakthrough. "The classes helped me learn that when you see your inner
              truth, you realise that the outside world is a reflection of your inner self.
              But this is not an easy truth to accept," she says, adding that the
              classes taught her to experience her emotions in totality without any
              judgements. "It took a year-and-a-half of staying with every raw emotion,
              and divine intervention, for forgiveness to happen. Not that I could forgive
              because I had to, but seeing my inner truth set me free, and that's when
              forgiveness happened."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Wired to let go</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              relief that Rama experienced through forgiveness is what Catholic priest Fr
              Suren Abreu calls "a consequence of letting go of emotions that are
              traumatic and painful". Such negative emotions impact not just a person's
              mental but also physical well being. "Holding grudges, nurturing thoughts
              of revenge, feeling depressed because of a wrong done to me, which cannot be
              satisfactorily addressed, all take a toll on the mind and the body," says
              Fr Abreu of Our Lady of Immaculate Church in suburban Mumbai.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">This
              is the emotional equivalent of stress. "Calming that stress and anger is a
              significant part of forgiveness," says Dr Luskin in his talk. "When
              you are angry or stressed, blood flow drains away from that part of the brain
              which allows you to think creatively and straight-forwardly. The purpose of the
              body's stress response is to be stupid."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Our
              body tightens when the mind feels it's in danger, and the lower abdomen is
              where most of us hold this tension. This is the moment to open your body to the
              parasympathetic settlement of your flight-and-fight response.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Taking
              slow, deep breaths allows the body to relax and the mind to calm down.
              "The more you can relax your belly, the more capable your mind is of
              having loving, positive thoughts," says Dr Luskin, adding that forgiveness
              is latent within each one of us. "When your body isn't tight, thoughts
              like forgiveness are natural."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Miraculous, but not magical</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">While
              letting go is linked to reduced stress and helps regulate blood pressure, it
              isn't an insurance against the pitfalls of life. Dr Agrawal puts it more
              succinctly when she says, "Pain still happens, but suffering is
              optional."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Forgiveness
              doesn't make you less angry with people who've aggrieved you, but the anger
              doesn't necessarily lead to being hurt, points out restaurateur Indira Monga*.
              The 51-year-old upturned a lifetime of dysfunctional family conditioning after
              the birth of her daughters upon the realisation that every choice she made,
              would impact them for life. "In a sense, it begins with low self-worth.
              And moves based on the choices you make to create a better version of yourself,
              which then leads to magnanimity. We get magnanimity from having forgiven
              ourselves, before we can progress to forgiving others," she says.
              "Neither love, nor forgiveness happen because you choose that. They happen
              because you make a whole set of other choices."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Bhubaneswar
              resident Keshab Sahani chose to live by the words he'd read. When he was 35,
              Sahani was so moved by Victor Hugo's Les Misérables that he translated and
              narrated each line to his wife and daughters. "The message I took is that
              forgiving your enemies annoys them no end," writes Sahani in an email. As
              fate would have it, the 70-year-old, who took charge of his brother's family,
              bringing up his nephew as his own son, was betrayed by his kin. "He paid
              the price of his ungratefulness. He failed to clear the CA exam and is now
              jobless. I harbour no grudges against them though," says Sahani. "I
              only took pity on them and forgave them."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Tough nut to crack</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">To
              forgive a folly on the part of a waiter, a blunder by a colleague, a betraying
              friend, a deceiving business partner, or overcome loss after a natural calamity
              requires calling upon ginormous reserves of kindness and compassion. This is
              possible when a distinction is made between expectations and reality, says Dr
              Agrawal of Nimhans. "We cannot control circumstances or even another
              person's behaviour. Things will always be different from how we'd prefer them
              to be," she says. "If there's a vast gap in this, you'll be more and
              more angry and sad."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Monga
              points out that everyone is dealing with hurt and trauma and pain, and "we
              come from a society that does not acknowledge it or talk about it", making
              it difficult to get closure. "I've realised that everyone is struggling
              with their lot and that there's a story behind each person's bad behaviour. So
              there's no reason to hold anything against them, but it's fine to develop
              compassion instead."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">This
              is just the thing Radhika Sharma* has started relying on. "I used to hold
              grudges earlier. I was told not to be rash and stubborn when I was a
              teenager," admits the 25-year-old, who has of late started forgiving one
              of her three most intimate friends for consistently not being around, including
              when Sharma's relationship with her boyfriend ended last month. "It's
              understandable that she is busy, but it has been hard to accept that your best
              friend isn't always going to be around. There were times when I'd get really
              upset, but over several years now, I've learnt to forgive."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Forgiveness and religion</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Buddhism</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">: Forgive others not because they deserve forgiveness,
              but because you deserve peace.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Christianity</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13pt;">: Bear with each other and forgive whatever grievances
              you may have against one another. Forgive as the Lord forgave you.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Jainism</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13pt;">: Kshamavani or Forgiveness Day is a day when Jains
              forgive and seek forgiveness, saying the Micchami Dukkadam prayer: "May
              all the evil that has been done be fruitless."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Judaism</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13pt;">: Jews mark Yom Kippus as the day of forgiveness. One
              must go to those he has harmed in order to be entitled to forgiveness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Islam</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13pt;">: Forgive them even if they are not sorry. Let them forgive and
              overlook, do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? For Allah is
              Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Do you have a forgiving personality?</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Agreeable
              people or people who adjust to a high degree, find it easier to forgive, says
              Nimhans' Dr Jyotsna Agrawal.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Those
              who are driven by negative emotions or neuroticism feel negative emotions far
              more intensely than others. "They too would find it harder to forgive
              easily," she says.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Narcissism
              is another thing that keeps people from forgiving i.e. thinking that what
              happened was unfair or why did it happen to me or why didn't I get a better
              deal, etc.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">How to forgive – in 3 easy steps</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">1)
              Stop noticing what's wrong in your life, and be grateful instead for all that
              you do have.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">2)
              Be mindful when experiencing negative emotions. Try to look at your emotions
              from a distance, which allows us the benefit of perspective. When we are able
              to distance from the pain, it is easier to forgive.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">3)
              Have compassion for the suffering of others, not just for yourself. We are all
              human, and capable of making mistakes.</span></p>
