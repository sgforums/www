            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Isis:</div><div class="quote_body">Is dualism cause by self ego ?</div></blockquote>It is not that the self ego causes dualism.. ego is not an entity, it is merely a process of identification and is fundamentally empty.<br><br>The judgment, division and separation is itself the workings of the sense of self, or the ego. The most fundamental duality is the duality of subject and object. This is because when there is a separate self or a subject, we see an 'other than' -- we see objects separate from ourselves as having inherent existence, and then we divide them into oppositions and dualities... i.e 'good and bad', 'tall and short', 'big and small', from there we grow dualistic attraction and aversion (i.e greed and hatred) to things or people, thus forming the 3 poisons, greed, hatred, ignorance.<br><br>Our Mind is simply like a mirror that is one with all that is arising moment to moment. It simply reflects and embrace fully, because it is not separate from, moment to moment arising. All reflections are in essence empty of any inherent existence, but when we fall into duality, we choose this over that, we separate what is whole into dualities and opposition.<br><br>In <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=242880" rel="nofollow">http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=242880</a><br><br><img src="http://xs413.xs.to/xs413/07122/tchen14.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://xs413.xs.to/xs413/07122/tchen15.jpg"><br><br>(by my Taiwanese teacher)<br><br>I wrote,<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">...Which is also why my Taiwanese teacher always say, Mind, Buddha, Sentient Beings are not three different things. Chu Shi Jian Fa (other-worldly dharmas) and Shi Jian Fa (worldly dharmas) are all empty in essence, all not separated from arising of causes and conditions and impermanent... therefore there is no purer states than everything else... therefore there is no choosing (zhu fa ping deng) for they are all empty and equal.<br><br>Like Thusness said, Like Zhuang Tze "zhou wang", allow the ten thousands things to flow in you and move heaven and earth with this non-preference. and "The problem is we choose, but all is really it. There is nothing to choose."...</span><br><br>Also when we talk about 'Non-Duality', we must also be able to discriminate what are the different forms of non-duality because when people talk about non-duality, it can actually mean many different things.<br><br>Non-Duality of Subject and Object is the sort of insight of enlightenment that there is no observer apart from the observed. It is seeing through the illusion of there being an Agent, Self, Watcher of phenomena, Doer of deeds, Thinker of thoughts...<br><br>Instead, deeds are done without a doer, hearing hears without a hearer, thought thinks without thinker, that all there is is simply the obvious self-luminous/self-knowing spontaneously arising appearances of "life" (which is not 'something' but an utterly transient-conditioned-arising-process of the 5 skhandas) with no one/no center living or experiencing it, and which there is no one/no self that could even escape from it even if they wanted to... all there is is simply an expression, a manifestation of our True Mind, our Buddha Nature, etc (pick a name, there is countless) which is essentially luminous-emptiness.<br><br>There is also another form of non-duality which is the non-duality of process, though we must be able to distinguish that the non-duality of subject-object  is different from this non-duality. This is the non-duality of Yin and Yang (including 'gain and loss', 'health and sickness', 'wealth and poverty', etc), which are in constant change and interaction, and therefore these polarities certainly isnÂ’t opposites; these extremities are themselves a single whole. It is only due to our power to abstract that we hold onto dualistic views.<br><br>The non-duality of process is like what Thusness said about attachment leading to non-attachment, as well as what Eckhart Tolle said which I posted before:</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>(continued)<br><blockquote><strong>CHAOS AND HIGHER ORDER</strong><br><br>When you know yourself only through content, you will also think you<br>know what is good or bad for you. You differentiate between events that are<br>Â“good for meÂ” and those that are Â“bad.Â” This is a fragmented perception of<br>the wholeness of life in which everything is interconnected, in which every<br>event has its necessary place and function within the totality. The totality,<br>whoever, is more than the surface appearance of things, more than the sum<br>total of its parts, more than whatever your life or the world contains.<br>Behind the sometimes seemingly random or even chaotic succession<br>of events in our lives as well as in the world lies concealed the unfolding of a<br>higher order and purpose. This is beautifully expressed in the Zen saying<br>Â“The snow falls, each flake in its appropriate place.Â” We can never<br>understand this higher order through thinking about it because whatever we<br>think about is content; whereas, the higher order emanates from the formless<br>realm of consciousness, from universal intelligence. But we can glimpse it,<br>and more than that, align ourselves with it, which means be conscious<br>participants in the unfolding of that higher purpose.<br><br>When we go into a forest that has not been interfered with by man, our<br>thinking mind will see only disorder and chaos all around us. It won't even<br>be able to differentiate between life (good) and death (bad) anymore since<br>everywhere new life grows out of rotting and decaying matter. Only if we are<br>still enough inside and the noise of thinking subsides can we become aware<br>that there is a hidden harmony here, a sacredness, a higher order in which<br>everything has its perfect place and could not be other than what it is and the<br>way it is.<br><br>The mind is comfortable in a landscaped park because it has been<br>planned through thought; it has not grown organically. There is an order here<br>that the mind can understand. In the forest, there is an incomprehensible<br>order that to the mind looks like chaos. It is beyond the mental categories of<br>god and bad. You cannot understand it through thought, but you can sense it<br>when you let go of thought, become still and alert, and don't try to<br>understand or explain. Only then can you be aware of he sacredness of the<br>forest. As soon as you sense that hidden harmony, that sacredness, you<br>realize you are not separate from it, and when you realize that, you become a conscious participant in it. In this way, nature can help you become realigned with the wholeness of life.<br><br><strong>GOOD AND BAD</strong><br><br>At some point in their lives, most people become aware that there is<br>not only birth, growth, success, good health, pleasure, and winning, but also<br>loss, failure, sickness, old age, decay, pain and death. Conventionally these<br>are labeled Â“goodÂ” and Â“bad,Â” order and disorder. The Â“meaningÂ” of people's<br>lives is usually associated with what they term the Â“good,Â” but the good is<br>continually threatened by collapse, breakdown, disorder; threatened by<br>meaninglessness and the Â“bad,Â” when explanations fail and life ceases to<br>make sense. Sooner or later, disorder will irrupt into everyone's life no<br>matter how many insurance policies he or she has. It may come in the form<br>of loss or accident, sickness, disability, old age, death. However, the<br>irruption of disorder into a person's life, and the resultant collapse of a<br>mentally defined meaning, can become the opening into a higher order.<br>Â“The wisdom of this world is folly with God,Â” says the Bible.3 What is<br>the wisdom of this world? The movement of thought, and meaning that is<br>defined exclusively by thought.<br><br>Thinking isolates a situation or event and calls it good or bad, as if it<br>had a separate existence. Through excessive reliance on thinking, reality<br>becomes fragmented. This fragmentation is an illusion, but it seems very real<br>while you are trapped in it. And yet the universe is an indivisible whole in<br>which all things are interconnected, in which nothing exists in isolation.<br>The deeper interconnectedness of all things and events implies that the<br>mental labels of Â“goodÂ” and badÂ” are ultimately illusory. They always imply<br>a limited perspective and so are true only relatively and temporarily. This is<br>illustrated in the story of a wise man who won an expensive car in a lottery.<br>His family and friends were very happy for him and came to celebrate. Â“Isn't<br>it great!Â” they said. Â“You are so lucky.Â” The man smiled and said Â“Maybe.Â”<br>For a few weeks he enjoyed driving the car. Then one day a drunken driver<br>crashed into his new car at an intersection and he ended up in the hospital,<br>with multiple injuries. His family and friends came to see him and said,<br>Â“That was really unfortunate. Â“ Again the man smiled and said, Â“Maybe.Â”<br>While he was still in the hospital, one night there was a landslide and his<br>house fell into the sea. Again his friends came the next day and said,<br>Â“Weren't you lucky to have been here in hospital.Â” Again he said, Â“Maybe.Â”<br><br>The wise man's Â“maybeÂ” signifies a refusal to judge anything that<br>happens. Instead of judging what is, he accepts it and so enters into<br>conscious alignment with the higher order. He knows that often it is<br>impossible for the mind to understand what place or purpose a seemingly<br>random event has in the tapestry of the whole. But there are no random<br>events, nor are there events or things that exist by and for themselves, in<br>isolation. The atoms that make up your body were once forged inside stars,<br>and the causes of even the smallest event are virtually infinite and connected<br>with the whole in incomprehensible ways. If you wanted to trace back the<br>cause of any event, you would have to go back all the way to the beginning<br>of creation. The cosmos is not chaotic. The very word cosmos means order.<br>But this is not an order the human mind can ever comprehend, although it<br>can sometimes glimpse it.</blockquote>~ A New Earth, Eckhart Tolle</div>
