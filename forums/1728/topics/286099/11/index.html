              <p>Hi wilsonhao,</p>
              <p>no you don't, and you don't have to feel pressured into. And, it's not true that most people are going to convert either. Just because people go to church, doesn't mean that they are all going to convert to Christianity either.</p>

              <p>Buddhist views and Christian views are fundamentally different on many levels... for example the most obvious of all is the Monotheistic view held by Christianity and Abrahamic religions.

              <p>The goals of Christianity is also quite different -- their goal is not 'enlightenment' but 'salvation' which can only be achieved through a savior.

              <p>I wouldn't say that the common religious teachings of Christianity is a way to enlightenment, because the path to enlightenment is not only about doing good and avoiding evil.</p>
              <p>The teachings of 'avoid all evil and do all good' is present in all kinds of religious teachings, and in fact is not peculiar to the teachings of religion. Our moral education basically teaches the same things, so do our own parents... morality is very much part of our culture. 'Avoiding all evil and do all good' will prevent the accumulation of negative karmas and lead to the accumulation of wholesome karma. As a result of this, the person can be reborn in higher realms of existence... perhaps even the heaven of the 33 gods.</p>
              <p>But this does not mean that he is anywhere near the path towards enlightenment, it is only the path towards a better rebirth in samsara. More enjoyment and less pain, but by no means 'the end of suffering' in the sense of Nirvana or liberation. While enjoying the fruition of their good karma (which are temporary and still of the nature of Dukkha) they have not liberated from the source of suffering.</p>
              <p>All the religions in the world that promotes morality and encourages wholesomeness leads their followers to the path of heaven, but it is only Buddhism that teaches about 'Liberation'. This can be done only by 'purification of mind' and this 'purification' is through liberating wisdom and insight into the nature of reality.</p>
              <p>When the Buddha taught 'avoid all evil, do all good, and purify the mind' most people only know about the first two but it is the third that is the essential part, the part of liberation. While the first two only ensures a good rebirth and positive conditions for the continuation of our dharma practice. So to summarise, other religions only teach the path of goodness but not the path of liberation and enlightenment, which Buddhism alone teaches. Hence not all religions are the same.</p>

              <p>Somehow, I think that Christianity might just be one of the
                              dharma doors to enlightenment.  Although the notion of a
                              creator is not accepted by Buddhism, it could be that the
                              Christian God is trying to persuade ppl to follow his way, which is
                              basically to do good.  I deem that God's paradise might be the
                              same as our Buddha pureland.</p>
              <p>While I can accept Christianity as one of the ways, most
                              Christians cannot accept Buddhism as it is.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>BTW in Christianity the belief is that we are created by a personal God and we need to be saved by the savior Jesus (otherwise we will be damned/go to hell). Hence they insist that salvation is only possible through Jesus. They do not believe in 'the path to enlightenment' much less 'many paths to enlightenment' -- they have very different goals in mind.</p>
              <p>So in the first place these Christian concepts are fundamentally different and thus irrelevant in the eyes of Buddhism, which does not accept the belief of a Creator, or of 'salvation'. We do not believe in being created by a God or being 'saved', we believe that the end of suffering can be achieved through liberation and insight into the nature of reality. And of course these are not just 'beliefs', it is actualisable -- many people have realised for themselves in their very lifetime.</p>

              <p>Actually my friend did not ask me to go to church, just that she kept mentioning God in every topic.  It's that in every conversation she wanted to insert her God into it.  Things like why I go for vegetarian food and why she doesn't believe in it etc.  It really makes conversation difficult to go on.  And I don't want to add my Buddhist view into it because I believe in non-conflict.</p>

              <p>I wouldn't say that the common religious teachings of Christianity is a way to enlightenment, because the path to enlightenment is not only about doing good and avoiding evil.</p>
              <p>The teachings of 'avoid all evil and do all good' is present in all kinds of religious teachings, and in fact is not peculiar to the teachings of religion. Our moral education basically teaches the same things, so do our own parents... morality is very much part of our culture. 'Avoiding all evil and do all good' will prevent the accumulation of negative karmas and lead to the accumulation of wholesome karma. As a result of this, the person can be reborn in higher realms of existence... perhaps even the heaven of the 33 gods.</p>
              <p>But this does not mean that he is anywhere near the path towards enlightenment, it is only the path towards a better rebirth in samsara. More enjoyment and less pain, but by no means 'the end of suffering' in the sense of Nirvana or liberation. While enjoying the fruition of their good karma (which are temporary and still of the nature of Dukkha) they have not liberated from the source of suffering.</p>
              <p>All the religions in the world that promotes morality and encourages wholesomeness leads their followers to the path of heaven, but it is only Buddhism that teaches about 'Liberation'. This can be done only by 'purification of mind' and this 'purification' is through liberating wisdom and insight into the nature of reality.</p>
              <p>When the Buddha taught 'avoid all evil, do all good, and purify the mind' most people only know about the first two but it is the third that is the essential part, the part of liberation. While the first two only ensures a good rebirth and positive conditions for the continuation of our dharma practice. So to summarise, other religions only teach the path of goodness but not the path of liberation and enlightenment, which Buddhism alone teaches. Hence not all religions are the same.</p>

              <p>Don't get me wrong.  I don't believe that the Christian God can lead us to nirvana; no offense to the christians.  But I do believe that their God is just one of the many around, and he has misunderstandingly thought that he's the creator.  However, his intention is good and through him, Christians will at least be born into the heaven realms, and hopefully will stay there until Maitreya Buddha comes into this world.  Then they can get liberated through him.  At least they're going to have a good life until liberation rather than being born into the lower realms eons after eons waiting for Maitreya.</p>

              <p>You see, that's the problem with us Buddhists, we tend to hold our views back because we think it will result in conflict. But i think, sometimes, you have to be a little direct and tell your friend that you feel uncomfortable, and sometimes, you should be a little stronger and add or state your views.</p>
              <p>Also, it's stated that those in the heavenly realms are one of those least receptive to hear the Buddha-Dharma, because they enjoy themselves so much that they do not find any need in wanting to even hear. Christians definetly do not believe in Maitreya, and who knows if they will even have a good life or get reborn in the lower realms after this life ends. Doesn't mean that if you are a Christian you automatically get born in heaven. For them, there's still the belief in the intermediatary period until resurrection during the Final Judgement.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Also, Pure Land in Pure Land Buddhism is WAYYYY different from the christian concept of heaven. Pure Land = Enlightenment, ie, you go to Pure Land, get Enlightened, then come back to lead other beings on the Path to Buddhahood; whereas heaven is still within the cycle of birth-and-death.</p></div>

              Found this via wiki:
              http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_in_Buddhism.
              
              In early Buddhism, in the Tittha Sutta AN 3.61, Buddha clearly states that "reliance and belief" in creation by a supreme being leads to lack of effort and inaction:
              
              Having approached the priests &amp; contemplatives who hold that...
              'Whatever a person experiences... is all caused by a supreme being's act of creation,'
              I said to them: 'Is it true that you hold that... "Whatever a person experiences... is all caused by a supreme being's act of creation?"'
              Thus asked by me, they admitted, 'Yes.'
              
              Then I said to them, 'Then in that case, a person is a killer of living beings because of a supreme being's act of creation. A person is a thief... unchaste... a liar... a divisive speaker... a harsh speaker... an idle chatterer... greedy... malicious... a holder of wrong views because of a supreme being's act of creation.'
              
              When one falls back on creation by a supreme being as being essential, monks, there is no desire, no effort [at the thought], 'This should be done. This shouldn't be done.' When one can't pin down as a truth or reality what should &amp; shouldn't be done, one dwells bewildered &amp; unprotected. One cannot righteously refer to oneself as a contemplative. This was my second righteous refutation of those priests &amp; contemplative who hold to such teachings, such views.

              <p>some christians will say that God give everyone free will, and he let people choose whether to believe him or not. However, they are contradicting themselves. Why do i say that? Because when we do not believe in christianity, they condemn us to eternal hell as a punishment for not believing in their God. If God really gave everyone free will, should there be punishment in the name of freewill?</p>
              <p>Secondly, when someone did something bad, they will say " Its not God who did it, Its the devil who make so and so do such things". In this case, where is the free will that they had spoken about? And anyway why subject all good happenings to be grace of God and unfortunate events to be the work of the devil?  </p>
              <p>Freewill exist but it comes from ourself. We give ourselves that, and not anyone else. Whatever good and bad we do, it is us that does the final action whether or not influenced.</p>
