              <p>There is a 5th option.... Quietly accept the Bible and then put
              it into the paper recycle bin.</p>
              <p>I did just that during one Good Friday Holiday. I was in a
              shopping mall minding my own business when a group
              of Christians passed me some evangelist materials.
              They insisted that I accept the materials no
              matter how hard I refused. In the end, I shut my mouth, accepted
              these materials and dumped them into a nearby recycle
              bin. </p>
              <p>Christians are happy that I 'accepted' their materials. I am
              happy coz the Christians left me alone... and Mother Gaia is
              happy about the recycling.</p>

              <p>I did not throw away the materials. I did not throw them into a 'normal' dustbin to be incinerated like common rubbish. I put them into a paper recycle bin... The materials will be put into better use after it is reborned as recycled paper. </p>
              <p>In a manner of speaking, I am giving the materials to people who might need it, and doing my little part to save the earth in the process.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 100%;">Who's that knocking on the door? </span><br><br></strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 100%;">A Buddhist's Guide to Evangelical Christianity</span><br><br>About six months ago there was a knock on my door and I opened it to find two evangelical Christians there. I knew they were evangelicals because they had that fake friendly smile on their faces, which all evangelicals have when they are trying to convert someone.<br><br>This was the third time that month that evangelists had come knocking on my door and disturbing me so I decided to teach them a lesson. 'Good morning' they said. 'Good morning' I replied.<br><br>'Have you heard about the Lord Jesus Christ'? they asked. 'I know something about him but I am a Buddhist and I'm not really interested in knowing more' I said. But like all evangelists, they took no notice of my wishes and proceeded to talk about their beliefs.<br><br>So I said, 'I don't think you are qualified to speak to me about Jesus'. They looked very astonished and asked, 'Why not'? 'Because', I said, 'you have no faith'. 'Our faith in Jesus is as strong as a rock' they insisted. 'I don't think it is' I said with a smile.<br><br>'Please open your Bible and read the Gospel of Mark, chapter 16, verse 16, 17 and 18' I said and while they flicked through their Bibles I went quickly inside and came out again. One of them found the passage and I asked him to read it out loud. It said, 'He who believes and is baptized will be saved but he who does not believe shall be condemned. And these signs will follow those who believe in my name. They shall cast out devils, they shall speak in tongues, they will handle snakes and if they drink poison it will not hurt them and they will lay hands on the sick and they will recover'.<br><br>When he finished I said, 'In that passage Jesus says that if you have real faith you will be able to drink poison and not die'. I took a bottle of Lankem from behind my back, held it up and said, 'Here is some poison. Demonstrate to me the strength of your faith and I will listen to anything you have to say about Jesus'.<br><br>You should have seen the looks on their faces! They didn't know what to say. 'What's the problem'? I asked. 'Is your faith not strong enough'? They hesitated for a few moments and then one of them replied, 'The Bible also says that we must not test God'. 'I'm not testing God', I said, 'I'm testing you. You love to witness for Jesus and now is your big opportunity'.

              <p>Quite humorous, it looks familiar though...</p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 100%;">Who's
              that knocking on the door?</span><br> <br></strong> <span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 100%;">A
              Buddhist's Guide to Evangelical Christianity</span><br> <br> About six months ago there was a knock on my door and I opened it
              to find two evangelical Christians there. I knew they were
              evangelicals because they had that fake friendly smile on their
              faces, which all evangelicals have when they are trying to convert
              someone.<br> <br> This was the third time that month that evangelists had come
              knocking on my door and disturbing me so I decided to teach them a
              lesson. 'Good morning' they said. 'Good morning' I replied.<br> <br> 'Have you heard about the Lord Jesus Christ'? they asked. 'I know
              something about him but I am a Buddhist and I'm not really
              interested in knowing more' I said. But like all evangelists, they
              took no notice of my wishes and proceeded to talk about their
              beliefs.<br> <br> So I said, 'I don't think you are qualified to speak to me about
              Jesus'. They looked very astonished and asked, 'Why not'?
              'Because', I said, 'you have no faith'. 'Our faith in Jesus is as
              strong as a rock' they insisted. 'I don't think it is' I said with
              a smile.<br> <br> 'Please open your Bible and read the Gospel of Mark, chapter 16,
              verse 16, 17 and 18' I said and while they flicked through their
              Bibles I went quickly inside and came out again. One of them found
              the passage and I asked him to read it out loud. It said, 'He who
              believes and is baptized will be saved but he who does not believe
              shall be condemned. And these signs will follow those who believe
              in my name. They shall cast out devils, they shall speak in
              tongues, they will handle snakes and if they drink poison it will
              not hurt them and they will lay hands on the sick and they will
              recover'.<br> <br> When he finished I said, 'In that passage Jesus says that if you
              have real faith you will be able to drink poison and not die'. I
              took a bottle of Lankem from behind my back, held it up and said,
              'Here is some poison. Demonstrate to me the strength of your faith
              and I will listen to anything you have to say about Jesus'.<br> <br> You should have seen the looks on their faces! They didn't know
              what to say. 'What's the problem'? I asked. 'Is your faith not
              strong enough'? They hesitated for a few moments and then one of
              them replied, 'The Bible also says that we must not test God'. 'I'm
              not testing God', I said, 'I'm testing you. You love to witness for
              Jesus and now is your big opportunity'. Finally one of then said,
              'We will go and speak to our pastor about this matter and come back
              and see you. 'I'll be waiting for you' I said as they scurried
              away. Of course they never came back again.<br> <br> Here is a bit of advice. Keep a copy of this Bible reference and a

              <p>So what do you think is Buddhism lacking in creating the 'passion for Buddhism' in youth? And why have the churches succeeded in attracting youth?

              <p>I agree with you statements about Chrsitainity being a simple belief. It is in fact a simple belief, and people find comfort in this belief. And I have also attributed the success of Christianity to three main causes (based on what I can remember during a brief discussion on this topic with Thusness):</p>
              <p><em>Thats right. Good observations.</em></p>
              <p><em>Of course, we also have to take into accounts of things, such as
                                                                  miracles, such as the promise of salvation and the fear of eternal
                                                                  condemnation, and so on.</em></p>
              <p><em>Bible is 'simple' -- or appears to be simple, in that
                                                                  all you have to do is have faith, and be saved. It sounds like a
                                                                  simple message that appeals to the masses, thats why Christianity
                                                                  is now the most popular religion in the world.</em></p>
              <p><em>And what about hell? Don't all of us fear being forever
                                                                  condemned in a lake of fire? That's why, fear is part of it.</em></p>
              <p><em>For Buddhism, we have a very rich philosophy and is very
                                                                  practical to all our lives... still, it requires certain kinds of
                                                                  conditionings for people to turn and look upon Buddhism... for me
                                                                  I'm fortunate, because my mom brought me to Buddhism at a very
                                                                  young age. But not everyone are so fortunate.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thusness also said that it's a cycle, that Christianity is now growing in the East, and that more people will look into Buddhism in the future. I can't remember what exactly he said but quite interesting.</p>
              <p>Also, Buddhism is truly the religion that can bring peace... if one knows how to apply the Buddhist teachings. Buddhism is essentially a very practical religion, and the Buddha does not make difficult philosophical proposition, all are simple truths and observable in every moment. The key is: observe, be mindful of reality all the time. It's not philosophy, and he taught that there is only one thing he teach: the cause and the end of suffering. You have to read from reliable books from experienced and enlightened masters to point the way to true practice that can lead to enlightenment.</p>
              <p>As for Emptiness, Emptiness should only be taught when one is sincere and ready and wishes to understand Emptiness. There are some people who cannot accept Emptiness, and for these other expedient means are required. For example, Buddha-Nature/Tathagatagarbha exists principally to describe emptiness in terms that those frightened of absence of identity can handle. At some point in time a practitioner will need to understand Emptiness, even just conceptually, to make progress. To a beginner, you can't tell him to read the philosophical books of Madhyamika to understand Emptiness.</p>
              <p>You can only refer them to relevant books that explains Emptiness in a very simple and straightforward manner, and that can link the teachings of Emptiness to one's daily life and how one can experience liberation through this viewless view. There are many such books written skillfully by enlightened masters, which you can refer them to.</p>

              <p>I agree with you statements about Chrsitainity being a simple belief. It is in fact a simple belief, and people find comfort in this belief. And I have also attributed the success of Christianity to three main causes (based on what I can remember during a brief discussion on this topic with Thusness):</p>
              <p><em>Thats right. Good observations.</em></p>
              <p><em>Of course, we also have to take into accounts of things, such as miracles, such as the promise of salvation and the fear of eternal condemnation, and so on.</em></p>
              <p><em>Bible is 'simple' -- or appears to be simple, in that all you have to do is have faith, and be saved. It sounds like a simple message that appeals to the masses, thats why Christianity is now the most popular religion in the world.</em></p>
              <p><em>And what about hell? Don't all of us fear being forever condemned in a lake of fire? That's why, fear is part of it.</em></p>
              <p><em>For Buddhism, we have a very rich philosophy and is very practical to all our lives... still, it requires certain kinds of conditionings for people to turn and look upon Buddhism... for me I'm fortunate, because my mom brought me to Buddhism at a very young age. But not everyone are so fortunate.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thusness also said that it's a cycle, that Christianity is now growing in the East, and that more people will look into Buddhism in the future. I can't remember what exactly he said but quite interesting.</p>
              <p>Also, Buddhism is truly the religion that can bring peace... if one knows how to apply the Buddhist teachings. Buddhism is essentially a very practical religion, and the Buddha does not make difficult philosophical proposition, all are simple truths and observable in every moment. The key is: observe, be mindful of reality all the time. It's not philosophy, and he taught that there is only one thing he teach: the cause and the end of suffering. You have to read from reliable books from experienced and enlightened masters to point the way to true practice that can lead to enlightenment.</p>
              <p>As for Emptiness, Emptiness should only be taught when one is sincere and ready and wishes to understand Emptiness. There are some people who cannot accept Emptiness, and for these other expedient means are required. For example, Buddha-Nature/Tathagatagarbha exists principally to describe emptiness in terms that those frightened of absence of identity can handle. At some point in time a practitioner will need to understand Emptiness, even just conceptually, to make progress. To a beginner, you can't tell him to read the philosophical books of Madhyamika to understand Emptiness.</p>
              <p>You can only refer them to relevant books that explains Emptiness in a very simple and straightforward manner, and that can link the teachings of Emptiness to one's daily life and how one can experience liberation through this viewless view. There are many such books written skillfully by enlightened masters, which you can refer them to.</p>

              <p>In my personal opinion people tend to get more inclined towards the
              church rather than Buddhism is mainly because Chirstian's teachings
              are much more straight-forward or easier to learn as oppose to
              Buddhist's teachings.</p>
              <p>Somehow, to find myself 'in Heaven under the glorious love of
              God' sounds much more easier than to be 'in Nirvana where there is
              no real cessation of self because there is no true entity known as
              self in the first place'.</p>
              <p>'To love God and find God's love in me' sounds like a much more
              straightforward path to happiness than to 'detach the roots of
              attachment after realising that the true nature of all
              things is empty of inherant nature'.</p>
              <p>When someone is facing a personal crisis, it's just so easier to
              say that 'God is testing you' rather than to explain the complex
              idea known as 'Karma' which even Buddhist themselves don't totally
              understand.</p>
              <p>People approach religion mainly to find peace, after facing
              stress in schools or the workplace. We certainly don't approach
              religion to find more stress in thinking why 'all compound
              phenomenon don't truly exist'. Admittedly, I'm one of those who is
              simply too lazy to ponder on questions like this.</p>

              <p>I think people tends to incline towards christian instead of buddhism because of 3 things:<br>Christians are very enthusiastic in preaching, through many method that seem to be very youthful and interesting.They go to buddhist region and even islam country to spread their religion. Christian parents also more keen to impart their religious thinking to the children, like bringing them to attend church service etc. Buddhist generally are more passive, haiz. but glad that things are changing now. :)<br>2nd reason is due to the long time colonisation of singapore by british, they have a lot of land given by the british government. People also tends to think that whatever the british and westerner practice and use is always superior.<br>3rd is christian's teaching that not believing in it will make one suffer in hell forever. So people feel scared to be punished, that's why join them.<br>Also because people tot burning josstick is the essence of buddhism, that's why when being approached, very fast to switch. In fact, if they only practice burning of josstick, it is in fact good for them to become christian.<br>IMO, I don't think simplicity is the reason of believing in christian. Buddhism also has simplicity in it, "avoid all evils, do all good" is a good starting point already.</p>

              <p>The state of nibbana is a personal experience (or rather, a non-experience, or cessation of experience). Whether you have experienced nibbana is another matter, but can we agree that it is an experience and not just theory? What the Buddha taught, is not a philosophical proposition, but an observation by him that we all can experience (gradually)... if we practice what he taught.</p>
              <p>Like if you went to the moon and you see that their soil is grey, when you come back and you tell others who didn't went to the moon, that the moon is grey, you aren't making a philosophical proposition but your actual observations.</p>
              <p>When Buddha spoke, he didn't spoke a theory, he spoke his own experience and how to experience it. i.e. the end of suffering is not a theory but his experience</p>
              <p><em>The Perfect One is free from any theory, for the Perfect One has
                                          understood what the body is, and how it arises, and passes away. He

I knew they were evangelicals because they had that fake friendly smile on their faces, which all evangelicals have when they are trying to convert someone.<br><br>This was the third time that month that evangelists had come knocking on my door and disturbing me so I decided to teach them a lesson. 'Good morning' they said. 'Good morning' I replied.<br><br>'Have you heard about the Lord Jesus Christ'? they asked. 'I know something about him but I am a Buddhist and I'm not really interested in knowing more' I said. But like all evangelists, they took no notice of my wishes and proceeded to talk about their beliefs.<br><br>So I said, 'I don't think you are qualified to speak to me about Jesus'. They looked very astonished and asked, 'Why not'? 'Because', I said, 'you have no faith'. 'Our faith in Jesus is as strong as a rock' they insisted. 'I don't think it is' I said with a smile.<br><br>'Please open your Bible and read the Gospel of Mark, chapter 16, verse 16, 17 and 18' I said and while they flicked through their Bibles I went quickly inside and came out again. One of them found the passage and I asked him to read it out loud. It said, 'He who believes and is baptized will be saved but he who does not believe shall be condemned. And these signs will follow those who believe in my name. They shall cast out devils, they shall speak in tongues, they will handle snakes and if they drink poison it will not hurt them and they will lay hands on the sick and they will recover'.<br><br>When he finished I said, 'In that passage Jesus says that if you have real faith you will be able to drink poison and not die'. I took a bottle of Lankem from behind my back, held it up and said, 'Here is some poison. Demonstrate to me the strength of your faith and I will listen to anything you have to say about Jesus'.<br><br>You should have seen the looks on their faces! They didn't know what to say. 'What's the problem'? I asked. 'Is your faith not strong enough'? They hesitated for a few moments and then one of them replied, 'The Bible also says that we must not test God'. 'I'm not testing God', I said, 'I'm testing you. You love to witness for Jesus and now is your big opportunity'. Finally one of then said, 'We will go and speak to our pastor about this matter and come back and see you. 'I'll be waiting for you' I said as they scurried away. Of course they never came back again.<br><br>Here is a bit of advice. Keep a copy of this Bible reference and a bottle of Lankem ready and every time the evangelists come to your door to harass you give them this test. You might like to have a polanga ready as well.</p>
