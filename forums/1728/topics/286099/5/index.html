I don't think there is such a  fix rule on marriages between christain n non-believer, but of cos usually one wld tends to follow one's spouse sooner or later. Especially, fr my observations, if the wife is a christain then most probably the hubby will convert to christainity later on. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  Maybe out of love for the wife n chrildren as well , cos usually the wife will baptise the kids too.<br><br>And many christains may believe that they can succeed in converting their non-christain spoues, so it's not uncommon to see such marriages nowadays too. I hv a relative whose hubby only becomes a christain recently after a marriage of 20 yrs.<br><br>For my case, i think my late ah gong was a wise and fair person as he was the one who stop the rest fr baptising me as a child then. He thought that it wld be better for me to choose what  i want when I grow up. Steady. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>And another factor  may be due to my paternal family members r the so-called "mild Christains" which belongs to the old-guard. We r the " lao hokkien christains"-  christainity has become like a family tradition n not so aggressive as some of todays young where most r converted to christainity out of fun, peer pressure, vanity, BG relationship,etc.<br><br>Oh, one more thing, if u choose to marry into a christain family, then of cos there r pressure to convert as u cannot escape fr ur new family members forever; but I guess when one decided to marry a christain, more or less he/she is not repulsive towards the religion liao. So, free choice. Don't blame anyone. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div></blockquote> Serious dating or marriage relationships among christians and non-christians is also another one of my concerns. for such issues are real, happening right in front of us; some are friends, some are relatives, and some, even fellow siblings or parents!<br></div>

He got ROM many years back. He's a buddhist (not sure is it josssticks or with understanding, cos never had a good chat with him on religion before) and he's then gf is a christian. So after ROM when they are about to do their custom marriage, she insisted that he convert or she will anull the marriage, so he converted. My grandma was very sad as he is the eldest grandson (for those who really know chinese custom would know zhang sun di zi). And they are very (I don't know is strict the correct word) strict christian, they don't eat the fruits that my grandma used to offer on the shrine at her house or those that offer during my grandpa's death anniversary.<br><br>Back then I was very young and it did give me negative impression on christianity. But like what cycle had said, I think there is no hard and fast rule that a conversion is a must for a non-christian to marry a christian.

Soka will be more difficult to differentiate from buddhism as compare to christianity.<br><br>In general, soka follows all the basic tenents of buddhism. Just that when come to their service, they recite the sacred title and focus on the gohonzon (lit. sacred object of worship).<br><br>But I do understand how the pressure was like.

I dunno how long <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> At least on the public forum.<br><br>Excerpts taken from <a href="http://www.budsas.org/ebud/beyond/beyond02.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.budsas.org/ebud/beyond/beyond02.htm</a>, <a href="http://www.budsas.org/ebud/beyond/beyond01.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.budsas.org/ebud/beyond/beyond01.htm</a> (Beyond Belief)<br><br>[b]Miracles</strong><br><br>Christians claim that miracles are sometimes performed in God's name and that the fact that this happens proves that God exists. This is an appealing argument until it is looked at a little more closely.<br><br>While Christians are quick to claim that because of their prayers the blind could see, the deaf could hear and crooked limbs were straightened, they are very slow in producing evidence to back up their claims. In fact, some Christians are so anxious to prove that miracles have occurred at their prayer meetings that the truth often gets lost in a flood of wild claims, extravagant boasts, and sometimes even conscious lies.<br><br>It is true that things which are unusual and difficult to explain do sometimes happen during religious events - but not just for Christians. Hindus, Muslims, Taoists, etc. all claim that their God or gods sometimes perform miracles. Christianity certainly does not have a monopoly on miracles. So, if miracles performed in God's name prove the existence of the Christian God, then miracles performed in the name of numerous other gods must likewise prove that they too exist.<br><br>Christians may try to overcome this fact by claiming that, when miracles occur in other religions, they are done through the power of the Devil. Perhaps the best way to counter this claim is to quote the Bible. When Jesus healed the sick, his enemies accused him of doing this through the power of the Devil. He answered that healing the sick results in good and if the Devil went around doing good he would destroy himself (Mk 3:22-26). Therefore the same could be said for the miracles performed by Hindus, Jews or Sikhs. If these miracles result in good, how can they be the work of the Devil?[/b]</blockquote>Good reading materials.

They suddendly don't eat the food the parents prepared during festive seasons meant for accesstors' offerings etc, which these kids hv been eating all their lives until they married a christain( to be fair, some still eat lah); some even threaten the parents by not attending their funerals in the future if they don't convert as well ( my cousin did exactly that to my aunt). Quite chaotic, man.<br><br>I also used to feel that christains r out to wreck the traditional family values n coehision. Now I think they only hold 50% responsibility ( due to their inflexibity n un-compassionate feelings towards others tradition n beliefs), the other 50 %, actually lies on the other partner.<br><br>Why? As I mentioned earlier, if one decided to marry a Christain( unless it was a planned secrecy), one actually deep in the heart has accepted Christainity liao. Its' a matter of time.  No offence, but I feel that two persons must hv the same level of "wisdom" to be able to fall in love enough to get married. They see eye to eye on many issues, same frequency.<br><br>So I always tell the parents not to blame your daughter-in-laws lah. Your sons choose their wives themselves with their eyes wide open. Its their own choice, so let it be. I find some Buddhist parents r quite cool, they just continue their practise even harder n was as solid as a rock, nobody, not even their beloved chrildren, can shake them. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Sorry, but I do feel a bit uncomfortable after not being able to understand why they were unable to consider long term and wide-ranging implications of their actions for their country and the rest of the world.<br><br>I will try to use your example and parts of advice from all here which I can understand and use , and if I'm stuck again after my cousin counter-attacks me (i lack the gift of real time response), please don't ignore me if I pm you. paiseh. haha. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div></blockquote>Hi Spnw, in all fairness, your opening post did ask for a buddhist view.

Hindus, Muslims, Taoists, etc. all claim that their God or gods sometimes perform miracles. Christianity certainly does not have a monopoly on miracles. So, if miracles performed in God's name prove the existence of the Christian God, then miracles performed in the name of numerous other gods must likewise prove that they too exist.<br><br>Christians may try to overcome this fact by claiming that, when miracles occur in other religions, they are done through the power of the Devil. Perhaps the best way to counter this claim is to quote the Bible.<br></div><div class="quote_body">When Jesus healed the sick, his enemies accused him of doing this through the power of the Devil. He answered that healing the sick results in good and if the Devil went around doing good he would destroy himself (Mk 3:22-26). Therefore the same could be said for the miracles performed by Hindus, Jews or Sikhs. If these miracles result in good, how can they be the work of the Devil?</div></blockquote>An interesting counter-view to Christianity's assertion that miracles that occur in other religions are the work of the Devil. Most importantly, it is quoted from the Bible itself.<br></div>

The beauty of being in a forum like this is that you can do away with pretention and niceties.
