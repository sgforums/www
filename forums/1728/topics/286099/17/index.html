              <p>Hi Maggie,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nice explanation, so can i conclude from your understanding, in Christian, to go heaven there is no a must to be a Christian, non-Christian can go heaven by exercising kindness, love, joy etc (whatever related to good deed) ?</p>
              <p>The reason i ask this because i ask few of my Christian friends, they go Church a lot, but their understanding is Only by become Christian and Accepting Jesus then you can go to heaven. I even find in some forum, the forumer dare to said, beside Christian God, all other religion is devil, which only make me shake head when i reading the topic.</p>
              <p>or maybe like you said you 1/2 Christian</p>
              <p>Your explanation about kingdom of God have some similliarity with my mind thinking that peace, joy, happiness is come from within our self (If i get your point right) <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>My personal take about the idea of cannot go to heaven simply not christian is that, it is an idea borned out from the church rather than from the Bible itself.</p>
              <p>From the NT, it is evident that one can only go to the Heavenly Kingdom through Christ, however, NT doesn't say that to go through Christ, you have to go through church.</p>
              <p>However, I guess church-going is a much easier group to manage and a way to strengthen the organisation.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, the idea of 2-life, present and afterlife only, makes the christians, especially the born-again ones more zealous in sharing their new found belief and reliance.</p>
              <p>As compared to the many-many lifetimes that buddhists have, some just backslide or slack away.</p>

              <p>IMO, most people nowadays are too superficial of their religion, taking it to be the absolute truth. I observed that most people commit themselves to a religion, without really understanding the virtues of the various religions. and that i despise. for me, i don't believe in any of the religions, but i simply view them as various sets of moral values and code of conducts. each religion has its own set of commendable strengths and weaknesses.</p>
              <p>Many people enter a religion because they were born into it, or they were influenced by peer pressure. i think that we should question ourselves before we step into the religion, "are the teachings true?". and choose our religion according to which sets of values we find most agreeable. it is not right to blindly adopt a particular religion "cos my parents, my ancestors were all followers of this religion".</p>
              <p>i seriously doubt the truth of the so called holy books, the Bible, Koran etc... they are afterall the works of men, not God. yes, you may say that they are the results of God's inspiration, but how do we truly know so? they may be simply written by the madmen of their respective time.</p>
              <p>and a question i have here.</p>

              <p>is it humans who created God, which therefore come into conflict with the notion that God created Man. which therefore mean that God did not exist.</p>
              <p>Or is there a even higher being which created God? if so, we are then not worshipping the true Almighty. also, it would bring about a never ending chain of answers regarding who created God.</p>
              <p>the question is base upon the assumption that like Man, God cannot simply exist on His own. He must be created somehow, by something, or that he does not exist.</p>
              <p>so, does God exists?</p>

                                                of all Buddhism does not accept the Judeo-Christian or other theistic

                                                was Brahmanism. In fact the Brahma was still worshipped nowadays.
                                                Brahma was known to be "The Supreme One, the All-mighty, the

                                                Jhana plane, the first plane among the 8 jhanic planes. There were
                                                higher realms above where he lives that he was unaware of, and above it

                                                Nevertheless all the devas below the 1st Jhana planes considered him as

                                                the intention to debate with the Buddha. The Buddha, with his ability
                                                to know another's mind, knew his intention and asked, "You claim to be

                                                welcomes death, he replied, "I did not create death."<br><br>Buddha
                                                asked him again, "All human beings experience sickness, did you create
                                                sickness also?" The king knew that nobody likes to be ill, and he
                                                replied, "I did not create illness."<br><br>Buddha asked many questions
                                                in succession, but the king denied that he created them. Eventually, he
                                                admitted that he did not create the universe and all things in it, and
                                                certainly not the human race. The king of heavens was full of regrets
                                                and he felt ashamed. Finally, he accepted Buddha as his teacher and
                                                invited Him to spread the Dharma in the heavens.</span></p>

              <h4>The question is whether or not the view of <em>pratityasamutpada</em> <em>(Dependent Origination)</em>, the
                                                General Theory I am discussing, infers a final cause, or source, either
                                                logically or temporally, or both, from which emerge all phenomena. If the
                                                General Theory does infer this, then rendering the General Theory with
                                                the term “dependent” would be accurate. I say this because in the monotheistic
                                                traditions, as well as in the platonic traditions, all things exist dependently;
                                                but what the monotheistic tradition means by this is that all things exist
                                                by the grace of an ultimate source, and that source is God.</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>On the other hand, if the General Theory does not infer such a final source
                                                or ground, then I need to ask the location of that which brings forth the
                                                appearances of this world. When I contemplate the General Theory I do not
                                                observe any inference for a final cause or source of existing things, and
                                                to which existing things return. The General Theory simply points to other
                                                things as the source for any particular thing. “When this exists, that
                                                comes to be,” draws our attention to other existing things. Once again,
                                                I see no reason, given the General Theory, to infer that the Buddha meant
                                                to imply the existence of a final source.</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>In addition, there exist very good historical reasons for rejecting the
                                                idea, in a Buddhist context, for an ultimate source interpretation of the
                                                General Theory. For example, Buddhism never developed a creation myth or
                                                story. Instead, Buddhism frequently refers to existence as beginningless
                                                and endless. This lack of a creation mythos, from the perspective of the
                                                various monotheisms, is quite distinctive. But this lack of a creation
                                                mythos in Buddhism is consistent with the view of the General Theory; I
                                                think I can infer that the lack of a creation mythos in Buddhism is directly
                                                derived from the central role of the General Theory.</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>The lack of a creation mythos in Buddhism reflects the General Theory’s
                                                focus on the appearance of things due to the existence of other things.
                                                Those other things, in turn, exist due to the appearance of other things,
                                                which are also existing due to other things, etc. This generates an infinite
                                                regress, which is logically self-referentially consistent, and has no beginning
                                                and no end. Notice also that the General Theory does not require the intercession
                                                of an ouside agency in order for this river of relationships to begin.
                                                Because the Buddha considered the General Theory as an elucidation of the
                                                very nature of things and existence as such, no special catalyst for this
                                                onward flowing is necessary. The location, therefore, of the source for
                                                the appearance of things is simply other things, spread out over all of
                                                existence, both in time and in space. In some of the ancient Indian exegeses
                                                they refer to this as “unlocated nirvana”; <em>unlocated</em> because this
                                                ultimate nature does not confine itself to any particular thing or corner
                                                of existence, <em>nirvana</em> because it is precisely this ultimate nature
                                                and its realization which brings about the peace of the cessation of all
                                                sorrow.</h4>

              <h4>The principle here, derived from the core insight of Interdependent Transformation,
                                                is that all things appear from a causal base. This understanding is extended
                                                to the existence of entire universes or world systems. The Dalai Lama makes
                                                this same point in his commentary on Shantideva’s <em>Guide to the Bodhisattva’s
                                                Way of Life</em>, the Ninth Chapter on Wisdom. Verse 124 speaks directly
                                                to this discussion:</h4>
              <blockquote>
              <h4>124. ... [I]f Creation were dependent upon conditions, the complete collection
                                                of those causal circumstances would be the cause, and not <em>Ishvara</em> [Note: <em>Ishvara</em> was a common name for God in ancient India, similar
                                                to <em>Yahweh</em>.] If the complete conditions were assembled, <em>Ishvara</em> would be powerless not to create; and if they were absent, there would

              <h4>The Dalai Lama’s Comment:</h4>
              <h4>If creation and destruction are dependent upon a collection of causal conditions,
                                                the totality of those conditions would be the cause, and not a God who
                                                is independent of and uninfluenced by events. If the causal conditions
                                                were assembled, <em>Ishvara</em> would be powerless not to create the resultant
                                                phenomena; and if they were not assembled, those phenomena would not be

              <p>Therefore
                                                in Buddhism, these kind of speculations about a Creator is useless.
                                                Instead, like a scientist, the Buddha encouraged the Buddhist
                                                practitioners to find out for themselves the truths that the Buddha
                                                said, to put it to test, and to see for ourselves, and to get
                                                enlightened. Buddhism does not encourage any blind belief and dogmas
                                                (see Kalama Sutra), and also encourages analytical questioning --
                                                whether this teaching actually helps us. If it does, then we should put it to practice.</p>
              <p>When we truly realise
                                                the truth of Dependent Origination, the question of Creator/Creation
                                                will no longer arise, because we understood the principle in which
                                                everything arises and pass away -- which is by conditioned 'genesis'. By realising the nature of reality (empty of self and phenomena, dependent arising) we will also be liberated from all sufferings of samsara and the cycle of rebirth.</p>

              <p>Religions have no monopoly over the teachings of morality. As Beyond Religion once wrote which is very true,</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Actually, I feel that religion cannot have an exclusive claim to
                                              morality and ethics. Free thinkers and Athiests abound that are
                                              morally upright, loving and compassionate. Conversely, religious
                                              people are often driven to misconduct and atrocities. The situation
                                              may be summarised by Steven Weinberg:</p>
              <p>Religion is an insult to human dignity. With or without it you
                                              would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil
                                              things. But for good people to do evil things, that takes
                                              religion.</p>
              <p>The quote is perhaps a tad anti-religionist, but it captures the
                                              essence that refuted religions' monopoly on morality.<br> <br> As Confucious mentioned, everybody is borned good. I attribute the
                                              'goodness' that everyone of us is borned with to the Buddha Nature.
                                              Some of these people become evil through upbringing (of lack
                                              thereof) as well as other circumstances. But there are also people
                                              who are brought up to be 'good' people but subsequently perverted
                                              by religion. (The greatest atrocities the human race has inflicted
                                              upon itself are often religiously motivated)<br> <br> Indeed, the notion that religions instil a sense of morality is
                                              outright scary as it denotes that all humans are evil, and that
                                              they only adhere to ethical codes pronounced by a divine being
                                              either for fear of divine retribution, or only pining after divine
                                              favours.....</p>

                                              all kinds of religious teachings, and in fact is not peculiar to
                                              the teachings of religion. Our moral education basically teaches
                                              the same things, so do our own parents... morality is very much
                                              part of our culture. 'Avoiding all evil and do all good' will
                                              prevent the accumulation of negative karmas and lead to the
                                              accumulation of wholesome karma. As a result of this, the person
                                              can be reborn in higher realms of existence... perhaps even the
                                              heaven of the 33 gods.</p>
              <p>But this does not mean that he is anywhere near the path towards
                                              enlightenment, it is only the path towards a better rebirth in
                                              samsara. More enjoyment and less pain, but by no means 'the end of
                                              suffering' in the sense of Nirvana or liberation. While enjoying
                                              the fruition of their good karma (which are temporary and still of
                                              the nature of Dukkha) they have not liberated from the source of
                                              suffering.</p>
              <p>All the religions in the world that promotes morality and
                                              encourages wholesomeness leads their followers to the path of
                                              heaven, but it is only Buddhism that teaches about 'Liberation'.
                                              This can be done only by 'purification of mind' and this
                                              'purification' is through liberating wisdom and insight into the
                                              nature of reality.</p>
              <p>When the Buddha taught 'avoid all evil, do all good, and purify
                                              the mind' most people only know about the first two but it is the
                                              third that is the essential part, the part of liberation. While the
                                              first two only ensures a good rebirth and positive conditions for
                                              the continuation of our dharma practice. So to summarise, other
                                              religions only teach the path of goodness but not the path of
                                              liberation and enlightenment, which Buddhism alone teaches. Hence
                                              not all religions are the same.</p>

              <p>I left christian religion 3 years ago after being involved in that for the last 22 years. You can guess my age.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Make no mistake, christian religion is a very good religion that teaches about love and compassion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, if a christian asks us to join their service, we should kindly decline and make our wish known to them. Be firm and polite. Don't let any bad thoughts arise in us. I am not aversed to attending christian ceremonies as I am seeing them with neutrality now.</p>

              <p><br>hi Spnwa07,</p>
              <p>Know what you mean, you want to decline nicely and still keep friendship, so that friends can still respect and accept each other's different faiths but some Christians won't let you off right? Then friendship may become more distant because of this - it's sad and unneccessary.</p>
              <p>You seem to have a lot of very useful advise from others in the forum. Here's one for you too. Use as last resort <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"> </p>
              <p>I was telling my friend how when evangelists knock on my door and try sell Christianity, I don't know if I should tell them I am Christian or not. If I say no, they won't let me go and if I say yes, they will try to chat me up and talk more because of Christianly brotherhood. But I just want to be left alone and watch telly! Then my friend (she is Anglican Christian) got a good suggestion : "Tell them you are Muslim - sure leave you alone one!" haha!</p>
              <p>But seriously, I can understand how you feel especially when the Christian trying evangelise to you is a close friend. Last time, I used to get it from my sister too, a staunch Christian. I love her lor, but sometimes, I wish I could tell her I wish she would love me just for me, just the way I am - not as a Christian "project" or "duty". </p>

              <p>It goes to show that no matter what religion, it's all about blind faith and buddhism has no excuse to it.</p>
              <p>And instead of ehipassiko, you chose to abuse your moderator's power in <em>simply removing what I had put up</em>.</p>
              <p>You should be ashame of calling yourself a buddhist.</p>
              <p>Anyway, it further concludes that this thread is all theory and no practice.</p>
              <p>And if there's practice, it's MCK-ism for sinweiy <em>not Buddhism</em>.</p>
              <p>I hope some rationale people out there had read what I had posted previously and think about it. It is because believe the sore loser is going to remove this posting.</p>

              <p>see, very easy to misinterpret. did i say the exact word "Theravada is hinayana"? no. never mention Theravada at all.</p>
              <p>hinayana thinking is not a kind of school per se. it's the content of the mind.  people who think they are 'greater vehicle', can also have hinayana thinking and mahayana thinking. some Theravada can also have mahayana thinking. this is truly not putting labels. its not judging the book by the cover.</p>

              <p> this is written previously:-</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Ajahn Chah is one enlightened person i admire that sound like mahayanists (and when i use "mahayana", i not puting down on Theravadin).</p>
              <p>base on my experience on Hua Yen Sutra/Buddha vehicle(Yi chan fa), and seeing people's reactions, i had notice the difference between hinayana and mahayana not base on the apparent or what people had wrote or journalized, that said Theravada is Theravada/Arahathood and Mahayana is Mahayana/Bodhisattvahood. or Theravada is hinayana.</p>
              <p>No. i think within Theravada, there's mahayana And hinayana. And within Mahayana, there's hinayana and mahayana. All in one, one in All. note i use cap for the 'm' and 'M'.</p>
              <p>What differences?</p>
              <p>hinayana cultivator - emphasis on the apparent meaning of what Buddha said; emphasis on sunyata of self; clear distinction between Buddhism from worldly dharma; prefer to meditate base on stillness of body; avoid polutions best as possible.</p>
              <p>mahayana cultivator - emphasis more on the significant than apparent; emphasis on sunyata of self And Dharma itself; able to blend/use worldly dharma to convert into Buddhadharma; "tong zhong xiu" able meditate amidst daily activities. ie they after cultivated bodily stillness in the mountain, they re-enter 'polutions' of urban area to enhance their meditative stillness. such standard of stillness of the mind powerful.</p>
              <p>so sometime i fall into the hinayana category and sometimes in mahayana category. but look forward to practice like mahayana standard, while hinayana is my foundation. :)</p>

              <p>no need, i put it back. if buddhist come to learn his disrespectfulness to Dharma master/teacher(not just MCK, others also), disparaging and sect bashing accusation, then they should be more ashame of calling themself a buddhist. my reply to his false allegations are posted in my reply to rokkie or the next post.</p>

              <p>The concept of almighty, all-knowing, all-loving, creator God does not exist in rationale and logical buddhistic thinking.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">sw : this is equal to Great Brahma god in Buddhism. <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/dhamma/sagga/loka.html">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/dhamma/sagga/loka.html</a></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">think i also explained before that it's according to target audiences. it's teaching buddhists NOT to look down or slander other religions. if they do, then they are no different than the regular fundermentalists.</span></p>
              <p>If your mck can tell people muslims and christians heavens are part of Amitabha's pureland, there is much room for people to exercise their discretion whether or not to believe.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> sw: doesn't matter who they are outside, it matters in the inside. ie. never judge the book by it's cover. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">"Those who teach a Dhamma for the abandoning of passion, for the abandoning of aversion, for the abandoning of delusion — their Dhamma is well-taught."<br>AN 3.72 - Ajivaka Sutta</span></strong></p>
              <p>Slander only applies when people deliberately twisted his words. The thing about mck is that, all of those stuff can be found in his own vcd. If you're going to say that we have to finish watching the whole series or what have you, please feedback to mck, to upgrade his presentation skills. I mean if the 'mainstream' buddhists are to slander him (according to you), then I believe mck has serious presentation problem that he may need to review.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">sw: that's why i said u</span><span style="color: #0000ff;"> also miss out those vcds that MCK stated otherwise. regarding presentation, majority can interpret, while the minority misinterpret. or do people have serious interpretation problem. anyway, it's perfectly okay not be perfect. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">people also need to reach His level of non-dualism. each dharma talk range from lower basic understanding to higher non-dualistic understanding. if higher non-dualistic understanding, cannot understand just emphasis on those u can understand. so it's not abt blind faith.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">hence all have explanation. if still cannot accept the rational explanation, then i think u are only for sect bashingism. ie not just against MCK, but against all people from other schools. only aim/pick on the bones in the eggs <span style="color: #3366ff;">é¸¡è›‹é‡ŒæŒ‘éª¨å¤´ã€‚don't want to see the good sides, only magnify the bad side (which is not). </span></span><span style="color: #0000ff;">u see we ever pick on ur school? this i think is more like the working of mara. destroying buddhism from the inside. people want to promote harmony in school, but don't want, want to promote separatisms.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">like mention, i also "hope some rationale people out there had read what I had posted and think about it. "</span></p>

              <p>it was said that muslims and christians heavens are part of Amitabha's pureland. actually i don't see anything 'wrong' from the state of <strong>“Material form and material form are not hindered one another” of Hua Yen School.  </strong>i see level not there yet.</p>
              <p>there are many well taught dharma and many followers. if one were to magnify the imperfect stuffs, then i think many would be cut of of dharma roots. nowadays, people very nitpicky å�¹æ¯›æ±‚ç–µ. äººé�žåœ£è´¤ï¼Œå­°èƒ½æ— è¿‡.</p>

              <p><br>yes, Heaven of 33. but Pureland is more than that. it's when the mind is pure the land is pure. everywhere can be pureland. hell can also be pureland for Earth store bodhisattva.</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">
              </span></p><p>that say:-</p>
              <p><em>All beings do not see mountains and waters in the same way. Some beings see water as a jeweled ornament, but they do not regard jeweled ornaments as water. What in the human realm corresponds to their water? We only see their jeweled ornaments as water. Some beings see water as wondrous blossoms, but they do not use blossoms as water. Hungry ghosts see water as raging fire or pus and blood. Dragons see water as a palace or a pavilion. Some beings see water as the seven treasures or a wish-granting jewel. Some beings see water as a forest or a wall. Some see it as the Dharma nature of pure liberation, the true human body, or as the form of body and essence of mind. Human beings see water as water. Water is seen as dead or alive depending on causes and conditions. Thus the views of all beings are not the same.</em></p>
              <p>i say if you are sitting next to a Buddha, be it Shakyamuni or Amitabha, what we, ordinary people see is samsaric environment. while what the Buddha see is pure land as described in Amitabha pureland sutra. a defiled mind see a defiled land. a pure mind see a pure land.</p>
