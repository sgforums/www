              <p>Vasubandhu's Discourse on the Pure Land states:</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: A1Nagao1; color: #000000; font-size: small;"><strong>When I contemplate the nature of that Land,<br> I find that it surpasses all states of existence in the three worlds.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Amitabha's Pure Land is more virtuous in nature compared to our own Buddhist concept of the 33 Heavens, the Brahma heavens (æ¢µå¤©) or even the Heaven of Non-Thought and Non Non-thought (é�žæƒ³é�žé�žæƒ³å¤©), which are within the Three Worlds, so how can one even equate the theistic concept(s) of heaven to the Pure Land(s)? Frankly, to say so, unfortunately, is degrading the Pure Land and the PL teachings!</p>
              <p>Tell a Jew/Christian/Muslim that their heaven is akin to our Buddhist Pure Land, not only will that land you in hot soup, people will also think, "what rubbish does Buddhism teach?!" This not only confuses the non-buddhists, but also Buddhists who do not practice Pure Land, as well as those who are practicing Pure Land! è‡ªæ��æ��ä»–!</p>

              <h3>The Buddha said to Ananda, "If a beggar in extreme poverty
                  sits by the side of a king, how can their appearances be compared?"<br> Ananda replied, "If such a man sits
                  by the side of a king, his emaciated, mean
                  and ragged appearance cannot be compared
                  with the king's. His appearance is a thousand
                  million kotis or even incalculable times
                  inferior to the king's. What is the reason
                  for this? The conditions of a beggar in extreme
                  poverty--being at the lowest social level,
                  with barely enough clothes to cover his body,
                  scarcely enough food to sustain his life,
                  with hunger and cold always tormenting him,
                  and having almost lost in human contact --
                  are all the result of his misdeeds in former
                  lives. In the past he did not cultivate roots
                  of virtue, but instead, accumulated riches
                  without giving anything to others. He became
                  more miserly as his wealth increased, desired
                  to obtain more, insatiably hankered after
                  further acquisitions and gave no thought
                  to good actions. Thus he piled up a mountain
                  of evil karma. When his life ended, all his
                  wealth was gone, and what he had accumulated
                  with great toil and worry was of no avail
                  to him; all passed in vain into the possession
                  of others. Having no stock of merit on which
                  to depend and no virtue on which to rely,
                  after death he fell into one of the evil
                  realms, where he suffered pain for a long
                  period. When his karmic retributions ended,
                  he was able to escape, but was reborn into
                  a lower class; being foolish, base and inferior,
                  he barely maintains the appearance of a human
                  being.<br> "The king of a country is the most Honored of
                  all men. This is the reward for virtues accumulated
                  in former lives, in which he, with a compassionate
                  heart, gave generously to many, saved people
                  from suffering through kindness and benevolence,
                  performed good deeds with sincerity, and
                  never disputed with others. When that life
                  ended, he was rewarded by rebirth into a
                  higher state. Born in a heavenly realm, he
                  enjoyed bliss and happiness. His accumulated
                  virtues produced such a surplus of goodness
                  that, when he was reborn as a man in this
                  life, his birth was, deservedly, into a royal
                  family. Being naturally noble, his dignified
                  and majestic demeanor commands the respect
                  of his people, and superb clothes and sumptuous
                  food are prepared and served to him as he
                  pleases. All this is a reward for virtues
                  from his past lives."</h3>
              <h3>The Buddha said to Ananda, "What
                      you say is true. Even though a king is the
                      noblest of all men and has a regal countenance,
                      if he is compared with a wheel-turning monarch,
                      he will appear as base and inferior as a
                      beggar beside a king. Likewise, however excellent
                      and unrivaled the majestic appearance of
                      such a monarch may be, if he is compared
                      with the lord of the Heaven of the Thirty-three
                      Gods, he will also appear incomparably inferior,
                      even ten thousands kotis of times more so.
                      Again, if this heavenly lord is compared
                      with the lord of the Sixth Heaven, he will
                      appear a hundred thousand kotis of times
                      inferior. If the lord of the Sixth Heaven
                      is compared with a bodhisattva or a shravaka
                      dwelling in the land of Amitayus, his countenance
                      and appearance will be far from matching
                      those of the bodhisattva or shravaka, being
                      a thousand million kotis of times or even
                      incalculable times inferior."</h3>
              <p>Sorry if i am found to be "nitpicking", putting labels or being dualistic, but this has to be clarified! If i am being dualistic, then from the above quote from the Larger Sutra, our Saha-world Teacher is even more so, because that Sutra comes from His Golden Mouth.</p>

              <p> 'cos it's a fact that he is not teaching proper Buddhism.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">sw: think u also miss out those vcd that MCK stated otherwise.</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">best to transcend labeling.</span></p>
              <p>The concept of almighty, all-knowing, all-loving, creator God does not exist in rationale and logical buddhistic thinking.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">sw : this is equal to Great Brahma god in Buddhism. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/dhamma/sagga/loka.html">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/dhamma/sagga/loka.html</a></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">think i also explained before that it's according to target audiences. it's teaching buddhists NOT to look down or slander other religions. if they do, then they are no different than the regular fundermentalists.</span></p>
              <p>If your mck can tell people muslims and christians heavens are part of Amitabha's pureland, there is much room for people to exercise their discretion whether or not to believe.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> sw: doesn't matter who they are outside, it matters in the inside. ie. never judge the book by it's cover.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">"Those who teach a Dhamma for the abandoning of passion, for the abandoning of aversion, for the abandoning of delusion — their Dhamma is well-taught."<br>AN 3.72 - Ajivaka Sutta</span></strong></p>
              <p>Slander only applies when people deliberately twisted his words. The thing about mck is that, all of those stuff can be found in his own vcd. If you're going to say that we have to finish watching the whole series or what have you, please feedback to mck, to upgrade his presentation skills. I mean if the 'mainstream' buddhists are to slander him (according to you), then I believe mck has serious presentation problem that he may need to review.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">sw: that's why i said u</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">also miss out those vcds that MCK stated otherwise. regarding presentation, majority can interpret, while the minority misinterpret. or do people have serious interpretation problem. anyway, it's perfectly okay not be perfect.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">people also need to reach His level of non-dualism. each dharma talk range from lower basic understanding to higher non-dualistic understanding. if higher non-dualistic understanding, cannot understand just emphasis on those u can understand. so it's not abt blind faith.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">hence all have explanation. if still cannot accept the rational explanation, then i think u are only for sect bashingism. ie not just against MCK, but against all people from other schools. only aim/pick on the bones in the eggs <span style="color: #3366ff;">é¸¡è›‹é‡ŒæŒ‘éª¨å¤´ã€‚don't want to see the good sides, only magnify the bad side (which is not).</span></span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">u see we ever pick on ur school? this i think is more like the working of mara. destroying buddhism from the inside. people want to promote harmony in school, but don't want, want to promote separatisms.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">like mention, i also "hope some rationale people out there had read what I had posted and think about it. "</span></p>

              <p>yes, nobody are saying that the quote above is incorrect. all i'm saying is <span style="font-size: normal; color: #000000; font-family: A1Nagao1;"><span style="font-size: x-;"><strong>when the mind is pure the land is pure.</strong> å¿ƒå‡€ä½›åœŸ.  </span></span></p>

              <p><br>You believe in everything that has been taught to you when you attend school?</p>
              <p>It's an experience and I don't meant to be an insult.</p>
              <p>From my point of view and experience in this thread, many buddhists are quick to criticise how christians conduct their sermon by mere <em>hearsay<em>. So why not attend to experience for yourself <em>then<em> comment?</em></em></em></em></p>
              <p>I wonder had AEN finally attend any church/cell service or not.</p>

              <p>excuses. like explained, it's mistaken. anyway no solid proof, it's just "ur words". would best have solid proof or link to a decoded video to study. can be done. no proof cannot speculate or believe.</p>
              <p>i say poor presentation is not the problem. if one need really prefect presentation skill to present, then i say can forget about propagating Dharma altogether..</p>
              <p>moreover, if say not proper, then the whole of Buddhist community or internet, would have equal the teaching to falungong, cults... etc and rebuted it...and made known. but no. not to that extend. He's still been respected as a whole, even from the west. so such people that make problems are really one of a kind. i say this not as an actual "disciple" of Him, <strong>i'm not</strong>. but as a common buddhist and common knowing from all around. if happen to other <em>good</em> masters, i'll still protect the same.</p>
              <p>i learnt from more dharma teachers than u think it's just only MCK. i seek dharma joy æ³•å–œ. MCK's teaching more traditional, i agree. but it's also about not being a èƒŒå¸ˆ<strong>å�›é�“.</strong> one that is against the way.</p>
