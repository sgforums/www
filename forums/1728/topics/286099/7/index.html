If you have read all my posts not just here or in EH, I have always said without fear, favour or pretentions. I don't whisper sweet nothings here in this forum but neither am I vulgar. Do you have a problem with that?<br>Sure, my comments are stirring, often to present alternative views. You are so used to only hearing what you want to hear, or your style. Did you read about what I said about Ronald Reagan and George Bush?<br>The BEAUTY of being in a forum like I said before: is that you don't have to face a black face when you tell the forumer in the face! Let's face it, you are not up to mark to face alternative views.  You take that as shooting mouth. How about I tell you this: What you said is also shooting your mouth. And what makes you think that only what you said is all civil?  I come across self-righteousness everyday, and you are just one of the many!</div>

Somebody else's Gods/ deities may be classified under gods "people anyhow worship" under your religion.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by An Eternal Now:<br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Excerpt from A New Earth by Eckhart Tolle, page 13 to 19</span><br><br>THE ARISING NEW CONSCIOUSNESS</strong><br><br>Most ancient religions and spiritual traditions share the same common insight Â– that our Â“normalÂ” state of mind is marred by a fundamental defect. However, out of this insight into the nature of the human condition Â– we may call it the bad news Â– arise a second insight: the good news of the possibility of a radical transformation of human consciousness. In Hindu teachings (and sometimes in Buddhism also), this transformation is called <span style="font-style: italic;">enlightenment</span>. In the teachings of Jesus, it is <span style="font-style: italic;">salvation</span>, and in Buddhism, it is <span style="font-style: italic;">the end of sufferings. Liberation</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">awakening</span> are other terms used to describe this transformation.<br><br>The greatest achievement of humanity is not the works of art, science, or technology, but the recognition of its own dysfunction, its own madness. In the distant past, this recognition already came to a few individuals. A man called Gautama Siddhartha, who lived 2,600 years ago in India, was perhaps the first who saw it with absolute clarity. Later, the title <span style="font-style: italic;">Buddha</span> was conferred upon him. Buddha means Â“the awakened one.Â” At about the same time, another of humanityÂ’s early awakened teachers emerged in China. His name was Lao Tzu. He left a record of his teaching in the form of one of the most profound spiritual books ever written, the <span style="font-style: italic;">Tao Te Ching</span>.<br><br>To recognise oneÂ’s own insanity is, of course, the arising of sanity, the beginning of healing and transcendence. A new dimension of consciousness had begun to emerge on the planet, a first tentative flowering. Those rare individuals then spoke to their contemporaries. They spoke of sin, of suffering, of delusion. They said, Â“Look how you live. See what you are doing, the suffering you create.Â” They then pointed to the possibility of awakening from the collective nightmare of Â“normalÂ” human existence. They showed the way.<br><br>The world was not yet ready for them, and yet they were a vital and necessary part of human awakening. Inevitably they were mostly misunderstood by their contemporaries as well as by subsequent generations. Their teachings, though both simple and powerful, became distorted and misinterpreted, in some cases even as they were recorded in writing by their disciples. Over the centuries, many things were added that had nothing to do with the original teachings, but were reflections of a fundamental misunderstanding. Some of the teachers were ridiculed, reviled, or killed; others came to be worshiped as gods. Teachings that pointed the way beyond the dysfunction of the human mind, the way out of the collective insanity, were distorted and became themselves part of the insanity.<br><br>And so religions, to a large extent, became divisive rather than unifying forces. Instead of bringing about an end of violence and hatred through a realisation of the fundamental oneness of all life, they brought more violence and hatred, more divisions between people as well as between different religions and even within the same religion. They became ideologies; belief systems people could identify with and so use them to enhance their false sense of self. Through them, they could make themselves Â“rightÂ” and others Â“wrongÂ” and thus define their identity through their enemies, the Â“others,Â” the Â“nonbelieversÂ” or Â“wrong believersÂ” who not infrequently they saw themselves justified in killing. Man made Â“GodÂ” in his own image. The eternal, the infinite, and unnameable was reduced to a mental idol that you had to believe in and worship as Â“my godÂ” or Â“our god.Â”<br><br>And yetÂ…. And yetÂ… in spite of all the insane deeds perpetrated in the name of religion, the Truth to which they point still shines at their core. It still shines, however dimly, through layers upon layers of distortion and misinterpretation. It is unlikely; however, that you will be able to perceive it there unless you have at least already had glimpses of that Truth within yourself. Throughout history, there have always been rare individuals who experienced a shift in consciousness and so realised within themselves that toward which all religions point. To describe that nonconceptual Truth, they then used the conceptual framework of their own religions.<br><br>Through some of those men and women, Â“schoolsÂ” or movements developed within all major religions that represented not only a rediscovery, but in some cases an intensification of the light of the original teaching. This is how Gnosticism and mysticism came into existence in early and medieval Christianity, Sufism in the Islamic religion, Hasidism and Kabbalah in Judaism, Advaita Vedanta in Hinduism, Zen and Dzogchen in Buddhism. Most of these schools were iconoclastic. They did away with layers upon layers of deadening conceptualisation and mental belief structures, and for this reason most of them were viewed with suspicion and often hostility by the established religious hierarchies. Unlike mainstream religion, their teachings emphasised realisation and inner transformation. It is through these esoteric schools or movements that the major religions regained the transformative power of the original teachings, although in most cases, only a small minority of people had access to them. Their numbers were never large enough to have any significant impact on the deep collective unconsciousness of the majority. Over time, some of those schools themselves became too rigidly formal or conceptualised to remain effective.</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by An Eternal Now:<br><strong>SPIRITUALITY AND RELIGION</strong><br><br>What is the role of the established religions in the arising of the new consciousness? Many people are already aware of the difference between spirituality and religion. They realise that having a belief system Â– a set of thoughts that you regard as the absolute truth Â– does not make you spiritual no matter what the nature of those beliefs is. In fact, the more you make your thoughts (beliefs) into your identity, the more cut off you are from the spiritual dimension within yourself. Many Â“religiousÂ” people are stuck at that level. They equate truth with thought, and as they are completely identified with thought (their mind), they claim to be in sole possession of the truth in an unconscious attempt to protect their identity. They donÂ’t realise the limitations of thought. Unless you believe (think) exactly as they do, you are wrong in their eyes, and in the not-too-distant past, they would have justified in killing you for that. And some still do, even now.<br><br>The new spirituality, the transformation of consciousness, is arising to a large extent outside the structures of the existing institutionalised religions. They were always pockets of spirituality even in mind-dominated religions, although the institutionalised hierarchies felt threatened by them and often tried to suppress them. A large-scale opening of spirituality outside of religious structures is an entirely new development. In the past, this would have been inconceivable, especially in the West, the most mind-dominated of all cultures, where the Christian church had a virtual franchise on spirituality. You couldnÂ’t just stand up and give a spiritual talk or publish a book unless you were sanctioned by the church, and if you were not, they would quickly silence you. But now, even within certain churches and religions, there are signs of change. It is heartwarming, and one is grateful for even the slightest signs of openness, such as Pope John Paul II visiting a mosque as well as a synagogue.<br><br>Partly as a result of the spiritual teachings that have arisen outside the established religions, but also due to an influx of the ancient Eastern wisdom teachings, a growing number of followers of traditional religions are able to let go of identification with form, dogma, and rigid belief systems and discover the original depth that is hidden within their own spiritual tradition at the same ime as they discover the depth within themselves. They realise that how Â“spiritualÂ” you are has nothing to do with what you believe but everything to do with your state of consciousness. This in turn, determines how you act in the world and interact with others.<br><br>Those unable to look beyond form become even more deeply entrenched in their beliefs, that is to say, in their mind. We are witnessing not only an unprecedented influx of consciousness at this time but also an entrenchment and intensification of the ego. Some religious institutions will be open to the new consciousness; others will harden their doctrinal positions and become part of all the other man-made structures through which the collective ego will defend itself and Â“fight back.Â” Some churches, sects, cults, or religious movements are basically collective egoic entities, as rigidly identified with their mental positions as the followers of any political ideology that is closed to any alternative interpretation of reality.<br><br>But the ego is destined to dissolve, and all its ossified structures, whether they be religious or other institutions, corporations, or governments, will disintegrate from within, no matter how deeply entrenched they appear to be. The most rigid structures, the most impervious to change, will collapse first. This has already happened in the case of Soviet Communism. How deeply entrenched, how solid and monolithic it appeared, and yet within a few years, it disintegrated from within. No one foresaw this. All were taken by surprise. There are many more such surprises in store for us.</blockquote></div>

Christians have the Holy Trinity: Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Jesus is considered God because he is the Son. Muslims and Jews deny this but Allah (Arabic), YHW - Yahweh (Hebrew) and God (English) are One and the Same to the three. They share the same prophets - Abraham, Moses, David, Solomon, etc. Only difference is, Jews do not recognise Jesus as a prophet nor as Son of God; while Muslims recognise Jesus as one of God's prophet, but not Son of God.<br><br>2. There is a concept of Hell in Judaism as well. However, like the Catholic concept of hades, there is no eternal damnation. To quote from Wikipedia:<br>"The Bible contains references to Sheol lit. gloom, as the common destination of the dead, which may be compared with the Hades or underworld of ancient religions. In later tradition this is interpreted either as Hell or as a literary expression for death or the grave in general.<br><br>According to aggadic passages in the Talmud, God judges who has followed His commandments and who does not and to what extent. Those who do not "pass the test" go to a purifying place (sometimes referred to as Gehinnom, i.e. Hell, but more analogous to the Christian Purgatory) to "learn their lesson". There is, however, for the most part, no eternal damnation. The vast majority of souls can only go to that reforming place for a limited amount of time (less than one year). Certain categories are spoken of as having "no part in the world to come", but this appears to mean annihilation rather than an eternity of torment."<br><br>Interestingly, some Jewish mystic denominations have the concept of reincarnation, but this is commonly rejected by most Jews.<br><br>3. The concept of tithe has its roots in Judaism. I do not know if the Jews still follow this practice. Also, tithe is not compulsory in all denominations or churches.<br><br>4. Heaven and Paradise can be considered the same.<br><br>5. Judaism, has for most of its part, remained an ethnic religion like Chinese Taoism or Japanese Shintoism, that is why there is no active proselytization, but it does not mean that they do not welcome new converts.</div>

Please try to get the facts right before putting it on a forum as it will easily mislead.<br><br>In the Mahaparinibbana Sutta which was prior to Buddha's parinibbana, Buddha spoke to Venerable Ananda:<br><br><strong>""It may be, Ananda, that to some among you the thought will come: 'Ended is the word of the Master; we have a Master no longer.' But it should not, Ananda, be so considered. For that which I have proclaimed and made known as the Dhamma and the Discipline, that shall be your Master when I am gone."</strong><br><br>So what Buddha reminded us prior His parinibbana was that we should always refer our practice to the Dhamma and Discipline that He had laid down.<br><br>The Kalama Sutta itself is an often misquote and abused sutta which ended up buddhists used it questionn their own beliefs. A study on the sutta's background would allow one to understand Buddha said this teachings when He met the group of kalama who are highly intellectual people. So many of the other religions tried to impress them by presenting very highly of their own religions. Buddha, being most wise, instead of presenting as per norm, He had in fact used a reverse psychological tactic which made the kalama to think for themselves.<br><br><strong>The Criterion for Acceptance<br>10. "Come, Kalamas. Do not go upon what has been acquired by repeated hearing; nor upon tradition; nor upon rumor; nor upon what is in a scripture; nor upon surmise; nor upon an axiom; nor upon specious reasoning; nor upon a bias towards a notion that has been pondered over; nor upon another's seeming ability; nor upon the consideration, 'The monk is our teacher.' Kalamas, when you yourselves know: 'These things are good; these things are not blamable; these things are praised by the wise; undertaken and observed, these things lead to benefit and happiness,' enter on and abide in them.<br><br>15. "Therefore, did we say, Kalamas, what was said thus, 'Come Kalamas. Do not go upon what has been acquired by repeated hearing; nor upon tradition; nor upon rumor; nor upon what is in a scripture; nor upon surmise; nor upon an axiom; nor upon specious reasoning; nor upon a bias towards a notion that has been pondered over; nor upon another's seeming ability; nor upon the consideration, "The monk is our teacher." Kalamas, when you yourselves know: "These things are good; these things are not blamable; these things are praised by the wise; undertaken and observed, these things lead to benefit and happiness," enter on and abide in them.'<br><br>--- From Kalama Sutta</strong><br><br>So the end purpose was that Buddha whom believe that His Dhamma is the best, still intend to convert the kalama into the Dhamma too!<br><br>So it is obvious that Kalama Sutta is used on <strong>non</strong>-buddhists instead of buddhists ourselves. It should be seen as a method for us to apply when a non-buddhistic faith tried to challenge our faith.</div>
