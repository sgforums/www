I can place a bet with you they don't know how to answer you because the Bible or the Church never teach them so.  One of the thing you must remember is that: Christians are 'commanded' to 'save' this world.  By that it means everyone they know and can be persuade either subtlely or by deceit to go to church or accept the Christian God.  It is in the Bible because that is the authority they quote.<br>My grandmother who was for all her life an ancestor worshipper was taken to church by a relative on the pretext of bringing her out for 'jalan-jalan'.  And when she became bed-ridden when she fell, they brought a pastor to her home to baptise her!<br>Just like you, I too had been asked, and my answer to them: I was a Christian, and I probably know more than you, and I have very good reason to be a free-thinker. If you think and think even more and deeply, you will also one day arrive at the same conclusion as me! From that day onward, they stopped asking me and also stopped treating me as friend. So, you know what Christians are! They have a motive.</div></blockquote> I wanted to, but I decided against it cos this question might make some Christians uncomfortable. So..better not.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by yamizi:<br><strong>Hi Spwn07,<br><br>I think it is no harm for you to attend church with your cousin for a few times. Firstly, you can treat it as an educational tour for you to understand why Christianity seems to be a favourite choice among young working adults.<br><br>Secondly, it can be a test of your own belief and your understanding of it. Attending sermons and make the comparisons, looking out for similiarities and differences, personally I find that it aids your own spiritual growth.<br><br>Thirdly, if after your visits, you really find that Christianity is not for you; or the church is not for you, then you can tell your cousin that you had been there and experienced and know that it is [b]really</strong> not your cup of tea.<br><br>Fourthly, as mentioned by justdoit77, you can negotiate a trade off with your cousin. But as told by a friend of mine before, usually after you have attended church, when it's their time to go to a dhamma talk, they will have 'reasons' not to show up in the last minute. Ain't sure how true is it. Probably if you're using this method, you can make your cousin to attend dhamma talk first before you attend church with him.<br><br>Finally, or heed what sleepwalkering had said, "Thank you for the invitation, i am comfortable with mine."<br><br>Anyway, you need not be too concerned or bothered with whether or not to explain to people to what you believe. At the end of the day, it is more important that you <span style="font-style: italic;">really</span> do know what you believe in. Have that confidence in yourself and ignore the ridicules. We can't please the whole world, at least, please ourselves.<br><br>There are various inspiring and touching testimonials that christians will give but nonetheless they are revolved around in believing that God has touched their lives. If that, in respect to the mental and spiritual sense, do give them comfort, I think it is really nothing wrong with it. But of course that doesn't mean that we allow them to push their opinion on us. And of course as buddhist don't believe in the existence of such a creator God, our confidence in the Dhamma shouldn't be shaken in any way. We understand that every results are due to cause and condition. So having a God pop out of nowhere doesn't quite tally with the principle of Dhamma.<br><br>On this onus, it will be our understanding and faith in the Dhamma that will pull us through. I also have quite a handful of friends who become christians and always tried to invite me to their churches.<br><br>I used to go churches on a regular and frequent basis few years back, on my own, not invited. It is quite a fruitful experience for me and I observed and learned that why people go to churches.<br><br>But anyhow, end of the day, don't be bothered by these little things in life. In life, there will be more important things to be worried and concerned about.<br><br>May you have fun in your spiritual quest =)[/b]</blockquote> Thanks for your advice.  Perhaps you are better in your terms of wit and communication skills and that your Christian friends have already somehow, I don't know, just know when to back off.<br><br>I have been to churches at the invitation of friends before, this is definitely not my first time.<br><br>Yes, this may be a little thing. But if not handled properly, not only will I not be able to continue interacting with people from different religions, I will not be growing in terms of interpersonal communication skills and spiritual cultivation.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Spnw07.<br><br>Yah, can understd ur feelings. But I guess we just hv to be firm with our beliefs n everything will be fine ie. no hard feelings, no paiseh, no unhappiness, no fightings at all when we decline the invitations or even went to one. We will still come out as a Buddhists. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Basically I don't go to any, but will attend church weddings to offer my blessings to the married couples. And yes, in such occasions, I wld hv to sit through the sermons or preachings as well. But no harm done lah, just that sometimes precious time was wasted. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Actually, fr my father's side there r 3 pastors and almost the whole congregation of one church are my extended famiy members. It's like a mini clan association. Our "clan" has been christians since my grand-parents for 3 generations n counting<br><br>My mother's side are Taoists, free-thinkers, ming jain xing yang followers.<br><br>My mom n I hv been Buddhist for 20 yrs. We r the only 2 Buddhist in our families. But we r still on good terms with everybody, no problem at all. If they wan to know abt Buddhism, we try our best to explain to them. If they wan to "fight", we let them satisfy them own aggressions, then when they've cooled down or bored, we continue with our other topics n be jolly again. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> If they wan to preach, then we wld keep quite n listen, then say thank u n continue fr where we hv stopped n be jolly again. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I also hv neighbours who r christains n we r on amicable terms, always talking abt our dogs. They never try to preach to me when they realised I'm Buddhist.<br><br>If we don't wish to attend, just don't. No need to feel awkward or uneasy. If we want to go, then go. And if after attending one, u find that it is better than Buddhadharma, then so be it. It just shows that our understanding n faith in Buddhadharma is too weak. One either practise harder or simply give up n go another way. Too bad though...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Spnw07,<br><br>Today it is very saddening to witness the contamination with wrong doctrines into the christian faith. Many young followers equipped with wrong doctrines enthusiastically rushed out to spread the gospel.<br><br>Of course, in the wrong way and with the wrong doctrines. Therefore creating the current Christian &amp; MLM look alike symptom.<br><br>Please don't feel compelled to visit any church or believe in the Christian faith. Also do not feel compelled to give money to the church because if you do not understand the true meaning of giving, please be kindly reminded to refrain from it. Offering is not as simple as the 10% of your income or is it proportional to your blessings as some churches portray it to be. Rather question the faith and find out more about it yourself rather than to be forced down the throat. Occasionally you may need assistance, you may want refer to<br><br>http://www.sbc.edu.sg<br>The Singapore Bible College will be the best place for you to enquire about the christian faith locally. If you don't feel comfortable to be identified, just email them anonymously. Don't feel pressurized. Just take your time.<br><br>As christians, the gospel must be spreaded gently. No threats nor brain washing tactics should be utilized. The good  It is stated in the gospel that daily personal conduct are actually the best way to spread the gospel. And not via arguments. The Gospel has to be accepted willingly and not forced down the throat.<br><br>Have a nice day.</div>

He constantly asks me to go to church when I asks him questions regarding Christianity.

Ie: They are very assertive and enthusiastic in introducing the Good News to non-believers.<br><br>I have already replied him many times that I'm now a Buddhist and intend to follow on with my faith.

But I guess we just hv to be firm with our beliefs n everything will be fine ie. no hard feelings, no paiseh, no unhappiness, no fightings at all when we decline the invitations or even went to one. We will still come out as a Buddhists. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Basically I don't go to any, but will attend church weddings to offer my blessings to the married couples. And yes, in such occasions, I wld hv to sit through the sermons or preachings as well. But no harm done lah, just that sometimes precious time was wasted. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Actually, fr my father's side there r 3 pastors and almost the whole congregation of one church are my extended famiy members. It's like a mini clan association. Our "clan" has been christians since my grand-parents for 3 generations n counting<br><br>My mother's side are Taoists, free-thinkers, ming jain xing yang followers.<br><br>My mom n I hv been Buddhist for 20 yrs. We r the only 2 Buddhist in our families. But we r still on good terms with everybody, no problem at all. If they wan to know abt Buddhism, we try our best to explain to them. If they wan to "fight", we let them satisfy them own aggressions, then when they've cooled down or bored, we continue with our other topics n be jolly again. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> If they wan to preach, then we wld keep quite n listen, then say thank u n continue fr where we hv stopped n be jolly again. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I also hv neighbours who r christains n we r on amicable terms, always talking abt our dogs. They never try to preach to me when they realised I'm Buddhist.<br><br>If we don't wish to attend, just don't. No need to feel awkward or uneasy. If we want to go, then go. And if after attending one, u find that it is better than Buddhadharma, then so be it. It just shows that our understanding n faith in Buddhadharma is too weak. One either practise harder or simply give up n go another way. Too bad though...<br></div></blockquote> I'm okay with church weddings and sermons that come with it. But not the way in which I'm approached out in the streets, at my house and etc...<br><br>Glad to know you have good Christian neighbours, good for you, too bad for me I guess.</div>

Also do not feel compelled to give money to the church because if you do not understand the true meaning of giving, please be kindly reminded to refrain from it.
