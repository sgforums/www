You should be honest and tell the person that what he/she is doing is making you uncomfortable, and would instead only make you dislike Christianity or Christians themselves. Try to let them understand what they are doing with you is causing more harm than good.<br><br>I believe you are mature enough to know the difference in being direct and being  offensive/offending towards the other party. Voice out your discomfort at what they are doing.<br><br>I'm sorry about the words in red above, but just something I wanted to point out to others as well. I have seen people who cannot see between the two, and it has nothing to do with whether they are Christians or not.<br><br>I myself as a Christian have been asked by people I know to join another church. Even though I told them I was already happy in my current church, they were so enthusiastic in getting more church members that they outrightly asked me to change church and in a very serious manner. 'Conversion' in another sense I guess. I told them I appreciate the offer, but I told them outright that the suggestion offended me, and if they persist then as they say in chinese 'peng you bu bi zhuo le'.<br><br>edit; you could try a PM or two to one of the other Christians who post in EH, I feel perhaps they might be able to give you a view or two as well.</div>

And did the younger people develop this kind of mentality overnight? The fault ultimately lies on the seniors, the elders, the older ones not doing the right thing.<br><br>If it's right for their seniors to do it, it's ok for them too. And with each batch or each generation, it gets worse. And the people who are guilty of these things are sometimes your well-to-do, supposedly cultured and educated people.

If not, that's ok with me. No offence, but I have no wish to fend off questions about my current faith, even though you can assure me that it wouldn't happen. As I'm sure, many things do not go as you wish cos one may not be in a position to represent a particular church or an entire community of church members. All are independent in their own views and ways of approaching new faces in the church.<br><br>Thanks again for sharing with me about your faith. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

When you said about the Great Spirit Mother I was thinking that you may be from Yi Guan Dao (aka Tian Dao). Whether did Buddha find God or not, depends on <strong>your</strong> understanding and definition of Buddha and God. Both the the words Buddha and God are often misused and abused.<br><br>However, I think understand the nature of ourselves is far more important than whatever religion label a person choose to stick it on their foreheads.

You could try or enquire with the moderators there. But I must comment that there are certain non-Christians who tend to come in to cause trouble from time to time. Oppurtunists so to speak. Not all the non-Christians who post in EH are like that, but there are a few nicks like that.<br><div class="quote_body"><blockquote>I could have pm any Christian in EH, but decided against it cos I want the whole discussion to be interactive, to be transparent to all.
