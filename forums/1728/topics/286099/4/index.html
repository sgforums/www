I can place a bet with you they don't know how to answer you because the Bible or the Church never teach them so.  One of the thing you must remember is that: Christians are 'commanded' to 'save' this world.  By that it means everyone they know and can be persuade either subtlely or by deceit to go to church or accept the Christian God.  It is in the Bible because that is the authority they quote.<br>My grandmother who was for all her life an ancestor worshipper was taken to church by a relative on the pretext of bringing her out for 'jalan-jalan'.  And when she became bed-ridden when she fell, they brought a pastor to her home to baptise her!<br>Just like you, I too had been asked, and my answer to them: I was a Christian, and I probably know more than you, and I have very good reason to be a free-thinker. If you think and think even more and deeply, you will also one day arrive at the same conclusion as me! From that day onward, they stopped asking me and also stopped treating me as friend.

I dunno how long <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> At least on the public forum.<br><br>Excerpts taken from <a href="http://www.budsas.org/ebud/beyond/beyond02.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.budsas.org/ebud/beyond/beyond02.htm</a>, <a href="http://www.budsas.org/ebud/beyond/beyond01.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.budsas.org/ebud/beyond/beyond01.htm</a> (Beyond Belief)<br><br>[b]Miracles</strong><br><br>Christians claim that miracles are sometimes performed in God's name and that the fact that this happens proves that God exists. This is an appealing argument until it is looked at a little more closely.<br><br>While Christians are quick to claim that because of their prayers the blind could see, the deaf could hear and crooked limbs were straightened, they are very slow in producing evidence to back up their claims. In fact, some Christians are so anxious to prove that miracles have occurred at their prayer meetings that the truth often gets lost in a flood of wild claims, extravagant boasts, and sometimes even conscious lies.<br><br>It is true that things which are unusual and difficult to explain do sometimes happen during religious events - but not just for Christians. Hindus, Muslims, Taoists, etc. all claim that their God or gods sometimes perform miracles. Christianity certainly does not have a monopoly on miracles. So, if miracles performed in God's name prove the existence of the Christian God, then miracles performed in the name of numerous other gods must likewise prove that they too exist.<br><br>Christians may try to overcome this fact by claiming that, when miracles occur in other religions, they are done through the power of the Devil. Perhaps the best way to counter this claim is to quote the Bible. When Jesus healed the sick, his enemies accused him of doing this through the power of the Devil. He answered that healing the sick results in good and if the Devil went around doing good he would destroy himself (Mk 3:22-26). Therefore the same could be said for the miracles performed by Hindus, Jews or Sikhs. If these miracles result in good, how can they be the work of the Devil?[/b]</blockquote>Your so-called counter are simply copy and paste from other sources.<br><br>Lack of innovation, creativity and actual experience.<br><br>From the previous time I have known, you had not been to church, if you still have not attend any church, I will advise you to go down and take a look.<br><br>I don't mind to take time off to accompany you if you are afraid that your faith will be shaken.<br><br>Don't be like jenchen which is quite out-of-fashion.

I don't think there is such a  fix rule on marriages between christain n non-believer, but of cos usually one wld tends to follow one's spouse sooner or later. Especially, fr my observations, if the wife is a christain then most probably the hubby will convert to christainity later on. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  Maybe out of love for the wife n chrildren as well , cos usually the wife will baptise the kids too.<br><br>And many christains may believe that they can succeed in converting their non-christain spoues, so it's not uncommon to see such marriages nowadays too. I hv a relative whose hubby only becomes a christain recently after a marriage of 20 yrs.<br><br>For my case, i think my late ah gong was a wise and fair person as he was the one who stop the rest fr baptising me as a child then.

I don't want to get into any debates with people who already firmly believe in the idea of a Creator God. It will just be a fruitless debate, now matter how much I know about Buddhism or practise Buddhist teachings.<br><br>Inter-religion cohesion is more of trying to organise more activities whereby people from different religions can participate in and share ideas and knowledge about learning to be a good practitioner of universal love and inner wisdom. That is my personal opinion.<br><br>I don't want to be confrontational, especially when most Christians I have met are rather direct and at times can be insensitive in focusing on differences rather than acknowledging and practising values like mutual love and respect (common for most religions in Singapore), towards all from different religions. When you walk into the church, you are telling them you want to be convinced, then of course, sooner or later, converted.<br><br>I don't think how walking into a church, will achieve anything concrete, without creating unnecessary misunderstandings in the first place. Furthermore, one person going there or many like-minded Buddhists? We don't want to give any Christians the impression we are like trying to 'ti1 guan3' (challenge the church's beliefs).<br><br></div>

I believe the answer is no. Who fills in this gap? I believe it is God. Even from nature's point of view, why is it that birds are able to navigate across oceans to escape the winter to a warmer climate and yet be able to return to their point of origin? Why is it that after the sea turtles lay their eggs on the beach, these eggs hatch, the young turtles grows into adulthood and then they are able to navigate unaided to the same spot where their parents laid the eggs? If God took so much effort to take care of these animals, then how much more love he will expend on us human beings?<br><br>2) There are also many documented documentaries on the miracles of God, the live testimonies of people who have in one way or another being cured of incurable diseases, illness, or physical deformities. Just do a quite check online and read these testimonies. Sure, you may question then why are there still sick people around? But say in a evangilical service, if only 100 people out of 100,000 people who attended the service are cured of their illnesses, then we shoud rejoice and be happy for this 100 people who are cured, and nt be griefed that the balance were not cured.<br><br>3) In the same logic just as people demand to see the tangible being of God, can you also ask if you can see the tangible being of the Gods of other religions? (Please do not count the wooden idols which are worshipped. Those are not tangible proofs too. ;-) )<br><br>4) Lastly, I think there are quarters of christians in Singapore who are overtly zealous in trying to bring salvation to their friends. You see, there is a God's eventual timeline for a person to be saved from salvation. But when these christians push it too far, they are using their own efforts, which then now involves their own pride and ego, their pride to want to use humanly effort to bring a person to salvation;cz they believe in using their own efforts to please God, and these mindset would then revert to the system of Laws in the old testament; for in the new testament, God has invoked a new convenent, to embrace grace rather than laws.<br><br>Just take the incident when the Korean missionary group was kidnapped in Iraq. Im sure in all wisdom, the holy spirit and God told the group not to proceed, but they still did, in a bid to use human effort to win, to outshine and proof that their church is the most gung-ho in South Korea. The result of course is tragic with the loss of 2 lives.<br><br>5) Hence, i believe in this case the best reply to decline your friend's invitation is, "God's timeline is not up yet for me to embrace him.". Because Jesus is such a gentlemen, he will only come in when u knock on his door. And this being said, also be aware that God always place us at the right time and right place to be saved. So ha, you will never know in near future, or decades from now, you would embrace him.<br><br>Alrites, this is my 2 cents worth of comment. Please accept my apologies if i offended anybody.<br><br></div></blockquote> Hey, new creation, I was hoping also for more christians like you to express their views on my topic. Others are important, but hearing christians like you speak out makes me feel encouraged that not all are over-zealous to the extent of ignoring the sensitivities and choices of others.<br>I'm so glad that you have views that are balanced and respectful of others in point 4. I'm also thankful that you are willing to give an example of how to politely decline a fellow member of your faith.<br><br>I do agree with you about your views about the Korean missionaries' abduction case. Sorry, but I do feel a bit uncomfortable after not being able to understand why they were unable to consider long term and wide-ranging implications of their actions for their country and the rest of the world.<br><br>I will try to use your example and parts of advice from all here which I can understand and use , and if I'm stuck again after my cousin counter-attacks me (i lack the gift of real time response), please don't ignore me if I pm you. paiseh. haha. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
