              <p>So how do you define fun?</p>
              <p>I thought fun means something amusing. I don't think cancer is fun or amusing.</p>
              <p>But if it is joy irregardless and unconditioned by circumstances then that is due to practice and wisdom.</p>
              <p>Many people meditate and chant, including me. I can tell you that the deeper you enter into meditation, the more joyful it becomes... sometimes the joy exceeds all ordinary joy you have ever experienced in worldly life -- even sex. Though meditation may appear to some to be the most boring activity on earth. It is joy not derived from sensual stimulation but by mere clarity and absorption. The clearer you become, the more blissful it is.</p>
              <p>I can experience this in daily activities as well. Though I do not claim to be able to maintain this even if I am in pain (at least not yet but I think it is possible) but the point is, joy in practice is not dependent on amusement of senses.</p>
              </div>

              <p>Heh, you're missing the point too. But thanks for sharing the experience you had on meditation.</p>
              <p>You already said you thought I meant amusement, that's a presumption you're holding. It's your own attachment. =)</p>

              <p>Hi Zerg,</p>
              <p>if you don't mind me answering from my christian background - Yes, for all if not most christians (including catholics), the only way through salvation is by accepting Jesus as your saviour. It is stated quite explicitly in the Gospel, cannot remember the actual quote off-hand but you'll see the quote very prominently in many churches.</p>
              <p>Some roman catholics believe, however, there is a notion of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">purgatory</span> where those who did not believe in Jesus, or whose faith was not strong enough, or who have sins that must be purified, have to go through. Supposedly if one of his/her relatives/friends did prayers to Mary and the saints to intercede on behalf of the deceased, then it's possible that person can still go to heaven. This notion is not accepted by other christians (orthodox and protestant) though.</p>

              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">Hi Zerg (and also picking up the thread from Sanath),</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">"Is accepting Jesus the only way to heaven?" - No, not really</span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">What a good question. I felt that this was one of the most important questions I needed to ask myself. Like many Christians, I did not dare ask it for a long time yet this is one key issues that seem to make Christianity seem so exclusive.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">My experience and understanding of the bible is "No", I do not believe that to go to what is termed "heaven" you have to "accept" Jesus in the commonly accepted and commonly (mis)understood way. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">But if you look at Jesus through a different pair of lens, not as a person/external God like a diety, but for what he represents, then the answer is "yes". In this case, it is not the name of Jesus you accept superficially but it’s your acceptance and practise of his teachings.<span>  </span>Jesus embodies what he preaches - love, joy, peace. patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control (these qualities are called "fruits of the spirits" in the bible's book of Galatians)</span></span><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">.So he IS his teaching and his teaching IS him. You accept his teaching and practise his teaching, you already accepted him even if you know not his name or call not his name. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Even Jesus has said: <em>“</em></span><em><span style="font-family: Arial; ">Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.”</span></em><span style="font-family: Arial; "> (Matthew 7:21)</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">So what is Jesus’ teachings? </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">The Greatest Commandmant</span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">In the bible’s book of Matthew chapter 22, a lawyer asked Jesus what is the greatest commandmant.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">Jesus replied: <em>" 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.'This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments." </em></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">This story was also repeated in the bible’s Book of Luke (chapter 10) but in slightly different way. Here a lawyer asked what he can do to inherit eternal life. Jesus asked him back, "what does the scriptures say?" </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">And the lawyer recited back to Jesus: "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself." </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">Then Jesus said "You have answered right; do this, and you will live." </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">Then this lawyer wanted to test Jesus and cheekily asked him: “So who is my neighbor?" </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">In reply Jesus said: "<em>A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he fell into the hands of robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him half dead. A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side. So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him. He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, took him to an inn and took care of him. The next day he took out two silver coins and gave them to the innkeeper. 'Look after him,' he said, 'and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.' </em></span></span></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">Jesus then asked the lawyer "Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?" </span></span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">The lawyer replied, "The one who had mercy on him." </span></span></em></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><em><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Jesus told him, "Go and do likewise."</span></em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">Now Zerg, let me explain to you why these passage is so important and so central to your question. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">First we look at the story of the compassionate Samaritan. </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">This story is remarkable in its depth by the choice of characters Jesus used. A Priest is a respected religious leader in Jewish society. A Levite also holds a high position in Jewish society as they are assigned to conduct religious rites for the Jewish people. However, Samaritans are of mixed marriages between Jews and non-Jews. The Jews do not consider them pure Jews and treat them as outcasts. They are despised by the Jews as only Jews are considered God’s “chosen people”. However, the Samaritan is the only one who stopped to help the injured man. Jesus considers him as the only one of the three having the <strong>TRUE spirit of Christianity</strong>. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">So to draw a parallel, I see it that in modern day, if you like you can say that Christians are like the Jews, the so-called “chosen” people of God. And non-Christians or half-Christians (like me haha) are like the Samaritans. If you give love to your neighbour as you do yourself, even if you are a Samaritan or a non-Christian, you too have exercised the true spirit of Christ and as such – is <strong>ACCEPTABLE</strong> to Jesus.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">Now, let us go back to what Jesus’ said is the most important commandment. He said that the most important thing is to love God. And the second thing, which “like it”, that is, just as important to the first law, is to love your neighbour just as much as you love yourself. And then Jesus went on to say - all the other commandments of the prophets rest upon these 2 laws. These 2 laws form the foundation of every other law.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">So this means that to have eternal life, you must accept and practise these 2 foundational laws. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">In the Book of John, Jesus was quoted as saying:</span><span style="font-family: Arial; "> <em>"I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me</em>. (John 14:6). Apostle John also said:”<em>For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life</em>.“ (John 3:16). </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; ">However, base on my explanation in the preceding paragraphs you can tell that one cannot take a literal and simplistic reading of just calling Jesus “name” and going through him in this way, or even converting and becoming a Christian and going to church. You go through him by practising his teachings. Would you accept and practise a teaching if you yourself do not believe in it? So, if you know not Jesus’ but practise love and kindness, so too you would have accepted and believed in him indirectly because love is what he represents. We believe in our teachers, as such we practise their teachings. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">And finally, what is God? I know Buddhists do not believe in a creator, personal god like the Christians too. But this understanding of God as a person, a creator, someone external to you (aka a theistic view) is not a view held by all Christians. Liberal Christians are moving away from the traditional belief in a theistic god. They believe that God is a divinity that is inside you (maybe what you call the buddhi nature? Yogis call this purusha or true nature) expressed when you practise love, compassion, gratitude, kindess. self-control. It is the intuition in you to call you to expand yourself, to love and to be inclusive of others, not contract yourself when you hate, fear and practise exclusions. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">In Luke 17:20-21, when asked <span style="color: #888888;">when</span> the kingdom of God will come, Jesus’ answer was, “<em>The Kingdom of God does not come in such a way as to be seen. No one will say, ‘Look, here it is!’ or, ‘There it is!’ because <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the Kingdom of God is </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">within you</span>.”</em></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="color: black;">So, it seems to me that Jesus says that:</span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="color: black;">1)heaven (the kingdom of God) is not a place in the sky, but a state of being inside you</span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="color: black;">2)God, who resides in this kingdlom, is thus in you, it's the divine nature in you</span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="color: black;">3) Jesus is someone who reflected all the divine nature and as such when you see him you see goodness and love. You see divinity, you see eternity, you see God</span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="color: black;">4) Even if you know not Jesus' name but have sincerely exercise love, joy, patience, kindness, gooness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control  - my understanding of the bible is that one is not rejected but have touched something DIVINE. </span></span></span></p>

              <p>Nice explanation, so can i conclude from your understanding, in Christian, to go heaven there is no a must to be a Christian, non-Christian can go heaven by exercising kindness, love, joy etc (whatever related to good deed) ?</p>
              <p>The reason i ask this because i ask few of my Christian friends, they go Church a lot, but their understanding is Only by become Christian and Accepting Jesus then you can go to heaven. I even find in some forum, the forumer dare to said, beside Christian God, all other religion is devil, which only make me shake head when i reading the topic.</p>
              <p>or maybe like you said you 1/2 Christian</p>
              <p>Your explanation about kingdom of God have some similliarity with my mind thinking that peace, joy, happiness is come from within our self (If i get your point right) <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>Hi Zerg,</p>
              <p>Yes, that is what I mean. But certainly, even that is not simple path to take. How often we have been angry, said unkind things, been rude to our parents, been selfish? Often right? Jesus' way is also not a simple way.</p>
              <p>I also shake may head when some Christians say other religions are from the devil and therefore evil. (shake-shake, roll my eyes <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">)</p>
              <p>There are so many holy and spiritual Buddhists, Muslims, Hindus, and also evil Christians (Hitler also Christian - during WWII he ordered mass execution of 6 million Jews because he believed they denied Jesus and deserved it. Maybe he forgot Jesus also Jew).</p>
              <p>Then Christians will tell you no these are not REAL Christians. What is real Christian anyway? Maybe the devils' people from other religion are not REAL Buddhists, not REAL Hindus - so maybe they are not REAL evil? No need to say more lah. Use common sense can already.</p>
              <p>I say maybe I am 1/2 Christian because average Christian will ask "What kind of Christian are you, man?" because my thinking is not very average.  Yet, I still consider myself Christian because I am not Buddhist, not Hindu mah. My tradition is Christian mah. I believe in Jesus' teaching mah. Inside I think I am Christian, outside people see not like Christian. So maybe I just 1/2 Christian - not a REAL Christian.  LOL.</p>
              <p>No lah, these are labels. If you ask me, am I good Christian? I will tell you "no". Because although I am not average Christian, I am just average human.</p>

              <p>Yah agree... Label only. I once had a PM conversation in another forum with a Christian from the US. Like you, he is very open minded, tolerant and liberal. It is interesting to note that he prefers to call himself a "follower of Christ". To him, a "Christian" conjures up images of ultra-fundamental and offensively evangelical Christians in his country.</p>

              <p>Well written! Just to add: The path of Christianity and the path of Buddhism is different, the emphasis for such paths is on submission and surrender to the divine. It is to allow divine happening, for Christians they just say receive grace. "Not my will but thy will be done." thus achieving the purpose of 'letting go' of the 'self'. Theirs is by faith while Buddhism is by wisdom. The path is different. That is why for them the emphasis is in loving God and submitting to God. But in Buddhism, we teach that we can gain insight into the nature of reality through practicing insight-meditation.</p>
              <p>In fact the real goal is to achieve union with Christ.  It is to dissolve the self so that there can be a new birth, a birth in spirit (being born again), in Christ. When Jesus said <span> <strong>Very truly, I

              <p>I posted some good resources on this. See <a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/271224">http://sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/271224</a> -- can also read the article <strong>'Living the Christ Life'</strong> which is written by a Christian in the EH forum, it explains this very well.</p>
              <p>As Paul said from his experience:
                                                                                                                                  <span style="font-style: italic;">I no longer live, but Christ
                                                                                                                                  lives in me! (Gal. 2.20)</span></p>
              <p>When one lives a 'Christ Life', no longer as the 'small self' but its Christ that lives in him, naturally good works, and all the good qualities of Christ becomes manifest. But it is not through good works (done through the 'ego' or the old sinful self) that one attains salvation, even 'ungodly men' can also perform good works... the difference is that the good works manifest through the new birth in Spirit -- <strong>"the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control."</strong> Galatians 5:22, 23</p>
              <p>All efforts by the 'self' to find its way to salvation is doomed, because the self is sinful by nature (and the word sin originally means to miss the mark, miss the target) -- the self has to dissolve totally, and let Christ.<br> <br> This, is the path of monotheistic religions and contemplative

              <p>But also I should note that there is <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/07/bernadette-roberts-interview.html">a path beyond transforming union or mystical marriage</a>, which as Christian contemplative Bernadette Roberts says is not  found in the Christian contemplative literature for various reasons, where transforming union is described as the final state which is achievable. But union is not the final stage, though there is some insight and transcendental experience of the divine.</p>
              <p>More specifically, insight into No-Self (not as a stage of dissolving ego but as the nature of reality as no separate agent apart from manifestation) and Emptiness is still not present. That requires further unfolding of insights. Even Bernadette Roberts has not fully understood the depths and hasn't understood Emptiness/Dependent-Origination... but she is closer, and that is why after years of searching for similar accounts of her experience, she found her experience described by Buddha. An article that is a little related to Bernadette Robert's experiences is Thusness's Six Stages of Experience: <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html</a>. Bernadette Roberts has gone through almost all the stages (I have one of her book and she described her journey), but I still don't think the insight into 'Stage 6' is there, and so still isn't the full understanding of Anatta or Shunyata in Buddhism.</p>

              <p>Hi Zerg,</p>
              <p>Yes, that is what I mean. But certainly, even that is not simple path to take. How often we have been angry, said unkind things, been rude to our parents, been selfish? Often right? Jesus' way is also not a simple way.</p>
              <p>I also shake may head when some Christians say other religions are from the devil and therefore evil. (shake-shake, roll my eyes <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">)</p>
              <p>There are so many holy and spiritual Buddhists, Muslims, Hindus, and also evil Christians (Hitler also Christian - during WWII he ordered mass execution of 6 million Jews because he believed they denied Jesus and deserved it. Maybe he forgot Jesus also Jew).</p>
              <p>Then Christians will tell you no these are not REAL Christians. What is real Christian anyway? Maybe the devils' people from other religion are not REAL Buddhists, not REAL Hindus - so maybe they are not REAL evil? No need to say more lah. Use common sense can already.</p>
              <p>I say maybe I am 1/2 Christian because average Christian will ask "What kind of Christian are you, man?" because my thinking is not very average.  Yet, I still consider myself Christian because I am not Buddhist, not Hindu mah. My tradition is Christian mah. I believe in Jesus' teaching mah. Inside I think I am Christian, outside people see not like Christian. So maybe I just 1/2 Christian - not a REAL Christian.  LOL.</p>
              <p>No lah, these are labels. If you ask me, am I good Christian? I will tell you "no". Because although I am not average Christian, I am just average human.</p>

              <p>Unfortunately, hasn't that quote been taken out of context in this sense?</p>

              <p>'cos it's a fact that he is not teaching proper Buddhism.</p>
              <p>The concept of almighty, all-knowing, all-loving, creator God does not exist in rationale and logical buddhistic thinking.</p>
              <p>If your mck can tell people muslims and christians heavens are part of Amitabha's pureland, there is much room for people to exercise their discretion whether or not to believe.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Slander only applies when people deliberately twisted his words. The thing about mck is that, all of those stuff can be found in his own vcd. If you're going to say that we have to finish watching the whole series or what have you, please feedback to mck, to upgrade his presentation skills. I mean if the 'mainstream' buddhists are to slander him (according to you), then I believe mck has serious presentation problem that he may need to review.</p>
