One of the thing you must remember is that: Christians are 'commanded' to 'save' this world.  By that it means everyone they know and can be persuade either subtlely or by deceit to go to church or accept the Christian God.  It is in the Bible because that is the authority they quote.<br>My grandmother who was for all her life an ancestor worshipper was taken to church by a relative on the pretext of bringing her out for 'jalan-jalan'.  And when she became bed-ridden when she fell, they brought a pastor to her home to baptise her!<br>Just like you, I too had been asked, and my answer to them: I was a Christian, and I probably know more than you, and I have very good reason to be a free-thinker. If you think and think even more and deeply, you will also one day arrive at the same conclusion as me! From that day onward, they stopped asking me and also stopped treating me as friend.

He wants you to believe, he has to come up with the proof and evidence.<br><br>2. Tell him that the proof and evidence you require must be real proof and evidence and you cannot accept what "other people say" as proof and evidence.<br><br>3. Tell him that you cannot accept what the Bible say because you do not believe in the Bible.<br><br>4. Tell him the proof you require is of a very high standard and you need to see God in action (not the David Copperfield kind).<br><br>5. Tell him you don't need to see God directly but he must show you proof and evidence of indisputable acts of God (not the Thaipusam kind, indirect and can be open to other interpretations).<br><br>6. Tell him you need independent proof and evidence and not subjective proof and evidence and that you don't trust your own feelings and imaginations.<br><br>Let him tell you anything he wants and at the end of it tell him, "Sorry, but I require proof and evidence of a high standard before I believe."<br><br>If he tells you "go and see" for yourself. remind him of point 6.<br><br>Every time he talks to you again, just tell him "I want to believe but have you come up with the proof and evidence I require?"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Spwn07,<br><br>I think it is no harm for you to attend church with your cousin for a few times. Firstly, you can treat it as an educational tour for you to understand why Christianity seems to be a favourite choice among young working adults.<br><br>Secondly, it can be a test of your own belief and your understanding of it. Attending sermons and make the comparisons, looking out for similiarities and differences, personally I find that it aids your own spiritual growth.<br><br>Thirdly, if after your visits, you really find that Christianity is not for you; or the church is not for you, then you can tell your cousin that you had been there and experienced and know that it is <strong>really</strong> not your cup of tea.<br><br>Fourthly, as mentioned by justdoit77, you can negotiate a trade off with your cousin. But as told by a friend of mine before, usually after you have attended church, when it's their time to go to a dhamma talk, they will have 'reasons' not to show up in the last minute. Ain't sure how true is it. Probably if you're using this method, you can make your cousin to attend dhamma talk first before you attend church with him.<br><br>Finally, or heed what sleepwalkering had said, "Thank you for the invitation, i am comfortable with mine."<br><br>Anyway, you need not be too concerned or bothered with whether or not to explain to people to what you believe. At the end of the day, it is more important that you <span style="font-style: italic;">really</span> do know what you believe in. Have that confidence in yourself and ignore the ridicules. We can't please the whole world, at least, please ourselves.<br><br>There are various inspiring and touching testimonials that christians will give but nonetheless they are revolved around in believing that God has touched their lives. If that, in respect to the mental and spiritual sense, do give them comfort, I think it is really nothing wrong with it. But of course that doesn't mean that we allow them to push their opinion on us. And of course as buddhist don't believe in the existence of such a creator God, our confidence in the Dhamma shouldn't be shaken in any way. We understand that every results are due to cause and condition. So having a God pop out of nowhere doesn't quite tally with the principle of Dhamma.<br><br>On this onus, it will be our understanding and faith in the Dhamma that will pull us through. I also have quite a handful of friends who become christians and always tried to invite me to their churches.<br><br>I used to go churches on a regular and frequent basis few years back, on my own, not invited. It is quite a fruitful experience for me and I observed and learned that why people go to churches.<br><br>But anyhow, end of the day, don't be bothered by these little things in life. In life, there will be more important things to be worried and concerned about.<br><br>May you have fun in your spiritual quest =)</div>
