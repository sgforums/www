                  Psychology of Awakening</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span class="subtitle1" style="line-height: 1.231;"><span style='font-size: 8.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>Tricycle - </span></span><span class="author8" style="line-height: 1.231;"><strong><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">John Welwood</span></strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 3.25pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; "><span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231; text-align: left;">Conventional psychotherapists often look askance at spiritual
                  practice, just as many spiritual teachers disapprove of psychotherapy. At the
                  extremes, each camp tends to see the other as avoiding and denying the real
                  issues.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">When I first encountered Zen in the 1960s, I found myself
                  particularly drawn to the mysterious satori—that moment of seeing into one’s
                  own true nature, when all the old blinders were said to fall away. In such a
                  moment, I imagined, one became an entirely new person, never to be the same
                  again. I found the prospect of this kind of ultimate realization compelling
                  enough to turn my life in that direction.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">Yet along the way I also discovered something I was not
                  prepared for: that spiritual realization is relatively easy compared with the
                  much greater difficulty of actualizing it, integrating it fully into the fabric
                  of one’s daily life. </span><em style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">Realization</em><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;"> is the movement from personality to
                  being, the direct recognition of one’s ultimate nature, leading toward liberation
                  from the conditioned self, while </span><em style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">actualization</em><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;"> refers to how we
                  integrate that realization in all the situations of our life. When people have
                  major spiritual openings, often during periods of intensive practice or
                  retreat, they may imagine that everything has changed and that they will never
                  be the same again. Indeed, spiritual work can open people up profoundly and
                  help them live free of the compulsions of their conditioning for long stretches
                  of time. But at some point after the retreat ends, when they encounter
                  circumstances that trigger their emotional reactivity or their habitual
                  tensions and defenses, they may find that their spiritual practice has hardly
                  penetrated their conditioned personality, which remains mostly intact,
                  generating the same tendencies it always has.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">Of course, realization has many levels, from temporary
                  experiences to more stable attainment. Yet even among advanced spiritual
                  practitioners, certain islands—unexamined complexes of personal and cultural
                  conditioning, blind spots, or areas of self-deception—may often remain intact
                  within the pure stream of their realization. Some would say that these shadow
                  elements are signs of deficiency in one’s spiritual practice or realization,
                  and this is undoubtedly true. Yet since they are so common, they also point to
                  the general difficulty of integrating spiritual awakenings into the entire
                  fabric of our human embodiment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">In the traditional cultures of Asia, it was a viable option
                  for a yogi to pursue spiritual development apart from worldly involvement, or
                  to live purely as the impersonal universal, without having much of a personal
                  life or transforming the structures of that life. These older cultures provided
                  a religious context that honored and supported spiritual retreat and placed little
                  or no emphasis on individual concerns. In Asia, yogis and </span><em style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">sadhus</em><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;"> who had
                  little personal contact with people could still be venerated by the community
                  at large.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">Many Westerners have tried to take up this model, pursuing
                  impersonal realization while neglecting their personal life, but have found in
                  the end that this was like wearing a suit of clothes that didn’t quite fit.
                  Taking on the challenges of a fully engaged personal life—finding right
                  livelihood in a complex materialistic world, being involved in a committed
                  intimate relationship, dealing with the social and political concerns facing us
                  at every turn—inevitably brings up unresolved psychological issues. For this
                  reason, Western seekers may also need the help of psychological methods to help
                  them more fully integrate spiritual practice and realization into their lives.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">For most of my career I have explored what the Eastern
                  contemplative traditions have to offer Western psychology. Yet more recently I
                  have also become interested in a different question: How might Western
                  psychological work serve a sacred purpose, by helping us to integrate our
                  spiritual insights into our everyday lives? In its ability to shine light into
                  the hidden nooks and crannies of our conditioning, psychological inquiry can
                  serve as a powerful ally to spiritual practice. It can help break up the hard,
                  rocky soil of our personality patterns so that this soil becomes permeable,
                  allowing the seeds of spiritual realization to take root and blossom there more
                  fully. Of course, this kind of psychological work would require a much larger
                  understanding and aim than conventional psychotherapy, whose focus is on
                  pathology and cure rather than transformation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">Psychological and spiritual work address different levels of
                  human existence. If the domain of spiritual work is emptiness—unconditioned,
                  universal, absolute truth—the domain of psychological work is form—our
                  individual, conditioned ways of experiencing ourselves and the world—or
                  relative truth. Spiritual practice, especially mysticism, points toward a
                  timeless trans-human reality, while psychological work addresses the evolving
                  human realm, with all its issues of personal meaning and interpersonal
                  relationship.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">My initial interest in psychotherapy developed in the 1960s,
                  at the same time as my interest in the Eastern spiritual traditions. At first I
                  imagined that psychotherapy could be the Western version of a path of
                  liberation. But I quickly found Western psychology too narrow and limited in
                  its view of human nature. As I became more involved in Buddhism, I went through
                  a period of aversion to Western psychology. Now that I had “found the way,” I
                  became arrogant regarding other paths, as new converts often do. I was also
                  wary of becoming trapped in endlessly processing emotional issues. But in my
                  newfound spiritual fervor, I was falling into the opposite trap—of refusing to
                  face the personal "stuff" at all. In truth, I was much more
                  comfortable with the impersonal, timeless reality I discovered through Buddhism
                  than with my personal life. Compared with the peace and clarity of sitting
                  still and following the breath while resting in the open space of awareness, my
                  personal feelings seemed messy and entangling.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">Yet in studying Tantric Buddhism, with its respect for
                  relative truth, I began to appreciate aspects of Western psychology in a new
                  light. Once I accepted that psychology could not describe my ultimate nature,
                  and I no longer required it to provide answers about the nature of human
                  existence, I realized that it had an important place in the scheme of things. I
                  also found that my own personal psychological work helped me approach spiritual
                  practice less encumbered by unconscious agendas.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">It can be difficult to understand or appreciate why we might
                  need to resort to psychological work when many Asian spiritual practitioners
                  have found liberation solely through the profound teachings and practices of
                  Buddhism for thousands of years. But it helps to recognize that the highest,
                  nondual Buddhist teachings, which show that who you really are is absolute
                  reality, presume a rich underpinning of community, religious customs, and
                  shared moral values that the West mostly lacks. Modern Western culture is
                  marked by social isolation, personal alienation, lack of community,
                  disconnection from nature, and the loss of the sacred at the center of our
                  lives. And the Western self is riddled with inner divisions—between self and
                  other, individual and society, mind and body, spirit and nature, or the guilty
                  ego and the harsh, punishing superego—that were mostly unknown in the ancient
                  cultures in which the meditative traditions first arose.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">Many Western children also grow up lacking close, sustained
                  early bonding with their parents, in contrast to the practice in traditional
                  cultures, where parents often hold young children continually and even let them
                  share their bed. Developmental psychologists argue that children with deficient
                  parenting tend to hold onto the internalized traces of their parents more
                  rigidly and develop parental fixations that haunt them in later life.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">Thus Western children often grow up without the support of
                  what the psychologist D. W. Winnicott called a good “holding
                  environment"—a context of love and belonging that contributes to a basic
                  sense of confidence and to overall healthy psychological development. Children
                  who grow up in fragmented families, glued to television sets transmitting
                  images of a spiritually lost, narcissistic world, lack a meaningful context in
                  which to situate their lives. As a result, many Westerners suffer from what the
                  psychologist Harry Guntrip considered to be the emotional plague of modern
                  civilization: ego weakness, the lack of a grounded sense of oneself and one’s
                  place in the world that shows up as self-hatred, insecurity, and self-doubt.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">Because their ego structure serves as a defense against
                  inner fragmentation, many Western seekers find that they are not willing or
                  able to let go of their ego defenses, despite all their spiritual practice and
                  realization. On a deep, subconscious level, it is too threatening to let go of
                  the little security that their shaky ego structures provide. This is why it can
                  be helpful for Westerners to work on dismantling the defensive personality
                  structure in a more gradual and deliberate way, through psychological inquiry—examining
                  and dissolving false self-images, distorted projections, and habitual emotional
                  reactions—and developing a fuller connection with themselves in the process. In
                  this way, psychological work can serve another important function for
                  Westerners: helping them to individuate by clearing up the emotional conflicts
                  that prevent them from finding an inner core of authenticity.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">If the great gift of the East is its focus on absolute true
                  nature—impersonal and shared by all alike—the gift of the West is the impetus
                  it provides to develop an individuated expression of true nature—which we can
                  also call </span><em style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">soul</em><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">, or </span><em style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">personal presence</em><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">. For traditional Asians,
                  soul (defined as the rich, colorful qualities of our humanness) was thoroughly
                  woven into the warp and woof of their culture. But in a materialistic culture
                  that has lost its soul, it becomes more important for people to individuate—to
                  cultivate individual soul qualities and find an authentic inner source of
                  personal meaning and purpose not found in the society at large.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">Coming out of traditional Asian societies, many Eastern
                  spiritual teachers have a hard time recognizing the developmental challenges
                  facing their Western students and may not understand their pervasive
                  self-hatred, shame, and guilt, as well as their alienation and lack of
                  confidence. These teachers may also fail to detect their students’ tendency to
                  engage in "spiritual bypassing"—a term I coined to describe the use
                  of spiritual ideas and practices to shore up a shaky sense of self, or to
                  belittle basic needs, feelings, and developmental tasks in the name of
                  enlightenment. And so they often teach self-transcendence to students who first
                  of all need to find some ground to stand on.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">When people use spiritual practice to try to compensate for
                  feelings of alienation and low self-esteem, they corrupt the true nature of
                  spiritual practice. Instead of loosening the manipulative ego that tries to
                  control its experience, they strengthen it, and their spiritual practice
                  remains unintegrated with the rest of their life.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">Using spirituality to make up for failures of
                  individuation—psychologically separating from parents, cultivating
                  self-respect, or trusting one’s own intelligence as a source of guidance—also
                  leads to many of the so-called "perils of the path": spiritual
                  materialism (using spirituality to prop up a shaky ego), self-inflation,
                  "us vs. them" mentality, groupthink, blind faith in charismatic
                  teachers, and loss of discrimination. Spiritual communities can become a kind
                  of surrogate family, where the teacher is regarded as the good parent while the
                  students are striving to be good boys or good girls—trying to please the
                  teacher-as-parent or driving themselves to climb the ladder of spiritual
                  success. In this way, spiritual practice becomes co-opted by unconscious
                  identities and used to reinforce unconscious defenses.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">For example, people resorting to isolation and withdrawal
                  because the interpersonal realm feels threatening often use teachings about
                  detachment and renunciation to rationalize their aloofness, impersonality, and
                  disengagement when what they really need is to become more fully embodied, more
                  engaged with themselves, with others, and with life. People with a dependent
                  personality structure, who try to gain approval and security by pleasing
                  others, often perform unstinting service for the teacher or community in order
                  to feel worthwhile. They confuse a co-dependent kind of self-negation with true
                  selflessness. And spiritual involvement is particularly tricky for people who
                  hide behind a narcissistic defense, because they use spirituality to make
                  themselves feel special or important while imagining they are working on
                  liberation from self.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">Spiritual bypassing often adopts a rationale using absolute
                  truth to deny or disparage relative truth. Absolute truth is what is eternally
                  true, now and forever, beyond any particular viewpoint or time frame. When we
                  tap into absolute truth, we can recognize the divine beauty or larger
                  perfection operating in the whole of reality. From this larger perspective, the
                  murders on tonight’s news, for instance, do not diminish this divine
                  perfection, for the absolute encompasses the whole panorama of life and death,
                  in which suns, galaxies, and planets are continually being born and dying.
                  However, from a relative point of view—if you are the wife of a man murdered
                  tonight—you will probably not be moved by the truth of ultimate perfection.
                  Instead you will be feeling human grief.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">There are two ways of confusing absolute and relative truth.
                  If you use the murder or your grief to deny or insult the higher law of the
                  universe, you would be committing the relativist error. You would be trying to
                  apply what is true on the horizontal plane of becoming to the vertical
                  dimension of pure being. The spiritual bypasser makes the reverse category
                  error, the absolutist error: He draws on absolute truth to disparage relative
                  truth. His logic might lead to a conclusion like this: Since everything is
                  ultimately perfect in the larger cosmic play, grieving the loss of someone you
                  love is a sign of spiritual weakness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; ">Since it is the nature of human beings to live on both the absolute and
                  relative levels, we can never reduce reality to a single dimension. We are not
                  just this relative body-mind organism; we are also absolute being/awareness/presence,
                  which is much larger than our bodily form or personal history. But we are also
                  not just this larger, formless absolute; we are also incarnate as particular
                  individuals. If we identify only with form, our life will remain confined to
                  known, familiar structures. But if we try to live only as pure emptiness, or
                  absolute being, we may not engage with our humanity. In absolute terms, the
                  personal self is not ultimately real; at the relative level, it must be
                  respected.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">A client of mine who was desperate about her marriage had
                  gone to a spiritual teacher for advice. He advised her not to be so angry with
                  her husband but to be a compassionate friend instead. This was certainly sound
                  spiritual advice. Compassion is a higher truth than anger; when we rest in the
                  absolute nature of mind, pure open awareness, we discover compassion as the
                  very core of our nature. From that perspective, feeling angry about being hurt
                  only separates us from our true nature.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">Yet the teacher who gave this woman this advice did not
                  consider her relative situation—that she was someone who had swallowed her
                  anger all her life. Her father had been abusive and would slap her and send her
                  to her room whenever she showed any anger about the way he treated her. She
                  learned to suppress her rage and always tried to please others by being “a good
                  girl" instead. So when the teacher advised her to feel compassion rather
                  than anger, she felt relieved because this fit right in with her defenses.
                  Since anger was threatening to her, she used the teaching on compassion for
                  spiritual bypassing—for refusing to deal with her anger or the message it
                  contained.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">As her therapist, I had to take account of her relative
                  situation and help her relate to her anger more fully. As a spiritual
                  practitioner, I was also mindful that anger is ultimately empty, a wave arising
                  in the ocean of consciousness, without any solidity or inherent meaning. Yet
                  while that understanding may be true in the absolute sense, and generally
                  valuable for helping dissolve attachment to anger, it was not useful for this
                  woman at this time. Instead, she needed to learn to pay more attention to her
                  anger in order to move beyond a habitual pattern of self-suppression, to
                  connect with her inner strength and power, and to relate to her husband in a
                  more active, assertive way.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; ">How then do we arrive at genuine compassion? Spiritual bypassing involves
                  imposing on oneself higher truths that lie far beyond one’s immediate
                  existential condition. My client’s attempts at compassion were not entirely
                  genuine because they were based on denying her own anger. Spiritual teachers
                  often exhort us to be loving and compassionate, or to give up selfishness and
                  aggression, but how can we do this if our habitual tendencies arise out of a
                  whole system of psychological dynamics that we have never clearly seen or
                  faced, much less worked with? People often have to acknowledge and come to
                  terms with their anger before they can arrive at genuine forgiveness or
                  compassion. That is relative truth.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">Psychological inquiry starts here, with relative truth, with
                  whatever we are experiencing right now. It involves opening to that experience
                  and exploring its meaning, letting it unfold without judgment. As a therapist,
                  I find that allowing whatever arises to be there as it is and gently inquiring
                  into it leads naturally in the direction of deeper truth. This is what I call
                  psychological work in the service of spiritual development.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">Many people who seek out my services have done spiritual
                  practice for many years. I have often been struck by the huge gap between the
                  sophistication of their spiritual practice and the level of their personal
                  development. Some of them have spent years doing what were once considered the
                  most advanced, esoteric practices, reserved only for the select few in
                  traditional Asia, without developing the most rudimentary forms of self-love or
                  interpersonal sensitivity. One woman who had undergone the rigors of a
                  Tibetan-style three-year retreat had little ability to love herself. The
                  rigorous training she had been through only seemed to reinforce an inner
                  discontent that drove her to pursue high spiritual ideals without showing any
                  kindness toward herself or her own limitations.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">In addition to spiritual bypassing, another major problem
                  for Western seekers is their susceptibility to the "spiritual
                  superego," a harsh inner voice that acts as relentless critic and judge
                  telling them that nothing they do is ever quite good enough: "You should
                  meditate more and practice harder. You’re too self-centered. You don’t have
                  enough devotion." This critical voice keeps track of every failure to
                  practice or live up to the teachings, so that practice becomes more oriented
                  toward propitiating a judgmental part of themselves than opening to life
                  unconditionally. They may subtly regard the saints and enlightened ones as
                  father figures who are keeping a critical eye on all the ways they are failing
                  to live up to their commitments. So they strive to be "Dharmically
                  correct," attempting to be more detached, compassionate, or devoted than
                  they really are, while secretly hating themselves for failing to do so, thus
                  rendering their spirituality cold and solemn. Their self-hatred was not created
                  by the spiritual teaching; it already existed. But by pursuing spirituality in
                  a way that widens the gap between how they are and how they think they should
                  be, they wind up turning exquisite spiritual teachings on compassion and
                  awakening into fuel for self-hatred and inner bondage.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; ">This raises the question of how much we can benefit from a spiritual teaching
                  as a set of ideals, no matter how noble those ideals are. Often the striving
                  after a spiritual ideal only serves to reinforce the critical superego—that
                  inner voice that tells us we are never good enough, never honest enough, never
                  loving enough. In a culture permeated by guilt and ambition, where people are
                  desperately trying to rise above their shaky earthly foundation, the spiritual
                  superego exerts a pervasive unconscious influence that calls for special
                  attention and work. This requires an understanding of psychological dynamics
                  that traditional spiritual teachings and teachers often lack.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">Paul, a therapy client of mine, had been a dedicated
                  Buddhist practitioner for more than two decades. A husband, father, and
                  successful businessman, he had recently been promoted to a position that
                  involved public speaking. After a few experiences in front of large audiences,
                  he started feeling overwhelmed by anxiety, worry, tension, and sleeplessness.
                  At first, he tried to deal with his distress by meditating more. While this
                  would help him regain some equilibrium, the same symptoms would recur when he
                  next faced an audience. After a few months of this, he gave me a call.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">From the Buddhist teachings, Paul knew the importance of not
                  being attached to praise and blame, two of the eight worldly concerns, along
                  with loss and gain, pleasure and pain, success and failure, that keep us
                  chained to the wheel of suffering. Yet it was not until his fear of public
                  speaking brought up intense anxiety about praise and blame that he realized
                  just how concerned he was about how people saw him.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">As our work progressed, he realized that he used detachment
                  as a defense, to deny an underlying fear about how other people saw him. He had
                  developed this defense to cope with not feeling seen by his parents. His mother
                  had lived in a state of permanent tension and anxiety. Regarding him as her
                  potential savior rather than a separate being with feelings apart from her, she
                  led him to feel responsible for her happiness. To shield himself from her
                  intrusiveness, Paul had adopted a defensive stance of not feeling his need for
                  her, and by extension, for other people. Having tried all his life not to care
                  about how people regarded him, he was particularly attracted to the Buddhist teachings
                  of no-self when he first encountered them. After all, in the light of absolute
                  truth there is nobody to be seen, nobody to be praised, nobody to be blamed,
                  and Paul found great comfort in this. Yet on the relative level, Paul carried
                  within him a frustrated need to be seen and loved. In denying this need through
                  “spiritual work,” Paul was practicing defensiveness, not true nonattachment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">Paul was doubly trapped. As long as he could not acknowledge
                  the part of him that felt, "Yes, I want to be seen and appreciated,"
                  his frustrated need for love kept him tied in knots, secretly on the lookout
                  for others’ praise and confirmation. And his inability to say, "No, I do
                  not exist to make you happy," kept him susceptible to potential blame
                  whenever he failed to please others.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><em style="line-height: 1.231;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; ">Yes</span></em><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> and <em>no</em> are expressions of desire and aggression—two
                  life energies that philosophers, saints, and psychologists, from Plato and
                  Buddha to Freud, have considered particularly problematic. Unfortunately, many
                  spiritual teachers simply criticize passion and aggression instead of teaching
                  people to unlock the potential intelligence hidden within them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">The intelligent impulse contained in the yes of desire is
                  the longing to expand, to connect more fully with life. The intelligence contained
                  in no is the capacity to discriminate, differentiate, and protect oneself and
                  others from harmful forces. The energy of the genuine, powerful no can be a
                  doorway to strength and power, allowing us to separate from aspects of our
                  conditioning we need to outgrow. Our capacity to express the basic power of yes
                  and no often becomes damaged in childhood. And this incapacity becomes
                  installed in our psychological makeup as a tendency to oscillate between
                  compliance and defiance, as Paul exemplified in his attitude toward others,
                  secretly feeling compelled to please them, yet secretly hating them for this at
                  the same time.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">As long as Paul failed to address his unconscious dynamic of
                  compliance and defiance, his spiritual practice could not help him stabilize
                  genuine equanimity, free from anxiety about praise and blame. Although he could
                  often experience equanimity during periods of solitary spiritual practice,
                  these realizations remained compartmentalized and failed to carry over into his
                  interpersonal relationships.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">Before Paul could find and express his genuine yes—to
                  himself, to others, to life—he had to say no to the internalized mother whose
                  influence remained alive within him: "No, I don’t exist to make you happy,
                  to be your savior, to give your life meaning." But it was not easy for him
                  to acknowledge his anger toward his mother for making him the object of her
                  narcissistic needs. Quoting spiritual doctrine, Paul believed it was wrong to
                  hate. Yet in never letting himself feel the hatred he held in his body, he
                  wound up expressing it in covert, self-sabotaging ways. I did not try to push
                  past his inner taboo against this feeling but only invited him to acknowledge
                  his hatred when it was apparent in his speech or demeanor. When Paul could
                  finally let himself feel his hatred directly, instead of judging or denying it,
                  he came alive in a whole new way. He sat up straight and broke into laughter,
                  the laughter of an awakening vitality and power.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">A second defining moment came when Paul finally acknowledged
                  his need to be loved for who he was, which triggered a surge of energy that
                  filled his whole body. Yet this was also scary, for it felt as though he were
                  becoming inflated. And for Paul, with his refined Buddhist sensibilities,
                  self-inflation was the greatest sin of all—a symptom of a bloated ego, the way
                  of the narcissist who is full of himself.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">Seeing his resistance, I encouraged him to explore, if only
                  for a few moments, what it would be like to let himself become inflated, to
                  feel full of himself, and to stay present with that experience. As he let
                  himself fill up, he experienced himself as large, rich, and radiant. He felt
                  like a sun king, receiving energy from the gods above and below, radiating
                  light in all directions. He realized that he had always wanted to feel this
                  way, but had never allowed himself to expand like this before! Yet now he was
                  letting himself be infused by the fullness that had been missing in his
                  life—the fullness of his own being. To his surprise, he found it a tremendous
                  relief and release to allow this expansion at last.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">As Paul got over his surprise, he laughed and said:
                  "Who would have thought that letting myself become inflated could be so
                  liberating?" Of course, he wasn’t acting out a state of ego inflation, but
                  rather feeling what it was like to let the energy of desire, fullness, and
                  spontaneous self-valuing flow through his body. In this moment of according
                  himself the recognition he had secretly sought from others, he did not care
                  about how others saw him. Nor was there any desire to lord his newfound
                  strength over anyone.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">Many spiritual seekers who suffer, like Paul, from a deflated sense of self,
                  take spiritual teachings about selflessness to mean that they should keep a lid
                  on themselves and not let themselves shine. Yet instead of overzealously
                  guarding against ego inflation, Paul needed to let his genie out of the bottle
                  before he could distinguish between genuine expressions of being such as power,
                  joy, or celebration, and ego distortions like grandiosity and conceit.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; ">As typically happens in many spiritual communities, Paul had
                  used spiritual practice as a way of trying to deny certain basic human needs.
                  Yet trying to leap directly from rejecting his need for love to a state of
                  needlessness was only spiritual bypassing—using spiritual teachings to
                  reinforce a subconscious defense. When he could finally acknowledge his need,
                  he found that it contained within it a genuine, powerful yes to life and love
                  that diminished his fixation on outer praise and blame.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">Although Paul’s spiritual practice had helped loosen his
                  identification with a fixed self-concept—what I call the </span><em style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">conscious identity</em><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">—it
                  had not helped him fully address his lingering sense of inadequacy and
                  unworthiness stemming from childhood—an even more problematic </span><em style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">subconscious
                  identity</em><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">. It is often hard to dislodge or transform this kind of
                  subconscious identity, which has its roots in interpersonal dynamics, through
                  meditation practice alone, which is mostly a solitary activity. Our work
                  together, with its relational focus, brought Paul’s underground sense of
                  deficiency to light so that he could work with it directly. This also had a
                  clarifying effect on his spiritual practice, helping him make an important
                  distinction between absolute emptiness—the ultimate reality beyond self—and
                  relative, psychological emptiness—his sense of being lacking or deficient.
                  Because he had previously conflated these two types of emptiness, his spiritual
                  practice had in some ways served to reinforce his old sense of inadequacy.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">Paul’s psychological conflicts also cut off his access to
                  deeper capacities such as strength, confidence, and the ability to connect with
                  others in a genuinely open way. These intrinsic human capacities—traditionally
                  described as “the qualities of a Buddha”—can be seen as differentiated
                  expressions of true nature. If realizing pure, undifferentiated being is the
                  path of liberation, then embodying a full spectrum of these differentiated
                  qualities of being is the path of individuation in its deepest sense: the unfolding
                  of our deepest human resources and imperatives, which exist as seed potentials
                  within us, but which are often blocked by psychological conflicts.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">This understanding of individuation goes far beyond the
                  secular, humanistic ideal of developing one’s uniqueness, being an innovator,
                  or living out one’s dreams. Instead, it involves forging a vessel—our capacity
                  for personal presence, nourished by its rootedness in deeper human
                  qualities—through which we can bring absolute true nature into form—the "form"
                  of our person.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">By </span><em style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">person</em><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;"> I do not mean some fixed structure or
                  entity, but the way in which true nature can manifest and express itself in a
                  uniquely personal way, as the ineffable suchness or "youness" of you.
                  Since individuation involves clarifying the psychological dynamics that obscure
                  our capacity to shine through, it is not opposed to spiritual realization.
                  Instead, it involves becoming a more transparent vessel—an authentic person who
                  can bring through what is beyond the person in a uniquely personal way.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">Working in this way to clear up old emotional conflicts can
                  help us develop a richer quality of personal presence and begin to embody our
                  true nature in an individuated way. Our individuated nature can then become a
                  window opening onto all that is beyond and greater than ourselves.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">While spiritual traditions
                  generally explain the cause of suffering in general terms as the result of
                  ignorance, faulty perception, or disconnection from our true nature, Western
                  psychology provides a more specific developmental understanding. It shows how
                  suffering stems from childhood conditioning; in particular, from static and
                  distorted images of self and other that we carry with us in the baggage of our
                  past. And it reveals these painful, distorting identities as relational—formed
                  in and through our relationships with others.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">Spiritual traditions that do not recognize the way in which ego identity forms
                  out of interpersonal relationships are unable to address these interpersonal
                  structures directly. Instead, they offer practices—prayer, meditation, mantra,
                  service, devotion to God or guru—that shift the attention to the universal
                  ground of being in which the individual psyche moves, like a wave on the ocean.
                  Thus it becomes possible to enter luminous states of trans-personal awakening,
                  beyond personal conflicts and limitations, without having to address or work
                  through specific psychological issues and conflicts. This kind of realization
                  can certainly provide access to greater wisdom and compassion, but it often
                  does not touch or alter impaired ego structures which, because they influence
                  our everyday functioning, prevent us from fully integrating this realization
                  into the fabric of our lives. Thus, as Sri Aurobindo put it, “Realization by
                  itself does not necessarily transform the being as a whole. One may have some
                  light of realization at the spiritual summit of consciousness but the parts
                  below remain what they were.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">We in the West have been exposed to the most profound
                  nondual teachings and practices of the East for only a few short decades. Now a
                  deeper level of dialogue between East and West is called for in order to
                  develop greater understanding about the relationship between the impersonal
                  absolute and the human, personal dimension. Indeed, expressing absolute true
                  nature in a thoroughly personal, human form may be one of the most important
                  evolutionary potentials of the cross-fertilization of Eastern contemplative
                  traditions and Western psychological understanding. Bringing these two
                  approaches into deeper dialogue may help us discover how to transform our
                  personality in a more complete way—developing it into an instrument of higher
                  purposes—thus redeeming the whole personal realm, instead of just seeking
                  liberation from it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">Buddhism has always grown through incorporating methods and
                  understandings indigenous to the cultures to which it spread. If psychotherapy
                  is our modern way of dealing with the psyche and its demons (analogous to the
                  early Tibetan shamanic practices that Vajrayana Buddhism integrated into its larger
                  framework), then the meditative traditions may find a firmer footing in our
                  culture through relating to Western psychology more fully.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.231;">For psychological and spiritual work to be mutually
                  supportive allies in the liberation and embodiment of the human spirit, we need
                  to re-envision both paths for our time, so that psychological work can serve
                  spiritual development, while spiritual work can take into account psychological
                  development. These two traditions would then come together as convergent streams,
                  furthering humanity’s evolution toward realizing its true nature—as belonging
                  to the universal mystery that surrounds and inhabits all things—and embodying
                  this larger nature as human presence in the world, thus serving as a crucial
                  link between heaven and earth.</span></p>
