            <div class='col-md body'>tis a beautiful piece by Dharma Master Heng Sure, i hope we can post more of such teachings!<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Don't discuss the faults of others. "Others" are just thoughts in your own head. What you see as a fault in someone else comes from your discriminating mind.<br><br>Others' faults are just my own. You should return the light all the time. Shine the light on the projections of the mind and get to work crossing them over.<br><br>Being of the same substance is called Great Compassion. All thoughts come from the self-nature. When they filter up into the mind they get discriminated into good and bad, right and wrong. When the Bodhisattva practices Prajna wisdom and wipes away all thoughts as they arise, he is returning to his self-nature, to the original, fundamentally pure substance that he shares with all living beings. This is truly taking all living beings across.<br><br>"At all times he nurtures them." He must do it constantly for Great Compassion to manifest.<br><br>"At all times" in the Buddhist sense means from thought to thought, minute to minute, hour to hour, day to day, week to week, through months, years, life to life, kalpa to kalpa. Time loses its meaning. For the Bodhisattva who has vowed to save all living beings, one thought of purity, one act of Great Compassion extends throughout all time and space to the ends of the Dharma realm. What could be more liberated, more independent than the scope of Great Compassion?<br><br>Practices are the measure of the Bodhisattva. In order to stay on the Middle Way he must maintain his Dharma-methods no matter what circumstances arise. If a good state appears he cannot turn from his practice. If an unpleasant scene develops, the Bodhisattva nurtures his practice all the same, taking tender care of his most valuable possession, the jewelled Dharma-raft that can ferry all beings from suffering to the other shore of bliss.</span><br>-Ven. Dharma Master &amp; Monk- Heng Sure<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Those of you who are in this Study, do not agitate your mind; let it<br>be like a mountain. Let your mind be like a wide and empty space and<br>continue to reflect on enlightening Dharma like the moon reflects the<br>sun. Whether others think that I am right or wrong is not your concern.<br>Do not judge or criticize others. Just be at ease and go on mindlessly<br>like a simpleton or fool. Or, be like one who is struck deaf and dumb.<br>Spend your life like you cannot hear a thing or like an infant. Then,<br>sooner or later, all the delusion will disappear.</span>-VENERABLE MASTER KYUNG-HO'S<br>INSPIRATIONAL TALK<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Everythings a test, To see what you will do.<br>Mistaking what's before your eyes,<br>You'll have to start anew."</span>-Ven.

            <div class='col-md body'>indeed all Masters or saints came to this conclusion of Not discussing faults of others. here's my collections.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">This was before Buddhism enter China.<br>Lu's Spring and Autumn Annals or Lu's History (Lu Shi Chun Qiu). LÃ¼, Buwei, d. 235 B.C..<br>ie. "Foundation of everything, Must first govern the body. By completing the body, One completes the World. By governing the Self, One govern the World. One who live for the sake of the world, do not start with the world but Start from here with OneSelf. "</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The outside phenomena is neither good nor bad. All that's good or bad is generated from your afflicted mind/heart of attachment, dualism and wandering thoughts.</span> - Grand Master Oyi.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Â“Judge not, that ye be not judged. For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again. And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.Â” - Matthew 7:1-5 </span><br><br>/\<br></div>

This is my karma.<br>The only "definitive truth" for Buddhism is the absolute negation of any one truth as the Definitive Truth. </span>-- HH Dalai Lama<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The object is never the source of your problems. We blame and criticize others because we don't like suffering. But if we don't like suffering, we should not harm others and create disharmony; this is what interferes with our happiness. What we want and what we are doing are opposite.<br>The time is now~ Practice is not for another time or another place or another person~It is not differences that divide us; it's our judgments that do</span>~Lama Zopa~<br><br>/\<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">THERE was an old monk sitting in the room, doing nothing with one of his students standing behind him. Two of his students, student A and B were arguing about something outside the room, for a while, student A rushing to the room, giving the description of argument to the old monk, and asking "Master, am I right?", the old monk answering "You are right", student A rushing to student B who is outside the room, few minutes later, student B also rushing to the room and giving his opinion about the argument to the old monk, and asking the same question "Master, am I right?", the old monk answering "You are right", student B so happy and leaving the room, in this moment the student behind the old monk asking the old monk with whispering voice "Master, if A is right, B must be wrong, if B is right, A must be wrong, how come they are all (right)?", the old monk answering "You are right too".<br><br>WHY? Because the old monk is already in the level of the WHOLE ONE, he can accept all kinds of opinions. As a matter of fact, the old monk can also give negative answers to his students like "You are wrong", it all because that the old monk already surpassed any standpoint and does not have his original nature.<br><br>"Everything are affirmative, everything are negative", is<br>the "Perfection and Completion" idea of the Hua Yen theory, is also<br>the conclusion of "Existence" and "Emptiness" becoming "ONE"(Existence equal Emptiness). When we understand this "ONE", then we might understand the next "In the level of higher dimension, (Everything are one, one is everything) (This is that, that is this) (Big equal small) (Past same as present), everything<br>are not interfere with one another".</span><br><br>/\<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>below is on dealing with insult:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">If one bodhisattva bestows in charity sufficient treasures to fill as many worlds as there are sand grains in the Ganges, and another, realizing that all things are egoless, attains perfection through patient forbearance, the merit of the latter will far exceed that of the former.</span> ---Diamond Sutra<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"in fact patient forbearance IS transcendent wisdom."</span> ---grand Master Guang Ching<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">If we can be patient with others' insult and ridicule, and not to calculate how much others have taken advantage of us and not to worry, then karmic conditions from previous lives will just go away. Further, we would be calm and peaceful right there and our blessings and wisdom will grow and our life spans will lengthen as well.</span> ---grand Master Guang Ching<br><br>/\</div>
