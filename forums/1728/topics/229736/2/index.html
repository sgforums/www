Only the subtlest of mental movement remains - perceiveable in its absence by those who have entered the second Jhāna. The ability to form unwholesome intentions cease.<br><br>Yeah thats what I got because I looked at all the lines on my palm all at once, then concentrated and other things ceased before I could see something coming out of my hand</div></blockquote>Erm, what you experienced doesn't sound like what wiki said at all. Sounds like hallucination of psychiatric illness <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I'm going to quote what Buddha said about the first jhana:<br><br><blockquote>[First jhana]<br><br>"There is the case where a monk Â— quite withdrawn from sensuality, withdrawn from unskillful qualities Â— enters and remains in the first jhana: rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought and evaluation. He permeates and pervades, suffuses and fills this very body with the rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal.<br><br>"Just as if a skilled bathman or bathman's apprentice would pour bath powder into a brass basin and knead it together, sprinkling it again and again with water, so that his ball of bath powder Â— saturated, moisture-laden, permeated within and without Â— would nevertheless not drip; even so, the monk permeates, suffuses and fills this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of withdrawal. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal...</blockquote>During first jhana, there is withdrawal from sensual attachment, one pointedness absorption, and very strong bodily rupture. The bliss spreads throughout body. (remember I mentioned my experience of intense bliss spreading throughout the body in wave-like movement?) The whole body is in a state of bliss. Physical rupture is the strong character in First Jhana, and in higher jhana physical rupture turns more to mental rupture, then to equanimity, etc. A different form of bliss.<br><br>So don't anyhow say you attain this or that jhana.</div>

Don't have the idea that you will gain some special knowledge in the form of mental perception and knowledge.. all these have to be let go of, released before you can enter into the realm of emptiness. Reality cannot be found on the level of mental knowledge and perception. Don't try to attain something special, like supernatural powers, or etc. That's why Zen Master Seung Sahn always says, "I hope you only go straight - don't know, get Enlightenment, and save all beings from suffering." Like Dharma Dan say, all you have to "do" is just follow the dharma, practise moronically and get enlightened.<br><br><blockquote>According to Lao Tzu, the greatest calamity is in having a body, thus he teaches the way of extinguishing the body* to attain the realm of wu or non-being. Moreover, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the greatest cause that burdens the body is in having knowledge, thus he teaches the way of abandoning knowledge to enter the realm of hsu or emptiness.</span></strong></blockquote>* extinguishing attachment to body, not suicide</div>
