              <p>A year ago, I used to recite Pu Men Pin every Saturday in the temple. Due to some reason, I've stopped going to that temple and now occasionally recite it at home. This is one of the sutra which I like most. I remembered the 1st time I recited this sutra, I cried because I can really feel Goddess of Mercy's compassion. I like the middle part which keep repeating å¿µå½¼è§‚éŸ³åŠ›ã€‚ã€‚ã€‚ã€‚ã€‚ã€‚ã€‚ã€‚ã€‚</p>
              <p>Following is a very nice version of recitation of  æ™®é—¨å“� (Total 4 parts) Happy viewing!</p>

              <p>the idea of Pu Men Pin is how Avalokitesvara use what ever form to liberate those who wish to be saved by what ever form.</p>
              <p>when old MCK went to Japan to visit a very old japanese master, the old japanese master told MCK that the founder of all religions are all manifestation of Avalokitesvara.  it's the first time he say this, said his disciples. He didn't even told his disciples, but after seeing MCK, he told him this. as not many Buddhists will understand this.</p>

              <p>my grandma also like your aunt. also pray to Guan Yin Pusa ll her life. hence i when young already got the affinity with Guan Yin Pusa. grandma don't know Dharma as she is uneducated, but when she die, we all as grandchildren who have knowledge of Dharma, all helped her gain a better rebirth. she was in a coma, at first she did not want to go, but when we mentioned that if she see Guan Yin Pusa, quickly go with Guan Yin Pusa, she pass on.</p>
              <p>we also invited my brother's personal guru, a rinpoche from Tibet and who's in touch with Eminence Drubwang Konchok Norbu Rinpoche to do the Phowa for her. we use a liberation mantra card, the golden sandé‡‘å…‰æ˜Žæ²™ and liberation blanketå¾€ç”Ÿè¢«! who got so much merit? if the dedication is good, i think she's already in pureland, become a Pusa herself. if not, she's in heaven or human realm. surely she won't be in the 3 lower realms. the ashes produce sarira flowers and are pinkish. my aunt dream they she was wearing very nice clothing. my cousin also dream of a special dream which i cannot remember.</p>

              <p><br>Why will Guan Ying Pusa be the founder of other religions? Form such religons will only lead to people slandering the triple gems. Slandering triple gems is very heavy karma.</p>

              Hmm I cant view the pictures...
              
              Dragon are not imaginary creatures. The are real, but we cannot see them with our normal eyes.
              
              If Guan Shi Yin Pu Sa be the founder of other religions, it is to lead them to do good. However, slandering the triple gems is what the people who misunderstand their own teachings do, the founders of the other religions did not teach their followers to slander the triple gems.
