              <div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Practical
               experience tells us that some aspects of our experience (hence, our 
              existence) are subject to our control while others are not. We feel that
               we can choose to sit, stand, walk, or lie down, but not that we can 
              choose to breathe, digest our food, circulate our blood, or grow new 
              skin cells. In fact, the real “us,” that is, our “true self” does 
              actually manage all of this and more; but the point we want to get at 
              here concerns a frequent target of Dogen’s criticism: the presupposition
               that the “natural” or “unintentional” processes of experience are 
              inclusive of our thoughts, speech, and actions. The worshiper of 
              emptiness presupposes that hearing, for instance, occurs unconsciously 
              as random sounds impress themselves upon the mind through the ear, 
              rather than, as Dogen contends, that hearing is actualized by the mind 
              conducting itself through the ear to the “objects” of sound. The former 
              (false) view is based on the same principle that divides “appearance” 
              from “reality” or “form” from “emptiness” – such a view “presupposes” 
              that the mind is uniform, passive, pure, unmoving “consciousness” or 
              “essential nature,” and that hearing (and seeing, smelling, tasting, 
              feeling, and thinking) are automatic, involuntary processes. Such 
              distorted views lead to dead end doctrines and practices advocating 
              “having no goals,” “letting things be as they are,” “just sitting in 
              pure awareness,” etc. – of such notions Dogen says:</span></span></div>

               to the phrase ‘when the right moment arrives’, folks in both the past 
              and the present have frequently held the view that this means one simply
               waits for some future time when Buddha Nature will manifest before 
              one’s eyes. They believe that while doing their training and practice in
               this way, the time will arrive when Buddha Nature will spontaneously 
              manifest before their eyes. They say that until that time comes, It will
               not manifest even by visiting one’s Master and inquiring into the 
              Dharma or even by doing one’s best to practice the Way. Looking at the 
              Matter in this manner, they uselessly return to worldly ways, vainly 
              waiting for It to fall down upon them from the heavens. Folks like this,
               I fear, are that type </span></span></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">of non-Buddhist who believes that things just happen to happen, independent of any cause.</span></span></span></div>

              <div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Here
               Dogen clearly illustrates the ordinary (unawakened) inactive mind of 
              “letting things be.” Realizing the reality of Buddha nature is not 
              something that just happens. Authentic liberation requires wholehearted,
               accurately directed, intentional effort. Those that “just sit” and 
              passively experience whatever happens to “spontaneously manifests” 
              before their eyes cannot even see the true nature of grass and trees, 
              much less Buddhas. Truly, it is immediately accessible to all, but none 
              access it without informing themselves of the details concerning how to 
              access it – and wholeheartedly applying themselves to it. On the 
              significance of this Dogen quotes the Buddha’s words, then comments that
               we “need to be clear” that to give rise to this intention is to 
              “wholeheartedly seek enlightened wisdom.” </span></span></div>

              <div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>The Tathagata said in the </span></span><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>Avatamsaka Scripture</span></span></em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>:</span></span></span></div>

               Bodhisattvas give rise to the intention to realize Buddhahood and make 
              birth-and-death the foremost issue, they wholeheartedly seek enlightened
               Wisdom and, being steadfast, they will not waver. The meritorious 
              functioning of that single-mindedness is deep and vast, knowing no 
              bounds. If I were to analyze and explain it, I would be unable to 
              exhaust the topic, even if I had eons to do it.</span></span></span></div>
              <p><br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">You
               need to be clear about this: using the issue of birth-and-death to give
               rise to your intention to realize Buddhahood is to wholeheartedly seek 
              enlightened Wisdom.</span></span></span><br> <span style="font-family: Calibri;"><em><span>Shobogenzo, </span></em><em><span>Hotsu MujÅ� Shin,</span></em><span> Hubert Nearman</span></span><br> <br> <span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span>Peace,</span></span><br> <span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span>Ted</span></span></p>
