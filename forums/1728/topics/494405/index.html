              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Pope Francis to make surprise visit to Myanmar on peace
              mission </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">John Zaw, Mandalay and Michael Sainsbury August 7, 2017 La
              Croix International</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The main impetus behind pope's visit is to help Myanmar make
              peace with the Roghinyas, says senior clergyman. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Pope Francis will focus on trying to improve the troubles of
              about a million ethnic Muslim Rohingyas when he visits Myanmar, in the first
              ever papal visit to the country.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The visit is due to take place in the last week of November
              after the pope was personally invited by President Htin Kyaw. News of his visit
              has leaked out of the Vatican but is not expected to be officially announced
              until next month.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The visit has already drawn the ire of hard-line Buddhist
              groups who have fanned sectarian violence and protest, especially against the
              Rohingya and other Muslims, over the past five years.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">"No, no, don't come," "don't visit if you come
              to Myanmar for Bengalis", and "we oppose the visit if he used
              the word Rohingya", several Buddhists posted on their Facebook pages.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Bishop Raymond Sumlut Gam of Banmaw in Kachin State said a
              visit by Pope Francis to Myanmar is most likely, although he said he had not
              officially been informed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">"The Catholic bishops invited Pope Francis before the
              500th anniversary of Catholicism in Myanmar in late 2014," Bishop Gam told
              ucanews.com.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">"Some improvements have occurred such as diplomatic
              relations between Myanmar and Vatican plus the appointment of an apostolic
              nuncio," he said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The pope's relatively last minute program change will see the
              leader of the world's 1 billion Catholics cancel a planned trip to India after
              prevarication by that nation's strongly pro-Hindu government. The proposed
              visit to Myanmar will precede the pope visiting neighboring Bangladesh.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Senior Catholic sources told ucanews.com that Pope Francis
              will arrive in Myanmar on November 27 for four nights.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">According to information shared with top clergy only two
              weeks ago, the pope is expected to first visit the jungle capital Naypyidaw
              where he will meet President Htin Kyaw and the country's de-facto leader, State
              Counsellor and Foreign Affairs Minister Aung San Suu Kyi.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">It is expected that he will hold at least two Masses before
              heading to the country's largest city and business capital, Yangon, for a large
              open air Mass. It is also expected that he will visit and say Mass at the St.
              Joseph's Catholic Major Seminary in Yangon.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">There are about 700,000 Catholics in Myanmar, served by 16
              bishops, more than 700 priests and 2,200 religious.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Rohingya</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Most of the Rohingya population in Myanmar's Rakhine State
              have been denied citizenship. About 120,000 of them are trapped in internally
              displaced people (IDP) camps near the state capital Sittwe. A further 400,000
              live in the state's north which is currently under martial law.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The media are forbidden to travel to the region but reports
              of atrocities by the military, including rape, murder and burning villages have
              leaked out over the past year. Such outrages have further fueled home grown
              terrorists who have emerged out of desperation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">More than 170,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh, Malaysia,
              Thailand, and Indonesia — many on risky boats — in the last five years
              according to the United Nations.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">While Pope Francis will not visit Rakhine State, he will fly
              over it on the way to Bangladesh, church sources said, and probably use that
              time to make some sort of statement. It's a tactic the Argentine pontiff, the
              first ever from outside Europe has used before.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">"The main impetus behind the pope visiting is to try and
              help the government make peace with the Rohingyas and improve their
              plight," said one senior clergyman with knowledge of the pope's visit but
              not authorized to speak about it. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">"When the pope received the invitation from President
              Htin Kyaw, we understand he jumped at it," the source said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Observers believe that the unexpected move by Myanmar's
              civilian-led government to invite the pope, a relentless advocate for refugees,
              has been driven by its desire to skirt the powerful military with which it
              effectively shares power. Under Myanmar's 2008 constitution the military
              retains the crucial defense, border and home affairs portfolios as well as 25
              percent of both houses of parliament.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Aung San Suu Kyi has been widely and increasingly criticized
              by democratic governments around the world for her hands-off attitude to the
              Rohingya crisis and her National League for Democracy's insistence on calling
              the group not by their self-determined name but as Bengalis.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">"[The pope's visit] may be a way for her to change the
              perception that she is ignoring the plight of the Rohingya,
              internationally," one observer noted.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Nyan Win, a central executive committee member of the
              National League for Democracy, would not confirm the visit but said the
              government would welcome the pope if he visited Myanmar.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">"There is no religious persecution and freedom of
              religion prevails in Myanmar, all religions have been living together
              peacefully so it is welcoming news about pope's visit," Nyan Win told
              ucanews.com.</span></p>
