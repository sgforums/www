              <p>thats the Buddha's chief disciple, Maudgalyayana. that is not hungry ghost festival, but Ulambana in Buddhism. This is an occasion when people transfer merits to their departed relatives by offering to the triple gem.</p>

              <p>The chinese seventh month, from what I read somewhere, has buddhist origins put in context of chinese beliefs of afterlife.</p>
              <p>The afterlife mirrors our normal life, which why paper money , houses, cars and amenties are burned as offerings. "Adminstrative fees" are also to hell officials to ensure smooth transition. Not all ghost need to be punished, some reside as like our world prior to rebirth.</p>
              <p>During the seventh month, the ghost are allowed to visit our world, offerings are made to the homeless and unworshipped spirits, the "good brothers", to placate them and maintain harmony. To maintain order, the ghost king, a manifestation of Kuan Yin and his retinue, will preside over the hungry ghost presence in our realm. </p>
              <p>At the end of the festival, the effigy of ghost king is burned, signifying his return to the spirit realm.</p>

              <p>Generally, chinese belief in the supernatural is collectively lumped as Taoism. Chinese beliefs is  predominately polytheistic, mixture of confucianism, taoism and buddhism and local folk belief which varies in different regions.  </p>
              <p>There are three realms, heaven, underworld and human realm,  with different levels. I am not sure which realm does the denizens of the sea belongs to! </p>
              <p>I prefer the term Shenism, but it is  not commonly used.</p>

              <p>I think the biggerest lesson that is missing in this Hungry Ghost Month is not  "Feeding the Hungry Ghost "  But rather thinking about why they become Hungry Ghost.</p>
              <p>What human action resulted their after life to become "Hungry Ghost" -- Human Greed. And for those people who pray and ask for 4D number during this month continue to perpetual the "Human Greed" </p>
              <p>So instead of praying for the dead. Remember what human action that lead to Hungry Ghost that is most important.</p>

              <p>I find this Hungry Ghost Month thing a little flawed. Its being portrayed till human have to fear and show respects. The paper money and all is just a psychological thing. My friend who was brought up in a Buddhist family once told me, burning of joss sticks and burning paper money is just a psychological effect to believe that something has been "given" to the dead. </p>
              <p>All that is needed is respect, and praying of fruits for them by displaying them at the altar. But till now, temples have not abolish the joss stick thingy is cos of public perception. The general public still can't accept these things. Plus our believes has integrated so much with the taoist ones already. </p>
              <p>Confusing ._.</p>

                      day, his Deva-eye saw that his deceased mother had transmigrated to the 
                      realm of the hungry ghost. Her stomach was enlarged and she had tiny limbs. 
                      Her throat was as normal as the eye of a needle, and as a result, it was 
                      impossible for her to eat any food or even to swallow a drop of water. 
                      Maudgalyayana could not bear the sight of his mother in such an extreme 
                      state of suffering. He immediately filled his alms bowl with food and 
                      with the immense power that he possessed, he sent it to his mother. However, 
                      she could not have the food because each time it turned into charcoal 
                      before she could put it in her mouth. It hurt Maudgalyayana to see what 
                      was happening and because of his strong emotion for his mother, it hindered 
                      his ability to see the karma that she had committed in her past lives. 
                      He went to Buddha for advice. The Buddha closed his eyes and entered into 
                      pure contemplation. With great compassion and gentleness, he said: "Maudgalyayana, 
                      your mother did not believe in the retributions arising from the law of 
                      cause and effect. She committed many evil deeds. She dishonoured the Buddha 
                      and insulted the Sangha [1], had no respect 
                      for the Three Treasures (Buddha, Dharma and Sangha), was greedy, filled 
                      with hatred, ignorant and arrogant. She was a wicked person who committed 
                      many evils, and she teased others giving them no peace. Therefore, she 
                      is suffering such a bitter consequence. Even though you are her son and 
                      your filial piety touches the heavens, these are still not able to save 
                      a person who had committed such serious evil karma." On hearing this, 
                      Maudgalyayana wept in pain. </strong></span></p>

                      The only way is to use the combined merits of the Sangha. The 15th day 
                      of the 7th month of each year is designated "Buddha's Joy Day". 
                      This is the last day of the Sangha's summer retreat, and because of the 
                      purity with which the Sangha observed the precepts and practised cultivation, 
                      many attain the Bodhi [2]. The merits that 
                      they accumulate are immense beyond imagination, and the Buddha is most 
                      delighted. If you make an offering to these Sangha during this time, you 
                      can liberate your deceased parents and relatives from the suffering of 
                      the three evil realms (realms of animal, hungry ghost and hell) through 
                      their immense merits. If the parents are still living, then they shall 
                      be blessed with good health, happiness and a life of abundance. This is

                      Maudgalyayana was delighted to hear this, and carried out the Buddha's 
                      advice accordingly. Thus, on the 15th of the 7th month after the offering 
                      to the Sangha, Maudgalyayana's mother was liberated from the suffering 
                      of the realm of the hungry ghost.</span></strong></p>

                      After Maudgalyayana received the benefits from this Dharma, he was very 
                      grateful to the Buddha and praised the merits of the Three Treasures. 
                      He advised people to promote the 'Ullambana Dharma'. This day, the 15th

                      Today, this auspicious celebration has become a day of widespread slaughter

                      the good brothers to a feast'. These practices are not only against the 
                      compassion of the Buddha, but also a let down to Maudgalyayana who had 
                      advised the world to be filial and to perform good deeds.</span></strong></p>

                      the merit of longevity and good health. It is meaningless to kill other 
                      living beings and offer them to the ghost, because they cannot benefit 
                      from these at all. Instead, those who kill shall have to repay for their

In order to appease them, animals are slaughtered and offered to these 'hungry ghosts', together with other food. Big feasts and other festivities are held during this month and the most 'auspicious day' is the 15th day of the month. It is so widespread that this yearly affair is dubbed the Month or Festival of the Hungry Ghosts. What is this all about?</em></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000a0; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Among the chief disciples of the Buddha was one named Maudgalyayana. He had immense supernatural powers: Deva-foot ubiquity which made it possible for him to appear at any place at will, the divine sight of Deva-eye to have unlimited vision of all things, large and normal, near and distant; Deva-ear to hear all sounds regardless of the distance. Furthermore, he had the ability to read and understand whatever was in a person's mind. He also had the ability to see clearly the events that occurred in a person's many past lives aeons ago. Thus, Maudgalyayana is considered to be a Maha-Bodhisattva who is foremost in supernatural powers.<br><br></strong></span></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/vol5img1.jpg" alt="" width="192" height="127"></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000a0; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>One day, his Deva-eye saw that his deceased mother had transmigrated to the realm of the hungry ghost. Her stomach was enlarged and she had tiny limbs. Her throat was as normal as the eye of a needle, and as a result, it was impossible for her to eat any food or even to swallow a drop of water. Maudgalyayana could not bear the sight of his mother in such an extreme state of suffering. He immediately filled his alms bowl with food and with the immense power that he possessed, he sent it to his mother. However, she could not have the food because each time it turned into charcoal before she could put it in her mouth. It hurt Maudgalyayana to see what was happening and because of his strong emotion for his mother, it hindered his ability to see the karma that she had committed in her past lives. He went to Buddha for advice. The Buddha closed his eyes and entered into pure contemplation. With great compassion and gentleness, he said: "Maudgalyayana, your mother did not believe in the retributions arising from the law of cause and effect. She committed many evil deeds. She dishonoured the Buddha and insulted the Sangha [1], had no respect for the Three Treasures (Buddha, Dharma and Sangha), was greedy, filled with hatred, ignorant and arrogant. She was a wicked person who committed many evils, and she teased others giving them no peace. Therefore, she is suffering such a bitter consequence. Even though you are her son and your filial piety touches the heavens, these are still not able to save a person who had committed such serious evil karma." On hearing this, Maudgalyayana wept in pain.</strong></span></p>

                      <p> </p>Actually you can dedicate merits at any time of the year, no need 7th month. The reason Ullambana Dharma is held at 7th month is because in the past, there was a period where monks go into retreat in the forest, and when they come out, many of them attain Arhantship. And we know that dedicating merits to Arhants results in very very immense merits (much much more than the merits from giving things to other non Arhant beings)  and is thus able to liberate a deceased being from the lower realm by that amount of merits.
