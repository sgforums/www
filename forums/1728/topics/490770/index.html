              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="color: #171717; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.231;">For the
                  science of psychiatry, the concept and act of “suicide bombing” remain an
                  all-time puzzle. It has become clear that suicide bombing need not be seen in
                  the same light ‘suicide’ is viewed traditionally in psychiatry as the ultimate
                  action of self-annihilation, the urge/determination to kill and escape from
                  self -aftermath of a severe depressive illness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="color: #171717; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">In
                  other words, does suicide bombing fit into being defined as a mental “illness”?
                  Subsequently, the bomber should be relieved of any responsibility for the
                  behavior; hence, if caught, in the event of a failed attempt, rather than being
                  prosecuted, s/he should be taken for psychiatry evaluation and treatment as
                  necessary.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="color: #171717; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">In the
                  realm of psychology and sociological science, different schools of thought have
                  emerged on what is the right approach to unravel the innermost intent of a
                  would-be suicide bomber.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="color: #171717; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">Many
                  have asked: what is the basis for the mission where more often than not many
                  innocent individuals got killed and maimed along with the suicide bomber? Is it
                  due to a prompting from an unbalanced mind, who had been subjected to all kind
                  of imaginative destitution and a hopeless future or is this another innovative
                  tool in the arsenal of guerilla warfare in the prosecution of a well-defined political
                  battle against a perceived oppressor cum enemy?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="color: #171717; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">In
                  other words, which discipline (medical sciences versus social science) is most
                  relevant to anchor the critical understanding as per the phenomenon of suicide
                  bombing? Is it strictly in the realm of psychology/mental health or majorly to
                  be seen as a sociological and political matter? Put succinctly, is a suicide
                  bomber mainly to be appreciated as an individual mind gone astray or a weapon
                  being used by an organized group to prosecute a political cause under the guise
                  of entrenched religious belief. The point really is the need for a deeper
                  understanding which requires a holistic approach; in this wise, to appreciate
                  the phenomenon of suicide bombing demand applying the dialectical rule of “the
                  whole is made of the parts and the parts make the whole”. And this is just the
                  point against those who strictly want to see the act of the suicide bomber
                  either as an individual’s irrationality explainable by strict psychoanalysis or
                  those who see it being driven by the hatred sowed and capitalized upon by
                  belief bigotry. The fact is that both recourses of analyses are relevant and
                  not exclusive: the phenomenon is best understood as the individual disposition
                  to strike violently against the ‘enemy, whilst sacrificing self as the mortar
                  of destruction, after being molded consciously and subconsciously based by the
                  socioeconomic day-to-day reality of severe wants, injustice, oppression,
                  deprivation and a hopeless future.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="color: #171717; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">However,
                  the socioeconomic reality that a suicide bomber finds himself is also a strong
                  factor that tilts such individual to this high point of self-annihilation. Even
                  this concept may not explain all about the phenomenon; as this does not explain
                  fully the participation in this act by individuals whose situations are far
                  from hopelessness per se. The example of Farouk Abdulmutallab (pictured) – the
                  young Nigerian who in December 2009 attempted to bomb a Delta Airliner,
                  certainly do not fall in line with this; he is a rich man’s son with the luxury
                  of life at his disposal yet he was ready to forgo this affluence and have a go
                  at suicide bombing for a beclouded political cause.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="color: #171717; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">Was
                  Abdulmutallab out of his mind? Is he a psychopath who would probably not have
                  enlisted to put himself forward as a suicide bomber if he had received
                  appropriate treatment for mental health? This I presume would have been the
                  line of argument a defense counsel in court would have loved to pursue.
                  Interestingly, our man gave no room for such legal conjecture, he pleaded guilty
                  to all charges as charged with a speech that did not betrayed a failing mind.
                  Abdulmutallab’s speech, i.e. his vocalized thought process, sounded rather
                  coherent and clearly put him above board in a mental state examination.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="color: #171717; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">One
                  other thing worthy of note is the place of suicide bombing in contemporary
                  history. Suicide bombing historically did not begin with the now popular
                  middle-east Islamic fundamentalists – the forebearers of the Boko-haram of
                  Nigeria.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="color: #171717; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">Records
                  of suicide bombing martyrdom are readily available from among the earliest
                  anarchists in the old tsarist Russia more than 100 years ago; and later in the
                  last century, among Japanese world war II fighters, Vietnamese Buddhist monks
                  and the Sri Lankan Tamil Tigers. THE</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="color: #171717; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">In World
                  War II, Japanese “Kamikaze” pilots participated in suicide attacks against
                  American ships in the Pacific. Researchers of the Kamikaze point out that these
                  individuals were not suicidal, but rather viewed self-sacrifice as the ultimate
                  weapon against the enemy. The pilots were driven by a desire to sacrifice for
                  their country, and did not display any signs of typical clinically abnormal
                  behavior.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong style="line-height: 1.231;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #171717;'>THE TAMIL TIGERS</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="color: #171717; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">The
                  Tamil Tigers, a secular group devoted to establishing an independent Tamil
                  state in Sri Lanka, have been responsible for more suicide attacks (over 200)
                  than most other groups. Their fighters are described as fierce, well trained,
                  and totally dedicated to their cause. The Tigers select volunteers from tough
                  combat units according to their combat record. They are known as a highly
                  nationalistic force who select both males and females to serve as “human bombs”
                  to attack selected targets.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong style="line-height: 1.231;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #171717;'>BUDDHIST MONKS AND SELF-IMMOLATION</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="color: #171717; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">Another
                  example of note is the self-immolation of Buddhist monks as practiced in
                  Southeast Asia in the 1960s. While these acts never involved any attacks on
                  others, they nevertheless carried a political message. The earliest of these
                  acts took place in 1963 when Thich Quang Duc, a Buddhist monk, set himself on
                  fire in South Vietnam. This act, and similar acts that followed, served to
                  raise political consciousness against what were described as the repressive
                  policies of the Catholic regime in South Vietnam against Buddhists.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong style="line-height: 1.231;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #171717;'>SO, WHAT DOES IT ADD UP?</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="color: #171717; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">In
                  summary, a close psychoanalysis of the ‘suicide bomber’ will pass as a mind of
                  recurrent contradictions; he is vulnerable yet strong at the same time. He
                  wants to remain anonymous yet remembered in the history of his community as a
                  hero. He wants to die and yet also live forever. He is the most rational being
                  in planning his attack and yet acts in the most irrational way by being
                  destructive to himself and others.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="color: #171717; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; text-align: left;">However, the unfortunate thing is the undesired political implication of
                  these actions, because in the main, this action serves a political cause, which
                  seriously speaking from the obvious does not add up to make the suicide
                  bombers’ cause stronger. If anything, it weakens the cause and leaves a ready
                  excuse for the ‘oppressive machinery’ they are fighting to rearm many times
                  over and thus become more oppressive than ever before.</span></p>
