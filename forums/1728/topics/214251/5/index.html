If you are 'unconscious', then you will simply go along with the conditionings. If conditions are bad, you will grow up as a drug addict, gangster, and screw up. If you are 'conscious', karmic conditions make you live in a drug addict, gangster family, but you grow upright. You are not lured due to 'unconsciousness' into the Step 3 and Step 4 of what Teacher Chen said. So you will not end up in jail. Therefore there is a saying that Buddhadharma can change your 'fate'.

Fated means no choice, but u have a choice. And that choice is not fated by some kind of conditions. It is conditioned arising, but it is NOT fated by other conditions, which I have earlier mentioned. Karma presents a pleasant condition but one need not be concerned about it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just a reminder of certain things we discussed before:<br><br><a href="http://www.londonbuddhistvihara.org/lectures_week/WEEK5.HTM" rel="nofollow">http://www.londonbuddhistvihara.org/lectures_week/WEEK5.HTM</a><br><br>There is a widespread misunderstanding that kamma carries with it the idea of predestination or fatalism, that since everything is conditioned by kamma, there is nothing we can do to influence the course of our lives. This is not so. If everything down to the minutest details were preconditioned, either by kamma or by the physical laws of the universe, there would be no room for the functioning of freewill. It would be impossible for us to free ourselves from the mechanism of cause and effect and to attain Nibbana.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"If one says that in whatever way a person performs a kammic action, in that very same way he will experience the result - in that case there will be no (possibility for a) religious life and no opportunity would appear for the complete ending of suffering. But if one says that a person who performs a kammic action (with a result) that is variably experienceable, will reap its results accordingly - in that case there will be (a possibility for) a religious life and an opportunity for making a complete end of suffering." (A.3:110)</span><br><br>Kammic laws state tendencies, not inevitable consequences. It is true that once an act has been performed, we cannot altogether avoid its consequences, BUT it is how we react to what we experience that determines whether we shall create wholesome or unwholesome kammic results in the future. A man born in poverty, squalor, etc. may be in an environment conducive to crime, but he may not commit any. A man born into wealth, etc. may commit theft. It is how we act in the present which will determine what we shall experience afterwards; we make our own heavens and we make our own hells. This is the very opposite of predestination.</div>
