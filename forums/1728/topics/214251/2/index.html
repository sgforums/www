            <div class='col-md body'>Yesterday I was too tired to think and understand what you were saying. But now I looked at your posts and they were clearly fatalistic. Not Buddhist at all. Definitely has nothing got to do with no-self. It is simply the idea of fatalism. And no will. There is will, but no self making will. There is thoughts, but no thinker.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Cenarious:</div><div class="quote_body">it all doesnt matter because whatever needs to be done will be done by those involved. having no desire and aversion is important for this.</div></blockquote>Nothing of this mentioned about no-self.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Cenarious:</div><div class="quote_body">because if i were you i would have acted exactly like how u acted</div></blockquote>This statement assumes that there is an existence of 'you' and 'i', and if 'i' become 'you', 'i' will act the same as 'you'. This is an illusion. How has that got to do with 'no self'? Conditions serve as a possibility for you to act on them. It does not mean you will act on them.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Cenarious:</div><div class="quote_body">those who come upon the conditions to do charity will do the charity. if i were that person i will also do the exact same thing. same for u because the conditions are exactly the same.<br><br>and im only seeking confirmation here.</div></blockquote>It doesn't mean you will do charity. Some people might choose not to do charity due to selfish or evil thoughts. Conditions are there, but whether you make a will to do charity is another thing. No-self doesn't mean no-will. And will doesn't mean self. Will is just will, there is no self.<br><br>But Eckhart Tolle's 'Choice implies consciousness' applies. If you are 'unconscious', then you will simply go along with the conditionings. If conditions are bad, you will grow up as a drug addict, gangster, and screw up. If you are 'conscious', karmic conditions make you live in a drug addict, gangster family, but you grow upright. You are not lured due to 'unconsciousness' into the Step 3 and Step 4 of what Teacher Chen said. So you will not end up in jail. Therefore there is a saying that Buddhadharma can change your 'fate'. This is absolutely true.<br><br><a href="http://www.katinkahesselink.net/tibet/karma_thanisaro.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.katinkahesselink.net/tibet/karma_thanisaro.html</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">For the early Buddhists, karma was non-linear. Other Indian schools believed that karma operated in a straight line, with actions from the past influencing the present, and present actions influencing the future. As a result, they saw little room for free will.<br><br>Buddhists, however, saw that karma acts in feedback loops, with the present moment being shaped both by past and by present actions; present actions shape not only the future but also the present.<br><br>This constant opening for present input into the causal process makes free will possible.</span><br><br><a href="http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/karma.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/karma.htm</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Thus, from a Buddhist point of view, our present mental, moral intellectual and temperamental differences are, for the most part, due to our own actions and tendencies, both past and present.<br><br>Although Buddhism attributes this variation to Karma, as being the chief cause among a variety, it does not, however, assert that everything is due to Karma. The law of Karma, important as it is, is only one of the twenty-four conditions described in Buddhist Philosophy.<br><br><strong>Refuting the erroneous view that "whatsoever fortune or misfortune experienced is all due to some previous action", the Buddha said:<br><br>"So, then, according to this view, owing to previous action men will become murderers, thieves, unchaste, liars, slanderers, covetous, malicious and perverts. Thus, for those who fall back on the former deeds as the essential reason, there is neither the desire to do, nor effort to do, nor necessity to do this deed, or abstain from this deed."</strong><br><br>It was this important text, which states the belief that all physical circumstances and mental attitudes spring solely from past Karma that Buddha contradicted. If the present life is totally conditioned or wholly controlled by our past actions, then certainly Karma is tantamount to fatalism or determinism or predestination. If this were true, free will would be an absurdity. Life would be purely mechanistic, not much different from a machine. Being created by an Almighty God who controls our destinies and predetermines our future, or being produced by an irresistible Karma that completely determines our fate and controls our lifeÂ’s course, independent of any free action on our part, is essentially the same. The only difference lies in the two words God and Karma. One could easily be substituted for the other, because the ultimate operation of both forces would be identical.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Such a fatalistic doctrine is not the Buddhist law of Karma.</span></strong></span><br><br>But most people's idea, and the general western idea of free will is also extreme and the term free will could be misinterpreted to mean that there is a controller of events. It is not so.<br><br>Here is a more balanced view:<br><br><a href="http://www.thinkbuddha.org/article/173/life-without-free-will" rel="nofollow">http://www.thinkbuddha.org/article/173/life-without-free-will</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">In other words, nirvana is the concrete realization of Â“no free will.Â” It is also the concrete realization of Â“no determinism.Â” For in order for something to be determined, it must be determined by something OUTSIDE itself. But if there is ultimately nothing outside us to force us to choose what we do, then we are no more determined to make the choices we do than we are free to make them. They simply Â“arise of themselves in relation to circumstances.Â”</span><br><br>On a higher level, nothing ever arose and exists merely as a potential. I think that is called 'alaya' and is beyond time and space.<br><br>By the way those who have paypal or bank accounts, please support sgForums by signing their membership.
