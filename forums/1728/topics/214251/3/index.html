Often this needs to be done.. if you want to overcome yourself without such help with negotiators, then you must be prepared to suffer many years, it can take years and depending on your practice... no doctors can help. We must start practising the dharma diligently ourselves to overcome such situations. If you practice no-self and is able to experience presence in the correct way, it does not affect you. Because there will be no entry point. When we are constantly authenticated by Presence and there is no entry for that trance level to take place.  That level of consciousness does not exist.

There is only this eternally present Present. So this sgForums account name you created is quite a nice name... I wonder how did you thought of that initially?<br><br>Changes occur in timelessness, in the timeless Now (not a Now in relation to past and future), because timelessness is reality. It only appears to have reality when we analysis in linear mode. So strangely to say, Cause and Effect happens simultaneously as you cannot really separate the two, or in timelessness, everything is Unmanifested. Nothing was ever born.<br><br><a href="http://www.angelfire.com/electronic/bodhidharma/karma_truth.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.angelfire.com/electronic/bodhidharma/karma_truth.html</a> - under the last part, IV. Karma and free will:<br><br><blockquote>Cause and effect, just like birth and death, lose their significance at the Enlightened level because at the level of basic nature there is no one to receive the effect of Karma, whether it is good or bad. Therefore, at the extreme, when one is Enlightened, the law of Karma is not applicable. All that the Enlightened one does, says, or thinks is through free will, a manifestation of basic nature, and not the effect of past Karma.</blockquote>No wonder Thusness told Longchen,<br><br><a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=213938" rel="nofollow">http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=213938</a><br><br><blockquote>Possibly but not conclusively. I do not deny that there are just certain aspects of consciousness that require us to work undisturbed deligently. Sufficient level of clarity is required to serve as the condition and momentum for deeper level of insight to take place. For this, one might have to leave behind normal everyday life and live in solitude for a period of time. <strong>But in the final stage, one's action is totally indeterminable. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></strong></blockquote></div>
