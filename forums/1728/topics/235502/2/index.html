If we don't wake up, nature will sobber us through its brute power. We always think that science and inventions are so all powerful... but we have greatly underestimated the complexity of co-habitating with the rest of the planet.<br><br>Sorry for the preaching...<br><br></div></blockquote>Hi Longchen,<br><br>I donÂ’t think you are preaching; your message is timely; the weather is getting so erratic.   It is quite alarming to realize that at the rate we are consuming the earth resources, it may only last for another few hundred years.  It wonÂ’t take long for us to destroy our own habitats and that, is just few generation away; although we may not live to see the disastrous, we have to think a little for the future generations.  We are abusing the natural systems.<br><br>I believe many are not aware of the harm and educations do play a role.  Prior to taking environmental science decades back, I had absolutely no idea about the impact and consequences of pollutions.  The idea that Â‘resources will come to an endÂ’ never existed.<br><br>Even with adequate education, developing nations are so helpless due to their poverty.  Developed nations lure these nations into commitments.  I shall not dwell deeper into it but the rapid disappearance of forests in many parts of the world is what caused the extra half carbon dioxide to be added to the atmosphere.  Reducing the CO2 emissions is not just getting rid of CFCs, land use change is a major issue.<br><br>Locally, a taxation policy driven towards pro-green policies may help.  At present the economic penalties are so small that it hardly drives people away from the demand of CFC sources.  Internationally certain sorts of agreements are also necessary for nations to adhere to policies that will slow down greenhouse gases emission. Global warming is an international issue, If China, for example, continues to double their coal consumption every decade, it would do little help even all other countries put in effort.<br><br>Lastly we must be careful of futuristic renewable energy.  I think very soon the world will turn to nuclear as an alternative source of energy.  Is using nuclear is viable solution?  I hope we are not replacing Â“flu with cancerÂ”.  I hope we do not replace ecological insecurity with nuclear threat.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks all for the replies...<br><br>I agree with Thusness and JonLS.<br><br>Going Nuclear is certainly a worrying potential.<br><br>The other thing that  (i feel) is a potential concern is supply/resource flow difficulties. Eventual oil shortages, crops, resources get destroyed in natural disasters, etc may pose accessibility problems to resource-scarce populations.<br><br>I feel that in the future, movement of supplies may be increasingly expensive or frustrating... due to oil supply-demand discrepencies and other potentially obscured factors.<br><br>I had this feeling some years ago that resource supply might be an eventual  problem. With the recent destruction of malaysian crops in flood, this seems like a prelude to some potential difficulties. Well, it certainly was a huge difficulties for the people affected by the floods. Maybe I am being pessimistic.</div>

It is not the form of "knowingness" that you experienced in "I AM".  That experience is "contentless", be free from a background. forget about the source and touch the heart of every arising directly.<br></div>

(existence, non-existence, both, neither) When "knowingness" is not seen as an entity, then existence, non existence, both and neither do not apply. Similarly if "self" or "life" is not seen as an entity, there is no birth (existence) and death (non existence).<br><br>"I know" and "I do not know" are just that.. an illusionary boundary between existence and non existence, like a line drawn between waking and sleeping. When we say "I do not know", does the knowingness belong to "me" or "I"? Nope. To say that "I do not know" is already a form of knowingness, with the karmic propensities of "self" as the conditions.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</div><div class="quote_body">"Mere suffering is, not any sufferer is found<br>The deeds exist, but no performer of the deeds:<br>Nibbana is, but not the man that enters it,<br>The path is, but no wanderer is to be seen.<br><br>No doer of the deeds is found,<br>No one who ever reaps their fruits,<br>Empty phenomena roll on,<br>This view alone is right and true.<br><br>No god, no Brahma, may be called,<br>The maker of this wheel of life,<br>Empty phenomena roll on,<br>Dependent on conditions all."<br><br>- Visuddhimagga XVI 90</div></blockquote>Similarly, mere knowingness is, dependent upon conditions do they arise. Everything is conditioned arising, but the ignorant tries to grasp them by imposing illusionary boundaries and views, thus illusions like the 4 extremes and so on.<br><br>Reality has also nothing to do with subjective and objective world. When we say something like "I do not know", isn't it viewing reality as an objective and subjective reality? These are again more boundaries imposed by the mind.<br><br>But let's look at Master Tu Shun's teachings. According to him, every node is a universe itself.<br><br><blockquote><img src="http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y199/xabir/indras_net.jpg"><br><br>The metaphor of Indra's Jeweled Net is attributed to an ancient Buddhist named Tu-Shun (557-640 B.C.E.) who asks us to envision a vast net that:<br><br>* at each juncture there lies a jewel;<br>* each jewel reflects all the other jewels in this cosmic matrix.<br>* Every jewel represents an individual life form, atom, cell or unit of consciousness.<br>* Each jewel, in turn, is intrinsically and intimately connected to all the others;<br>* thus, a change in one gem is reflected in all the others.<br><br>This last aspect of the jeweled net is explored in a question/answer dialog of teacher and student in the Avatamsaka Sutra. In answer to the question: "how can all these jewels be considered one jewel?" it is replied: "If you don't believe that one jewel...is all the jewels...just put a dot on the jewel [in question]. When one jewel is dotted, there are dots on all the jewels...Since there are dots on all the jewels...We know that all the jewels are one jewel" ...".</blockquote>So there are countless universes and each is interlinked. It is not in the form of a subjective and objective world. Now if we say you drop something, it is being reflected in all, and that is what Master Tu Shun is saying. "I do not know how you feel" is subjective and objective division. According to Master Tu Shun, there is no difference. It is a reflection in you and in all, no difference at all. "I feel" and "you feel" are all nodes reflecting. There are nodes, but knowing is true. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
