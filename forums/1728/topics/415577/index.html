              Dhamma Last as Long as my Sons and Grandsons and the Sun and the Moon 
              will be, and may the people follow the path of the Dhamma, for if one

              <p><span style="font-family: comic sans ms; color: #000000; font-size: medium;">Asoka went through a 4 year war of succession after his father's death before recieving the throne. Then,
              			      he started conquering new lands. The turning point came during the war of Kalinga which killed thousands
              			      of people. With feelings of regret, he became a Buddhist convert. </span><span style="font-family: comic sans ms; color: #000000; font-size: medium;">Asoka tried to convert people to Buddhism, as he had done, by leaving messages on rocks in the cities, but didn't force
                 conversion onto anyone. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: comic sans ms; color: #000000; font-size: medium;">Bindusara was 
              succeeded by his son Asoka, the best known of the Maurya emperors (see 
              Asoka). He came to the throne in about 274 and remained in power for 42 
              years. More is known about Asoka's reign because of the many edicts he 
              issued. These were often carved on rocks or pillars in public places.
                 The empire was divided into four provinces, and at the head of each 
              was placed a prince of the royal family. The provinces were subdivided 
              into districts, and these in turn were divided into smaller units. The 
              basic unit of administration was the village. Society was divided into 
              seven castes: philosophers, farmers, soldiers, herdsmen, artisans, 
              magistrates, and councillors. </span><span style="font-family: comic sans ms; color: #000000; font-size: medium;">The philosophers included monks, priests, and teachers. The farmers, herdsmen, and artisans paid taxes to support the empire. </span></p>

              <p>Post from AEN</p>
              <p><strong>KING ASOKA TURNS OVER A NEW LEAF</strong><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">Adapted from the book Â“Buddhist
                                      Tales 1Â” based on the Buddhist sutras<br> Publisher: Jen Chen Buddhist Book Publisher.<br> Author: Shih Ta-Lien.</span><br> <br> <img src="http://www.wat-thaton.org/images/history/ashoka2.jpg" alt="image"><br> <br> One hundred years after BuddhaÂ’s Nirvana (liberation from Birth and
                                      Death), there appeared a great King in India by the name of
                                      Asoka.<br> <br> Asoka means worriless; therefore he was known as both King Asoka
                                      and Worriless King. In his childhood, he was much disliked by his
                                      father for his fiery temper. After the old King died, there came
                                      distressing fights for the throne among these princes. In the end
                                      Prince Asoka succeeded the throne, and only one of his younger
                                      brothers, Tisya, survived from this Cain and AbelÂ’s fight.<br> <br> In his initial years as a king, King Asoka was very arrogant and
                                      pitiless. He destroyed temples, banished Sanghas (Buddhist monastic
                                      community), slandered Buddha and treated his rivals cruelly. In
                                      addition, he took the evil GirikaÂ’s idea to build a huge prison
                                      filled with all sorts of inhumane instruments like the dreadful
                                      Avici Hell of the underworld. There were many different hellish
                                      rooms within the Inhumane Hell. These rooms were fully equipped
                                      with knives, iron-hammers to smash criminalsÂ’ bodies to pieces;
                                      iron-hooks to pull out the criminalsÂ’ tongues; iron-chains to
                                      circle round criminalsÂ’ necks; molten steel to pour into criminalsÂ’
                                      mouths; burning flames and boiling oil to burn criminals to ashes;
                                      pits of urine and manure to drown criminals; iron-swords and the
                                      iron-forks to pierce through the criminalsÂ’ bodies as well as many
                                      other kinds of instruments of torture.<br> <br> <br></p>
