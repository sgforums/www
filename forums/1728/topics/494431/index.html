              life advice from a Zen master</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Kodo Sawaki Roshi WINTER
              2015 tricycle</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Kodo
              Sawaki Roshi [1880–1965], or “Homeless Kodo,” as he came to be known, was one
              of the most influential Soto Zen teachers of the 20th century. Born in 1880 and
              orphaned in early childhood, Sawaki ran away from his caretaker at the age of
              16 to become a monk. Not long after he was ordained, he was drafted into the
              Imperial Japanese Army and served during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05.
              When the war concluded, he returned to his study of Zen, eventually taking
              responsibility of Antaiji Shichikurin Sanzen Dojo in 1949. Sawaki was by no
              means a conventional abbot, however, and instead of attending to administrative
              duties at the temple, he roamed around the country of Japan in order to teach
              zazen [meditation] to laypeople, an endeavor he dubbed the “Moving Monastery.”
              His efforts both earned him the appellation “Homeless” and established him as a
              pioneer of the repopularization of sitting practice within Japan.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">What
              follows is an abridged version of a collection of his sayings, called “To You,”
              which were compiled by Sawaki’s successor, Uchiyama Roshi. Unpublished in full,
              a selection can be found on Antaiji’s website, from which this text was taken.
              It has been translated from the Japanese original by Muho Noelke, the current
              abbot of Antaiji, and Reiho Haasch, a teacher in the lineage.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Sawaki
              is especially known for his nomadic lifestyle and for emphasizing the
              importance of meditation over the study of texts or working with koans. If his
              words here are any indication, however, he must also be remembered for his
              charismatic and direct style of communication, which can sometimes border on
              the irreverent. Are you worried about your career? Fighting with your spouse?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Complaining
              about how busy you are? Homeless Kodo has a piece of advice for you. We just
              can’t guarantee it’s the advice you’ll want to hear.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">1.
              To you who have just begun brooding over life</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              a part of Manchuria, the carts are pulled by huge dogs. The driver hangs a piece
              of meat in front of the dog’s nose, and the dog runs like crazy to try to get
              at it. But of course he can’t. He’s only thrown his meat after the cart has
              finally reached its destination. Then in a single gulp, he swallows it down.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It’s
              exactly the same with people and their paychecks. Until the end of the month
              they run after the salary hanging in front of their noses. Once the salary is
              paid, they gulp it down, and they’re already off: running after the next
              payday. Nobody can see farther than the end of their nose.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              question is: why are you straining your forehead so much?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">If
              you aren’t careful, you’ll spend your whole life doing nothing besides waiting
              for your ordinary-person hopes to someday be fulfilled.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">2.
              To you who can’t stop worrying about how others see you</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">You
              can’t trade even a single fart with the next guy. Each and every one of us has
              to live out his own life. Don’t waste time thinking about who’s most talented.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              eyes don’t say, “Sure we’re lower, but we see more.” The eyebrows don’t reply,
              “Sure we don’t see anything, but we are higher up.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              nose can’t replace the eyes, and the mouth can’t replace the ears.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Everything
              has its own identity, which is unsurpassable in the whole universe.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">3.
              To you who are totally exhausted from fighting with your spouse</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              question isn’t who’s right. You’re simply seeing things from different points
              of view.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It
              all begins when we say “I.” Everything that follows is illusion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Stop
              trying to be something special—just be what you are. Hold fire. Just sit!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">4.
              To you who think there’s something to being “in”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">You’re
              always hanging on to others. If somebody’s eating French fries, you want French
              fries too. If somebody’s sucking on a candy, you want a candy too. If
              somebody’s blowing on a pennywhistle, you scream, “Mommy, buy me a pennywhistle
              too!” And that doesn’t just go for children.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">When
              spring comes, you let spring turn your head. When autumn comes, you let autumn
              turn your head. Everyone is just waiting for something to turn their head. Some
              even make a living turning heads—they produce advertising.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">One
              at a time people are still bearable, but when they form cliques, they start to
              get stupid. They fall into group stupidity.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">We
              live in group stupidity and confuse this insanity with true experience. It is essential
              that you become transparent to yourself and wake up from this madness. Zazen
              means taking leave of the group and walking on your own two feet.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">5.
              To you whose life is about money, money, and more money</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Human
              happiness and unhappiness doesn’t only depend on money. If the balance in your
              savings account were a measure of your happiness, it would be a simple matter.
              Yet it really isn’t so.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Don’t
              be so helpless that you start saying you need money to live. In this world you
              can lead a fine life without savings.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Some
              think they’re important because they have money. Others think they’re important
              because they have “satori” [enlightenment]. But no matter how much you puff up
              your personal sack of flesh, you won’t make yourself into any- thing besides a
              devil.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">That
              which doesn’t belong to you fills the entire universe. Where personal thoughts
              come to an end is where the buddhadharma begins.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">6.
              To you who would like more money, love, status, and fame</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Stupidity
              means being preoccupied with your own body. Wisdom says, “I am what I am, no
              matter how things end up.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Once
              during the war [the Russo-Japanese War, 1904–05] I visited a coal mine. With
              the same outfit and headlamp as the miners, I got into the lift and down we
              went. At one point when we were going down it seemed to me as if suddenly we
              were going up again. But when I looked with the lamp at the wall of the shaft,
              I saw that we were still going down. In the beginning when we were accelerating
              downward, we could really feel that we were going downward. It was only when
              the velocity changed that it seemed to us as if we were going up again. In
              exactly the same way, when we think about our lives, we always go wrong when we
              mistake the fluctuating amounts for the sum.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Losing
              is satori. Winning is illusion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Not
              coveting a single thing is the greatest gift you can give to the universe.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">7.
              To you who would like to leave your rivals in the dust</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">We
              often wonder who here is really better. But aren’t we all made out of the same
              lump of clay?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Everyone
              should sit firmly anchored in the place where there is no better and worse.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Your
              whole life you’re completely out of your mind because you think it’s obvious
              that there is a “you” and “the others.” You put on an act to stand out in a
              crowd, but in reality there’s neither “you” nor “the others.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Buddhadharma
              means seamlessness. What seam runs between you and me? Sooner or later we all
              end up acting as if a seam separates friend and foe. When we get too used to
              this, we believe that this seam really exists.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Poor
              and rich, important and unimportant—none of that exists. It’s only glitter on
              the waves.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">8.
              To you who are sobbing because somebody’s put one over on you</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">All
              beings are mistaken: we see as happiness that which leads to unhappiness, and
              weep over an unhappiness which isn’t unhappiness at all. We all know the child
              whose tears suddenly turn into laughter when you give him a cookie. What we
              living beings call happiness isn’t much more than that.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">At
              some point you’ve got to slap yourself in the face and seriously ask yourself:
              is your personal gain or loss really worth this overwhelming joy and suffering?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Sooner
              or later everyone starts thinking of nothing besides themselves. You say, “That
              was good!” But what was good? It was only good for you personally, that’s all.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">A
              person with big desires is easily fooled. Even the greatest con man can’t
              profit from a person with no desires.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Buddhism
              means no self, nothing to gain.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">9.
              To you who are tumbling down the career ladder</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">When
              you’re dead and you look back at your life, you’ll see that none of this
              mattered in the least.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Fortune
              and misfortune, good and bad—not everything is how it looks to your eyes. It’s
              not how you think it is either. We’ve got to go beyond fortune and misfortune,
              good and bad.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Suffering
              is nothing more than the suffering we create for ourselves.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">10.
              To you who are complaining all the time that you haven’t got any time</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Everybody
              complains that they’re so busy they haven’t got any time. But why are they so
              busy? It’s only their illusions that keep them busy. A person who practices
              zazen has time. When you practice zazen, you have more time than anyone else in
              the world.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">If
              you aren’t careful, you’ll start making a big fuss just to feed yourself.
              You’re constantly in a hurry, but why? Just to feed yourself. Chickens too are
              in a hurry when they peck at their food. But why? Only to be eaten by humans.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">How
              many illusions does a person create in their lifetime? It’s impossible to
              calculate. Day in, day out, “I want this, I want that . . .” Just a single
              stroll in the park is accompanied by incalculable illusions. So that’s what it
              means to be “busy.” “I want to be with you, I want to come home, I want to see
              you. . . .”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">People
              are constantly out of breath— from running so quickly after their illusions.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">11.
              To you who wish you could lead a happier life</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Rest
              awhile and everything will be fine. We simply need to take a short break. Being
              buddha means taking a short break from being a human. Being buddha doesn’t mean
              working your way up as a human.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“What
              sort of person stands on the ground where there’s neither coming nor going?”
              Kyuho answered, “The stone sheep versus the stone tiger: sooner or later
              they’ll get tired of staring each other in the eyes.” The stone sheep won’t
              flinch. The stone tiger won’t jump out of hunger. That’s the point—encountering
              things beyond thinking.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">What
              do we have when we truly have a grip on things as they are? Beyond-thinking
              [hishiryo]. Beyond-thinking doesn’t allow itself to be thought. No matter if
              you think so or not: things are simply as they are.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“All
              things are empty” means there’s nothing we can run into, because nothing is
              really happening. Nothing is ever happening, no matter what seems to be going
              on—that’s the natural condition. Illusion means losing this natural condition.
              Normally we don’t recognize this natural condition. Normally we cover it with
              something else, so it’s not natural anymore.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              buddhadharma means the natural condition.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">To
              practice the way of Buddha means to completely live out this present
              moment—which is our whole life—here and now.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">12.
              To you who want to study a little Buddhism to improve yourself</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“Empty
              theories” is what we call it when bystanders play around with terminology.
              Playing around like that is good for nothing. Dive in with body and soul!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">You’ve
              got to die completely in order to be able to reflect on the buddhadharma. It
              isn’t enough to torture yourself and only die halfway.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">13.
              To you who say that Buddhism doesn’t have anything to do with you</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">When
              you talk about Buddha, you’re thinking of something far away that’s got nothing
              to do with you, and that’s why you’re only running around in circles.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Ordinary
              people and buddhas have the same form. Awakening and illusion have the same
              form.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">When
              we practice the buddhadharma, we are buddha. Or better yet, it is precisely
              because we are buddha already that we can practice the buddhadharma.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">You
              believe that Buddhism is a little different from everything else. But it’s not
              like that at all: Buddhism is each and every thing.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">14.
              To you who are wondering if your zazen has been good for something</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">What’s
              zazen good for? Absolutely nothing! This “good for nothing” has got to sink
              into your flesh and bones until you’re truly practicing what’s good for
              nothing. Until then, your zazen really is good for nothing.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">You
              say you want to become a better person by doing zazen. Zazen isn’t about
              learning how to be a person. Zazen is to stop being a person.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">You
              say, “When I do zazen, I get disturbing thoughts!” Foolish! The fact is that
              it’s only in zazen that you’re aware of your disturbing thoughts at all. When
              you dance around with your disturbing thoughts, you don’t notice them at all.
              When a mosquito bites you during zazen, you notice it right away. But when
              you’re dancing and a flea bites your balls, you don’t notice it at all.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Don’t
              whine. Don’t stare into space. Just sit!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">15.
              To you who are out of your mind trying so hard to attain peace of mind</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">You
              lack peace of mind because you’re running after an idea of total peace of mind.
              That’s backwards. Be attentive to your mind in each moment, no matter how
              unpeaceful it might seem to be. Great peace of mind is realized only in the
              practice within this unpeaceful mind.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">When
              dissatisfaction is finally accepted as dissatisfaction, peace of mind reigns.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">16.
              To you who say that you have attained a better state of mind through zazen</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">As
              long as you say zazen is a good thing, something isn’t quite right. Unstained
              zazen is absolutely nothing special. It isn’t even necessary to be grateful for
              it. . . . Don’t stain your zazen by saying that you’ve progressed, feel better,
              or have become more confident through zazen.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">We
              only say, “Things are going well!” when they’re going our way.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">We
              should simply leave the water of our original nature as it is. But instead we
              are constantly mucking about with our hands to find out how cold or warm it is.
              That’s why it gets cloudy.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Zazen
              isn’t like a thermometer where the temperature slowly rises: “Just a little
              more . . . yeah . . . that’s it! Now I’ve got satori!” Zazen never becomes
              anything special, no matter how long you practice. If it becomes something
              special, you must have a screw loose somewhere.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">17.
              To you who are aiming at the ultimate way of life</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">What’s
              the buddhadharma about? It’s about having every aspect of your daily life
              pulled by Buddha.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              basis of all actions is to follow through to the end. If your mind is absent
              even just for a moment, you’re no different from a corpse.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Practice
              means asking with your whole being the question “What can I do right now for
              the Buddha way?”</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It
              isn’t enough to hit the bull’s-eye once. Last year’s perfect marks are useless.
              You’ve got to hit the bull’s-eye right now.</span></p>
