              Two questions:
              
              (1) Buddhism &amp; Vegetarianism
              This is what I understand: during Buddha's time, Buddha did not specifically dictate his followers to abstain from taking meat, although it is clear from the 5 precepts that thou shall not kill or harm living things. Later on, followers in the Theravada tradition in general do consume meat while those in the Mahayana do not. 
              My question is: Theravada and Mahayana traditions notwithstanding, if you were to make a judgement based on your personal understanding of Buddhism, should Buddhists consume meat? There is no right or wrong answer since there is no definite Buddhist teachings (definite yes or no) on this.
              
              (2) Kamma &amp; Enlightenment
              Kamma is about cause and effect, i.e., A leads to B, where A is what the person did/does/will be doing and B is the outcome from A. Enlightenment is about the cessation of suffering through the thorough understanding and practice of the noble eightfold path. 
              My question is: If a person has bad kamma as a result of the bad things done in the past, but he has a thorough understanding and diligently practise the noble eightfold path perfectly in the present life, can he achieve enlightenment in this present life, notwithstanding the yet-to-be manifested bad kamma?

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>1) Buddhist can consume meat as long as they are not killed, not asked to be killed, its killing is not witnessed by you. i.e. frozen meat</p>
              <p>Some Mahayana sutras recommend vegetarian as part of bodhisattva practices. Vajrayana and tantras however permit meat. And of course Theravada as you mentioned, does not teach vegetarianism.</p>
              <p>2) Of course he can, provided he has not committed the five grave sins (hurting buddha, killing arahant, killing parents, causing dissension in sangha). Check out the story of Angulimala, who actually killed almost a thousand men, but later became an arahant after being converted by Buddha.</p>

              <p>Its interesting though that the Buddha in the Pali Canon seems to suggest that the five grave deeds prevent awakening. Late Mahayana sutras and Vajrayana tantras however suggests skillful methods that allow such beings, including the icchantikas, to awaken or seek rebirth in pure lands. I have some skepticism of this as I shall explain below.</p>
              <p>In DN 2, the Blessed One addressed the monks: "The king is wounded, monks. The king is incapacitated. Had he not killed his father — that righteous man, that righteous king — the dustless, stainless Dhamma eye would have arisen to him as he sat in this very seat."</p>
              <p>According to the Digha Commentary, (i.237-8) that king AjÄ�tasattu was born in the Lohakumbhiya niraya (niraya = hell) after his death. He will suffer there for 60,000 years, and later will reach nibbana as a Pacceka Buddha named Viditavisesa (VijitÄ�vÄ«). AjÄ�tasattu’s crime of parricide is often given as an example of an upacchedaka-kamma which has the power of destroying the effect of meritorious deeds (E.g., AA.i.369). He is also mentioned as the worst kind of parricide (E.g. AA.i.335).</p>
              <p>If this were true, this makes me wonder, why had Buddha, being someone of utmost compassion, wisdom and skillful means, not taught any method (if there were any at all) for his faithful student king AjÄ�tasattu - admittedly someone who had the potential to attain stream entry had he not killed his father, so that he may awaken or at least avoid a rebirth in the lower realm? It is reasonable that the Buddha would have taught something if he knew in his omniscience that it could help his student prevent 60,000 years of suffering in hell.</p>
              <p>Since the Buddha did not teach any methods to him in the original suttas, it would therefore seem that it is reasonable to say that someone who has committed the five heinous sins are indeed as Parikuppa Sutta puts it: incurable, and are destined for rebirth in hell. (at least for the long time he has to spend in hell)</p>

No help from outside is able to mitigate the sufferings they will endure in hell, and thus they are said to be incurable. Only when the results of these deeds have worked themselves out will they be released from hell. Even if they return to the human plane, they will continue to suffer the consequences of their deeds. For example, Ven. Moggallana, one of the Buddha's foremost disciples, killed his parents many aeons ago, and the results of that deed pursued him even through his final lifetime, when he was beaten to death.</em><br><br>"There are these five inhabitants of the states of deprivation, inhabitants of hell, who are in agony &amp; incurable. Which five? One who has killed his/her mother, one who has killed his/her father, one who has killed an arahant, one who — with a corrupted mind — has caused the blood of a Tathagata to flow, and one who has caused a split in the Sangha.

              1)Do you eat just for sustenance only, or do you still crave for this food or that when you'll are hungry?! Probably there is still room for further contemplation!

              <p>i got a friend who is like this but also believe in fengshui and chi energy (the unseen forces which are not so scentific proven).</p>
              <p>i would tell him that i believe that the meat he eat also contain a form of resentment chi. the resentment chi is produce when the animal is killed. that resentment chi will effect the quality of the meat. :)</p>
              <p>in Mahayana Buddhism, there's something known as "collective" karma.</p>

              <p>becoming vegetarian is one of the most important and effective actions you can take to ease the strain on our Earth's limited resources, protect the planet from pollution, prevent global warming, and save countless species from extinction.</p>
              <p>According to Dr. David Brubaker, PhD, at Johns Hopkins University's Center for a Livable Future, "The way that we breed animals for food is a threat to the planet. It pollutes our environment while consuming huge amounts of water, grain, petroleum, pesticides and drugs. The results are disastrous." </p>

              <p>I think it depends on which area. If there are too many vegetarian stalls in one area, it tends to close down fast. There's only one vegetarian stall near my place. The stall is doing very good business. The queue is long almost every day. The queue is so long that the next stall owner is not happy and keep telling the customers not to obstruct his stall doing business. At least I see some improvements compare to many years ago where there are fewer vegetarian stalls.</p>
              <p>There are many vegetarian stalls at Bukit Batok and they are close to each other but every vegetarian stalls is doing good business. I think the business depends on whether does the cook can cook well.</p>
              <p>There's a very good vegetarian restaurant at Quality Hotel in Balestier. They have good vegetarian buffet during weekends and the price is also reasonable. There are many people who turn to vegetarian food because of health and not religion.</p>

              <p>Its interesting though that the Buddha in the Pali Canon seems to suggest that the five grave deeds prevent awakening. Late Mahayana sutras and Vajrayana tantras however suggests skillful methods that allow such beings, including the icchantikas, to awaken or seek rebirth in pure lands. I have some skepticism of this as I shall explain below.</p>
              <p>In DN 2, the Blessed One addressed the monks: "The king is wounded, monks. The king is incapacitated. Had he not killed his father — that righteous man, that righteous king — the dustless, stainless Dhamma eye would have arisen to him as he sat in this very seat."</p>
              <p>According to the Digha Commentary, (i.237-8) that king AjÄ�tasattu was born in the Lohakumbhiya niraya (niraya = hell) after his death. He will suffer there for 60,000 years, and later will reach nibbana as a Pacceka Buddha named Viditavisesa (VijitÄ�vÄ«). AjÄ�tasattu’s crime of parricide is often given as an example of an upacchedaka-kamma which has the power of destroying the effect of meritorious deeds (E.g., AA.i.369). He is also mentioned as the worst kind of parricide (E.g. AA.i.335).</p>
              <p>If this were true, this makes me wonder, why had Buddha, being someone of utmost compassion, wisdom and skillful means, not taught any method (if there were any at all) for his faithful student king AjÄ�tasattu - admittedly someone who had the potential to attain stream entry had he not killed his father, so that he may awaken or at least avoid a rebirth in the lower realm? It is reasonable that the Buddha would have taught something if he knew in his omniscience that it could help his student prevent 60,000 years of suffering in hell.</p>
              <p>Since the Buddha did not teach any methods to him in the original suttas, it would therefore seem that it is reasonable to say that someone who has committed the five heinous sins are indeed as Parikuppa Sutta puts it: incurable, and are destined for rebirth in hell. (at least for the long time he has to spend in hell)</p>

              <p><br>Hi, just to share my views.</p>
              <p>I'm not sure for Vajrayana part... but as for Mahayana Pureland, I learnt that one needs to repent sincerely for his grave negative karma... including the 5 heinous deeds.</p>
              <p>As long as he repents, he can be reborn in Pureland but will take very long... lowest grade.</p>
              <p>For King AjÄ�tasattu, what I know is that he did went to hell but suffer for a short time only. After that he immediately rose to the deva realms... I didn't know he was stuck there for as long as 60,000 years.</p>

              <p>In the Suttas, Mogallana recounted having spent a very very long time in the hells.
              Even King Ajatasattu is said to be able to become a paccekabuddha after finishing his 60000 years in hell, according to Digha commentary.
              So when Buddha said that doers of the five heinous deeds are "incurable" it doesn't mean "eternal". It just means incurable for that very very long length of time.</p>

              <p>It is interesting. I thought pure land buddhism states that those who commit the five deadly sins can be born in the lowest of the lowest grade, but I'm not sure how they can achieve that birth. But nice that you found the quotation with regards to the 5 deadly sins. I have long suspected this is so.</p>

              <p><strong> <br>All forms are illusions<br>Rebirth in the Pure Land is only possible through pure karma</strong><br><br><br>    <br>The Pure Land School of Buddhism advocates that when people die, they bring with them the karma that they had committed to be reborn in the Western Pure Land. This led to a lively debate on the subject. Some people argued that it means that regardless of the virtuous or evil karma [1] that one has committed, a person only needs to wholeheartedly recite “Amitabha Budhha” to the extent that he resonates with the power of the Amitabha Buddha’s vow, then he will be reborn in the Western Pure Land.<br><br>On the other hand, others advocated that people must bring with them virtuous karma in order to be reborn in the Western Pure Land, but not when they bring evil karma. Yet, others advocated that a person cannot be reborn in the Western Pure Land as long as he has karma and rebirth in the Pure Land can occur only when all the karma have been eliminated.<br><br>In reality, all people will be reborn according to their karma. The kinds of karma and the corresponding realms of rebirth are as follows:<br><br>    Karma of extreme evil leads one to be reborn in the hell realm<br>    Karma of ignorance and foolishness lead one to be reborn in the animal realm<br>    Karma of superstition leads one to be reborn in the ghosts and deities realm<br>    Blessings of observing the Five Precepts lead one to be reborn in the human realm<br>    Blessings of performing the Ten Virtuous Deeds lead one to be reborn in the heaven realm<br>    Actions or karma from hatred, anger and fighting lead one to be reborn in the asura realm<br><br>These are called “rebirth according to one’s karma”.<br><br>To be reborn in the Western Pure Land requires pure karma. Besides the pure karma, rebirth in the Western Pure Land is not possible at all with whatever kinds of virtuous and evil karma. Therefore, there is no basis to speak of rebirth in the Western Pure Land and then returning to this Saha world to bear the retribution of the karma that they had committed. Only the Bodhisattava, with the power of his vow, can return to this Saha world.<br><br>Notes:<br><br>[1] karma: A deed or action (either positive or negative; intentional or unintentional) of our thoughts, speech or body and its consequences. These consequences may manifest immediately or at any time in the future. Positive karma will generate pleasant consequences and vice-versa.</p>

                  however suggests skillful methods that allow such beings, including
                  the icchantikas, to awaken or seek rebirth in pure lands. I have
                  some skepticism of this as I shall explain
                  below.</span></span></em></p>
              <p><span>Thought one of the 48 Great Vows of Amitabha
                  Buddha states that:</span></p>
              <p><span>“Provided I become a Buddha, if the beings of the
                  ten quarters who after having heard my name, and thus awakened
                  their highest faith and aspiration of re-birth in that country of
                  mine, even they have recollected such a thought for ten times only,
                  they are destined to <span>be born there, <em><span style="color: #1f497d;"><span style="color: #003366;">(with the exception of those who have committed
                  the five deadly sins (Anantarya),</span></span></em></span> <span style="color: #003366;"><em><span style="color: #1f497d;">and have blasphemed the orthodox law
                  (Dharma)</span></em>;</span> otherwise may I not attain the
                  enlightenment”.</span></p>
              <p><span>Wouldn’t it mean those who have committed the
                  five deadly sins and those icchantikas who have blasphemed the
                  Dharma would not be allowed to seek rebirth in the pure
                  lands?</span></p>

              <p>it's a very common question in PL school. Contemplation Sutra
                  <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, 'bitstream vera sans', clean, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">of Amitayus</span> had already proven that Prince Ajatashatru even through commited most of the deadly sins and slandered the right Dharma, but at the end of his life repented and practiced wholeheartedly also was reborn in PL, and in the medium upper grade some more!</p>
              <p>our 13th Patriach Yin Guang in his early stage of Buddhism also slandered and disbelieve in PL method, in the later stage of life also wholeheartedly believed in PL method. same goes with Master Chin Kung, in his early stage also disbelieve.   </p>
              <p>the most important factor is not too much on the deadly sins but more on the "<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;"> </span><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">blasphemed the Dharma" . it mean that one had NO faith in the Right dharma. and in PL, faith is very important. without faith, one is not possible to reborn in PL. but if one re-</span><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">established the faith, then things changes. but of coz, the deadly sins is more to do with karma obstruction or conscience.</span></span></p>
