              <p>Below represents my current understanding of the path,other than slight modifications,none of the words below are mine (just copy and paste)  :-)</p>
              <p>******************</p>
              <p>Surrender. It is easily one of the most important aspects of spirituality. It is synonymous with letting go and allowing. The hallmark of surrender is the giving up of resistance. It’s a being transparent to energy that is passing through you.</p>
              <p>If surrender is so important, what is it, really?</p>
              <p>The traditional sense of surrender includes a sense of loss and defeat, a place of weakness and inability, a choice to end the experience and exit the journey. In a spiritual context, surrender means something very different. It’s something applied while fully engaged with the experience rather than an end to it.</p>
              <p>
              </p><p><em>
              </em></p><p><em>"What is the secret of your serenity?" asked a student. "Wholehearted cooperation with the inevitable." said the Master.</em></p><em>
              -Anthony DeMello</em><p></p>
              <p></p>
              <p>"<em> Realize deeply that the present moment is all you ever have. Make the Now the primary focus of your life. Whereas before you dwelt in time and paid brief visits to the Now, have your dwelling place in the Now and pay brief visits to past and future when required to deal with the practical aspects of your life situation. Always say "yes" to the present moment. What could be more futile, more insane, than to create inner resistance to something that already is? What could be more insane than to oppose life itself, which is now and always now? Surrender to what is. Say "yes" to life — and see how life suddenly starts working for you rather than against you</em>. " -Eckhart Tolle</p>
              <p>Surrender basically boils down to a complete acceptance to life as it is in the moment ,creating a space for non-dual experience to arise.It’s more than just an intellectual acceptance, but a true acceptance that permeates your entire being.</p>
              <p>Surrender is total internal non-resistance.Through non-resistance and allowing, the chain of dualistic bond will be loosen and weaken.</p>
              <p>What is the deepest result of complete and total surrender?</p>

              <p>Non-duality is the realization of no observer-observed.
                  
                  Even while resistance is happening, there is no doer, or observer of resistance. It is simply what IS. Even resistance is allowed at that moment, because there is no separate self at the center who can avoid what IS manifesting at that moment. There is always only manifestation, which includes resistance, or whatever is appearing at that moment. In short, acceptance is not something you 'do' - everything is always already allowed because everything is simply unavoidable and undeniably present at that moment and there is no one who can escape what presents itself at the moment.</p>

              <p>From my experience, there are more than one depth of non-duality.</p>
              <p>The first initial one is like all the subject and object collapsed onto a 'flatness' screen.</p>
              <p>The second one is penetrating all the visions and perceptions to reveal a depth... but this depth is not the same as the conventional space before the first non-dual. This second non-duality is 'transparent' with a clarity as if the pixels of colours are penetrated into. Here... it can feel as if one has never existed at all.</p>

              <p>Happy New Year ... sorry for the late reply.</p>
              <p>Will like to add that, in my experience, no-self is a more subtle insight than non-duality.</p>
              <p>Usually, we see a continuity of mental formation... well... my experience is that it is not always so. The streams of thought seems to be linear but it is not.. To my experience, it is the fast movement of thoughts that give the impression of continuity of self.</p>
              <p>Now... thoughts can appear and disappear and they do not have to be linear... 'Simpo' the name pop up and dissapear... another image appears and dissapears... all of them are not self... just appearance, sensations, etc... and we cannot say they arise from a base or sink into the base. There is no base (as far as i see it)... just this ungraspable appearing and dissappearing.</p>

              <p>Right now im seriously inquire into the practice of 'direct experience' ; i.e ..entering into nondual.</p>
              <p>and i feel (suspect)the stages of insight that i've read(self-realization,non dual,anatta sunyyata...)need not be linear ,they can unfold in unpredictable ways ....</p>
              <p>the most important thing is to keep letting go of the 'mind' , 'dualistic consciousness',and experiencing experience nakedly,totally.</p>
              <p>zen buddhism,with it's way(method) of pointing to what we can actually experience,rather than in conceptual mind,seems very appealing to me.</p>
              <p>come across this site <a href="http://www.wwzc.org(thanks">www.wwzc.org</a> (have to thanks AEN ,it's frm his article in Awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com that i discover link to the site),many many good articles pointing to the way we can direct experience sensations as it is,so that the mind can bcome clearer(uncluttered),and this wiil serve as potent condition for insight(seeing things as they really are)to arise.</p>

              <p>Want to add... when we drop the story and ground ourselves in the bare actuality of sensations themselves, all we feel are sensations of bodily contractions, that is all. More accurately, we don't 'feel' sensations, we are the sensations themselves revealing its vivid clarity.</p>
              <p>That is all resistance is when we rest in non-dual luminosity... clear bodily sensations arising and passing away. Let them manifest and dissolve on its own accord. Resistance thus reveal its essence and nature as mind itself, an effervescent luminescence.</p>

              <p><strong>Yes AEN, you are beginning to experience what that is known in
                                          the Advaita Vedanta as ‘Atman’ except that the experiences you had
                                          did not lead to you to the wrong conclusion.  This is because
                                          the doctrine of anatta has sunk sufficiently deep in your inmost
                                          consciousness.  Although the 'teaching of anatta' helps to
                                          prevent you from landing into wrong views, the downside is it also
                                          denies you from experiencing that deep and utimate conviction,
                                          that certainty beyond doubt of your very own existence -- "I
                                          AM'.  This is a very important factor for Advaita
                                          practitioners.</strong></p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>The next important factor is the duration of this non-dual
                                          experience must be prolonged; long enough for you to enter
                                          into a sort of absorption that the experience becomes
                                          'oceanic'. </strong></p>
              <p><em><br></em></p>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p><em>Me: Then how about for a Buddhist, does he need to experience " that
                                          deep and utimate conviction, that certainty beyond doubt of your
                                          very own existence -- "I AM'."?</em></p>

              <p><strong>Yes it is still important (in my opinion).  It is the
                                          experience of our luminosity.  There must be certainty of our
                                          luminosity but this luminosity is empty of an essence. 
                                          This is most difficult to understand and the purpose of insight
                                          into our emptiness and anatta nature (to me) is really just about

              <p><strong>The next important factor is the duration of this non-dual experience must be prolonged; long enough for you to enter into a sort of absorption that the experience becomes 'oceanic'.</strong></p>

              <p>The Certainty of Being gives rise to a conviction about the immediate Beingness or pure luminosity of Being. Because this is not an experience, but a clear realization/insight into the luminous essence of Being, it does not fade - luminosity never fades, luminosity can never be lost and is ever-present. Whether thought/memory arise or not - the undeniability of Beingness is still present. Whether you want to remember or not - its there, it is inescapable.</p>
              <p>Non-dual experience can simply be an experience without realization/insight. So here is the difference.</p>
              <p>Mindfulness and letting go can lead to non-dual experiences, self-inquiry/koans/etc lead to self-realization.</p>
              <p>Self-inquiry in my experience is not an attention-based practice, which will then be contrived.</p>
              <p>You are not focusing your attention on something - on a feeling, a sensation, an experience, whatsoever. Rather, you are investigating - you are finding out what you truly are. What am I, truly?</p>
              <p>So you are actually going to 'discover' something that is undeniably present already - you are not trying to reach or sustain an experience, you are simply going to discover what is already present.</p>

              <p>Surrender. It is easily one of the most important aspects of
              spirituality. It is synonymous with letting go and allowing. The
              hallmark of surrender is the giving up of resistance. It’s a being
              transparent to energy that is passing through you.</p>
              <p>If surrender is so important, what is it, really?</p>
              <p>The traditional sense of surrender includes a sense of loss and
              defeat, a place of weakness and inability, a choice to end the
              experience and exit the journey. In a spiritual context, surrender
              means something very different. It’s something applied while fully
              engaged with the experience rather than an end to it.</p>
              <p><em>"What is the secret of your serenity?" asked a student.
              "Wholehearted cooperation with the inevitable." said the
              Master.</em></p>
              <p>-Anthony DeMello</p>
              <p>" <em>Realize deeply that the present moment is all you ever
              have. Make the Now the primary focus of your life. Whereas before
              you dwelt in time and paid brief visits to the Now, have your
              dwelling place in the Now and pay brief visits to past and future
              when required to deal with the practical aspects of your life
              situation. Always say "yes" to the present moment. What could be
              more futile, more insane, than to create inner resistance to
              something that already is? What could be more insane than to oppose
              life itself, which is now and always now? Surrender to what is. Say
              "yes" to life — and see how life suddenly starts working for you
              rather than against you</em>. " -Eckhart Tolle</p>
              <p>Surrender basically boils down to a complete acceptance to life
              as it is in the moment ,creating a space for non-dual experience to
              arise.It’s more than just an intellectual acceptance, but a true
              acceptance that permeates your entire being.</p>
              <p>Surrender is total internal non-resistance.Through
              non-resistance and allowing, the chain of dualistic bond will be
              loosen and weaken.</p>
              <p>What is the deepest result of complete and total surrender?</p>

              <p>when you need to take a shit real badly, can you surrender your body? if not, then all these questions revolving the attained state of surrender is irrelevant for you, the only being who are answer your question without making any mistake is buddha.</p>
              <p>so stop worrying about what is it like if you can totally disregard whether your body need to ex-cremate or not. Work with what you have now, whenever your body needs to command your mind, observe and study the fight. </p>

              <p>One more thing: luminosity, beingness is not a feeling.</p>
              <p>You cannot feel beingness. Why? 'Feeling beingness' implies there is a 'you' separate from 'beingness', a 'you' that can sometimes feel, sometimes perceive, and sometimes not perceive beingness. Because of a perceived separation you will always have the illusory sense of 'losing' or 'gaining' presence-awareness. It is like thinking 'oh I used to have it but now I don't' even while reality is shining in plain view in its immediacy - you simply overlooked it in favour of a false concept that you 'felt' it before but now you don't. In actuality reality never is an experience to be 'felt' - it is simply overlooked, maybe recognised at times, but due to lack of realization, the habits/ignorance of duality manifest and you then project a sense of separation again and there goes the 'I got it, I lost it' drama - but that is all illusory projections that stops arising after realization, and so the tendency is to rest naturally in the natural state (which isn't a state but the undeniable beingness).</p>
              <p>Such a dichotomy is false, it is non-existent. There is no 'you' who can perceive or not perceive 'beingness'.</p>
              <p>Why? You ARE that self-shining, self-knowing presence-awareness. Presence is aware by nature, and awareness is present by nature. Presence and awareness is one.</p>
              <p>Self-shining, self-knowing presence-awareness cannot be approached by 'feeling' because there never was a subject-object dichotomy present. So you don't come to know/feel/see presence, but presence is self-felt, self-known, self-evident by its nature (but overlooked due to our ignorance).</p>
              <p>Even if you had a so called 'strong feeling of presence' (which I often have even before the realization of I AM), if you do not realize non-separation, if you do not realize your non-dual nature as presence-awareness, you will be forever deluded even in the face of reality.</p>
              <p>As Presence-Awareness cannot be approached by feeling, it can only be discovered, realized, as an ever-present, undeniable fact of existence, more undeniable and more intimate than your own nose. You don't need to remember your own existence or try to feel your own existence - these attempts are seen to be ridiculous much like the attempt to search for your horse elsewhere while riding in it, or looking all around for your eyes with your eyes - because you never were apart from existence, you ARE existence, undeniably present in its immediacy. You simply need to realize that all along, you were riding on your horse, all along, you ARE pure presence awareness and there is no need to focus your attention on it, try to remember it, try to feel it, and all those nonsense.</p>
