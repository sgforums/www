              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Whether they are
              savants who can paint a masterpiece blindfolded in seconds, geniuses who can
              calculate numbers only a computer could, or regular people who can remember
              every single detail of their lives down to the date and time, humans with
              special abilities seem to be abundant in society. But special abilities go far
              beyond what many savants are doing today, and science has been studying these
              abilities for decades, despite the fact that the results are not always
              emphasized by mainstream academia. Below are a few of many examples that will
              make you stop and question what you think you know.</span></p>
              <h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #00ccff;'>Ingo Swann &amp; Remote Viewing</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #161616;'></span></h3>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Remote viewing is
              the ability of a person to describe a remote geographical location up to
              several hundred thousand kilometers from their actual physical location. It’s
              not just one person who can do this, but multiple human beings can and this is
              a verified fact. The CIA and NSA, in conjunction with Stanford University, were
              involved in the scientific study of parapsychological phenomena that that
              lasted more than two decades, which also included remote viewing.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In these
              experiments, multiple individuals were able to describe distinct objects that
              were located in a separate room, and at other remote physical locations from
              where their body was not.(</span><a href="http://www.researchgate.net/publication/237282216_CIA-Initiated_Remote_Viewing_Program_at_Stanford_Research_Institute"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #23a9e1;">source 1</span></a><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">)(</span><a href="http://www.lfr.org/lfr/csl/library/AirReport.pdf"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #23a9e1;">source 2</span></a><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">)(</span><a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~pear/pdfs/1979-precognitive-remote-viewing-stanford.pdf"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #23a9e1;">source 3</span></a><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">)</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It’s kind of like
              projecting your consciousness outside of your body to another location that is,
              again, away from your current physical location.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">As reported by a
              publication in the Journal </span><em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">Scientific
              Exploration, </span></em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">one of the study’s
              participants, Ingo Swann, was able to successfully describe and view a ring
              around Jupiter that scientists had no idea existed at the time. (</span><a href="http://www.researchgate.net/publication/237282216_CIA-Initiated_Remote_Viewing_Program_at_Stanford_Research_Institute"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #23a9e1;">source 1</span></a><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">) Ingo has gone on to write about remote viewing the
              moon and other strange anomalies within the realm of parapsychology.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Remote viewing was
              actually used by intelligence agencies, which is why they spent large amounts
              of money, time, and years<span> </span></span><a href="http://www.collective-evolution.com/2014/08/09/scientists-observe-man-travel-out-of-his-body-and-into-space-what-he-saw-was-remarkable/"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #23a9e1;">investing in the program</span></a><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">. Who knows what information still remains classified
              from it?</span></p>
              <h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #00ccff;'>Uri Geller &amp; Psychokinesis</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #161616;'></span></h3>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Another great
              example comes from the work of professional aerospace engineer and physicist
              Jack Houck. He, alongside Army Colonel J.B. Alexander, was responsible for
              holding a number of sessions to test the validity of psychokinesis (moving
              objects with the mind). In these sessions, attendees were taught how to
              initiate their own PK events using various metal objects. Individuals were able
              to completely bend or contort their metal specimens with no physical force
              being applied whatsoever. (</span><a href="http://www.jackhouck.com/pdf_files/pk_materials_format.pdf"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #23a9e1;">source</span></a><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">)(</span><a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/eprint/teleport.pdf"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #23a9e1;">source</span></a><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">)</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">There have also
              been reports of individuals (mostly children) being able to “teleport” full
              physical objects from one location to another. (</span><a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/eprint/teleport.pdf"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #23a9e1;">source</span></a><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">)</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">One notable
              individual was Psychic Uri Geller, who, during a talk he gave at the U.S.
              Capitol building, caused a spoon to curve upward with no force applied. The
              spoon then continued to bend after he put it back down and resumed speaking. (</span><a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/eprint/teleport.pdf"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #23a9e1;">source</span></a><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">)</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Regardless of
              whether you think this is a hoax, or question the validity of what happened
              with Uri Geller, the fact that consciousness has some sort of measurable affect
              on our physical material world is now, at least some scientists believe, firmly
              established in scientific literature.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The<span> </span></span><a href="http://www.collective-evolution.com/2015/06/03/how-is-this-possible-scientists-observe-one-particle-exist-in-multiple-states/"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #23a9e1;">quantum double

              one great example out of many. Although science has observe these types of
              phenomenon, it can’t explain it yet. Perhaps</span><a href="http://www.collective-evolution.com/2015/05/03/quantum-entanglement-verified-why-space-is-just-the-construct-that-gives-the-illusion-of-separate-objects/"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #23a9e1;">quantum
              entanglement</span></a><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"> </span></span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">has
              something to do with it?</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">For a selected
              list of downloadable peer-reviewed journal articles reporting studies of this
              type of phenomena, mostly published in the 21<sup>st</sup><span> </span>century, you can click</span><a href="http://deanradin.com/evidence/evidence.htm"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #23a9e1;">HERE</span></a><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">.</span></p>
              <h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #00ccff;'>Stephen Wiltshire</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #161616;'></span></h3>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Stephen Wiltshire,
              diagnosed with autism at the age of 3, is an artist who draws and paints
              detailed cityscapes. He’s most known for his ability to observe accurate
              representations of cities for seconds, and then depict them with remarkable
              precision.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Below is a video
              of Wiltshire drawing the Singapore skyline from memory.</span></p>
              <h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #00ccff;'>Wim Hof aka “Iceman”</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #161616;'></span></h3>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Wim Hof raised the
              eyebrows of many scientists after he was able to use meditation to stay
              submerged in ice for almost two hours without his core body temperature
              changing one bit. This is remarkable, and adds to the growing body of evidence
              that points to the important role consciousness plays in our body’s
              reaction to certain situations/ailments.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Since Wim was able
              to successfully maintain his core body temperature in such a harsh environment,
              he’s since gone on to climb Mount Everest in his shorts, resist altitude
              sickness, complete a marathon in the Namib Desert with no water, and proven
              under a laboratory setting that he’s able to influence his autonomic nervous
              system and immune system at will.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Almost everything
              this man has done was thought to be impossible by most. Below is a documentary
              done on Wim by VICE news if you are interested.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Listen to the
              Podcast we did with Wim<span> </span></span><a href="https://soundcloud.com/gandcoletti/wimhof"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #23a9e1;">HERE</span></a><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">.</span></p>
              <h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #00ccff;'>Buddhist Monks</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #161616;'></span></h3>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">During a visit to
              remote monasteries in the 1980s, Harvard professor of medicine Herbert Benson
              and his team of researchers studied monk living in the Himalayan Mountains who
              could, by g Tum-mo ( yoga technique), raise the temperatures of their fingers and
              toes by as much as 17 degrees. This is very significant, and it’s still unknown
              how the monks are able to generate such heat. (</span><a href="http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/2002/04.18/09-tummo.html"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #23a9e1;">source</span></a><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">)</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It doesn’t stop
              there, the researchers also studied advanced meditators in Sikkim, India, where
              they were astonished to find that these monks could lower their metabolism by
              64 percent.(<a href="http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/2002/04.18/09-tummo.html"><span style="color: #23a9e1;">source</span></a>)</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In 1985, the Harvard
              research team made a video of monks drying cold, wet sheets with body heat
              alone. Monks spending winter nights 15,000 feet high in the Himalayas is also
              not uncommon.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Can yoga,
              meditation, and other similar practices unleash our inherent supernormal mental
              powers?</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Just over a year
              ago, I wrote an article regarding meditators collapsing quantum systems at a
              distance, you can read that<span> </span></span><a href="http://www.collective-evolution.com/2014/05/01/scientific-study-shows-meditators-collapsing-quantum-systems-at-a-distance/"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #23a9e1;">HERE</span></a><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">There is no
              shortage of literature when it comes to Buddhist monks, and monks from all over
              the world, who possess “supernormal” abilities.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">If you’re further
              interested in this subject, I recommend reading “</span><a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Supernormal-Science-Evidence-Extraordinary-Abilities/dp/030798690X"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #23a9e1;">Supernormal:
              Science, Yogo, and the Evidence for Extraordinary Psychic Abilities</span></a><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">” by Dr. Dean Radin, Chief Scientist at the<span> </span></span><a href="http://noetic.org/"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #23a9e1;">Institute of
              Noetic Sciences</span></a><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">.</span></p>

              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In 2004,<span> </span></span><a href="http://www.danieltammet.net/"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #23a9e1;">Daniel Tammet</span></a><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"> </span></span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">gained a lot of public attention when he recited the
              mathematical constant Pi (3.141…) from memory to 22,414 decimal places in 5
              hours, 9 minutes, without error. The recitation took place at the Museum of the
              History of Science in Oxford and set a European record.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">He was diagnosed
              with high-functioning autistic savant syndrome that same year, as he is able to
              perform a number of complex mental tasks, and learn at
              the rate another “normal” mind could not.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">This is common
              among “autistic” people, and Daniel emphasizes himself that the differences

              industry. According to him, his astonishing abilities are not the result of a
              genetic quirk, but are rather the results of a highly rich and complex
              associative form of thinking and imagination. According to him, autistic
              thought is an extreme variation of a kind of thinking that all of us do, from
              daydreaming to the use of puns and metaphors. (</span><a href="http://www.danieltammet.net/wide-sky.php"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #23a9e1;">source</span></a><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">)</span></p>

              of Philosophical Research. His book tells the story of a 20 year field
              investigation he conducted on a man who had extraordinary
              psychokinetic/precognitive abilities. As many other researchers have done, he
              calls attention to Nina Kulagina, a citizen of the former Soviet Union who
              has apparently demonstrated psychokinetic influence on physical objects. She
              caused quite a stir at the time, and in 1968 Western researchers attending
              a conference were shown a video of her in action:</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #161616; letter-spacing: .95pt;">The Russians claimed that this woman, also known as Nelya
              Mikhailova, had been studied by some forty scientists, including two Nobel
              laureates.  They also reported that, like Serios, Madame Kulagina was able
              to cause images to appear on photographic film.  The communist scientists,
              who were by no means inclined to take a spiritualistic world view, felt that
              they had encountered a new force in nature.</span></em></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Below is some
              footage from 1970, where more researchers conducted experiments. Many have
              examined Kulagina, and for the last 20 years of her life she was subjected to
              academic research by the USSR.</span></p>

              was and is able to accelerate the germination of specific seeds for the

              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #161616; letter-spacing: .95pt;">Chulin Sun is a woman with exceptional powers (Shen and
              Sun, 1996, 1998; Sun, 1998). A member of the Chinese Somatic Science Research
              Institute, she is a practitioner of Waiqi. Waiqi is a type of qigong that
              teaches the practitioner to bring the qi energy of traditional Chinese medicine
              under the control of the mind. Chulin Sun can induce plant seeds to grow shoots
              and roots several cm long within 20 min using mentally projected qi energy
              (Fig. 1). This has been demonstrated on more than 180 different occasions at
              universities as well as science and research institutions in China (including
              Taiwan and Hong Kong) as well as other countries (e.g., Japan, Thailand,
              Malaysia, etc.) (Ge et al., 1998; Qin et al., 1998; Lee et al., 1999). We took
              part in and repeated the qi germination experiments seven times, and five of
              them succeeded (Ge et al., 1998). This remarkable effect on seed development
              has drawn widespread attention (Tompkins and Bird, 1973; Lee, 1998), but the
              biological mechanisms that underlie this phenomenon are unknown.(<a href="http://zeniclinic.com/2011/04/dna/"><span style="color: #23a9e1;">source</span></a>)</span></em></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Pretty remarkable
              isn’t it? How does Sun do it? Apparently, she enters into a deep trance-like
              state, and from this place, she is able to advance the time required for
              sprouting dry seeds from their usual 3 to 4 days , to 20 minutes, generating a
              sprout growth of 3-4 inches. After a genetic analysis, scientists confirmed
              this to be the case, hence, the using of the word “rapid” in the title.</span></p>

              <p>Tummo is part of the "Six yoga's of Naropa"  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Yogas_of_Naropa</p>
              <p>Jetsun Milarepa practice tummo while in a cave, he used the cloth his sister gave as finger sheaths instead of clothing his body. He was naked except for his fingers.</p>
              <p>It is part of the Kagyud tradition, perhaps look in that direction will help.</p>
              <p>The another reference which Reiko tummo, however I am unfamiliar with it.</p>
