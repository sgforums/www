              Abe should go to war himself</span></strong></h1>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span class="date"><span style='font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";'>September 21, 2015</span></span><span style='font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";'> TAKUMI OKADA The Asahi Shimbun</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">KYOTO--Jakucho Setouchi, a Buddhist monk and novelist,
              denounced the Diet’s passage of security legislation as “foolish” and
              “embarrassing,” and urged voters to oust lawmakers who supported the bills in
              the next national election.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“Today’s politics is wrong,” the 93-year-old said on
              Sept. 20, the day after the bills were enacted. “It is foolish to allow Japan
              to fight (overseas) by abandoning war-renouncing Article 9 of the
              Constitution.”</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Her remarks came during her monthly lay sermon session
              at her temple in Kyoto’s Ukyo Ward, which was attended by about 160 people.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The Diet enacted the legislation despite a wave of
              huge rallies staged near the Diet building in Tokyo and elsewhere and opinion
              polls showing a majority of the public opposed to the bills.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is so preoccupied with
              wanting to leave his own legacy that he does not care at all what ordinary
              people think,” Setouchi said. “Japan may wage war now that the bills have been
              written into law. Abe should go to war himself.”</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">She also said the way the ruling coalition railroaded
              the bills through an Upper House special committee session was “embarrassing.”</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The security legislation lifts Japan’s self-imposed
              ban on exercising the right to collective self-defense for the first time since
              the end of World War II. Under the laws, the Self-Defense Forces can use force
              overseas to assist an ally under attack, even if Japan is not under a direct
              threat.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Setouchi lived through World War II, lost relatives in
              U.S. air raids on Japan, and has since been well known for her commitment to
              peace.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">She went on a hunger strike to protest the 1991
              Persian Gulf War and the war in Afghanistan following the 2001 terrorist
              attacks against the United States.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Despite her ill health, she traveled to Tokyo in June
              to speak against the security bills at a rally near the Diet building.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Setouchi said she did see a glimmer of hope when the
              Diet was deliberating the bills, namely the nationwide movement spearheaded by
              the Students Emergency Action for Liberal Democracy-s (SEALDs) consisting
              mainly of university students in Tokyo and elsewhere.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“They are saying ‘the real test is ahead’ and that
              ‘they should settle the matter in the upcoming national election,’” said
              Setouchi, referring to SEALDs’ pledge to unseat lawmakers who voted for the
              bills when the Upper House election is held next summer.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Setouchi also called on women, who made up the
              majority of the audience at the Sept. 20 session, to pay more attention to the
              legislation and other political issues.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“We should not leave the matter just to men,” the monk
              said. “You, too, should work hard.”</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Setouchi said she will continue to speak out against
              the legislation in future sessions and write about the topic.</span></p>
