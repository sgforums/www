              <p>The first step to eliminate suffering is to give up clinging to this 
              life. From the day we are born to our mothers, until the day we die, 
              this entire life is like last night's dream. After we have died, we 
              awaken in the Bardo the intermediate state after death. Then this entire 
              lifetime will seem just like a dream; the human world will become a 
              fading memory. It is like waking up from a dream. At this point, if we 
              have failed to eliminate self grasping, frightening appearances will 
              manifest compared to which, this human world appears as a pure land. 
              Milarepa knew what would happen if he failed to purify self-grasping, 
              and thus he had the courage to dedicate his entire life to practice, 
              undaunted by hardship. Thus, whenever you encounter difficulty, 
              consider: "this life is like a dream, before too long it will come to an
               end, and when it comes to an end, I must be prepared."</p>
              <p>In
               order to secure happiness beyond this life, it is important to 
              understand the causes of happiness. In order to avoid causes of 
              suffering, we must give up self cherishing attitudes and cultivate an 
              altruistic mind that seeks the benefit of others. The jewel of 
              Bodhichitta is the only protection at the time of death. The essence of 
              this is found in the 37 Bodhisattva Practices it contains a remedy for 
              any kind of suffering, an answer to all questions. Although the Buddha's
               teachings are vast, the Buddha himself summarized: "perfectly tame your
               own mind, this is the Buddha's teaching."</p>
              <p>Although most 
              of us live like kings and queens, still we are very skilled in finding a
               way to suffer nothing is ever good enough. The rich suffer from their 
              possessions, the poor suffer from a lack of possessions. Milarepa lived 
              in a cave without food and drink and he was the happiest person in the 
              world. The truth is that we can only find happiness in our mind. If the 
              mind has a habit of grasping at suffering, it will create suffering and 
              perceive everything as an enemy and a threat. If one does not grasp 
              inside the mind, even an actual difficult circumstance, like an illness,
               is not perceived as suffering. Truly understanding karma will enable us
               to tolerate our present circumstances and will teach us how to abandon 
              suffering in the future.Karma can be explained very 
              easily Love is the cause of happiness; self-grasping is the cause of 
              suffering. Therefore, in the 37 Bodhisattva Practices it says: "all 
              suffering without exception comes from wishing for one's own happiness. 
              The perfect Buddhas arise from the altruistic mind."</p>

              <p><em></em><strong>A teaching on refuge </strong><em>that Garchen Rinpoche gave in Lapchi in one of Milarepa's caves to a few retreatants.</em></p>
              <p>"<strong>Gampopa</strong> said, “If we do not practice Dharma in accordance with the Dharma, then
               Dharma itself will become the cause for falling into the lower realms.”
               What are the so-called Three Jewels? The outer Buddha refers to all the
               buddhas of the three times. The outer Dharma consists of the 84,000 
              heaps of Dharma teachings, yet they are included within loving kindness 
              and compassion. Sangha refers to a person who has cultivated loving 
              kindness and compassion, a good-hearted person. Having been liberated 
              from one’s own suffering, rooted in self-grasping, one is able to show 
              the path of liberation to others. This is the Sangha. Having received 
              the refuge vow, the Three Jewels are also contained within your own 
              mindstream. These are called the inner Three Jewels. The inner Buddha is
               your mindful awareness and alertness. The inner Dharma is to never let 
              go of loving kindness and compassion, the altruistic mind.</p>
              <p> <strong>What is the benefit of an altruistic mind</strong>?
               It will destroy self-grasping. When self-grasping collapses, on their 
              very ground, all sentient beings are buddhas. Lord Buddha said: “The 
              Buddha is within all sentient beings. Yet they are obscured by 
              adventitious stains.” What are these adventitious stains? All thoughts 
              and afflictive emotions are contained within a single turn of mind, the 
              root of all sentient beings of the three realms is self-grasping. In 
              reality self-grasping is a mental fixation, a thought grasping at a 
              reality. Tilopa said, “Son! You are not fettered by the appearances, you
               are fettered by grasping at them.” Once all grasping is cleared away, 
              there is nothing that can obscure the mind. Even if thoughts arise, they
               will not obscure the mind, if you do not grasp at them. If you grasp at
               them, you will be hurt like being pricked with a thorn, you will become
               obscured. This is called ‘fettered.’ We are not fettered by the extent 
              of thoughts that arise, as long as we do not grasp at them.</p>

              <p>All
               you practitioners, retreatants, mountain hermits, know this, yet listen
               to the advice of me, a man with experience. I have gathered many 
              experiences of suffering and difficulties in this lifetime. It is said, “<em><strong>an elder sick person is the best doctor</strong></em>.”</p>
