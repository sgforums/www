              sixth century and may have been derived from an earlier Sanskrit <em>gatha</em> (a four-line verse that sums up an aspect of the dharma, and is often a vow).
              At the turn of the eighth century we find Chinese Zen master Hui-neng teaching
              their implications. Today they are recited at the end of services in most
              Mahayana centers.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Composed with seven Chinese graphs per line, the
              Great Vows are poetically arranged in parallels, rhymes, and repetitions. The
              contemporary English translations of the Great Vows rely heavily on D.T.
              Suzuki's version, first published in 1935. He used the title "The Four
              Great Vows," an abbreviation of the title used by Hui-neng: "The Four
              Broad Great Vows." The graph for "broad" implies "for broad
              dissemination." Nakagawa Soen Roshi (1908-83) in turn established the
              title "Great Vows for All" for his own translation in 1957, and two
              years later, at the Diamond Sangha—then a fledgling community in Honolulu—we
              used this title in our first sutra book. Today, as we continue to refine our
              translation, it is almost the only part of the wording of the Vows that has
              stayed the same.<br> <br> <strong>The
              four Great Vows</strong> express aspirations relating to the Three
              Treasures of Buddhism: to redeem the sangha, to stop debasing the Three
              Treasures, to perceive the dharma clearly, and to attain buddhahood. As such,
              the Vows are a recasting in the Mahayana of the <em>Ti-sarana-gamana</em>, the
              ceremony of taking refuge in the Three Treasures, that is found in all Buddhist
              traditions.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Shu jo mu hen sei gan do</span></strong><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '><br> <em>The many beings no limit pledge vow carry across</em></span></em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '><br> The many beings are numberless; I vow to save them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Shu </span></em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>means "the
              many," or "all." <em>Jo</em> is literally "birth" or
              "spring up," and is the term for "a being" or
              "existence." The compound <em>shujo</em>, "the many
              beings," is an expanded translation of the Sanskrit <em>sattva</em>, which
              also means "a being" or "existence." Shujo, "the many
              beings," includes "the vegetable kingdom," as Soothill and
              Hodous remark in their Buddhist dictionary, but my reading would have "the
              many beings" include all things that exist.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>In other contexts, one finds a compound pronounced <em>ujo</em>,
              "with sentience," used as a translation of <em>sattva</em>. <em>Ujo</em> confines the meaning of "beings" to "the animal kingdom"—or
              more probably just to humanity. But it is <em>shujo</em>, "the many
              beings," not <em>ujo</em>, that we find in the Great Vows. Our East Asian
              ancestors clearly intended to be all-encompassing; using "sentient
              beings" in this context, as some Western centers do, sets anthropocentric
              limits to our bodhisattva spirit.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Do</span></em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '> is a translation of
              the Sanskrit <em>paramita</em>, which has two possible meanings. The first is
              "perfection"—the state and the practice—and the second is "to
              cross over." <em>Do</em> follows this second interpretation, and is
              causative: "enable" (them) to cross over. Some dharma centers use
              "enlighten them" and—although bushes and grasses are evolving toward <em>anuttara-samyak-sambodhi</em>—the
              implication of human realization in the word "enlighten" seems, once
              again, to exclude the nonhuman.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Beginning students commonly ask how they can
              honestly vow to save all beings. It sounds like missionary arrogance. Hui-neng
              offers a response: "You are saving them in your own mind." It is <em>bodhichitta</em> that you are cultivating—your own aspiration for wisdom and compassion, and
              your determination to practice it in the world as best you can.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>bon no mu jin sei gan dan</span></strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '><br> <em>grief distress no exhausting pledge vow conclude </em><br> greed, hatred, and ignorance rise endlessly; I vow to abandon them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>The Japanese word <em>bonno</em> translates the
              Sanskrit <em>klesha</em>, "pain, affliction, distress," and this term
              is interpreted by the Chinese Buddhists as "delusions, trials, or
              temptations of the passions which disturb and distress the mind"; also in
              brief as the "Three Poisons." The Three Poisons are "greed,
              hatred, and ignorance," and we settled on this interpretation as the most
              specific. "Obstacles" seemed to lack specificity, while the use of
              "passions" and "desires" echo Calvinism rather than
              Buddhism. Without "passions" we'd be the walking dead, and without
              "desires" we wouldn't even be walking. <em>Dan</em> means
              "conclude, dismiss, cut," and is rendered "cut them off" in
              some Western versions. One community member suggested that while
              "cut" has a precedent, it seemed macho. Instead we chose
              "abandon them," which implies that these actions were formerly
              esteemed—which they were.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Like the first, this second line is about one's own
              mind. It expresses the aspiration to "cut off the mind road," in
              Wu-men's terminology, to cut the tape of incessant chatter, the internal
              monologue that inevitably relates to "how I am, how I was, how I will
              be." In the silence that follows, one turns naturally to the well-being of
              others, as the Buddha turned his mind to his five disciples in Benares when he
              cut his own incessant tape.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>ho mon mu ryo sei gan gaku</span></strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '><br> <em>dharma gates no measure pledge vow learn</em><br> dharma gates are countless; I vow to wake to them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>When our sangha first wrestled with the wording of
              the vows sixteen years ago, Stephen Mitchell, who was translating <em>The Book
              of Job</em> at the time, suggested that we use the expression "vast and
              fathomless," which appears in Job's first response to Bildad the Shuhite.
              We omitted the troublesome "gates," and rendered the line,
              "Though the dharma is vast and fathomless." But in our new version we
              have reinstated the "gates" because they really are dharma
              openings—our chances for realization of the myriad things that advance and
              confirm us—when we are open to them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Another problem with this line lies in the word <em>gaku</em>,
              "learn" or "study," the graph found in compounds that means
              "school," "institute," and "student." It is
              usually translated "understand" or "master," neither of
              which conveys the idea of "being receptive to," which <em>gaku</em> seems to suggest here. After all, how does one master or understand an
              opportunity! This line recalls Zen master Bassui's challenge: "Who is
              hearing that sound?" When you are receptive and not lost in thoughts, that
              sound, touch, glimpse, or scent is your great chance.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Butsu do mu jo sei gan jo</span></strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '><br> <em>Buddha way no top pledge vow become</em><br> Buddha's way is unsurpassed; I vow to embody it fully.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Butsu</span></em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '> is
              "Buddha" and <em>do</em> is "Tao," so <em>Butsudo</em> is
              the Buddha Tao or Buddha dharma, the Way of the Buddha, and the practice of
              Buddhism. More fundamentally, it would be perennial practice, as set forth by
              the Buddha and his successors.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Mujo</span></em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '> is literally
              "no higher," with <em>jo</em> meaning "top." Gary Snyder
              translated this line, "Buddha's way is endless, I vow to follow
              through." In our first seminar, we had a hard time with <em>jo</em>. After
              some discussion, we settled on "embody," and we added
              "fully" to give the Vows a feeling of completion.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 12.0pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>This final line is our vow to walk the Eightfold
              Path of the Buddha as rigorously and as nobly as he did. This is the Way that
              begins with Right Views: clear insight into the insubstantial nature of the
              self and all things, the innate harmony of the universal organism, and the
              uniqueness of each individual being. It then extends to the application of
              these Views in thoughts, words, conduct, livelihood, lifestyle, recollection,
              and meditation.</span></p>
