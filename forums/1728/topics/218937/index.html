[M---] suggests in his exhaustive website that we do the Awareness Watching Awareness practice, where we just stay quiet and watch ourselves watching -- not the objects of thought, but the watching process itself. Easier said than done.<br><br>Now my question to you is, will it help me if I study Vipassana meditation? My hope is to hone my mind in such a way that it is receptive to all cues, whether the type you suggest or [M---] does.<br><br>Annette: I won't tell you to study Vipassana meditation, or not to study it. You're welcome to do or practice whatever you want, but I have no assignments or homework to give you. I recommend no practices. When I suggest a looking, it is merely a suggestion of something to do right now, not a practice to master. This requires no practice, no mental training, no honing. You can stop preparing now.<br><br>You use language like "I have been unable to do...," and "Easier said than done." Just look right here, into the assumptions that are behind these statements. They tell you everything you need to know. Look at what you assume, as you think and say these words. You assume that there is a "you" who can do things. You also assume that there is something that needs to be done, for this "you" to have more of something - completion, perhaps? Enlightenment? A better, more satisfying life, as an awakened person?<br><br>Is this "you" real? Have you looked for it? You don't need any preparation or meditation to do this. Reality is simply right here, right now, and right in front of your eyes. Have you looked for this person you assume to be real? Have you ever found this separate person? When I looked for one, all I found was some passing thoughts that, when strung together, seemed to comprise a story, which seemed to be "me." But I never found anything other than that. I never found anything substantial and lasting that I could call "me."<br><br>You can do this for yourself right now. Don't take my word for it.<br><br>Let's stop right here. How many times have you read these very words, Bill? And have you done as your helpers and teachers have suggested, right now? Right now? Right now? Not after you have studied meditation for another ten years, or after you have "put in your time" practicing awareness watching awareness. Those things can happen, but what you are looking for is not in them. What you are looking for is right now. Did you miss it? It's okay, because there is another opportunity right now, and another right now. This opportunity is always available to you, but it is always now, never in the future, and never requires preparation. And this now moment is always. There is never a time other than right now.<br><br>So this is it. This, this awareness you are aware of right now. Can you find any entity in this who needs anything at all? Is there anything needed right now, in this perfect clear awareness, at such peace with itself? Is there anything more you ever need to know, to learn, to master? Or is this, right here, just it?</blockquote><blockquote>Perhaps we have abandoned our old ways of petty, self-centered thinking and worry and fear, but we still imagine that there is a job for this tiny being, and that job is to know and deeply understand the truth of Â“who I am.Â” But this idea is the kiss of death. This Â“I must know who I amÂ” Â– this one small need alone Â– places you at odds with everything you claim to value and cherish, and throws you headlong into the terrifying, claustrophobic loneliness of being on your own. It says, Â“I can do it myself.Â” There is no terror like this in all the universe, and yet we go along living with it, voluntarily. Can you really stand another minute of it? Can you bear to be all alone, naked and fending for yourself in the wilderness, any longer?<br><br>So this is when the search ends: when the idea that you must know who you are is dropped, because you simply canÂ’t stand the pain anymore, the pain of believing your Â“selfÂ” to have some power to know, to understand, to correct, to soothe, to lift yourself out of all this and into Heaven. You drop that load, because it has simply become too heavy, and it's too painful to carry it another step. And you stop doing anything, you stop looking for anything, even for the truth of Â“who you are.Â” And in that stopping, there is an admitting that it canÂ’t be done by you Â– you canÂ’t control this. You give up.<br><br>So stop. Rather than looking for the truth, even the truth of Â“who you are,Â” just stop, for one moment, and donÂ’t look for anything. Just stop trying, stop moving. Stay put, for once in your life. Admit that this is all there is. It doesnÂ’t get better. There is no other truth but this. Existence just is, and there is no purpose to any of it.</blockquote></div>
