              <p>hahaha, the issue is one of curiosity, if that is what you want to know why.  I am curious to know whether there are hungry ghosts or just belief.  I am also aware of arguments like "if you don't see doesn't mean it does not exist".  In the debate on whether god/God exists, many people put this line of argument when challenged that if god/God exists, then EVERYONE should be able to see.</p>
              <p>You have not seen a hungry ghost because you cannot even describe it just like those people who have not seen god/God but say look like an old man with beard!</p>

              <p>You need to have faith in science, or your beliefs. Science is not always right.</p>
              <p>Someone pointed out there are photos, you said it could be doctored. You dont have the faith so to you everything is wrong false incorrect. You dismiss it as chilidish.</p>
              <p>I am surprised you used words like childish or stupid to describe people's faith, tells alot about your personality. Have more tolerance towards other people's beliefs.</p>

              <p>Substantial like science, fact, evidence, investigation. So those are not childish ? What if tomorrow, the scientist changed their view and said that the cookie monster may exist !!!. Do you suddenly feel that TTFU is a prophet ?</p>
              <p>You need to have faith in science, or your beliefs. Science is not always right.</p>
              <p>Someone pointed out there are photos, you said it could be doctored. You dont have the faith so to you everything is wrong false incorrect. You dismiss it as chilidish.</p>
              <p>I am surprised you used words like childish or stupid to describe people's faith, tells alot about your personality. Have more tolerance towards other people's beliefs.</p>

              i have yet to see a hungry ghost but i have seen with my own eyes ghosts captured on CCTV in office. 
              
              I know a young lady executive who is born with the "YIN YANG" eyes. She can see ghosts naturally and she can see Celestial being. She is a pretty young lady working as an executive in a MNC. Do you think she will go around telling people what she can see?
              
              During the Ghost month, she can't go out at night because she can see too many ghosts squatting on the pavement fighting for food and eating the candles.  Ghost month is the worst torture month for her and she often have black pandan eyes.  Only her mother and some buddhist bro/sis know about her natural gifted "Yin Yang" eyes.
              
              There are many out there with this natural gifted eyes. They just keep silence.

              <p>I think your 'believe' is either a theory or hypothesis a scientist postulates.  Big bang is a theory and so is evolution that scientists posit rather than believe.  Science as a discipline is not faith-based.  Science do not reach a conclusion based on faith or a person's belief.  However, what an individual scientist as a person wish to believe is a different matter.</p>
              <p>Amongst the scientific community, one's theory or hypothesis is subjected to challenge, scrutiny and vigorous questionings.  If a scientist goes about and say I believed 'this' or 'that' without any basis, he lend himself to ridicule.</p>

              <p>Then I asked my in-laws, if we hide at home, not going out, what will our ancestor think? That we are avoiding them?  Is this filial piety?</p>
              <p>From that day on, my in-laws never stop my family from doing any activities on 7th month, be it travelling, swimming, or practical anything. </p>
