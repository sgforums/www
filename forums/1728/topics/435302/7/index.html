              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #888888;">A tale of Heaven and hell: </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">A curious man once asked to visit heaven and hell. Expecting hell to be a terrible, frightening place, he was amazed to find people seated around a lovely banquet table. The table was piled high with every delicious thing one could possibly want. The man thought, “Perhaps hell is not so bad after all.”</span></p>
              <p><br><span style="color: #888888;">Looking closely, however, he noticed that everyone at the table was miserable.<br>They were starving, because, although there was a mountain of food before them, they had been given three-foot-long chopsticks. There was no way to carry the food to their mouths with such long chopsticks, and so no one could eat a bite.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">The man was then taken to heaven. To his surprise, he found the exact same sit­uation as he had seen in hell. People were gathered around a banquet table piled with food. All the diners held a pair of three-foot-long chopsticks in their hands. But here in heaven, everyone was happily eating the delicious food, for the residents of heaven were using their extra-long chopsticks to feed one another.</span></p>

              <p>Of course there are hungry ghosts in Europe and U.S. I did not encounter them but someone in my tour group stayed in the haunted hotel room in U.S. There are many ghosts stories in the westen countries.</p>
              <p>Buddha said there are 33 levels of heavens (if I remember the number correctly). There are many heavenly gods staying in heavens. Which heaven a person goes to  depends on which god do you believe and of course faith alone does not guarantee you a place in heaven. Heaven is just a temporary place. If you read the sutra, you will realise there are many hells. Which hell a person goes to  depends on your deeds.</p>

              <p>I personally know of a diplomat who was at one point posted to Bangkok as ambassador.  Many of his predecessors before him also occupied the same bungalow house reserved for ambassadors from his country. </p>
              <p>They all saw a Thai woman in traditional Thai costume in a particular level of that house, at various points in time.  I'm sure you would already have guessed that this Thai woman was not human, but from another realm. </p>
              <p>This diplomat, whom I had the chance to get to know over dinner a few years ago, told us that he too often caught glimpses of this Thai woman.  He described the appearance of this other-worldly figure to his predecessors and all confirmed that what he'd glimpsed was also what they had seen. </p>
              <p>Therefore, he decided to radiate loving-kindness (metta) to this woman and soon he stopped seeing this woman floating around.  Nevertheless, he said that he continued to sense her presence, but that he knew she was not malevolent. </p>
              <p>Believe it or not is up to you... but that was the first time I came to know about the concept of radiating loving-kindness (metta) and <strong>how powerful goodwill can be</strong>.</p>

              The smell is very jialat.

              <p>Burning paper houses, paper money, even paper maids etc. is more a Taoist practice.  I suppose they hope to give their departed relatives a better life in the netherworld? </p>
              <p>Buddhists don't believe that burning of these things will cause them to manifest in another realm.  However, dedication of merit and sending loving thoughts to friends and relatives in other realms will benefit them. </p>
              <p>My Dharma teacher was talking in class last week about how thoughts and mental energy can bring about healing if one is sincere enough.  He said this can come about because of the non-locality of mind (he was speaking in Chinese, so I'm just roughly translating).  He gave the example that, if your child is sick in the USA and you are in Singapore, you can actually send loving thoughts to help speed up his healing. </p>
              <p>Of course, healing and telepathy is not the main aim of Buddhism... but he happened to mention the possibility of such things. </p>

              <p>Haha... not sure if there's a Taoist sub-forum on Sgforums.  However, I suspect that the burning of paper paraphernalia for beings in the netherworld would also be considered a folk/superstitious practice by true practising Taoists.  You probably won't get a proper answer here though...</p>
              <p>Btw, you may actually find it interesting to read about the true significance of this 7th month "festival".  The term "Hungry Ghost Festival" was coined by the Chinese and the manner in which it is observed rests more on folk belief than anything else.</p>

              Funeral also will burn even if it's not ghost month.
              
              A funeral just happened near my house, burn cars, houses ... ...
              
              It's a taoist practice. Taoists form a sizeable portion in Singapore population.

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #888888;">A tale of Heaven and hell:</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">A curious man once asked to visit heaven and hell. Expecting hell to be a terrible, frightening place, he was amazed to find people seated around a lovely banquet table. The table was piled high with every delicious thing one could possibly want. The man thought, “Perhaps hell is not so bad after all.”</span></p>
              <p><br><span style="color: #888888;">Looking closely, however, he noticed that everyone at the table was miserable.<br>They were starving, because, although there was a mountain of food before them, they had been given three-foot-long chopsticks. There was no way to carry the food to their mouths with such long chopsticks, and so no one could eat a bite.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">The man was then taken to heaven. To his surprise, he found the exact same sit­uation as he had seen in hell. People were gathered around a banquet table piled with food. All the diners held a pair of three-foot-long chopsticks in their hands. But here in heaven, everyone was happily eating the delicious food, for the residents of heaven were using their extra-long chopsticks to feed one another.</span></p>
