              <p>The seventh month of the lunar calendar is the Hungry Ghost Month and there will be many festivities and feasts to entertain and appease the ghosts and spirits let loose from hell.  In Buddhism there are 6 realms of existence, two of which are where hungry spirits and hell beings exist. </p>
              <p>So the hungry ghost fesitval originated from Buddhism or from Chinese folk belief and traditions?</p>

                          day, his Deva-eye saw that his deceased mother had transmigrated to the 
                          realm of the hungry ghost. Her stomach was enlarged and she had tiny limbs. 
                          Her throat was as small as the eye of a needle, and as a result, it was 
                          impossible for her to eat any food or even to swallow a drop of water. 
                          Maudgalyayana could not bear the sight of his mother in such an extreme 
                          state of suffering. He immediately filled his alms bowl with food and 
                          with the immense power that he possessed, he sent it to his mother. However, 
                          she could not have the food because each time it turned into charcoal 
                          before she could put it in her mouth. It hurt Maudgalyayana to see what 
                          was happening and because of his strong emotion for his mother, it hindered 
                          his ability to see the karma that she had committed in her past lives. 
                          He went to Buddha for advice. The Buddha closed his eyes and entered into 
                          pure contemplation. With great compassion and gentleness, he said: "Maudgalyayana, 
                          your mother did not believe in the retributions arising from the law of 
                          cause and effect. She committed many evil deeds. She dishonoured the Buddha 
                          and insulted the <span style="color: #cc0000;">Sangha [1]</span>, had no respect 
                          for the Three Treasures (Buddha, Dharma and Sangha), was greedy, filled 
                          with hatred, ignorant and arrogant. She was a wicked person who committed 
                          many evils, and she teased others giving them no peace. Therefore, she 
                          is suffering such a bitter consequence. Even though you are her son and 
                          your filial piety touches the heavens, these are still not able to save 
                          a person who had committed such serious evil karma." On hearing this, 
                          Maudgalyayana wept in pain. </strong></span></p>

                          of the 7th month of each year is designated "Buddha's Joy Day". 
                          This is the last day of the Sangha's summer retreat, and because of the 
                          purity with which the Sangha observed the precepts and practised cultivation, 
                          many attain the <span style="color: #cc0000;">Bodhi [2]</span>. The merits that 
                          they accumulate are immense beyond imagination, and the Buddha is most 
                          delighted. If you make an offering to these Sangha during this time, you 
                          can liberate your deceased parents and relatives from the suffering of 
                          the three evil realms (realms of animal, hungry ghost and hell) through 
                          their immense merits. If the parents are still living, then they shall 
                          be blessed with good health, happiness and a life of abundance. This is 
                          the truly marvellous method of giving salvation to the deceased." 
                          Maudgalyayana was delighted to hear this, and carried out the Buddha's 
                          advice accordingly. Thus, on the 15th of the 7th month after the offering 
                          to the Sangha, Maudgalyayana's mother was liberated from the suffering 
                          of the realm of the hungry ghost.</span></strong></p>

                          give offering to the Sangha in this way is called the 'Ullambana' method. 
                          After Maudgalyayana received the benefits from this Dharma, he was very 
                          grateful to the Buddha and praised the merits of the Three Treasures. 
                          He advised people to promote the 'Ullambana Dharma'. This day, the 15th 
                          of the 7th month, can also be considered an occasion to express our gratitude 
                          and filial piety to our parents and ancestors. Unfortunately, the passage 
                          of time saw a gradual erosion in its understanding and purpose, so much 
                          so that this special occasion is not performed in accordance to the Dharma. 
                          Today, this auspicious celebration has become a day of widespread slaughter 
                          of animals to be used as offering to the hungry ghosts. The original act 
                          of performing offerings to the Sangha has become a day for feasting and 
                          making offerings to the hungry ghosts, often referred to as 'to invite 
                          the good brothers to a feast'. These practices are not only against the 
                          compassion of the Buddha, but also a let down to Maudgalyayana who had 
                          advised the world to be filial and to perform good deeds.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #0000a0; font-size: small;">When 
                          we refrain from killing and protect all lives, we actually accumulate 
                          the merit of longevity and good health. It is meaningless to kill other 
                          living beings and offer them to the ghost, because they cannot benefit 
                          from these at all. Instead, those who kill shall have to repay for their 
                          action by suffering endlessly in hell. Unless we put an end to all forms 
                          of killing, the world forever shall not have peace. If the tradition of 
                          offering to the ghosts and the deceased on this day cannot be changed, 
                          the least we could do is to replace the slaughter and offer of meat with 
                          vegetarian food, flowers or fruits. It does not matter if we are not able 
                          to make offerings to the Sangha on this day, but at least we could invite 
                          them to chant the sutra for the purpose of liberating the deceased. In 
                          this way, it benefits both the living and the deceased.</span></strong></p>

              There are many Buddhist temples that one can go to chant the Kitisargarbhva Sutra for all the wandering spirits, ancestors, deceased....etc...
              
              One can choose to offer lamps, bardo service , food to the spirits during a grand praying event on Kitisargarbhva Bodhisattva's Birthday to dedicate the merits of chanting his sutra.
              
              It's not restricted to only gold papers burning and food offering along roads.
              
              Anyway, i am a believer that roads that have people who offer food to the wandering spirits have lesser accidents happened that stretch. It's for the good of drivers too.

Thus, it is difficult for the monks to stop them from papers burning. It is to convenient them. Anyway, the monks in the temples always advise the devotees not to burn or burn less.</p></div>

              <p>The word 'believe' means that it is not real (uncertain) but would like it to be real.  If there are hungry ghosts - then 'believe' will not be used.  Have you ever heard anyone say "I believe there is a sun?" even though he does not see the sun (at night)?</p>

              <p>Even though you cant see the sun, does it mean that it doesnt exist ? The same with believe, its faith. Do you need any evidence ?</p>
