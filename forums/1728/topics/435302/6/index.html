              The hungry ghost festival is period whereby the chinese, where there are different elements of Taoism, Buddhism and Confucian, practice generosity and transfer of goodwill and merits. For those who take the ghost month seriously, it is a good time for them to practice! 
               The euphemism used in hokkien is "good brothers", who in the context of confucian values of ancestral reverence, died and are not taken care of by their family, is the equivalent of the vagrant  and destitude. These include any one who died and not placed with their ancestral tablet.
                          One view is to placate the wandering spirit so that they don't create havoc, another is to see these sentient beings as sufferring, worthy of our compassion. So we must encourage those that believe in the seventh month to transfer goodwill and merit to these being.

              One thing about being born into a traditional polytheistic chinese family is that you never really questioned your beliefs and of the supernatural your family unless being questioned. Mine first association is the seventh month, where you are not to go out at night, or go swimming, sing or whistle, kick offerings or stand at the crossroads. Most are mainly admonishments not to do, not to do that! 
                  If you are to believe by your family, you just accept it, and even it doubt creep up later, it does'nt have much direct effect on our daily lives, but be mindful just to place safe, just in case.....
                  Traditional chinese religion mirror the ancient government, you have the Jade  Emperor, Tien Gong or Shangti, with his retinue presiding over all. What you have in the human realm also exist in heaven and hell. There is three realms, Heaven, Earth(Hell), Human realm. The Gods with the Jade Emperor preside over the heavens,which are different levels, with the Son of Heaven, the chinese emperor presiding over the middledom, and Yen Luo Wang, or Yama presiding over hell. In chinese beliefs, the departed will stay in in underworld for certain period, all will have judgement pass upon them,the virtuous will ascend to heaven, only those who are guilty are sent to hell to suffer punishment. After whichthey are made to drink a memory erasing elixir to forget before crossing the bridge of life and death(nine her chiao) to be reborn back as humans or animals.f

              One thing about taking refuge as a Buddhist is that you no longer seek  Gods of other religion as refuge. But again, notable persons are deified owing to the virtuous acts. Some of these are also accepted as Worldly Dharma Protector owing to the great respect the chinese has for them.
                  The average polytheistic has no discrimination against Gods of other religions, you will see chinese offering incense ai Indian temples. The only objection they have are those religions that an antagonistic views over chinese polytheistic beliefs.
                  Traditionally, chinese visit and pray at Buddhist, Taoist, Shenistic temples. Buddhist and Taoist are consider "kong" or empty paths, where one renounces the worldly life.

              <p>But I think the translation Hungry Ghost is wrong. Hungry Ghost
              is too Western.</p>
              <p>Any translation of Zhong Yuan Jie into English ?</p>

                  Sometimes deep seated beliefs may be untrue due to ignorance, either the way it is presented or the way we see it. There is a need for quietude and also a confidence in one identity in association to these beliefs. One need to feel unthreatened when calling to question these beliefs. There is a need for respect when we review these beliefs.

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Traditional customs add richness in our culture . some look at the festival as supernatural . others look at it just as another cultural festival . say like during deepavali when our Indian friends are piercing their own body with needles and other tools . it adds richness to their Indian culture . to many it is fun to watch (fun without disrespect) . I think True or not true is not so important . if you look at the festival as something educational then the main purpose could be not about ghosts at all . the festival could be to teach us about respecting people and even the deceased . I think it depends on how we look at things and how we want to perceive them too .</p></div>
