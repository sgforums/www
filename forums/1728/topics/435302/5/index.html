              <p>What make you think that I presume all are local in this forum. Read my opinion here and there will tell you whether I am local or not.</p>
              <p>Your descriptions on 7th month and the lady who could see beyond what we see have certain amount of differences of what I think I know in Sg.</p>
              <p>I see quite a number of Bhuddist here. I know indirectly a lady which is a Bhuddist. She also can see beyond what we could see. Very unlike what you described.</p>
              <p>She would invite the ........ and chant the Di Zhang Wang script. After which, will "walk away" and disappear for good.</p>
              <p>I hope those who read this can read (not from the internet) up more and do not be SUPERSTITIOUS.</p>

              actually to those who want to experience hungry ghosts during this month, it is not difficult.  You can just go around kicking the food laid out for the ghosts, spit on the black spot where papers are burnt, urine if you dare , do it at your own risk. Of course please wait till the people who burnt and offer have left the spot, you want to see ghosts not humans.
              
              Please let your family/good friends know what you are trying to do so that when something odd happened to you, they can still at least help you to get a Taoist priest.
              
              One huge warning, it's a big risk you are taking but you may have your wish fulfilled....experienced Ghosts .   lols...............

              <p>My education is not wasted because I use it to determine you are
              Rubbish.  That you are Rubbish is not a presumption because it
              took several days and many exchanges for me to confirm that you are
              Rubbish - a language you excelled, and one that reflects the
              kind of material stuff (rubbish) you are good at.</p>

              <p>That is only your obeservation. I wouldn't change what you determined, only how you determined it. I can only conclude its a waste of resourses to spend so much time and effort to determine what you thought Rubbish is. If you are still not aware, no one is interested in your observation or what you have already determined. I'm also good in Finish.  </p>
              <p>I have excelled, have you?</p>

              punggol mee goreng, i will tell the boss Anthony of this marina bay restaurant that you are mis-using his famous dish name.
              
              I think you need to stay off personal attack on this forum. My post up there discusses about the ghost month .  It is relevant.  Dawnfirstlight has read my warnings , how come you can't read?

              <p>Buddhist does not endorse on the idea that <strong>7TH MONTH IS PERIOD WHEN THE GATE OF HELL IS OPENED AND THE GHOST IS FREE TO ROAM THE EARTH.</strong> If you read the Earth Store Bodhisattva Sutra, u will know that when a being entered into hell.

              Your muslims friends don't believe in Hantu and Bomoh ? They have their own versions of ghosts and medium. They are not ignorant about the supernatural either.
              
              Most of them are more fed up with the smoke caused by excessive paper burnings than laughing at the idea of ghosts.
