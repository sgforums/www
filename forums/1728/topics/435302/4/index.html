              <p>I was talking about religious faith which includes supernatural beings, teachings and practice.  However, in practice there is also rites and rituals.  Many practices are devotional in nature.  As long as you don't question why you carry out a certain rite or ritual, you are doing so by blind faith.</p>
              <p>It is all back to understanding of the word 'faith'.  Sorry to say this, but from the two posts, I gather that the meaning of faith is not easily understood and mostly mistaken as faith=religion.  It is the other way round.  When a religion has a set of ideologies that you simply believed, that is faith.  When the belief is not questioned, that is blind faith.</p>
              <p>There is nothing wrong with the phrase 'blind faith'.  It is your mindset that tells you 'blind faith' is negative and adverse, and you rather tell yourself 'my belief is not blind'.</p>

              <p>Once people said, stupid Christian believe in God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, and yet they say they believe in one God?  How can 1+1+1 equal to 1?</p>

              <p>hahaha, you are getting more incomprehensive with each exchange with me.  You seemed more sensible in other forums.  Perhaps, you lacked perspective in this forum?</p>
              <p>Also, you are no match for my repartee.  I am restraining myself because this is a Buddhist forum.  In retrospect, I can see why you are dead set in your track because you just don't like that I am smarter than you!</p>

              <p>Its one of my better skills. Exposing ignorance. You are unable to argue with propriety because you don't possess what you like to believe you have.</p>
              <p>I'm not into "winning" arguments. I just cannot contain the impulse of stripping the empty shell of... meaningless ego. There is only one true religion, its the beliefs that one retains.</p>

              <p>I shall focus on your opening sentence: "Well, I am wondering, what exactly is 'blind faith'?"</p>
              <p>You have confirmed what I said earlier: most people don't understand the meaning of faith.  Have you read all my posts and replies regarding this topic so far?</p>
              <p>Perhaps, I can give another example: When I say I have <span style="text-decoration: underline;">faith</span> in my surgeon who is going to operate me.  What do I mean?  It means I have <span style="text-decoration: underline;">confidence in</span> my surgeon.  I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">trust</span> he can do a good job and I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">believed</span> he would perform to the best of his ability.</p>
              <p>If the faith in my surgeon was without basis, such as I have no idea he is qualified or experienced, I never check which university he graduated from, how many similar operations he has performed, then my faith is BLIND FAITH.</p>
              <p>Now, do you have faith in my explanation or are you still blinded?</p>
