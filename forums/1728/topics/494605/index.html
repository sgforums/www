              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">There’s
              no need to pray to anything. If done from a settled mind, what we are praying
              for arises naturally.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">We
              were gathered in the temple for a daylong ritual during a three-year retreat in
              France. The person who was leading the chants that month had a wry sense of
              humor. When we had all sat down and were ready for him to begin, he paused. We
              waited. In the silence that opened, he gently intoned, Mes frères, prions.
              (“Let us pray, my brothers.”)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Straight
              out of a Catholic monastery! It was an amusing and simple reminder that prayer
              was and is an essential part of contemplative practice, regardless of tradition.
              Every meditation we practiced involved prayers—prayers to the lineage, prayers
              of refuge, prayers for bodhicitta [the wish to attain enlightenment for the
              sake of all beings], prayers of devotion in guru practice, prayers of praise in
              deity practice, prayers for protection and activity in protector practice,
              dedication prayers, good fortune prayers, offering prayers, and aspiration
              prayers. Between meditation sessions, we were encouraged to read teaching and
              aspiration prayers to fill the time and keep our minds from wandering. We
              recited five or six long prayers at the end of the evening ritual. And the
              daylong practices involved pages and pages of prayers of many different types.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">All
              these prayers were intended to shape our attitudes and minds, as well as help
              us avoid distractions. I had enough experience to know that conscious or
              deliberate attempts to adopt specific attitudes often result in problematic
              contortions of the mind. Other feelings are suppressed in favor of the desired
              attitudes. Imbalances arise, and from there all kinds of problems unfold,
              particularly in intensive practice settings. As a consequence, I wasn’t sure
              how to approach all this prayer.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">A
              number of us had the same concerns. Early in the three-year retreat, we asked
              our teacher, Kalu Rinpoche, what we were meant to do with all these prayers and
              all this praying. His answer was a bit surprising. “Let your mind settle
              naturally in mahamudra and recite the prayers from there.” Mahamudra is all
              about not-thinking, letting the mind settle so deeply that it does not do
              anything. That was where we were meant to pray from? I wasn’t sure what to make
              of that. What was the point of all these prayers if you weren’t going to think
              about them?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Little
              by little, I came to appreciate the wisdom and depth of Rinpoche’s instruction.
              In the Shangpa tradition of Tibetan Buddhism, the basic instruction for
              mahamudra is to let body, breath, and mind settle naturally. Though it sounds
              simple, it is not easy. At first, you feel like you are doing nothing, and it
              takes a while to appreciate that that is exactly what you are doing (or not
              doing). The productive and achievement-oriented parts of you start to rebel,
              and there is nothing to do but let them settle naturally, too. Other stuff
              arises, and you let those things quiet, too. After a while, you do find that
              you are resting deeply, without effort, and your mind is growing clearer and
              clearer.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">As
              I practiced this approach to prayer during the morning and evening rituals, the
              first thing I noticed was that the prayers were gradually committed to memory
              without conscious effort on my part. With daily recitation, without trying to
              think, I found that the words were just there. I didn’t have to remember them.
              A second effect was that the prayer took up residence in my mind, again without
              conscious effort. While it was important to study each prayer, once I had a
              good understanding of the content, deliberately thinking about the prayer or
              trying to feel a certain way seemed artificial and superfluous. Understanding
              came on its own. So did devotion, gratitude, awe, and other powerful emotions.
              It was sufficient to set an intention and then rest, letting the words and
              meanings wash through me. The conceptual mind had little influence here, and
              when it did arise, it usually felt like a lead-footed dance partner in contrast
              to the nimble gazelle of the non-conceptual mind.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I
              recently read a piece by my friend and colleague Stephen Batchelor about his
              discomfort with prayer in the Tibetan tradition. In particular, he raised the
              question, “To whom, to what, are you praying?” This is a valid question,
              particularly in the context of yidam, or deity practice, and even more so in
              the context of protector practice [a different class of deities that are
              invoked to create conditions conducive to practice]. On the one hand, the deity
              is regarded as an expression of one’s own mind. On the other, certainly in the
              rituals themselves, the deity is regarded as something that has agency and
              power in its own right. Are deities symbols? Are they independent figures? In
              general, the ontological status of deity in Western thought has long been
              fraught with difficulty—does God or a god really exist? Batchelor’s exit from
              the conundrum was through Feuerbach, of whom Karl Marx wrote, “[Feuerbach’s]
              work consists in the dissolution of the religious world into its secular basis
              . . . Feuerbach resolves the religious essence into the human.” Essentially,
              Feuerbach felt that humans projected positive qualities onto a deity, and then
              prayed to the deity (or God) for those positive qualities to be given to them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It
              makes sense, but this interpretation did not tally with my own experience.
              After reading this piece, I wondered why I had not experienced this conundrum,
              and I realized that Kalu Rinpoche’s instruction played a significant role. When
              you let the mind settle and let the conceptual mind subside, a peace and
              openness arise naturally, regardless of what is going on in your life (or in
              your mind). Questions about what is and what isn’t fall away. The law of the
              excluded middle (a thing is either this or that) simply doesn’t hold. The deity
              is just there. It is your own mind. It is a symbol. It also has a kind of
              agency, at least with respect to you. It is not you and it is you at the same
              time. None of these perspectives are contradictory. They are all valid. The
              conflicts arise only in the conceptual mind as it tries to put these
              experiences into different and mutually exclusive boxes.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              saying this, I’m not talking about blind faith. Blind faith is a rigid
              adherence to certain beliefs for which there is little or no evidence. These
              beliefs cannot be questioned as they form an internal structure through which
              experience is interpreted. Everything you experience is interpreted in a way
              that conforms to the ideas already deeply implanted inside. That is blind
              faith, or belief, a self-contained system that maintains itself.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">What
              I am trying to describe here is quite the opposite. When you let the mind
              settle, you open to the totality of what you are experiencing, including all
              the different ways you interpret experience, whether they are consistent with
              each other or not. In this field of sensory, emotional, and cognitive
              experience, you naturally become aware of what is out of balance and move in the
              direction of balance, weighing one interpretation over another. But this
              direction is constantly changing. You end up resting, but resting nowhere,
              constantly opening to the complexity and richness of your experience. This
              opening is awake and alive—not blind. It is a willingness to open to whatever
              arises in experience and meet it.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Through
              that kind of faith, devotion, awe, understanding, and compassion arise
              naturally. In effect, your prayers are answered without your having to think
              about them. They are answered through the practice of prayer itself.</span></p>
