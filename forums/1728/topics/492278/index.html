              nursed as a boy to the fantastical Garuda—Andrea Miller explores the intriguing
              role that birds play in Buddhist mythology and teachings.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>In my freshman
              year of college, my religious studies class was at the sleepy hour of two
              o’clock, and to make matters worse the professor was hypnotically soft-spoken
              and wore tired shades of brown. So on the day that he slowly enumerated the
              four noble truths on the board, I failed to experience the flash of insight,
              which many Buddhist converts talk about; the only thing I felt was my heavy
              eyelids.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>Then I glimpsed
              movement.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>I was sitting by
              the window—sunlight pouring in—and a dark, glossy bird I didn’t have a name for
              had landed on the stone windowsill outside. If it weren’t for the glass, I
              could have touched it—I was that close to its iridescent purple and green
              sheen, blunt tail, and yellow bill. Watching the bird tilting its head as it
              looked at me with alert, shiny eyes, I was suddenly wholly focused.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>I’d never before
              paid much attention to birds, but for me this particular one was what Zen
              master Thich Nhat Hanh calls “a bell of mindfulness.” The bird woke me up to
              the present moment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>It was
              inevitable: I became both a Buddhist and a birdwatcher.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>For me, birding
              is a form of meditation—it’s just watching, just listening. I appreciate how
              birding encourages equanimity, how it helps me rest in ambiguity and
              uncertainty. In the field, I get a glimpse of small, brown wings disappearing
              through the branches of an oak. Then I look through my bird books and see page
              after page of almost indistinguishable little brown birds with their subtle
              markings and minor differences. Did the bird I see have yellow or tan legs? Was
              its beak straight or did it curve? I can’t positively identify the bird and I
              have to find some peace with that.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>It’s easy to find
              symbolism in birds—in the way they take flight, in the way they preen and nest
              and sing. Poets have long made wordy use of their wings, while mystics have
              revered them. In Buddhism, birds are used to teach ethics and concepts. They
              are metaphors for our muddled, unskillful selves, and also represent our best,
              no-self selves. Buddhist bird lore goes all the way back to the beginning, or
              so the story goes.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #222222;'>Siddhartha and the Swan</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>One day, when the
              future Buddha, Siddhartha, was just a child, he and his cousin Devadatta went
              walking in the forest. Devadatta was an avid hunter, never without his bow and
              a sheaf of arrows, so when a wedge of swans passed through the sky, he aimed at
              the leading bird and pierced its wing. As the swan fell heavily to the ground
              both boys ran to it, but it was Siddhartha who arrived first. He cradled the
              injured creature in his arms and whispered comfort into its curved, milky neck.
              Then he extracted the shaft of the arrow and rubbed the wound with a cool and
              soothing herb.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>Eventually,
              Devadatta caught up to Siddhartha and demanded he hand over the swan, but
              Siddhartha refused. When Devadatta persisted, Siddhartha suggested that they
              bring the matter to the king, and so in front of the whole court Devadatta and
              Siddhartha each presented their side of the argument. They were both so
              persuasive that the court was divided; some people thought that the swan
              belonged to Devadatta because he shot it, while others believed that it was
              Siddhartha’s for nursing it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>Suddenly, an
              elderly man appeared and the king asked him his opinion. “The prized possession
              of every creature is its life,” the elder stated. “As such, a creature belongs
              to whoever protects it, not to the one who attempts to take its life away.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>Seeing the wisdom
              in this, the court awarded Siddhartha the swan. He sheltered it until it was
              fully healed, and then set it free.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #222222;'>The Golden Goose</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>The Buddha often
              told his followers stories about his previous lives to teach them ethical
              lessons. According to one story, he was a man who died and was reborn as a
              golden goose. He still remembered his old family and felt a pang thinking of
              how, since his death, they were just barely scraping by. So he went to them and
              at their feet he released one of his valuable feathers. “I’ll always provide
              for you,” the goose promised. Then each day after that he gave the family
              another feather until they had enough gold to buy soft beds and rich foods.</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #222222;'></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>But his former
              wife grew greedy, and one day she lured the goose close to her with sweet
              words. Then she grabbed him, pinned his beating wings between her chest and the
              crook of her arm, and plucked all of his resplendent feathers. Now, the goose
              couldn’t fly away, so his wife threw him into a barrel, fed him skinny scraps
              of food, and waited for his feathers to grow back. But when they did, she was
              disappointed: instead of the golden glint she was hoping for, the new feathers
              were as white as icy silence.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>Buddhist
              teachings place a bird at the very center of the wheel of life, the<span> </span><em>bhavacakra</em>.
              At root, Buddhism is about how we can find true liberation from the suffering
              of<em>samsara</em>, the wheel of cyclic
              existence. The bhavacakra, which some say the Buddha himself created as a
              teaching tool, is both a diagram to help us see why we’re stuck in samsara and
              a map to help us find freedom from it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>At the hub of the
              wheel of life there are three animals: a bird, a pig, and a snake. In English
              we refer to this bird as a rooster or cock, but Tibetan teacher Ringu Tulku
              says that it’s actually an Asian species, one that is obsessively attached to
              its mate. The bird, therefore, represents desire, clinging, or attachment,
              while the snake symbolizes aggression or aversion and the pig symbolizes
              ignorance or indifference. Together, these three animals represent the three
              poisons—passion, aggression, and ignorance—that drive the wheel of samsara.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #a0a0a0;'>The wheel of life is both a diagram to help us see why we’re
              stuck in samsara and a map to help us find freedom from it.</span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>If you look
              around, you may notice that the whole well of our world is poisoned. From the
              spider crawling on your shin to the climate crisis to a box of chocolates with
              creamy centers—everything in our unenlightened lives always comes down to “I
              want it,” “I don’t want it,” or “I don’t care about it.” It’s through this
              attachment, aversion, or indifference that karma or action arises, which in
              turn gives rise to suffering. In short, the three poisons are the venomous fuel
              that drives samsara.</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #222222;'></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>Look again at the
              animals in the center of the wheel. Frequently, the bird and snake are depicted
              coming out of the pig’s mouth, while at the same time they are clenching his
              tail. This hints at how the poisons bleed into each other: desire and aversion
              not only stem from ignorance, they also feed it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>As Roshi Bernie
              Glassman puts it, “The basic poison is ignorance, which means being totally in
              the dark, not seeing life as it is because of egocentric ideas.” But, he
              continues, “If we are rid of the self, the three poisons become transmuted into
              the three virtues of the bodhisattva. Ignorance becomes the state of total
              nondiscrimination, so we no longer discriminate between good and bad; instead
              we deal with what is in the appropriate way. Similarly, anger becomes
              determination and greed becomes the selfless, compassionate desire of the
              bodhisattva to help all beings realize the enlightened way.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #222222;'>Peacock in the Poison Grove</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>When the monsoon
              started and the Buddha and his community of monks and nuns gathered for the
              annual rainy season retreat, they would often hear the plaintive call of the
              peacock. Ever since then, this bird with its electric blue throat and tail
              strewn with eyes has captured the Buddhist imagination.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>Peacocks are
              credited with being able to eat poisonous plants, snakes, and insects, and not
              only survive but thrive. For this reason, these boldly beautiful birds
              represent a particular way that we can relate to our mental and spiritual
              poisons.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>In the Vajrayana
              tradition it’s said that there are three ways of dealing with proverbial
              poison. The first, which is arguably the least dangerous option, is to avoid
              it. If you have a poison tree in your yard, chop it down. If you feel rage
              welling up in you, refrain from venting it. And if everyone else is drinking
              scotch, order apple juice.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>But poison—if
              used correctly—can be a medicine, so maybe you’d like to put your axe down and
              let that tree in your yard live. It’s important to remember, though, that you
              must be skillful to employ this method or else you simply end up poisoned. If
              you want to use the leaves of the poison tree as medicine, you need to know the
              correct dosage to use and the right time to take it. And if you want to use
              your so-called vices and unwholesome mental states as the path to
              enlightenment, you really need to know how to transform them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #a0a0a0;'>To the peacock, poison is no other than nourishment.</span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>Finally, in the
              third way of dealing with poison, we take a page from the peacock’s playbook.
              The peacock struts over to that tree in your yard and just gobbles down a whole
              venomous branch because, to the peacock, poison is no other than nourishment.
              It’s what creates the brilliant plumage.</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #222222;'></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>Tenzin Wangyal, a
              lineage holder in the Bön Dzogchen tradition, puts the peacock’s method into
              spiritual terms: “Instead of avoiding or manipulating poison, you host the
              poison. You bring naked awareness directly to the pain or poison, and discover

              liberates by itself.”</span></p>

              fantastical, Garuda is the lord of birds in both Buddhist and Hindu traditions.
              According to legend, Garuda had a five-hundred-year incubation and then hatched
              fully formed. His golden body was so luminous that he was mistaken for the god
              of fire and his wings beat with such vigor that the earth shook.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>One day, Garuda’s
              mother Vinata and her sister had a disagreement about the color of a horse’s
              tail, and apparently this sister was quite testy, because to get revenge she
              kidnapped Vinata and held her ransom in a serpent-pit prison.<em>Amrita</em>, the nectar of immortality,
              was to serve as payment, and Garuda—desperate to free his mother—stormed heaven
              to steal it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #a0a0a0;'>Because Garuda hatches fully mature, he represents the Vajrayana
              view that enlightenment can happen fully on the spot.</span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>After that,
              however, things did not go quite as planned. Through subterfuge, Garuda
              completed his rescue mission, but the gods were hot on his heels and they
              eventually—with enormous effort—pried the amrita from his beak. In the fray, a
              few drops fell on some sharp blades of grass, and serpents licked these drops
              up, forever forking their tongues. Moreover, the god Vishnu managed to subdue
              Garuda and, taking him as his vehicle, granted him immortality.</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #222222;'></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>Originally,
              Garuda was always depicted straightforwardly as a large, powerful bird. Later
              images, however, show him as a “bird-man.” In Tibetan iconography, he has the
              torso and arms of a human, yet his thighs are feathered and culminate in talons
              and he has the fierce head of an eagle. It’s said that his two horns symbolize
              the two truths, relative and ultimate, while his two angelic wings symbolize
              the union of method and wisdom. Because Garuda hatches fully mature, he
              represents the Vajrayana view that enlightenment can happen fully on the spot,
              without a long gestation. Because he extends his wings without limits and soars
              fearlessly into space, he represents absolute confidence.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>As the lord of
              the skies, Garuda is traditionally seen as an enemy of the lion, the lord of
              the earth. But in the Tibetan imagination, the rivals mate and give birth to a
              beast that has the body of a lion and the wings and horns of Garuda. A symbol
              of the union of earth and sky, the Garuda-lion is one of what are called the
              three victorious creatures in the fight against disharmony. The other two are
              also born of animal enemies. The fish-otter’s body is covered in the sleek,
              dark fur of an otter, but at the neck this fur gives way to scales. The<span> </span><em>makara</em>-conch,
              on the other hand, is a dragonish water-monster, with its head and mane
              bursting from a spired shell.</span></p>

              thing more magical than wildly impossible avian-mammalian hybrids—an absolutely
              ordinary bird. In 1420, Ikkyu, the celebrated Zen master, poet, and
              troublemaker, was meditating in a boat on Lake Biwa when he heard a crow cawing
              and found himself rattled into<span> </span><em>satori</em>, an experience of
              enlightenment. “One pause between each crow’s/reckless shriek Ikkyu Ikkyu
              Ikkyu,” he wrote. “No nothing/only those wintery crows bright black in the
              sun.”</span></p>

              pretty symbol, beyond being a character in a morality tale, birds are just what
              they are and they can reveal to us what we are. “All I am is the birds singing
              and fluttering,” said the late meditation teacher Toni Packer. “Birdcalls and
              the songs of the breeze do not exist when the mind is full of itself.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>Do you remember
              that dark, glossy creature that, for me, made a nest in the four noble truths?
              Well, almost as soon as class let out I found a friend who could tell me about
              my mystery bird, and at first I was disappointed by what I learned.</span></p>

              course, a lovely name. It has all the ancient allure of the Old World,
              plus—with a star—it’s almost celestial. But European starlings are worse than
              ho-hum common birds; they’re an invasive species stealing the nest holes of
              purple martins and swallows and nuthatches. They were introduced in 1890 when
              some hair-brained humans decided to release sixty of them in Central Park
              because they wanted all the birds mentioned in Shakespeare’s collected works to
              fly free in North America. Now, from Alaska to Central America, European
              starlings are perched on garbage cans pecking at moldy sandwiches; they’re
              mobbing lawns; they’re shitting dirty white on shiny cars. But this, all the
              same, is the truth: Sometimes—even if it’s just for a moment—they still wake me
              up with their unmusical song.</span></p>
