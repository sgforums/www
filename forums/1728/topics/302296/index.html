            <div class='col-md body'>One thing that has to be clarified. Deeds of individual Buddhists needs to be distinguished from Buddhism. Buddhism as a body of teaching encompasses compassion and wisdom. Unlike most other religions, Buddhism does not portray itself as a persecuted underdog. There isn't anywhere in the sutras that exhort its believers to 'fight', 'struggle', 'kill' and wage war etc. etc. blah blah kebalah etc.<br><br>The persons who kill, fight and engage in violence etc do so out of their own accord, <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>against</strong></span> the teachings of Buddhism.<br><br>Michael Parenti has either inadvertantly (or intentionally) smeared the name of Buddhism based on the conduct of deviant "Buddhists" that has strayed from the core teachings of non-violence in Buddhism.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You have to see how the old Tibet social structure was like.<br><br>"I admit the posting is a little sensationalistic, but it's true that Tibet was a feudal society, with a status-quo of lamas that lived in luxury, often inheriting their position ala brahmins, captial punishment and torture were part of the penal system (people were still put in stocks in the middle of towns), etc.<br><br>exaggerating either way is just that ("Tibet was completely oppressive" or "Tibet was a heavenly utopia") but we can at least see a little of the truth that's being spoken here.<br><br>but anyway, Revolutionary, the number of Tibetans that welcome the current regime are the minority, and the ones against it are not just wealthy people, not by a long shot.<br><br>As far as the Dalai Lamas living in palaces while people live in squalor, i agree with you. but the thing is, once a status quo is so strongly established, it's difficult to change it, even if one wants to. there is a story about one of the earlier kings of Tibet, who tried to equalize the position of rich and poor. he was assasinated by his sister. traditions and political/social hierarchies tend to develop lives of their own after a while, and sometimes people can only work within the confines, even powerful, influential people, like Dalai Lamas.<br><br>His Holiness stated many times that he was poised to make major changes in Tibet despite these obstacles, and I fully believe him. He recognized that the state of Tibet was unacceptable and reforms had to be made, so I don't buy the whole "sitting on his throne while the people were enslaved" bit."</div>
