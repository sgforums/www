              the Buddha’s close friend, cousin, and attendant Ananda tells us that he has
              received 82,000 teachings from the Buddha and 2,000 more from his disciples for
              a total of 84,000. This great vastness of the Buddha’s body of teaching later
              became a metaphor for the many ways that Truth, Dharma, or simply ‘the
              teachings’ could come to a person.</span><span style="font-size: 13pt;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">In <em>The Complete Book of Buddha’s
              Lists — Explained </em>(available for <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=69dNpJa-VzkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"><span style="color: #509ac9;">free
              on google-books</span></a>) David Snyder notes that “The 84,000 Dhamma
              doors are a metaphor to basically state that there are innumerable paths to
              enlightenment. This is a representative teaching to the Buddha‘s tolerance for
              other religions.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">And in this 21st century, it has also come
              to represent teachings from <a href="http://amzn.to/1ELwejc"><span style="color: #509ac9;">friendly
              felines</span></a> and man’s best friend, as found here in an excerpt from
              Charles Prebish’s new book: <em>A Puppy’s Path to Nirvana. </em></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 22.45pt; background: whitesmoke;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">To understand the teachings of the
              historical Buddha for living beings, we first have to understand the way in
              which he saw and experienced the world. He called this view of the world the
              “Three Marks of Existence.” We prefer to call it the “World According to
              Puppies.” It argues for three basic principles. First, there is no permanent,
              abiding self. Second, the world is impermanent, changing all the time. And
              third, all life experiences what Buddha calls du</span><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Tahoma, sans-serif;">á¸¥</span><span style="font-size: 13pt;">kha, which his disciples translate as “suffering” (but as
              you’ll see later, we dogs describe quite differently).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 22.45pt; background: whitesmoke;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">To complicate matters, and unlike the
              beliefs of some other religions, Buddhism doesn’t believe in a permanent,
              abiding self or soul. To do so would contradict what we just learned above. So
              there is no self—what the Hindus call Ä�tman—in Buddhism. For Buddhists, each
              individual is simply a conglomerate of five “aggregates:” form, feeling,
              perception, mental formations, and consciousness. We’ll explain these in
              another lesson. But there’s no permanent “Bill” or “Sallie” or even “Buddha”
              (although my family’s previous dog was called “Buddha the Beagle”). By not
              presuming each individual has some permanent and even holy self, there’s
              nothing to grasp after, and this helps to remove the basis for what Buddha
              later identifies as the cause of all suffering. So if there’s no permanent
              self, all you need to do is <strong><span style='font-family: "Cambria","serif";    '>LET GO</span></strong>.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 22.45pt; background: whitesmoke;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Humans have a hard time understanding the
              notion of impermanence. They try hard to grasp after things and experiences
              which they think they can make permanent, lasting. OK, it’s pretty hard to
              understand complicated notions like “quantum mechanics,” so we puppies can make
              the notion of impermanence much easier to grasp. We call this second mark of
              existence “The Road Runner Theorem.” Everyone—dogs and people alike—grew up
              watching the old “Roadrunner” cartoons. Poor old Wiley Coyote seems never to be
              able to capture and kill Roadrunner because all of his schemes rely on one
              basic principle: that Roadrunner will actually stop . . . and stop long enough
              to be crushed by a falling boulder or smashed by an oncoming truck. It just
              never happens because Roadrunner never stops moving. Equally, everything in our
              world never stops changing in each second, in each moment. So nothing—and we
              mean absolutely nothing—stays the same. Everything is continually changing and
              evolving. By the time I finish writing this sentence, I won’t be quite the same
              “Dharma Dog” that started the sentence. That’s why every important conversation
              we plan in advance always changes just a bit when it’s finally time to engage
              in it. The two beings involved keep changing, and what made sense two hours
              before just isn’t quite the same later. Sure it would be great to be able to
              retain the actual experience of the game-winning home run you hit during your
              freshman year of high school, or a great sexual romp with some hot partner
              you met in college, but you can’t. So don’t be dumb. <strong><span style='font-family: "Cambria","serif";    '>DON’T TRY!</span></strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 22.45pt; background: whitesmoke;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Finally, Buddha’s third mark of existence
              is his notion, which we’ll also explain more fully later, that all life is
              suffering. We’ll see that he doesn’t mean that every single moment is filled
              with suffering, but rather, when we can’t find permanence and ongoing
              satisfaction in every moment, we become unhappy with our existence, and engage
              in ongoing craving and grasping, which binds us more tightly into the endless
              cycle of rebirth. Buddha’s teachings help us learn to not only bypass
              suffering, but to completely eliminate it. That’s pretty easy too: start by <strong><span style='font-family: "Cambria","serif";    '>GIVING UP CRAVING. </span></strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 22.45pt; background: whitesmoke;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Now all we need to do is see how to do all
              this stuff.</span></p>
